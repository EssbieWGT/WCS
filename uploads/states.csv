(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)Senior members of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration helped Republican state Sen. Richard Stuart clear a major regulatory hurdle for a planned solar farm on his King George County property last year. 
It’s unclear what role Youngkin administration officials played behind the scenes. But their actions produced a letter and revised easement that helped the stalled project to proceed, as similar projects proposed by citizens met challenges in other rural areas of the state.
Louisa County landowner caught up in solar farm regulation debate

In November, the solar farm was unanimously approved by the county’s board of supervisors. Stuart serves as the county attorney, but recused himself from being involved in the board’s debate of the issue.
Stuart, a close political ally of the GOP governor, said in an interview the long road to building the solar farm was frustrating because he shared the goals of conservationists who opposed the project. He said the solar farm involved a small sliver of his 1,431 acres, on land that he said his ancestors had once owned. 
“I’m protecting 1,430 acres — a thousand acres of timber, 300 and some acres of marsh,” Stuart said. “Yet they just beat you up if you try to do anything. And I don’t understand that.”
Stuart worked with the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation since at least 2022 over his plans to lease 122 acres of his land to TerraForm Power, which plans to build a 22 MW solar farm. Stuart’s land is governed by an easement — in this case, an agreement between a landowner and DCR designed to “encourage preservation of open space land.”
The 2001 easement, signed by a previous landowner, forbids most industrial or commercial activities. But Stuart pointed to a later, 2017 management agreement he signed with DCR that lays out how the easement should be implemented. 
The 2017 agreement explicitly allowed solar facilities “so long as any such project is in accordance with the Conservation Easement and/or Deed of Dedication.” Stuart maintained that because the project sat on an exclusion zone, outside of the heart of the easement, he should be allowed to lease the land to TerraForm.
The argument failed to persuade former DCR director Matthew Wells, who gently rejected Stuart’s plan in an August, 2023 letter. Wells said Stuart needed to work with DCR to amend the easement in order to proceed.
Wells also sought the opinion of the U.S. Department of the Interior, whose grant funded the easement. In a June 21, 2024 letter, an official at the department said they believed the solar farm was incompatible with the easement.
But Stuart was undeterred. In a July 8, 2024 letter to Wells, Stuart threatened to proceed with the solar facility and vowed “swift legal action” if the state tried to stop him. 
Stuart said he was “most distressed by your comments to me that you must treat me differently because of ‘who I am.’” In an interview, Stuart said Wells had told him he needed to hold Stuart to a higher level of scrutiny given his status as a public official (Wells, who left DCR in October, did not respond to a LinkedIn message seeking an interview).

Stuart cc’d Richard Cullen, Youngkin’s counsel, then-Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources Travis Voyles, and two men he described in an interview as attorneys who’ve represented him in legal matters: Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, and attorney Thomas Wood IV.
A little over two weeks later, on July 26, 2024, Voyles responded to Stuart with a letter that struck a different note: “Solar energy development is specifically permitted in certain areas of the property, where it is consistent with the easement.”
TerraForm representatives referenced Voyles’ letter in hearings in front of the county’s planning commission, which nonetheless recommended against approving the project in September. Two months later, the five-member BOS opted to approve the project anyway.
It’s not clear what changed with the state’s treatment of the solar facility.
Stuart said he can’t remember if he spoke directly with Cullen during that period, but said “it would certainly make sense if we talked,” pointing to his threat of legal action against the state. He said he’d known Cullen, an attorney and mainstay in Virginia and national Republican politics, for years, but would’ve alerted any governor’s counsel in the situation.
Cullen did not respond to an email and phone call seeking comment. 
When the Mercury filed a public records request about the matter, the governor’s office said it was withholding 24 pages of text messages, emails and call logs between Stuart and Cullen during the period between Stuart’s warning letter and Voyles’ response.
It also withheld “half of a manilla file” worth of emails and text messages between Cullen and Voyles containing the keywords “solar” or “Stuart.”
Last month, DCR and Stuart signed an amended easement that explicitly allows solar facilities and cites Voyles’ letter as rationale for the changes.
A coalition of conservation groups called the Land Trust Alliance signed a letter to Voyles’ successor, Stefanie Taillon, in May saying that allowing a solar farm on easement was likely unprecedented in Virginia, and warning that the action could have “local and national implications.”
Residents have shared mixed reviews for the project. Laurie Schlemm told the county’s planning commission in September that the easement clearly barred solar and said the previous landowner, James Nash, who’d initially set up the easement, would be “turning over in his grave” if he knew its fate. Others, like Rose Payne, said new subdivisions were a bigger threat than the solar farm. 
TerraForm representatives said the project would generate $11.3 million in economic benefits for the county over its 40-year lifespan, including $3 million in direct revenue.
Stuart said in an interview last week that the whole process had made him wary of easements. He noted the original easement allowed for the extraction of oil and gas and said he needed to bring in revenue to help pay property taxes. 
“Some folks in these fields believe that you should not be able to do anything but
look at the land and pay taxes,” he said. “And unfortunately that probably will be the downfall of this program when they’re just too rigid with people.”
The solar farm proposal isn’t the first issue that has prompted headlines about Stuart’s property. 
In 2020, the Washington Post reported he and his wife discovered headstones on the riverbanks of the property that originated from a historic African American burial ground in Washington D.C. In 2021, 55 headstones were moved to National Harmony Memorial Park in Prince George’s County, Maryland.

(Photo by RKO)Conservation group Center for Biological Diversity has filed suit against the Trump administration for failing to provide endangered species protection to the Rio Grande cooter, a freshwater turtle that lives in the Pecos and Rio Grande watersheds in New Mexico, Texas and Mexico. 
The Jan. 8 lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, argues that federal wildlife officials’ 2022 decision to not list the turtles puts them at risk of extinction, and contends the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ignored “mounting evidence” in order to conclude the species didn’t require protection.
“The extinction of these irreplaceable turtles would cost the Southwest a vital piece of natural heritage, so it’s shocking that federal officials failed to protect them,” said Camila Cossío, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement. “Rio Grande cooters are threatened by climate change, unsustainable water usage and the oil industry’s influence, but we can save them with Endangered Species Act protections.”
The turtles, which have distinctive marbled yellow striping on their shells, are vulnerable both to habitat loss from climate change but also potentially pollution from oil and gas extraction, Cossío told Source NM in a phone call. 
“They’re really slow to mature so sometimes it’s hard to see the effects, the negative effects that’s happening, until it’s too late,” she said. 
Federal protections under the Endangered Species Act would provide states funding for turtle conservation and breeding programs, she said.
There’s also been documentation of a tenfold increase in international sales of the turtles — often taken from the wild — for the international pet and food trades, with the federal government data showing an increase of 20 turtles were exported in 2016 to more than 350 in 2020.
“Just taking one turtle out of the wild for trade is a ripple effect on multiple generations of turtles,” she said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/rio-grandecooter-1024x723.jpg,,,2026-01-13 14:12:13.918866

A ticket described the misdemeanor as driving a motor vehicle “while failing to slow down when approaching a stationary emergency vehicle with emergency lights active.”
The case is pending. A Broadwater County officer issued the citation at 6:17 p.m. on Nov. 27, and McKinnon pleaded not guilty on Dec. 8, according to court records.
The citation does not state an alleged speed McKinnon was traveling on U.S. Highway 287. County Sheriff Nick Rauser said Tuesday the limit is 70 by day and 65 by night where she was stopped.
Sunset that day in the county was 4:44 p.m. according to Fish, Wildlife and Parks. (The agency sets sunrise and sunset times in the state for game bird hunting.)
When passing an emergency vehicle with lights flashing on a state highway, statute requires drivers to reduce their speed by 30 miles per hour if they can move lanes and by half of the posted speed limit if they can’t move lanes.
County Attorney Kevin Bratcher provided the court records to the Daily Montanan but said the county could not release additional details about the case, such as alleged speed, until it concludes.
“I can’t comment on the specific facts in more depth than what is printed on the citation since the case is still pending,” Bratcher said in an email, citing professional conduct rules for lawyers.
An omnibus hearing, to address procedural matters, is scheduled for Jan. 20.
The maximum penalty for a first offense is 90 days in jail, a fine of up to $500, or both. The citation lists a fine of $285.
McKinnon could not be reached for comment by email sent late Monday afternoon. She was elected to the Montana Supreme Court in 2012, and re-elected in 2020.
Sheriff Rauser said he also could not provide additional details about the specific situation that led to the citation.
However, Rauser said the law is in place to protect workers, such as law enforcement, fire personnel and tow truck drivers.
Emergency responders may walk into the lane of traffic to investigate a crime, help victims or clean up debris on the road, he said.
“It’s just important to slow down so everyone on the scene is safe and nobody is getting injured or killed,” Rauser said.
In 2021 with House Bill 264, the Montana Legislature stiffened requirements for safely passing emergency vehicles, included tow trucks as vehicles for which slowing is required, and increased penalties.

(Courtesy photo)Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger’s administration is promoting Jenna Conway, a state education leader, to become the next state superintendent of public instruction. The administration has also named Connor Andrews as deputy secretary of education.
The announcement on Tuesday is the latest move by the incoming administration to shape the state’s education leadership. Spanberger, who last week announced longtime educator Jeffery Smith as Virginia’s next secretary of education, reiterated her goal to strengthen all levels of education in the state, including early childhood, K-12, and colleges and universities.
Spanberger nominates Jeffery Smith as Virginia’s next secretary of education

“Ms. Conway and Mr. Andrews share my deep commitment to putting Virginia’s students first, attracting and retaining world-class educators, and making strong investments at every level of our education system,” Spanberger said in a statement. “I’m proud to have them join my administration as we work to strengthen Virginia’s public schools across our commonwealth.”
Conway has served in the Virginia Department of Education for the past seven years, most recently as chief of early learning and specialized populations. She led improvements to Virginia’s birth-to-five early childhood system and oversaw special education, behavioral health, student safety and adult education, demonstrating a commitment to supporting all learners.
Her education experience also includes building a nationally recognized early childhood model. Over eight years, Conway helped double the number of birth-to-five children served with public funds. In addition, she helped shape other significant legislation, including the implementation of the Virginia Literacy Act. 
In a statement, Conway said she joins Spanberger in a commitment to strengthening the state’s public schools and early childhood programs to prepare Virginia’s future workforce and empower students, families and educators. 
“Throughout my tenure at the Virginia Department of Education, I have been inspired by the dedication of educators, stakeholders, and parents across the commonwealth. While each voice is unique, a shared purpose unites us: we believe in our children and are determined to ensure every child has every opportunity to reach their fullest potential,” Conway said.
Spanberger’s administration also announced that Andrews, who co-chairs the governor-elect’s education policy committee, will transition to the Office of the Secretary of Education as deputy secretary.
Andrews, the director of state government relations at the University of Virginia, previously served in the office of former Gov. Ralph Northam, first as a policy analyst and later as deputy policy director, where he focused on education, workforce development and labor policy. He also staffed Northam’s Children’s Cabinet, which worked to improve outcomes for children and families.
“The governor-elect’s education plan recognizes the critical role that our education system and institutions of higher education play in expanding opportunity and preparing students for success,” Andrews said in a statement. “I look forward to collaborating with partners across the commonwealth to ensure all Virginians have access to a world-class education.”

[…],"Photo illustration by Natalie Behring/Getty ImagesAttorney General Liz Murrill has obtained an indictment for a California doctor who she alleges sent abortion pills to Louisiana in violation of state law.
Murrill said in a news release Tuesday that Dr. Rémy Coeytaux has been charged in St. Tammany Parish with criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs. She has asked Gov. Jeff Landry to approve an extradition warrant to bring Coeytaux to Louisiana to face the charge, though California authorities are unlikely to cooperate.
In 2024, Louisiana classified the reproductive health drugs mifepristone and misoprostol as Schedule IV controlled dangerous substances, the same designation given to drugs with the potential for addiction and abuse such as Valium and Xanax. The medications are the most commonly prescribed for abortion, but they also have other life-saving medical uses.
Louisiana became the first state to set criminal penalties for anyone who handles mifepristone and misoprostol without proper clearance. Offenses can be punished by one to 50 years in prison, depending on the circumstances.
The indictment, handed down Jan. 8 in St. Tammany Parish, follows an arrest warrant for Coeytaux issued in May 2024 for allegedly mailing abortion pills to a patient in Louisiana.
“This is not healthcare; it’s drug dealing,” Murrill said in a news release. “Individuals who flagrantly and intentionally violate our laws by sending illegal abortion pills into our state placing women in danger. We’ve seen the proof of that, with women showing up in emergency rooms after taking these pills and being coerced into abortions.”
Coeytaux did not immediately respond to a message left at his office phone number. A representative with the Center for Reproductive Rights responded to an email sent to Coeytaux’s office and said they would have comment shortly.
Murrill is a co-plaintiff in a federal lawsuit against the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that ultimately seeks to require in-person doctor’s visits to obtain mifepristone and misoprostol. Rosalie Markezich is the lead plaintiff in the case. According to the lawsuit, Markezich said her boyfriend at the time ordered abortion drugs from an out-of-state doctor in October 2023 using her email address. Markezich said her boyfriend pressured her to take the pills, and she was unable to regurgitate them.
Louisiana issued an arrest warrant for “a California-based doctor” in 2024 after learning about what happened to Markezich, according to the lawsuit. A copy of Coeytaux’s arrest warrant that Murrill’s office provided Tuesday does not name Markezich, but it details a “complainant” who purchased abortion medication online in October 2023. The warrant links Coeytaux to AidAccess, an Austria-based business that ships medication to the United States.
This is the second instance of Murrill bringing charges against an out-of-state physician for prescribing abortion medication to a Louisiana. A year ago, a West Baton Rouge Parish grand jury indicted Dr. Margaret Carpenter of New York for providing pills to a Port Allen woman for her pregnant daughter, who was a minor at the time.
Attempts to extradite Carpenter to face prosecution in Louisiana have run into a New York “shield law” that protects telehealth providers from criminal consequences in states that have outlawed abortion. California has similar protections for its health care provides against investigations and prosecutions from other states.

Robby Mills, R-Henderson, says bills to tackle the housing shortage should be moving soon in the Kentucky legislature. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)FRANKFORT — Republican lawmakers joined housing advocates from across Kentucky to tout legislation addressing the state’s significant housing shortage, though lawmakers offered few specifics on what they will propose. 
Kentucky Senate Majority Caucus Chair Robby Mills, R-Henderson, told advocates and reporters Tuesday morning that two “very good” reports from the legislature’s housing task force validated “the facts that we need more housing in the state of Kentucky.” 
The task force, which met a number of times last year, issued recommendations in November, including easing  regulations on housing developers and strongly considering providing funding to incentivize housing and infrastructure construction.
“There are several bills, there are several budget requests that have already been made,” said Mills, co-chair of the task force. “I’m really excited. Hopefully you’ll see some of these bills start rolling out here in the next week or so.”
Kentucky needs more than 200,000 housing units, including rentals and homes for sale, according to a national research firm hired by the Kentucky Housing Corp. The firm found that the gap could grow to more than 287,000 units by 2029 without efforts to build or repair housing; low-income renters could be particularly impacted by the growing shortage. 
Much of the calls for action from housing advocates centered around providing more funding to build housing. 
Housing advocates in previous years have come before the GOP-controlled legislature, in the wake of past catastrophic flooding and tornado outbreaks, asking for hundreds of millions of dollars to provide the resources for nonprofit housing builders to build homes in disaster-impacted communities.

Republican lawmakers have turned down those requests for large infusions of funding, citing concerns about whether local housing developers have the capacity to adequately use allocated funds. 
Lawmakers have created the Rural Housing Trust Fund — another vehicle to support housing construction alongside the state’s longstanding Affordable Housing Trust Fund — in addition to allocating smaller infusions of funding to the trust funds. The legislature also passed a bill last year to prevent local governments from implementing certain restrictions on manufactured housing.
Scott McReynolds, the executive director of the Perry County-based Housing Development Alliance, said “the housing supply gap is not a capacity issue — it is a resource issue.” 
His nonprofit is one the Eastern Kentucky housing developers that have been rebuilding homes on higher ground after past catastrophic floods.
“Can you spend that money? It’s a legitimate question,” McReynolds said. “But what’s been proven in Eastern Kentucky in the flood recovery, and what has been proven in Western Kentucky and the tornado recovery is when resources are available, communities find the capacity to build the housing.” 
Gov. Andy Beshear in his budget proposal called for a one-time $150 million allocation to go into the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, a pool of monies the Kentucky Housing Corp. manages to help subsidize housing projects. The allocation would come from the Budget Reserve Trust Fund, also known as the state’s “rainy day” fund, which has billions of dollars available. 
Asked about conversations around a potential one-time allocation for housing, George Eklund, director of education and advocacy at the Coalition for the Homeless in Louisville, said his organization is focused on increasing fees that provide sustainable funds to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund. 
The trust fund receives regular funds through fees on real estate transactions, though advocates say funding from those fees has waned. 
“We know that we need housing, and it is a point of crisis. So I would welcome any kind of one-time infusions to the trust fund,” Eklund said. “We personally are focusing on the fee increase, just so that we have a sustainable, modernized funding structure.” 
Eklund said increasing fees would increase available funds to the trust fund annually by $10 million and develop 6,000 units over the next 10 years. 
Lawmakers also touted legislation that didn’t see passage in last year’s session, such as a bill allowing religious organizations more flexibility to build housing on land they own. It’s a concept known as “God’s Backyard.” 
“It’s about empowering faith-based institutions and churches to use their land to serve these means. Houses of worship and religious organizations want to help,” said Rep. Sarge Pollock, R-Campbellsville.

Rep. Susan Witten, R-Louisville, the co-chair of the legislature’s housing task force, told the gathered audience she also planned to file a bill that would automatically seal evictions from someone’s record if they’ve been dismissed. 
“Even when a case is dismissed, it can follow individuals for years, showing up on their background checks and limiting their housing options,” Witten said. “Housing stability strengthens families and it supports our workforce.” 
Among the advocates gathered by the state capitol building included those who lost homes in natural disasters Kentuckians have grappled with. 
Missy Sexton, who lives in a rebuilt home out of the floodplain in Perry County supported by funding from the Rural Housing Trust Fund, told reporters she supports more funding because of the sheer need for stable housing she sees from her neighbors. 
“When you do something good for one of us, it’s a ripple effect because we take care of each other,” Sexton said. “Every person in southeast Kentucky, they deserve safe housing.”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Crews began cleaning up the walls of the Oklahoma State Capitol on Tuesday after someone wrote derogatory comments about the governor and Immigration and Customs Enforcement on the building and the surrounding area.
Officials Tuesday morning quickly used brown paper to cover what authorities called “violent and vulgar rhetoric.” They said the vandalism occurred overnight, but was discovered Tuesday morning.
While Oklahoma Highway Patrol Lt. Mark Southall would not disclose the content of the messages graffitied on the south side of the Capitol building, he said they included “anti-ICE propaganda and threats against politicians.” He would not say if any politicians were named specifically. 
Graffiti was also inked along a nearby underpass on 23rd Street, which cuts underneath the Capitol Complex. One of the most prominent messages named Gov. Kevin Stitt while another encouraged violence against ICE, which has been actively arresting immigrants in the country without proper authorization.

Another message said, “We are the Sons of Liberty,” an apparent reference to a secret colonial-era group that is best known for mastermining the Boston Tea Party and that focused on undermining British rule ahead of the American Revolution.
The underpass messages had yet to be covered up or cleaned Tuesday morning.
Southall said there is video of the act and the agency’s Criminal Investigations Division is “processing evidence.” 
“It’s really disheartending because the Capitol is the people’s house where conversations happen,” Southall said. “Desecrating the Capitol is an affront on all of Oklahoma.” 
He said the cleanup efforts are expected to take multiple days and cost “several thousand dollars.” The Office of Management and Enterprise Services is responsible for the cleanup, Southall said.
A spokesperson for Stitt referred comment to the Oklahoma Highway Patrol. 
Southall said the underpass is city property so it is the responsibility of the Oklahoma City Police Department. 
A spokesperson for the Oklahoma City Police Department said they are not the investigating agency for these incidents. 
The vandalism will be federally investigated, the department said.

Founders say federal land takeover legislation spurred formation of political action committee on behalf of hunters, anglers and other outdoor recreationists.
The post New Wyoming PAC forms to oust ‘anti-public lands’ lawmakers appeared first on WyoFile .","Legislation demanding Congress turn over 30 million acres of federal public land to Wyoming was a bridge too far for Zach Lentsch.
Although the land takeover push by state senators last legislative session was considered symbolic, legally questionable and ultimately unsuccessful, it got the Park County climbing guide fired up. 
“That was an ‘absolutely not’ moment for us,” said Lentsch, who owns Wyoming Mountain Guides. “My livelihood depends on access to public lands, and I’m a permittee on several national forests and BLM field offices across the state.”

In the months that followed, he perceived an “acceleration” of efforts in Wyoming to transfer or sell public lands. The Cody resident grouped the ongoing push to sell landowner hunting licenses — which critics say is a step toward privatizing wildlife — into the same bucket. After talking with a group of like-minded friends and receiving “great guidance and great mentorship,” Lentsch set off on his first foray into politics. 
Last week, he launched and started promoting the “Protect Wyoming PAC.” Lentsch chairs the political action committee, and a friend, Chris Allen, is the treasurer. The committee’s chief purpose is to back Wyoming state lawmakers in the 2026 election who will protect public lands, and oppose those who favor divestiture. 
“If folks are wanting to protect public lands, we’ll support them,” Lentsch said. “And if they want to sell off our public lands, we’re not going to stand by them.” 
Allen, a Johnson County resident who pays his bills selling dental equipment, emphasized the grassroots nature of their organizing effort. There aren’t big donors pulling the PAC’s strings, he said.
“It’s organic,” Allen said. “It’s a group of people who hunt and fish and climb.”

Where the Protect Wyoming PAC will direct its money remains to be seen. Candidates have until late May to file to run for office. The committee will be nonpartisan, Lentsch said.
“We don’t have to be aligned by party,” he said. “We can support whoever is going to defend our public lands.” 
By law, Lentsch and Allen will be able to direct up to $5,000 per non-statewide office candidate and make unlimited contributions to statewide candidates. The Protect Wyoming PAC is not planning to engage in congressional races, and intends, instead, to focus on lambasting state lawmakers deemed anti-public lands. 
“The sky’s the limit, at this point,” Allen said. “Mailers, we’ve got a good website, social media, events locally and across the state, fliers, billboards, all that stuff.” 
Election spending by PACs and super PACs, including from out of state, has been on the upswing in Wyoming. The latter can’t work directly with campaigns, but aren’t bound by spending limits. 
Time will tell how Lentsch and Allen’s new political action committee will fit into the broader spectrum of campaign spending.

“We launched yesterday,” Lentsch said in a Wednesday interview. “We do have fundraising goals, and we have a couple donations so far, so we’re excited about that. But we’ve got a long way to go.” 
Notably, the candidates that the Protect Wyoming PAC will likely target also figure to be assembling warchests to defend themselves and go on the offensive. 
Sen. Bob Ide, a Casper Republican, was the lead sponsor of the unsuccessful federal land takeover resolution that provoked Lentsch to mobilize. When Ide beat incumbent Sen. Drew Perkins and was elected into office in 2022, his campaign spent $58,000, the most of any state senate candidate that election cycle. 
Ide did not respond to WyoFile’s request for an interview.

The Capitol Arts and Grounds Commission voted with no dissent to allow Secretary of State Cole Jester to accept new submissions for the monument after the artist it selected in late 2023 applied for a federal copyright for her design. Jester said that move would interfere with the state’s efforts to market the anti-abortion monument.
“We couldn’t sell a Christmas tree ornament with it,” Jester said. “We couldn’t do so many things, and it would be very problematic.”
Arkansas was the first state to enact a law requiring such a monument and fundraising for it has struggled. The 2023 law called for a monument to mark the abortions that were performed in the state between the Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized the procedure nationwide and the 2022 ruling overturning Roe.
The law states that Arkansans had at least 236,243 abortions between 1973 and 2022. An Arkansas law banning nearly all abortions took effect immediately with the court’s 2022 decision.

The commission had previously selected artist Lakey Goff’s idea of a “living wall” of flora and fauna for the monument and accepted her suggestion to place it in the grassy space behind the Capitol and to the north of the Supreme Court building.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas called the proposed monument “an offensive and inappropriate use of public space.”
“The decision whether to continue a pregnancy is deeply personal, and politicians should not use Capitol grounds to shame or stigmatize people for their private medical decisions,” ACLU spokesperson Megan Bailey said in a statement.
Jester told the Arts and Grounds Commission that moving forward with building the monument based on a private citizen’s copyrighted work would be “poor stewardship.”
Arkansas Right to Life, the state’s leading anti-abortion group, said in a statement that Goff is “a talented artist and a strong supporter of life” whose design was “regrettably” disqualified from public use.
Republican state Rep. Mary Bentley of Perryville and Sen. Kim Hammer of Benton, the sponsors of the law to create the monument, both supported the commission’s decision, Jester said. He also noted that Goff could resubmit a version of the Living Wall idea and the commission could select it again.
Goff told the Arkansas Advocate she has not yet decided whether to submit a new design. She said she was not aware until Tuesday’s meeting that the commission was considering moving on from her design.

She wanted to copyright her proposal so it would remain “true to my original inspiration and design, which came from the Lord, the Holy Spirit,” she said.
The proposal had an estimated $900,000 price tag, and Goff said in August 2025 that she expected to have raised a total of $100,000 for the project by the end of October. Act 310 established a trust fund to raise money through private gifts, grants and donations, and fundraising for the project began in May 2024.
The effort had raised $25,110 by August. That total is now about $28,000, Jester said Tuesday.
Commissioner Stephen Bright, a former state representative and the Secretary of State’s Chief Taxpayer Services Officer, told the New York Times last year that he hoped to change the design to reduce its cost to about $700,000. The design would be unchangeable once copyrighted.
Jester’s office will accept new submissions until March 14.
Earlier this year, the Texas Legislature passed its own law to install an abortion-related monument on Capitol grounds, also with private funds. The bronze sculpture would replicate the National Life Monument originally installed in Rome. A copy of the sculpture is on display in Washington, D.C.

(Getty Images)Efforts to criminalize doxing in Indiana moved forward Tuesday after a Senate committee approved legislation targeting the malicious and “intentional” online disclosure of personal information.
The proposal was filed amid ongoing concerns about threats and harassment tied to recent redistricting fights and now heads to the full chamber for further consideration.
Senate Bill 140, authored by Sen. Vaneta Becker, R-Evansville, cleared the Senate Corrections and Criminal Law Committee on a 6–1 vote after lawmakers adopted a narrowing amendment. Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, cast the sole no vote, citing lingering concerns about the bill’s “broad” scope.
The underlying bill would create a new criminal offense for doxing — defined as the intentional sharing of personal information about a “targeted person” — or someone closely connected to them — when done with the intent to threaten or place them in fear of bodily harm.
Lawmakers have said the proposal was prompted by a string of bomb threats and swatting incidents targeting legislators and others during the December redistricting debate.
Indiana lawmakers consider anti-doxing bill following redistricting bomb, swatting threats

Before advancing, the committee adopted an amendment to narrow the bill’s reach by removing “coworkers” from the definition of a person closely connected to the targeted individual and explicitly stating that “personal information” could include only an individual’s name.
Committee chair Sen. Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis, said the amendment addressed concerns Brown had raised previously about the bill’s breadth.
“I heard Sen. Brown and I agreed with her,” Freeman said. “I thought (the language) was a little broad. I agreed — took it out.”
Still, Brown said she remained uneasy even after the change, particularly with language that could sweep in private communications.
“I am a little bit concerned, too, about the broadness of the section with respect to any email, post, text,” Brown said. “You could even be texting … or emailing someone privately … and they would be included in this.”
Freeman said further changes could come later in the legislative process.
“Not disagreeing with you,” Freeman said. “My suggestion would be, let’s move it. Let’s get it out of here, and I’m happy to continue to work on it.”
Targeted lawmakers included those for and against President Donald Trump’s failed push to eliminate Indiana’s two Democratic congressional seats in favor of a 9-0 Republican delegation, ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
The Indiana Senate voted the maps down mid-December, after months of intense pressure and weeks of threats.
Those included swatting attempts at lawmakers’ homes — hoax reports to emergency services intended to trigger armed responses — plus bomb threats and more. No arrests have been made.

(Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)The owner and operator of a landfill in Bethlehem will pay $1.9 million in penalties to the state for multiple alleged violations.
The fine is the largest civil penalty ever assessed for a violation of the state’s Solid Waste Management Act, said Attorney General John Formella in a press release Monday. The release announced the settlement between the state and North Country Environmental Services, Inc., a subsidiary of Vermont-based Casella Waste Systems, Inc., which operates a landfill in Bethlehem.
“I think it’s good that they’re held accountable for the issues,” said Nancy Strand, Bethlehem Select Board chair, in a phone call Tuesday. However, she said, given the size of the companies involved, the penalty amounted to “a slap on the wrist.” In 2025, Casella Waste Systems estimated total revenue at about $1.84 billion, according to a financial report released in October. 
Alleged violations at the landfill include placement of waste outside the permitted limits of the landfill; failure to prevent leaks of leachate, or toxic trash effluent; storage of more leachate than allowed within the landfill; failure to investigate and report certain violations; a hole in the primary landfill liner, which is intended to help keep trash and leachate contained; drilling through another overlay liner; and failing to adequately cover the landfill at the end of a working day. 
The consent decree settlement agreement does not contain a judgment on the facts around, or liability for, the alleged violations. But payment of the $1.9 million penalty, according to the terms of the agreement, will conclude the case around those alleged violations.
The fine is for past violations, and is issued “on top of” costs Casella has incurred to address those on site in Bethlehem, said Christopher G. Aslin, senior assistant attorney general, in an email Tuesday.

“Over the last two years we have invested significantly in improving the operations of the North Country Environmental Services landfill,” said Jeff Weld, a spokesperson for Casella Waste Systems, in an email. “We have worked to address compliance matters at the site by improving our control and monitoring systems, and replacing our management team.”
Wayne Morrison, of North Country Alliance for Balanced Change, wrote in a press release Tuesday that the violations were the result of “a pattern of chronic noncompliance.” The alliance has advocated against a proposed Casella landfill in Dalton and proposed expansions in Bethlehem.
The terms of the settlement may call for North Country Environmental Services, Inc., to expend a portion of the penalty funds on a separate project involving remediating the erosion of landfill debris into the Saco River in Bartlett, at the site of a former municipal landfill. The state is awaiting the results of a study on possible routes for remediation and cost estimates, Aslin said. 
Based on the outcome of that study, the state will decide whether to move ahead with the remediation project, he said. The remainder of the $1.9 million will be paid to the state, according to the terms of the settlement.
The Bethlehem landfill at the heart of the settlement has been the focus of many conversations around waste management in New Hampshire in recent years and the current legislative session. Strand said she hoped the settlement would bring attention to the status of the landfill and the town’s concerns.
“I think it’s a positive step because it recognizes the problems, at least some of the problems, that our landfill in particular has had,” she said. “It may help explain to outsiders why we’re kind of wary of the business relationship with (Casella).”

Jim Murphy, R-St. Louis County, presents his bill Tuesday, to ban automatic, recurring political donations in Missouri (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).Missouri politicians wouldn’t be able to lure donors into recurring contributions with emotional appeals that don’t disclose who would benefit from the money under a bill heard Tuesday.
State Rep. Jim Murphy, a Republican from St. Louis County, said the scheme leaves contributors, who are often elderly people, confused when thousands of dollars are drawn from their accounts months, or years, after they respond to a fundraising email or text.
“If it’s not fraud, then it’s certainly something that hurts every one of us,” Murphy said as he presented his bill to the House Elections Committee.
The committee also heard a bill that would restore the presidential primary, which was eliminated in 2022, as well as double the time allowed for early voting from two weeks to four weeks. A vote on both bills is expected next week.
Murphy’s bill is a response to fundraising tactics used by former state Sen. Bill Eigel, a Republican from St. Charles, who used it to finance his unsuccessful bid for governor in 2024 and is pulling money from donors to that campaign to fund his bid this year for St. Charles County executive.
Murphy said he filed the bill after The Independent reported in November that a 92-year-old Nebraska veteran who thought he had given once to Eigel’s campaign in 2023 was tapped 35 times, for $1,050 total, from December 2024 through Sept. 30 because of an automatic recurring donation.
Russell Wood is one of 141 people nationally — including six from Missouri — who made multiple donations to Eigel’s 2024 campaign for governor who are also contributors to his St. Charles County executive race. 
How a Nebraska veteran unwittingly became a repeat donor to a Missouri county campaign

One retired woman in Texas, who made 143 donations to Eigel’s campaign for governor, contributed $1,205 in 74 separate donations since December 2024.
BILL PAC, a separate committee that promotes Eigel’s campaigns, also uses the tactic.
The latest campaign donation reports are due Thursday and will show whether those donations continued during the final quarter of the year.
Eigel’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment on the bill.
Murphy’s bill would ban any political committee from accepting automatically recurring donations although, under questioning, he said he would be willing to change it to allow people to set up recurring donations if they wish.
The bill would also require solicitations to “state clearly, in a clear and conspicuous manner” which candidate or committee would benefit from a donation.
Murphy did not name Eigel during Tuesday’s hearing but said his campaign was soliciting contributions without giving his name but with an appeal that brought an emotional response.
“As it turned out, there were elderly people that said, ‘oh, yeah, I’m against this particular issue, so therefore I’m going to give $20 to fight this issue’,” Murphy said. “They had no idea where the money was really going to and then years later, they’re still trying to get off the automatic contribution rolls, and it’s turned into thousands of dollars.”
If the bill passed, it would not stop candidates for federal office from using solicitations that create automatic, recurring donations, Murphy said in response to questions. 
The problem, he said, isn’t limited to federal candidates and needs a state response.
“Politicians don’t have the best reputation in the world,” he said. “Some of it is deserved and some of it is certainly not. But when campaigns do things like this, they certainly do not do any of us a service and they don’t do the country any service.”
 Presidential primary

Missouri conducted its first presidential primary in 1988 but did not have a regular primary until 2000. The law authorizing the primary was repealed in 2022, but confusion in 2024 over how national convention delegates are selected shows it should be restored, state Rep. Peggy McGaugh, a Republican from Carrollton, told the elections committee.
“We found it was even worse, and it was hard to manage for the parties,” McGaugh said of using a caucus system instead of a primary.
A similar bill passed the House last year but did not come up for a vote in the state Senate.
Boone County residents line up in October 2024 for no-excuse absentee voting at the Boone County Government Center in Columbia (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
The primary would be held on the first Tuesday in March of each presidential election year. The bill does not require political parties to allocate delegates based on the primary results and actual delegates would continue to be chosen in party caucuses and conventions.
The bill including a presidential primary is a wide-ranging elections bill backed by county clerks and election authorities statewide. It would extend the early voting period, increase the area around a polling place where political solicitations are banned from 25 to 50 feet and allow more time for candidates seeking local offices to file their candidacies.
McGaugh said she attached the extension of early voting — called no-excuse absentee voting and currently only allowed for the final two weeks before an election — because it has proven to be wildly popular.
The bill would double that period to four weeks.
Long lines formed in both urban and rural counties as people took advantage of the law, she said. Election authorities like it because it gives them time to solve individual voter problems, McGaugh added.
“It was exciting,” she said. “It brought excitement back to voting.”
Missourians can vote absentee as early as six weeks before the election but must be able to show a reason, such as having a disability or being away from home, to vote that early. 
Kurt Bahr, director of elections for St. Charles County, said he saw about 300 voters per day using the traditional reasons for voting absentee but the number jumped to 4,000 to 5,000 per day once the early voting period began.
“We’d love to see all six weeks but I don’t think there is enough agreement in this building,” Bahr said.
The early voting period was included in the 2022 bill that ended the presidential primary. That law also required voters to show a government-issued ID card, with photo, date of birth and an expiration date, prior to voting. 
Republicans opposed early voting and wrote the bill to end it if a court struck down the identification requirement. It was upheld by a Cole County judge in November 2024 but the decision was appealed and a ruling is pending from the Missouri Supreme Court.
McGaugh’s bill would not remove the link between the provisions of law.
Voters like early voting and a longer period would make the process go smoother, Bahr said.
“It was insanity,” he said, “not just in St Charles County, but every county, even rural counties, because of how many people were trying to come in and vote.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Murphy-Eigel-bill-20260113-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-13 12:59:46.357794

During his remarks, Perez briefly touched on an array of topics ranging from taxes to the economy to affordability and insurance to the costs of  “public benefits.”
“We have been summoned here to the Capitol by the Constitution of the State of Florida. We have been called to spend the next nine weeks conducting the business of the people. And that is what we will do — with all the energy, determination, and creativity we can muster. We will approach this task with an open hand, an open mind, and an open heart. The Florida House stands ready to work with anyone who is willing to put the needs of our state first,” Perez said.
“We must ensure Florida stays at the center of our planet’s race for the stars, and that our infrastructure keeps pace with our growth. Every child in Florida, from the unborn to our college graduates, deserves a fair shot at finding their own American Dream.”

Perez delivered his second and final opening day speech of his two-year term as House speaker — a stint marked by quarrels with Gov. Ron DeSantis over state spending levels, homeowners insurance, the elimination of homestead property taxes, and immigration. 
DeSantis vetoed Perez’s a priority bill from the 2025 session, which would have revamped a long-standing law that bans parents of single childless adult children and adult children of single parents from suing physicians and hospitals for wrongful death stemming from medical malpractice.
Perez did not, however, mention those skirmishes with the governor and instead focused his speech on the chamber’s ability, he said, to celebrate triumphs and in the face of adversity to  “come together” and “find our way through.”
“We stand here today ready to write together the second half of our story. And I can’t tell you how many reporters and lobbyists and others in the process have asked me, ‘What is going to happen this session?’ It’s like they want me to give away the ending. 
“Honestly, I don’t know what is going to happen. That’s okay, because the journey is the best part.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-13 17:12:35+00:00,CT Mirror,Report: Medical errors led to deaths of 2 incarcerated men prescribed methadone,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/13/report-medical-errors-led-to-deaths-of-2-incarcerated-men-prescribed-methadone/,CT Inspector General found that “significant medical errors” were made when prescribing methadone to Ronald Johnson and Tyler Cole.,"An investigation by the Connecticut Office of the Inspector General released Monday found that “significant medical errors” were made when prescribing methadone to Ronald Johnson and Tyler Cole, two young men who died from the combined effects of methadone and other prescribed medications while incarcerated at Garner Correctional Institution. 
“The investigation suggests that both Johnson and Cole received initial doses of methadone that were too high for them, and their doses were increased too rapidly,” the report read. “The investigation further suggests that insufficient attention was given to the fact that Johnson and Cole were receiving medications that enhanced the respiratory suppression effects of methadone.”  
The state Department of Correction has administered a program known as medication assisted treatment, or MAT, since 2013, for patients addicted to opioids or heroin. As of last year some type of MAT existed in 10 of Connecticut’s 13 correctional facilities. The department contracts with Recovery Network of Programs Inc. in Shelton, which is responsible for distributing methadone at Garner. 
Johnson had been transferred from Rikers Island to Garner in July 2024. When he was first admitted to Garner, he was found to have “moderate to severe” opioid use as well as a history of other drug use, according to the inspector’s report. On July 10, 2024 he tested negative for opioids and was prescribed 30 mg of methadone, which was increased to 40 mg after two days. 
According to the report, Johnson was found with an inmate request form in his pocket. On the form, he had written, “I think I could be having a bad reaction to the methadone because my feet are very swollen till the point that it is noticible.” He had also spoken with a friend the day before his death in which he’d spoken about his swollen feet.
According to the report, a white pill was found near Johnson that DOC investigators identified as Vraylar, an antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The state Medical Examiner’s office later contended that the drug was Prozac. Johnson hadn’t been prescribed either medication. 
Guidelines from medical organizations, cited in the report, warn that doctors should take caution not to increase doses of methadone too quickly and to prescribe lower doses to patients who are considered to be “high risk.” 
While an initial methadone dose can be between 10 mg and 30 mg, The College of Physicians & Surgeons of Manitoba advises that for “high risk” patients, that first dose should be between 5 mg and 20 mg. High risk patients include people who are on sedative medications or antipsychotics, as well as those who have not taken opioids for a significant period of time. 
At the time of his death, Johnson had been incarcerated for nearly two months, meaning it was likely he had not taken an opioid for a significant period, and he was being prescribed an antipsychotic. The Inspector General’s office said that these facts should have prevented the medical staff from starting him at such a high dose of methadone or increasing that dose so quickly. 
“In Johnson’s case, it is likely that his body could not handle the amount of methadone that he was receiving each day, and it accumulated to a toxic level that (along with the Seroquel and Zyprexa) caused him to stop breathing,” the report read. “His death should have raised immediate red flags in DOC regarding whether other inmates were receiving medically appropriate doses of methadone.”   
Just two days after Johnson’s death, another young man at Garner, Tyler Cole, died from a combination of methadone and antipsychotic drugs he was prescribed. 
During his intake at Bridgeport Correctional Center on June 13, 2024, Cole told medical staff that he had used heroin and drank Hennessy cognac that day. Soon after, he was transferred to Garner. It was more than a month later, on July 19, when Cole was first given methadone. He was given an initial dose of 30 mg. The next day, it was raised to 40 mg. 
Like Johnson, Cole would have been considered a high risk patient, since he had not taken an opioid for over a month and was being prescribed both a sedative and an antipsychotic medication. 
The same guidelines from the College of Physicians & Surgeons of Manitoba say that methadone doses should be increased by 5 mg every 3 to 5 days, or 10 mg every 7 days. The American Society of Addiction Medicine advises increasing methadone doses “no more than 10 mg approximately every 5 days.”  
[RELATED: Drug overdoses in CT prisons raising alarms]
A lawyer for Cole’s family, Ken Krayeske, filed a claim with the state’s Claim Commissioner in 2025 asking for permission to sue the Department of Correction and requesting $25 million in damages. Krayeske called the increase from 30 mg to 40 mg within 24 hours a “pretty outrageous” jump, which wouldn’t have given Cole time to build up tolerance to the drug.
“Certainly, his dose should not have been increased to 40 mg after only one day in the program,” the Inspector General’s report read. “It is likely that methadone was starting to accumulate in his system; but the methadone’s interaction with the antipsychotic drugs and the Clonazepam (a benzodiazepine) depressed his respiration to the point where he could not breathe.” 
The Inspector General’s report did not find that medical professionals who prescribed the methadone engaged in any “criminal action.” 
“Johnson and Cole should have been prescribed no more than 20 mg of methadone per day for the first three days of therapy. Perhaps, even a lower dose was more appropriate. Thereafter, the dose should have increased at the rate of no more than 5 mg every 3 to 5 days with careful assessment of their reaction. Instead, they received the typical initial dose of 30 mg that ramped up quickly to 40 mg with fatal consequences,” the report read.
The report also notes that, in both cases, doctors or medical professionals who prescribed the methadone did not meet in person with either of the men. 
Reached by phone, Cole’s mother, Tracy Ciccone and his stepfather Jason Ciccone said they wanted the Department of Correction and the medical professionals involved with Cole’s death to be held responsible. 
“ This can’t happen again to other people,” said Jason Ciccone. “It’s a tragedy, and going forward they’ve really got to clean things up.” 
Tracy Ciccone said she felt the people involved should lose their jobs, and that Cole’s son should receive some type of monetary compensation for the events of his father’s death. 
“It’s frustrating, I think, for us, because there’s a little boy whose dad was killed. There’s a mom who lost her son, and the Office of the Inspector General says ‘This is tragic, but I can’t take any action against anybody,’” said Krayeske.  
The Inspector General’s report warned against eliminating methadone programs in prisons overall, noting that allowing incarcerated men and women who are detoxing from opioids to access methadone improves their ability to reenter their communities after they leave prison. But the report said the department should take “immediate and substantial steps” to address how the methadone program was being run.  
Andrius Banevicius, spokesperson for the Department of Correction, said in a statement to the Connecticut Mirror that after Cole and Johnson’s deaths, the department conducted a review of the Medication Assisted Treatment program “to ensure that it is being administered as effectively and safely as possible.”
According to the report, and to Banevicius, the Department of Correction plans to hire an addiction medicine specialist to work across the prison facilities, and they will no longer start patients at Garner Correctional Institution on methadone because of the risk of combining methadone with antipsychotic medications.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PRISON-OVERDOSES-0113-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-13 12:12:45.779428

According to a news release from Dooley’s campaign, the sixth-generation farmer intends to advocate for family farms and communities over the “priorities of big business and political insiders” if elected.  
“We have so much potential here in Iowa—we have the best soils, the most innovative people, and some of the most advanced technology on the planet,” Dooley said in the release. “We have communities that, with a little support, could flourish and grow. We have water systems that, with care and effort, can be clean, safe, and fun for all.”

Dooley graduated from Iowa State University and returned to the family farm in 2008. He has served as a board member with Practical Farmers of Iowa and worked to implement conservation practices on the farm including no-till, cover crops, oxbow restoration and enrollment of tracts in the Conservation Reserve Program. 
He also owns and operates Dooley Ag Stewardship Inc., which sells seed and cover crop mixes and offers custom seed application.
Dooley is gunning for the Democratic nomination on the ticket to replace current Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig, who is running for reelection. Naig, a Republican, has been in the role since 2018. 
Dooley said he is running because the communities and families the depend on agriculture “deserve a partner who will help them succeed.” 
Chris Jones, an author and water scientist, is expected to officially launch his campaign — also for the Democratic spot on the ticket — Thursday in Des Moines.

The board's January meeting included a motion to downgrade St. Louis Public Schools' accreditation status (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).The Missouri State Board of Education stripped St. Louis Public Schools of its status as fully accredited onTuesday a move the only opposing board member called a “messaging device.”
The school district has been downgraded to provisionally accredited. 
“Lowering accreditation is a broad signal and by itself does not fix audits, stabilize transportation or strengthen governance,” said Pamela Westbrooks-Hodge, a board member from Pasadena Hills.
The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education planned only to raise accreditation during the state board meeting Tuesday, boosting the Osborn School District from provisional to full accreditation following its hiring of a superintendent in order to meet certification requirements.
Missouri senators question education officials about efforts to help struggling schools

The department has been looking at factors like superintendent certification and financial security to determine whether a school district is fully accredited since the launch of the Missouri School Improvement 6 in 2022. Any changes to accreditation based on MSIP6 scores are not supposed to be implemented until next year, which has drawn criticism from state lawmakers who want low-performing schools penalized sooner rather than later.
State board member Kerry Casey, of Chesterfield, asked the board to lower St. Louis Public Schools to provisional accreditation based on factors outside of MSIP6. She cited leadership instability, transportation issues, a poor rating from the State Auditor and the district’s late submission of its annual financial report to the state.
“(My recommendation) is strictly based on the fact that they have experienced significant change in the scope of effectiveness of their programs and their financial integrity upon which their original designation was based, and they have failed to comply with the statutory requirement,” Casey said. “If we do not make this lower classification change, we are not doing our job.”
Commissioner of Education Karla Eslinger said she was “very dissatisfied” that the district turned in its financial report late and thought about recommending to lower its accreditation. But she didn’t think the move would solve any problems.
Charter schools can open in areas where a school district has been provisionally accredited for three or more consecutive years. But state law already allows charter schools in St. Louis.
“The provisional tag on the school district is not going to make that big of a difference,” Eslinger said. “Why I did not make that recommendation is I’d rather have them at the table with me and working with me.”
A spokesperson for St. Louis Public Schools could not be immediately reached for comment on the board’s decision. 
State education officials have been working with the district, Eslinger said, and the department has convened a group of school leaders and local stakeholders to brainstorm solutions for St. Louis Public Schools and other underperforming districts.
“Putting those plans together, I see good things ahead for St Louis,” Eslinger told the board.
When she took office as commissioner in 2024, St. Louis Public Schools’ leadership did not return calls or emails, she said.
“We do now have a relationship, and we’re being very honest and upfront about the issues that they have,” Eslinger said.
Westbrooks-Hodge, whose district includes St. Louis, was the only board member to speak against Casey’s motion. She pointed out that the district had incremental growth in its annual performance reports, and she worried it was being singled out.
“Using reclassification primarily to send a message risks blurring the distinction MSIP6 intentionally draws between academic performance and governance or financial stress and risks, weakening the consistency and credibility of classification systems statewide,” she said.
Casey and the other five board members voted by voice in favor of the motion.
Last January, Casey made a similar motion but did not receive a second supporter to spur a vote. In reaction, the American Federation of Teachers St. Louis called for Casey’s resignation from the board. Missouri Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin shared her support for Casey’s decision on social media, saying: “This has long been needing to happen but for some reason hasn’t.”
During Tuesday’s meeting, Casey also requested that the department provide a report on underperforming schools statewide by the board’s April meeting. This motion received unanimous support from board members.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/090925_eslinger1-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-13 12:12:45.779428

(Photo by Will Jacott/Minnesota Reformer) Minneapolis Public Schools placed its top three finance department leaders on administrative leave more than a week ago — but the district has not provided any public explanation.
The district has communicated the personnel changes to a narrow group of employees, but has not shared the information with school staff. The district has declined to comment to the Reformer, citing state privacy law. 
The significant personnel moves come as the district, already facing fiscal uncertainty, grapples with an audit whose delivery to the Minnesota Department of Education is already late. The district has declined to talk about that, as well.  
The Reformer has reached out to all five school board members who sit on the finance committee: Abdul Abdi, board treasurer; Collin Beachy, board chair; Greta Callahan; Kim Ellison, board vice chair; and Joyner Emerick. None would comment on the record. 
The school board will meet in executive session, closed to the public, to “discuss potential litigation in an employment-related matter” and “preliminary consideration of charges and allegations against an individual subject to the Board’s authority,” at 4 p.m. Tuesday, according to the official meeting notice. 
It is not clear from the notice whether these topics are related to Ibrahima Diop, Tariro Chapinduka or Aaron Gilbert, the three employees placed on leave.
There is nothing on the agenda for the board’s public meeting Tuesday that indicates the district will provide information about why the finance department leaders were placed on leave.
The district has started assigning some of the senior finance officers’ roles to Senior Executive Officer Ryan Strack. The school board approved a series of annual financial authorizations that included transferring multiple authorities to Strack, which in prior years the board had assigned to Diop in his role as senior finance officer. By Friday, Jan. 9, the Minnesota Department of Education had changed its website to name Strack as the district’s business agent — a role previously assigned to Diop.
Strack has not previously worked in the district’s finance department. He started at the district as a social worker, and at least as far back as 2018, under former Superintendent Ed Graff, worked as a liaison between the school board and the superintendent. 
Diop was hired by Milwaukee Public Schools on Dec. 18, 2025, to serve as a deputy superintendent of operations, according to WTMJ in Milwaukee. This is the day before his departure from Minneapolis Public Schools was announced to district staff. On Jan. 8, Milwaukee Public Schools informed district employees that Diop would not be joining the district.
The people of Milwaukee — and, for that matter, Minneapolis — might want to know the cause of this notable development, but at this point, Minneapolis Schools has declined to tell the public anything.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MinneapolisSchool_1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-13 11:58:41.794281

Dan McKeon of Amherst speaking before deciding to resign moments before the floor debate and possible vote to expel him in the Nebraska Capitol on Jan. 13, 2026. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Instead of possibly becoming the first sitting senator expelled from the Nebraska Legislature, State Sen. Dan McKeon resigned minutes before floor debate was set to begin. 
McKeon faced expulsion following allegations he inappropriately touched a legislative staffer — allegations he denies. The Legislature’s Executive Board, which oversees the legislative branch’s internal discipline, introduced Legislative Resolution 282 for his expulsion. 
That resolution was up for floor debate Tuesday. Just before the debate began at around 10 a.m., McKeon took the microphone and resigned his seat representing Legislative District 41. 
“This last year has humbled me,” McKeon said tearfully. 
State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area, who vocally supported McKeon’s expulsion, said she believed there were enough votes to expel McKeon — it required 33 — after checking with lawmakers Tuesday morning. 
The staffer reported that McKeon made a joke about going to Hawaii to “get laid” and smacked her rear end after delivering the joke, according to an investigative report from outside counsel Tara Paulson. 
A separate police report after the incident led to McKeon being cited for misdemeanor public indecency by the Nebraska State Patrol in October. Prosecutors have since charged him with misdemeanor disturbing the peace. McKeon pleaded not guilty after originally signaling his intent to plead no contest. His next court date is Jan. 26.

The Examiner is aware of the alleged victim’s name but is not publishing it because it is the policy of States Newsroom and the Examiner not to identify people who say they have been abused unless they wish to talk publicly.
McKeon’s varied responses to the allegation, as well as additional allegations against the senator that have surfaced since then, contributed to the Exec Board’s resolution, said State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, the board’s chair. 
Paulson’s report concluded that McKeon’s actions did not constitute actionable sexual harassment under state or federal law. However, she said the actions may violate the Legislature’s own workplace harassment policy. That policy includes “sexually oriented jokes” in its definition of sexual harassment.
“Actionable is not tantamount to acceptable,” Paulson said.
Paulson added that she believes McKeon’s actions “should not be tolerated” by the Legislature, as it could foster a hostile work environment, which in legal circles could put taxpayers at risk of a state claim. Neary has said her client is considering filing a civil lawsuit, but hasn’t specified what parties would be targeted.

Bill Huizenga has become one of the few Republican members of Congress pushing back on the interventions of President Donald Trump’s administration in Venezuela following the United States’ capture of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3, which United Nations’ officials and Amnesty International say occurred in violation of international law.
The Holland Township Republican specifically expressed to NOTUS worries about the role of Delcy Rodríguez, who served as Maduro’s vice president, as the acting president of the country. Huizenga has repeatedly supported Edmundo González Urrutia, who ran against Maduro in the 2024 presidential election and was seen by many international leaders as the rightful winner of that election, as well as other Venezuelan opposition leaders like María Corina Machado, winner of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize. 
“When are we going to get to either recognizing González or an actual free, fair election that the results will be recognized?” Huizenga told NOTUS that he had asked the administration.

In the immediate wake of Maduro’s capture, Huizenga expressed support for the mission and its outcome in a press release — adding his support for González Urrutia
“Anyone connected with Maduro should be viewed as illegitimate,” he wrote on Jan. 3. “The United States should recognize Edmundo González Urrutia, the rightful winner of the past election, as President and work with him in this time of transition until the Venezuelan people can hold a free and fair election.”
Huizenga also criticized Trump’s plans to have the United States establish control over Venezuela’s oil industry and reserves, asking in a classified briefing, according to NOTUS, what the administration’s plan to do so was, saying he had not received full or satisfactory answers to those questions. 
“If they [administration officials] hadn’t thought through all the details, let’s get them talking about those kinds of details, because those details are very important with the goal and objective that those proceeds are used properly,” he said, adding that oil proceeds should “not support the Maduro leftover regime.”
In criticizing the administration, Huizenga joins a small group of Republican colleagues who have broken with the Trump administration on the intervention in Venezuela, including the five GOP U.S. senators who voted to advance a war powers resolution that would halt U.S. military action in Venezuela without congressional authorization.

Does one vote really make a difference in an election?


With mail-in voting starting this month for North Carolina’s 2026 Primary, a new report answers that question with a decisive “yes.”


Research from Common Cause North Carolina reveals how one person’s vote — or decision not to vote — made the difference in who won or lost in three dozen North Carolina elections last year. Seven contests for mayor or town council ended in a tie. In another 15 elections, the winner prevailed by just one vote. And in 14 other cases, a two-vote margin of victory would have vanished if one of the winner’s voters had chosen the losing candidate.


That’s 36 North Carolina contests with outcomes determined by one voter.


For example, out west, with the flip of a coin, John Shepherd won his 2025 race for a seat on the Jefferson Town Council. In the eastern North Carolina town of Whitakers, John Ford emerged the winner of a tie vote for a seat on the town board when his name was pulled from a cardboard box. In 2019, Ford lost a tied contest when his opponent’s name was drawn from a box.


It was the same story 10 years ago in the Sandhills town of Garland, when a tied race was also resolved “by lot” or chance, as required by state law. In that case, candidates put colored pens in a box, and the elections board chair picked the winner’s purple pen. In that same year, 69 North Carolina mayors or town council members won their election by five or fewer votes.
These types of results over the past decade aren’t a fluke. In a similar analysis of 2019’s local elections, in 39 cities, the decision of one voter could have turned a loser into a winner.
The winners of these local elections have a direct impact on our lives. They make decisions affecting community projects, public health and safety, taxes, and more. Local electeds can also use these positions as a steppingstone to gain even more power. In 2003, Thom Tillis tied for a seat on the Cornelius town council and went on to become a state legislator, then N.C. House Speaker, and now a U.S. Senator.


But local elections aren’t the only ones where a single voter makes a difference.


In 2020, incumbent N.C. Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley lost her statewide race to opponent Paul Newby by 401 votes out of over 5.5 million votes cast. That means less than one vote in each of North Carolina’s 550 incorporated municipalities could have determined who would run our state’s highest court.
Similar to the stakes in 2026, the result of that single Beasley-Newby race would ultimately shift the trajectory of our judiciary. In the years since, the Newby Court has been responsible for reversing key decisions that protected voters from rampant gerrymandering, opened the door for more delays in long overdue education funding in the Leandro case, and driven “changes that have reverberated well beyond the borders of his state.”


As we look ahead to this year’s elections, it’s also worth mentioning that in the last midterm, only about half (51.14%) of the state’s registered voters (3,790,202 out of 7,412,050) cast a ballot. Those who chose not to vote had as much impact as those who did — determining everything from the balance of power of the U.S. Senate to how powerful county sheriffs enforce laws around everything from health access to immigration.


Just as your vote can be pivotal in any North Carolina election, sharing the power of that vote with others can help jumpstart a movement that could drive the millions who stayed home in 2022 to make a different choice this year.

New Mexico Finance Authority officials said on Jan. 12, 2026, that they’d approved nearly $75 million in housing loans, but mostly in urban areas. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Two years after the Legislature entrusted the New Mexico Finance Authority with $125 million to spur construction of middle-income and affordable housing, the authority has loaned out almost $75 million of it in support of roughly 700 new housing units.
But the majority of that funding has benefited urban areas, lawmakers on the House Appropriations and Finance Committee noted at a meeting Monday, despite lawmakers’ intent to boost housing development in rural New Mexico. 
“I definitely don’t want the money being unspent, but at the same time, we have an obligation to make sure that our rural communities have access to the funds,” said state Rep. Meredith Dixon (D-Albuquerque).
NM Finance Authority says it’s approved $52 million in housing loans

The Legislature in 2024 allocated $125 million for NMFA’s Opportunity Enterprise Revolving Loan fund and also amended the loan program to make developers and nonprofit organizations eligible to receive loans for housing projects. 
The low-interest loans are limited to affordable housing infrastructure, like sewer or electricity to an affordable housing project, or construction of “workforce” housing, designed for people who can’t afford housing but earn too much income to qualify for state and federal housing subsidies. 
During a presentation to the committee Monday, NMFA Deputy Director Fernando Martinez listed three infrastructure and seven housing projects the authority has approved in three funding rounds since September 2024. Three of the projects are in Santa Fe and four are in Albuquerque, both urban areas. The final three are in rural Taos, Alamogordo and Los Lunas. 
That mix of urban or rural housing projects appears to be right at the limit the Legislature contemplated when it created the housing loan fund. The fund requires at least 30% of projects to be completed in rural areas, and it prohibits more than 50% of projects from being within any one county. 
Martinez acknowledged the issue but said few rural organizations have expressed interest in the grants. 
“There’s not enough interested entities in the rural communities that can qualify at this time,” he said. “We’ve seen a lot of problems with that.”
Dixon suggested the legislative NMFA Oversight Committee consider devising changes to the law that would encourage more rural organizations to seek  the loans, but also suggested possibly lowering the required percentage of projects that must go to rural areas. 
“I think the oversight committee needs to seriously consider modifying the legislation and the rural and frontier percentages, because if that money is not going to be able to be spent, we don’t want it just sitting there,” she said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_9539-1024x964.jpg,,,2026-01-13 11:58:41.794281

(Photo by Liv Caputo/Florida Phoenix)Florida Senate President Ben Albritton gaveled in the chamber Tuesday for 2026 legislative session, outlining his priorities of revitalizing rural Florida and cutting costs — while offering a tribute to Gov. Ron DeSantis.
It will be DeSantis’ final session as governor, whose tenure Albritton characterized as “unpredictable, surprising, energetic, trailblazing,” and, at times, “rough and tumble.” The Wauchula Republican acknowledged the “different” session experienced last year, but, he said “we completed our mission.”
“I’m not king of the Senate — collaboration and communication are the driving forces here,” Albritton told lawmakers, speaking to a chamber packed with senators’ families, the Cabinet, and Lt. Gov Jay Collins, himself a former senator. DeSantis, ahead of his State of the State address, was not present.
“I’m here to serve Floridians and each of you, in my own way, using Biblical principles,” Albritton continued.
The 2025 session was marked by an unanticipated rebellion against DeSantis by the GOP supermajority Legislature. Spearheaded by House Speaker Danny Perez — and briefly supported by Albritton — lawmakers insisted on asserting independence from the governor, a stark contrast to the domination DeSantis enjoyed for most of his administration.
The mass discord led to disagreements over the budget, the only measure constitutionally required to pass each year. It ended up being signed into law just days before the July 1 deadline.
‘Rural Renaissance’
Albritton, entering his second and final year as Senate president, launched into a salute to what he characterized as the Trump administration’s dedication to rural America. He described a discussion he had with U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, who Albritton said plans to make his “Rural Renaissance” legislation a “national model across the United States.”
Last session, Albritton’s “Rural Renaissance” package died when the House refused to adopt Senate language. Its provisions — revitalized this year — include funding for rural roads, housing, education, healthcare, and business to the tune of $217.9 million.
Part of this rural focus will extend to citrus, a driving force in Florida’s agricultural economy, Albritton said. This will expand on last year’s “Make Citrus Great Again” and “Farmers Feeding Florida” initiatives.
“Citrus has been a pillar of our state since the 1500s and remains a key part of Florida’s Rural Renaissance,” Albritton said. “Research and new technologies offered renewed hope for the future of citrus in Florida. I’m keeping my foot on the gas — Florida Citrus is not going down on my watch.”
 Affordability and property taxes
The Senate president’s other priority this session is affordability. However, he cautioned that the Legislature’s ability to address skyrocketed costs is limited.
“We have to be honest with constituents. The ability of the Florida Legislature — in a 60-day session — to influence the price of goods and services within a state economy that is largely driven by national and international economic trends is pretty limited,” Albritton said, taking care to praise Trump’s tax cuts.
Costs have been a dominating issue in Florida politics in the past few years, most recently rearing its head in the form of property taxes. Soaring taxes on homes have sparked a GOP insistence on either eliminating the taxes or seriously slashing them.
The call first came from DeSantis ahead of the 2025 session, but fears of eliminating funding for law enforcement, schools, fire departments, and other public works has proven a hefty obstacle. This year, DeSantis has floated a late spring special session to solve the problem.
“I look forward to providing voters the opportunity to pass meaningful property tax relief,” Albritton said. “And, again this year, the Florida Legislature will pass a balanced budget that holds the line on state spending, pays down debt, cuts taxes, and saves for the future.
“That’s the strong fiscal-responsibility Floridians expect and deserve, and that’s the single best thing we in the Florida Legislature can do to keep our state on the right track,” he added.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0964-1024x935.jpeg,,,2026-01-13 11:13:12.840390

Sign up for their newsletter here.
A jury in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, thought it had put the issue to rest.
In April 2025, after an 18-day trial, the group of south Louisianans awarded two coastal parish governments $744.6 million in damages, finding that Chevron had contributed to the decline of the state’s shoreline and wetlands.
In the face of that landmark ruling, Chevron and oil companies facing similar suits fought back.
On Monday, eight of the U.S. Supreme Court’s nine justices heard the companies’ appeal. Lawyers representing Chevron, Texaco and Exxon Mobil argued that the case should be litigated in federal, not state, court. Justice Samuel Alito recused himself from further consideration of the case, though he’d already participated in the court’s decision to address the issue.
Lawyers for Chevron argued that the company should be permitted to remove lawsuits against it from state to federal court because its actions, which stretch back to the World War II era, were at times done at the encouragement and direction of the federal government.

Paul Clement, a seasoned advocate before the nation’s highest court now representing Chevron, told the justices the controversy amounted to a “relatively straightforward case.” Because of the federal government’s outsized involvement in the oil market beginning in the 1940s, he argued, the court should require that suits over oil companies’ related actions should be heard by federal, not state, judges.
Justice Elena Kagan questioned whether the oil company’s suggested legal theory would lead to absurd outcomes, like requiring suits against vertically integrated producers to be heard in federal court while suits against oil refiners, for example, would remain in state courtrooms.
Clement suggested the court ignore the contradiction, calling it “a surface anomaly.”
Ben Aguiñaga, Louisiana’s solicitor general, told justices that Clement’s argument before the court, focused in large part on oil companies’ actions during the World War II era, strayed far from the on-the-ground, contemporary evidence that was presented during the state court trial in Pointe à la Hache.
“They do not dispute that they dumped billions of gallons of produced water from oil wells directly into our marsh,” he said of Chevron’s executives.
Aguiñaga pointed the court to its own decision in Watson, a 2007 case where the body unanimously decided that Phillip Morris, a tobacco company, could not remove lawsuits against it to federal court simply because it operated under the close supervision of government regulators.
The parishes’ successful lawsuit, which alleged Chevron had violated a 1978 Louisiana coastal management law, was rightly heard in state courts, Aguiñaga argued, because that’s where the expertise on the relevant law lies.
“We want the actual experts interpreting state law, especially when we get the Louisiana Supreme Court on an important statute like this, and especially with respect to a problem that is so sweeping in scope,” he said.
Legal experts say the oil companies view the federal courts as a friendlier venue that will be more receptive to their arguments that they are owed some protection from liability because of their role in national security. The court’s decision will determine the venue for a slew of similar cases, including 40 lawsuits by Louisiana officials. It also could have bearing on litigation now underway around the country over oil company liability for the costs of climate change.
While the legal outlines of the Louisiana case don’t seem to fall along traditional political lines, the court’s liberal justices appeared more skeptical of the oil companies’ insistence that the cases be moved to federal courts during Monday’s arguments.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that the companies’ suggested scope of when a case should be forced into a federal courtroom was too broad.
“They way you’re defining this, but for a nail, something could fall apart,” Sotomayor said.
But Clement told justices that federal law is broad in its categorization of cases that can be removed from state courts.
“If we are going to get into a big debate about exactly what happened in World War II, boy, I think that should take place in federal court,” he said.
The case puts lawyers for Republican-led Louisiana up against both Chevron and the Trump administration, which filed a brief in the case and delivered arguments at Monday’s hearing supporting the removal of the case to federal court.
The implications of the court’s decision could be significant, with both the $744 million judgement and future precedent at stake.
Whatever the court’s decision, Louisiana’s loss of coastline is likely to continue. The state has lost more than 2,000 square miles of land in the last century, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, though Chevron maintains it has not caused the state’s coastal woes.
An environmental impact like that shouldn’t be ignored, Aguiñaga said. “That’s why this is such a massive deal for the state of Louisiana.”

During performances, white actors would blacken their faces with burnt cork and wear tattered and unkempt clothing to mock African slaves. Here, tropes like the Mammy, Jezebel, and untrustworthy criminals were constructed for a large audience, creating a false image of the everyday African American.
More than 150 years later, on TikTok, users see a woman depicted as a gorilla. She’s in front of a gas station and has on a pink wig, big fake pink eyelashes, and bright pink nails. While holding a gas station cup, she says with a blaccent, “So my probation officer called. Good news I ain’t gotta do no more community service, bad news it’s ‘cuz there’s a new warrant out for my arrest, teehee.”
Minstrelsy is back, and just like in the mid 19th century, we, the audience consume its contents without a second thought. Seemingly out of nowhere, hundreds of thousands of AI videos depicting Black people being “ghetto” or “ratchet” have flooded our timelines with no end in sight. For me and my peers at Farmington High, as well as other Connecticut schools, it can be hard to avoid.
Minstrel shows were American’s largest form of entertainment. As lower- and working-class whites were the target audience, performances encouraged them to feel superior in a time of financial struggle as the Great Depression left many of them unemployed. Shows were marketed as family-friendly and were often viewed by people of various ages.
The 20th Century saw a shift, as Black actors began to participate in shows as well. They too dressed up in scruffy garb, painted themselves as dark as they could, and portrayed their own people as slovenly and foolish. Minstrelsy opened doors that were previously closed for Black actors and musicians who struggled to make a name for themselves.
They cashed a check using damage to their own community as collateral. This phenomenon can be seen all throughout history; minorities aligning themselves with their oppressors in order to seek special treatment. Only with minstrel shows, this self-deprecating dynamic is broadcasted for everyone to see, having a lasting effect on people’s perception of who Black people really are.
Throughout the 1900s, Broadway minstrel shows died out and Race Films took their place. Due to the public’s newfound reliance on on-screen entertainment, Race films went where minstrel shows couldn’t —reaching the world on a global scale. The pattern of Black creatives pandering to a white audience is evident here, as Race Films succeeded at modernizing tropes of the last generation.
Bleeding into the 21st century, we see this reflected once again with AI. Only now, who receives compensation? Major software and AI database companies only stand to gain from this phenomenon. Programs like OpenAI’s Sora and Google Gemini’s Veo take faces and artwork from across the internet, then generate videos based on prompts imputed by users. It’s free and easily accessible to the public, making it extremely profitable.
This kind of content has made its way onto TikTok, one of the world’s largest social media platforms. With approximately 1 billion users worldwide, TikTok was taken by Sora 2’s launch in late September of this year. Users were bombarded with AI- generated videos, making it difficult to discern what was real from what wasn’t.

The woman in the gorilla video is meant to look absurd. Her excessive appearance followed by a ridiculous yet playful statement, invites viewers to laugh at such absurdity while reinforcing inherent biases. Through slavery, and later minstrelsy, Black women were frequently disparaged in the public eye, often overly masculine and seen as obnoxious or overly sexual. Portraying Black women as gorillas is not a new concept and is a direct reference to the pseudoscience of the 19th century.
Disgraced practices like phrenology, where scientists compare the size and shape of a person’s head to determine their personality traits, morality, and brain capacity, were used to enforce a racial hierarchy: one with white Europeans on top and Black Africans on the bottom. Phrenologists compared skulls of Africans to those of monkeys or gorillas and cited their research as a justification for enslavement.
But AI Minstrelsy doesn’t stop here. It can generate just about anything: A video depicting Black men as deadbeats, in which a Black man throws something at his girlfriend after she asks for child support. Or maybe another about young Black children —feeding the stereotype of Black boys being gangsters and Black girls being overly promiscuous. Anything and everything pertaining to Black people and “the Black experience” can be found here. Once again Minstrel tropes have been modernized for the public, placing an entire group of people in a box they can never seem to escape.
People laugh because they believe their acceptance has no impact on the world around them. Whether you overtly or covertly believe in racist tropes, engaging with minstrel content shows algorithms that this content holds the audience’s attention. It becomes a recurring loop: Someone creates an AI video, algorithms push it out enough to go viral, then someone notices that virality and decides that they want to go viral too. Passive engagement is now easier than ever; people aren’t using AI because they agree with the agenda being pushed, but because it’s an easy and free way to gain popularity and monetary advantage.
At the end of the day, artificial intelligence is only a tool; it can be wielded by many for various purposes. Someone making Minstrel content for free and posting it online with zero pushback is not only alarming but indicative of our political climate. Sora AI may have been the first social media platform to solely implement AI short-form content, but they won’t be the last.
 To some, this issue may seem trivial, but when thinking about the broader implications it has on our communities, the danger becomes apparent. Connecticut is home to over 360,000 black Americans, and this content is a reflection of the implicit biases held by our neighbors. A lack of race and class consciousness across our nation invites us to be susceptible to outside agendas. Comedy is used to validate racism, and that racism only stands to divide us from one another and distract us from reality.

The 60-day regular legislative session kicks off in Tallahassee today. What, if anything, the Florida Legislature does in the next two months to make health care more affordable and accessible to Florida residents remains to be seen.
Med mal and wrongful death of fetuses
Florida legislators are expected to once again look at killing a medical malpractice law that bars adult children of single parents and parents of childless adult children from pursuing negligence lawsuits if a family member has died.
The Legislature passed a similar bill during last year’s session, but Gov. Ron DeSantis — siding with medical malpractice insurers and medical providers — vetoed the measure. The House is poised to vote out the bill on Thursday. DeSantis has said he could consider approving the measure but only if legislators limit the amount of money recoverable in medical malpractice lawsuits.
The caps were previously ruled unconstitutional by the Florida Supreme Court but the business community is eager to have a largely DeSantis-appointed Supreme Court reconsider their legality.
The chamber also will vote this week on legislation to allow wrongful death lawsuits for the loss of developing fetuses.
Doubling down on doulas
The Florida Health Justice Project, arguing health care is a right, supports a spate of bills during the 2026 session including Medicaid expansion and proposals (HB 681 and HB 823) filed by Orlando Democratic Rep. Ana Eskamani to repeal existing bans on health care including eliminating the state’s six-week abortion ban and striking from statutes the prohibition on gender-affiming care to minors and limitations on that care for transgender adults.
Policy Director Melanie Williams said last week that the association hopes to see those proposals heard in committees this session.

“Expanding Medicaid is an economic, societal, and health win that would lower health care costs, strengthen Florida’s workforce and support hospitals and the health care system,” project policy director Melanie Williams said.
The group also hopes a pair of bills meant to improve maternal and child health by training more doulas will be considered. Doulas serve as birth advocates and coaches during labor and delivery and even after childbirth. 
HB 1043 and SB 1456 sponsored by Rep. Ashley Gantt, a Democrat from Miami, and Sen. Rosalind Osgood, a Democrat from Tamarac, respectively, would create a Doula Workforce Development Support Program at the Department of Commerce. 
The bills would declare that “persistent maternal morbidity and mortality disparities that disproportionately affect Black, Brown, rural, and low-income communities” exist in the state.”
The department would get $7.5 million to provide grants and technical assistance to doula-training entities to expand that workforce. The bill would direct grants to urban counties with high maternal morbidity disparities; rural areas with limited or no obstetric providers or maternity wards; and to communities affected by hospital closures or reductions in maternity services.
Nonprofit organizations, community-based programs, training collectives, academic institutions, and private educational providers that conduct doula training, mentoring, and continuing education would qualify for the grants.
“Florida continues to face unacceptable disparities in maternal and infant health outcomes. Too many families lack consistent access to prenatal, postpartum, and infant care, especially in rural communities and in communities of color,” Williams said. “Addressing these gaps requires policies that prioritize continuity of care, workforce, support, and coverage that meets families where they are.”
Debt protections
The lives of Florida residents could also be improved if the Legislature strengthened oversight of Medicaid, Williams said, referencing a recent federal court finding that the administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis sent Medicaid termination letters following the end of the COVID public health pandemic that were “vague, confusing and often incorrect and misleading.”
Court rules Florida Medicaid termination letters fly in face of federal law

Williams said the Health Justice Project supports HB 1271 and SB 1222, carried by Jacksonville Democrat Rep. Angie Nixon and Miami Republican Sen. Ana Maria Rodriguez. The bills limit how far debt collectors can go to collect medical debt.
“Unfortunately, across Florida debt is not just a financial issue, it’s a health care one as well. Medical debt forces families to delay care; it drains household savings and pushes working people into long-term financial instability through no fault of their own,” Williams said. “When Florida and federal policies limit access to affordable, available medical services, we shouldn’t allow debt collectors to threaten people with their livelihood.”
Expand scope, not Medicaid
Ten states, mostly southern and including Florida, have refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, often referred to as “Obamacare,” to provide health coverage to childless, lower-income, working adults. 
While the Republican-led Legislature isn’t willing to expand the health care safety net to cover more people, top legislators, including House Speaker Daniel Perez, a Miami Republican, have championed bills that would expand services that health care providers may offer by altering their “scope” of allowable services.
Specifically, HB 693, filed by Miami Republican Mike Redondo, would authorize all advanced practice registered nurses to work independently of medical doctors. While some advanced nurses can do that today, it’s authorized on a limited basis and only for provision of primary care. Redondo’s bill would allow others, such as registered nurse anesthetists, to work independently of physicians.
The move to expand what advanced nurses can provide has put the bill on organized medicine’s radar, and Jacksonville health care lobbyist Christopher Nuland said quashing the scope of practice expansion for nurses, what he describes as a small part of a much larger bill, is a priority of his.
House Speaker Daniel Perez seeks cuts, restrictions, for safety-net programs

 
Expanding scope for advanced nurses has been a long-standing priority for the House. So has been eliminating certificate of need requirements for the construction of new health care facilities, which HB 693 also would do for nursing homes and institutions for the developmentally disabled.
HB 693 also would require people on food assistance who are not disabled and who don’t have young children to show they are working through age 64. Florida law now requires people to show they are working through age 59. The change is being made to conform with the provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill.

Dental care
Another bill, HB 363, would establish a new health care category in the state called “dental therapists.” The Florida Dental Association does not support the idea, sponsored by Republican Rep. Linda Chaney of St. Pete Beach. The bill is being championed by a group called Floridians for Dental Access, led by dentist Dr. Frank Catalanotto. 
The Senate has rejected similar legislation in the past but advocates hope to enlist Senate President Ben Albritton, a Republican from Wauchula, who’s been keenly interested in investing in rural counties. Those are some of the hardest hit by dental shortages and cost increases, with nearly 41% of Florida’s 32 rural counties reporting a 77% increase in dental-related hospital and emergency room billings. 
The grassroots advocacy group Florida Voices for Health has made dental screenings at schools its top priority and is lobbying for SB 1136 and HB 1091. The bills would alter Florida’s “Parent’s Bill of Rights” to allow dental screening to be performed at schools after parents have been given written notice and reasonable opportunity to deny, consent, or opt their students out of the screenings. The screenings would be limited to noninvasive visual inspection for signs of dental disease or abnormality.

“Anyone who’s lived with dental pain knows what it’s like day-to-day, how hard it is to focus and stay on top of things when you’re living with like a pain in your mouth. And so this bill … clarifies school districts are allowed to use passive consent,” FVH Executive Director Scott Darius said. “And it feels like a small change, but one that’s happening in the context of, you know, the end of community water fluoridation, which is just going to impact low-income kids the most.”
He added that the legislation would give FVH a platform to talk to school districts about the importance of dental screenings and encourage them to start dental screening programs if they don’t already have them.
Safety net hospitals’ agenda
Safety Net Hospital Association of Florida CEO Justin Senior said his association will closely track House and Senate budgets and spending on Medicaid.
A top priority is ensuring the viability of an $86 million program meant to help train future physicians and to solidify Florida’s health care workforce. Passed as part of the 2023 “Live Healthy” proposal, the “Slots for Docs Program” requires the state to annually allocate to hospitals $100,000 for each newly created residency for a physician specialty or subspecialty for which there is a statewide shortage. 
The law lays out 29 specialities and sub-specialities experiencing a statewide “supply and demand deficit,”  including  obstetrics and gynecology; geriatric medicine; family medicine; emergency medicine; and cardiology.

The Slots for Docs Program is funded with state dollars that are coupled with matching federal Medicaid funds.
However, the program isn’t yet operational because the federal government, concerned that there was no mandate for the physicians to care for Medicaid patients, didn’t approve the plan. Senior said the safety-net hospitals have a two-fold goal for the 2026 session: 

Ensure the money in the current fiscal year budget for the Slots for Docs program that isn’t being spent isn’t raided for other purposes.
 Help work out the details of a graduate medical education program that the federal government could approve. 

“We’re hoping to find a way to maintain that $86 million in the system,” Senior told the Florida Phoenix. “And we’ll have to find a new distribution model for it.”
Senior said the hospitals — as of now — haven’t been harmed by the federal government’s decision to not approve the program. And, he said, as long as the Legislature agrees to revert the unused funds from the current budget and allow them to be used in the coming FY 2026-27 budget, his member facilities should be fine.
“There’s been no impact yet but I think the hospitals that were counting on this money and were responding to the incentives in the Slots for Docs program would really like to see a program, or whatever replaces it, drive the money in a very similar way.
To that end, Senior said the hospitals are on board with Gov. Ron DeSantis’ budget proposal to distribute the money, which essentially borrows from a different and already approved graduate medical education plan.
“It looks acceptable to us but we are hopeful that the House and Senate take up either that or something very similar to it,” Senior said.
In addition to the $86 million in funding, Senior said, his group will closely track the budget process and work to ensure Medicaid funding for hospitals isn’t cut.
“We hope there are no rate cuts. A lot of that is tied to the economy and the economic performance,” he said, noting that Medicaid is counter-cyclical. During recessions, when people lose their jobs, the number of people relying on Medicaid for health care security increases. The caseload increases come as the state has less money coming into its coffers to pay for the services.
“We’re not seeing that right now. Medicaid enrollment has dropped below 4 million in the most recent reading in Florida and we are seeing right now, if you look at the measure of gross domestic product and things like that around the country, the economy is still growing. So we are hopeful that there are no cuts to Medicaid rates.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-1026036240-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-13 11:00:11.934329

Ned Lamont's reelection campaign reported raising $84,903 from contributors since mid-November. He chipped in another $105,000.","Gov. Ned Lamont still intends to largely self-fund his reelection campaign, but his first campaign finance filing had one surprise: Others gave nearly as much to the campaign in its first weeks as did the independently wealthy Democratic governor. 
“We’re trying to raise as many small dollar donations as we can to show we got broad-based support,” Lamont said Monday.
That was not a concern in 2022, when Lamont’s opponent was a wealthy Republican businessman, Bob Stefanowski, who also largely self-funded his campaign. Neither man tried to use the number of donors as a measure of support.
This year, all three of Lamont’s opponents are participants in the state’s revamped Citizens’ Election Program, which requires a broad base of small-dollar donors to qualify for public grants of about $3.2 million in a primary and $15.4 million in a general election.
“We have a lot of small money donations,” Lamont told reporters a few hours before his report was filed. “I have not done any fundraising. I got a day job. But we’re doing fine.”
His campaign reported raising $84,903 from contributors since his campaign’s launch in mid-November through Dec. 31, the end of the quarterly reporting period. 
His own contribution: $105,000.
“We are really proud of how many people have joined the campaign in just six weeks since the governor announced,” said Lauren Gray, a spokeswoman for the campaign. “We believe this surge of support is one indication.”
Not all the donors were small donors, at least as defined by the public financing law. A little less than half his outside money — $38,500 — came from 11 individuals who gave the legal maximum of $3,500.
Other contributions were as modest as $5.
In 2022, Lamont contributed $25.7 million to his own campaign. Others gave $564,164. Stefanowski gave $12.98 million and raised $1.5 million from others.
The report filed Monday by Rep. Josh Elliott, D-Hamden, who is challenging Lamont for the Democratic nomination, showed that his struggles to attract qualifying contributions are continuing. 
Qualifying for public financing requires gubernatorial candidates to raise at least $250,000 in donations ranging from $5 to $250. Elliott raised $39,918 in the three-month reporting period ending on Dec. 31. His total since opening his campaign in July is $85,082. 
Elliott opened the day with another fundraising appeal, saying Lamont is not aggressive enough to face the Trump administration and incidents like the shooting death of Renee Good in Minneapolis by federal immigration agents.
“Ned Lamont is a decent person. But ‘decent’ isn’t what this moment requires,” Elliott wrote. “We need leaders who understand that dismantling unaccountable agencies isn’t radical — it’s the bare minimum. Leaders who will use the power of the office, not just occupy it.”
The two Republicans running for governor, former Mayor Erin Stewart of New Britain and state Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich, already have crossed the $250,000 threshold.
Stewart’s application for public financing was approved last week. Fazio has not yet filed his application.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_9071-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-13 11:00:11.934329

Lower courts ruled for the transgender athletes in Idaho and West Virginia who challenged the state bans, but the conservative-dominated Supreme Court might not follow suit.
In just the past year, the justices ruled in favor state bans on gender-affirming care for transgender youths and allowed multiple restrictions on transgender people to be enforced.
The legal fight is playing out amid a broad effort by President Donald Trump to target transgender Americans, beginning on the first day of his second term and including the ouster of transgender people from the military and declaring that gender is immutable and determined at birth.
The culture war cases come from Idaho and West Virginia, among the first of the more than two dozen Republican-led states that have banned transgender athletes from girls’ and women’s teams.
The justices are evaluating claims of sex discrimination lodged by transgender people versus the need for fair competition for women and girls, the main argument made by the states.
In the first case, Lindsay Hecox, 25, sued over Idaho’s first-in-the-nation ban for the chance to try out for the women’s track and cross-country teams at Boise State University in Idaho. She didn’t make either squad but competed in club-level soccer and running.
Becky Pepper-Jackson, a 15-year-old high school sophomore, has been taking puberty-blocking medication, publicly identified as a girl since age 8 and has been issued a West Virginia birth certificate recognizing her as female. She is the only transgender person who has sought to compete in girls’ sports in West Virginia.
Pepper-Jackson has progressed from a back-of-the-pack cross-country runner in middle school to a statewide third-place finish in the discus in just her first year of high school.
Prominent women in sports have weighed in on both sides. Tennis champion Martina Navratilova, swimmers Summer Sanders and Donna de Varona and beach volleyball player Kerri Walsh-Jennings are supporting the state bans. Soccer stars Megan Rapinoe and Becky Sauerbrunn and basketball players Sue Bird and Breanna Stewart back the transgender athletes.
The high-court arguments are expected to focus on whether the sports bans violate the Constitution or the landmark federal law known as Title IX, which prohibits sex discrimination in education.
In 2020, the Supreme Court ruled LGBTQ people are protected by a landmark federal civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in the workplace, finding that “sex plays an unmistakable role” in employers’ decisions to punish transgender people for traits and behavior they otherwise tolerate.
But last year, the six conservative justices on the nine-member court declined to apply the same sort of analysis when they upheld state bans on gender-affirming care for transgender minors.
The states supporting the prohibitions on transgender athletes argue there is no reason to extend the ruling barring workplace discrimination to Title IX, which dramatically increased opportunities for girls and women in school sports.
Lawyers for Pepper-Jackson argue that the law protects people like their client from discrimination. They are asking for a ruling that would apply to the unique circumstances of her early transition. In Hecox’s case, her lawyers want the court to dismiss the case because she has forsworn trying to play on women’s teams.
Despite the small numbers of transgender athletes, the issue has taken on outsize importance. The NCAA and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committees banned transgender women from women’s sports after Trump, a Republican, signed an executive order aimed at barring their participation.
The public generally is supportive of the limits. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in October 2025 found that about 6 in 10 U.S. adults “strongly” or “somewhat” favored requiring transgender children and teenagers to only compete on sports teams that match the sex they were assigned at birth, not the gender they identify with, while about 2 in 10 were “strongly” or “somewhat” opposed and about one-quarter did not have an opinion.
About 2.1 million adults, or 0.8%, and 724,000 people age 13 to 17, or 3.3%, identify as transgender in the U.S., according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law.

Scholarships can be a great way to fund your future. It’s worth it to review VSAC’s Scholarships & Forgivable Loans 2026–2027 booklet—so you don’t miss out on the chance to receive free money. 
If you’re a high school senior or a returning college or training student, now is the time to apply for any of the 150+ VSAC-administered scholarships and forgivable loans. The VSAC scholarships booklet contains information about funding opportunities available whether you continue your education in Vermont or somewhere else. Application materials are due February 11.
VSAC-administered scholarships are managed by VSAC on behalf of other organizations. Scholarships—like grants—are financial aid that you don’t need to pay back. Scholarships are offered by an array of groups, organizations, and even individuals. They’re offered for all kinds of achievements—and to a wide range of students. 
They’re also usually competitive, with eligible applicants vying for a limited number of awards—but Vermont’s smaller communities may offer you a higher chance of winning a scholarship than if you were competing nationwide. 
What you’ll find inside: scholarships and forgivable loans 
VSAC’s 2026-27 scholarship booklet includes information on over 150 scholarships, interest-free forgivable loans administered by VSAC, and an additional 41 scholarships run by outside organizations. Here’s a peek at what’s inside.
Some scholarships offer one-time awards, while others are renewable, meaning the student can receive additional financial awards for each subsequent year of study. The annual award amounts generally range from $500 to $6,500, though there are some exceptions. In addition to achieving extraordinary academic and community service goals, many scholarship applicants are motivated to grow into careers that will help others—paying it forward with a lifetime goal that spans generations.
The scholarships booklet also covers VSAC’s workforce development funding, which are forgivable loan programs available for students studying in some trades, or to be a nurse, nurse faculty, or psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner. These forgivable loan programs are structured as interest-free loans, but with a big difference: complete your program or service and work in Vermont in your field for a set amount of time, and your loan is fully forgiven. No repayment. No interest. Just the support to launch your future.  
 In addition, the Vermont National Guard Tuition Benefit Program pays for some or all the tuition for a student who enrolls in Guard service while in school.  
How to find the right VSAC scholarships for you—and what to expect next
Even if you’ve used VSAC’s scholarship booklet in prior years, you may want to take note of the VSAC-administered scholarships and loan programs that would be a good fit for you now.
Here’s a quick trick: Use Control + F (for Windows) or Command + F (for Mac) on the Scholarships Booklet PDF to search for keywords that apply to you.

Scholarships for a broad variety of fields of study, different interests, and financial circumstances
There are scholarship opportunities for a wide range of academic interests. Some of the more common fields include:

Business
Technical industries
Public safety
Agriculture
Health care
Education

Here are a few of the new scholarships designed for students pursuing specific interests:

The Michael E Bingham Vocational Scholarship was established by “Vermont Mike,” who had an exciting career that began in the Peace Corps and included seismic oil exploration and land surveying. The Bingham Scholarship offers $1000 to a student who lives in Addison County and wants to pursue a career in the trades.
The Alex Williams Culinary Scholarship was established to honor the memory of Alex Williams and his passion for cooking. Alex was a 2020 graduate of the culinary arts program at the Central Vermont Career Center. Alex was a free-spirit, avid “foodie,” and emerging chef who always aspired to help others. The Alex Williams Culinary Scholarship offers one or more students who are seeking a degree or certification in the culinary arts up to $1000 annually. 
The Brian R. Searles Memorial Scholarship was established to honor Essex High School alumni Brian R. Searles who died in 2024. Brian was a recognized role model epitomizing what it means to be a true public servant. He was a talented and humble leader who spent 40+ years serving the State of Vermont in many different positions. The Brian R. Searles Memorial Scholarship provides $1000 to a current high school senior graduating from a Vermont high school who has shown a commitment to public service, leadership qualities, academic achievement, strong work ethic, and financial need.

There may even be specific scholarships for your town, county, or high school. Here are a few scholarships that benefit students living in particular communities:
• The Newbury Alumni Memorial Scholarship was established in honor of all Newbury High School alumni, and supports a graduate from Oxbow High School who is pursuing college after high school.  
• The Early Childhood Educators Scholarship supports students who have a commitment to the education of young children, who reside in Chittenden, Franklin, Grand Isle or Lamoille County.
Also check for scholarships to help members of traditionally disadvantaged groups. For example, students who are single parents may want to check out the Bernice Murray Scholarship, which covers up to $4,000 in child-care expenses for single parents who continue their education.
There are many choices, all directed by the donors to honor the legacy of someone important to them, a cause or passion, or a business or organization. If you’re interested in funding your own scholarship, let’s connect!

Sarah Stevens, R-Surry. (Photo: NCGA video stream)An investigation by the North Carolina State Board of Elections found that two contributions by lobbyists to Rep. Sarah Stevens’ state Supreme Court campaign were illegal, but said they did not represent an “intentional violation.”
The board issued warning letters to the Stevens campaign as well as registered lobbyists Harold Brubaker and Andy Munn, who donated $6,800 and $1,500, respectively, according to a Jan. 9 notice obtained by NC Newsline. Those contributions have since been returned.
Under North Carolina law, it is illegal for lobbyists to donate to the campaigns of sitting state legislators. The unlawful donations were first reported by NC Newsline in August. Brubaker, a former North Carolina House speaker, claimed in a call with NC Newsline last year that the donation was “legal,” while Stevens argued  it was not inappropriate because “he gave to me as a judicial candidate.”
Stevens, a Surry County Republican, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the findings by the board of elections.
Bob Hall, a campaign finance watchdog who previously served as executive director of Democracy North Carolina, filed the initial complaint over the donations in August. He said he believes the Stevens campaign was trying to “capitalize on what they thought was a loophole in state law.”
“It’s good the state board has educated and warned all the parties involved,” Hall said. “But it is troubling that a legislator who chairs the House Election Law Committee and who seeks a seat on the Supreme Court did not understand the plain language of these statutes.”

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas schools that opt to use a gun detection software program supported by the attorney general could receive a cut of $10 million from the state.
Attorney General Kris Kobach promoted an artificial intelligence-driven, unconcealed firearm detection and situational awareness software that can be applied to existing security cameras. He announced Monday that his office is accepting applications to integrate the program into K-12 public schools.
AI gun detection software purports to halt and prevent gun violence. Its implementation in schools has grown in popularity as technology has advanced and school shootings and mass shootings have increased in frequency.
The attorney general uses a product from the Pennsylvania-based company ZeroEyes, which sent lobbyists to the Kansas Legislature in 2024 to push for a contract with schools. The technology can analyze more than 36,000 images per second from security camera video feeds, according to the company’s website.
If the software identifies a gun in school, images are immediately shared with the ZeroEyes Operations Center, an in-house hub staffed 24/7 by military and law enforcement veterans, according to ZeroEyes. The company claims security teams and law enforcement can be notified of a threat as quickly as three to five seconds from the point the software detects a firearm. Operation center staff review software images and determine whether a threat is valid. They can then send alerts equipped with information such as a description, gun type and last known location.
The chief strategy officer for ZeroEyes, Kieran Carroll, said in 2024 that installing the software in 1,300 school buildings in Kansas and enabling 24-hour surveillance of two dozen cameras per school would cost the state $8.5 million annually. That same year, Gov. Laura Kelly line-item vetoed a budget measure that allocated $5 million to a program that favored ZeroEyes. The governor called it “a no-bid contract,” criticizing the lack of consideration for other companies.
A $10 million earmark made it through the Legislature in 2025, and in November, the Legislature’s special budget committee said the state was considering three bidders for a gun-detection software contract. ZeroEyes beat out companies based in Wichita and Springfield, Missouri.
Funding will be dispersed equally across Kansas’ four congressional districts, and grants are available on a first-come, first-served basis, according to the Attorney General’s Office.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA010107-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-13 09:57:41.387950

(Photo by Peter Griffith/NASA)The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected the state of Alaska’s latest attempt to alter Alaska’s decades-old system of subsistence fishing management.
In a one-sentence order Monday, the court said it will not review a decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled in August that Alaska cannot manage fishing on a stretch of the Kuskokwim River that flows through the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge.
If the Supreme Court had taken up the case, it could have redefined Alaska’s unique system of hunting and fishing management, which allows the federal government to restrict subsistence hunting and fishing on federal land to rural Alaskans. The state is forbidden by the Alaska Constitution from offering the same preference.
Alaska Native organizations, including the Alaska Federation of Natives, praised the court’s decision, but the commissioner of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game said by email that it would continue to work with the federal government on the issue.
Monday’s Supreme Court decision ends a five-year dispute that began during a salmon shortage on the Kuskokwim River in 2021. The state of Alaska issued orders to open fishing that contradicted federal fisheries managers’ decision to keep it closed.
Salmon fishing is a critical aspect of Alaska Native culture, tradition and survival. Salmon returns have plummeted in recent years, straining managers who must balance the wants and needs of Alaskans and Yukoners pursuing the same fish.
On the Kuskokwim, the state claimed it was simply interpreting a U.S. Supreme Court ruling from 2019, but the federal government disagreed with the state’s interpretation and sued the following year.
Alaska Native groups sided with the federal government, and Alaska District Court Judge Sharon Gleason ruled in favor of the federal government in 2024. 
The state appealed to the 9th Circuit, which again ruled in favor of the federal government. That prompted the state to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
The Kuskokwim River Intertribal Fish Commission was one of the lead groups standing with the federal government. 
“Our Fish Commission is very pleased with this historic victory in favor of the people of the Kuskokwim River. The victory not only upholds rural subsistence rights in Alaska, but upholds the participation of local people, elected by the Tribes, in the co-management of Kuskokwim salmon,” said the group’s chair, Martin Andrew, in a written statement.
Attorney Erin Dougherty Lynch worked on the case for the Native American Rights Fund, which represented the Association of Village Council Presidents.
By phone, she noted that even though this case is over, the Bureau of Land Management is considering changes to the subsistence program. 
“What the state is seeking to accomplish now is basically the same thing through administrative processes. They’re definitely still going after subsistence. This won’t be the end, unfortunately, of their efforts to restrict subsistence,” she said.
Safari Club International, which petitioned BLM for regulatory changes, backed the state in the appeal that was rejected Monday.
In a written statement after Monday’s decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, the group said it believes the federal government “has increasingly superseded Alaska’s wildlife authority” and that the state and federal government should continue to work on the issue.
By email, Alaska Department of Fish and Game Commissioner Doug Vincent-Lang offered a similar comment and referred to the 1980 compromises between state and federal interests in the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. 
“We will respect the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court to not address the legal issues regarding fish and game management authorities over navigable waters belonging to the State of Alaska,” he said. “This said, we will continue to work with the Secretaries of Interior and Agriculture to ensure the rights Alaska was given under its statehood compact and envisioned under ANILCA are safeguarded.”

As Michiganders set their intentions for 2026, the state Legislature is setting its intention for the upcoming year by finalizing budget priorities for the 2027 fiscal year, which informally kicks off with the Census Revenue Estimating Conference (CREC) on Friday, Jan. 16. 
One priority lawmakers should include in the upcoming budget is adopting the framework for funding special education services detailed in the Michigan Special Education Finance Reform Blueprint. This legislative report, delivered in October 2025, describes longstanding flaws with our current reimbursement model for supporting students receiving special education services, and then it provides a solution: a weighted funding model tied to student need.
Today, nearly 16% of students in Michigan receive special education services, and the proportion of students who qualify for these services continues to grow. This increase underscores a pressing need for our funding system to modernize in response to the changing student population. Currently, most funding for special education services comes from the state in the form of a reimbursement for 28.6% of district expenditures. Local funds contribute to the rest of costs, but contributions vary widely by Intermediate School District (ISD). Additionally, most districts are forced to use general fund dollars to cover special education costs, creating budget constraints. The result is inequity that shows up directly in classrooms. 
The Blueprint highlights this inequity by pointing to two counties with similar student populations, but due to tax wealth, one county can spend $3,500 more per student on special education services. Essentially, our system has created a reality where two students with identical characteristics (academic achievement, family life, diagnosis, etc.) are receiving drastically different services simply because of the district they are assigned. This gap translates into fewer interventions, more students per teacher, and fewer supports for students who need them most. 
The Blueprint’s model solves these problems by tying special education funding to the needs of a particular student. The new model scraps the reimbursement format and provides each special education student with the foundation allowance (currently set at $10,050) and an additional percentage of the foundation allowance, as determined by their diagnosis. The change means that funding is tied to student needs, not ZIP codes.
Although it has been nearly a decade since I was a classroom teacher, the feeling of “if only” has not faded.
If only I could be in two places at once…
If only there were someone to provide the reading interventions…
If only we funded all of our students according to their unique needs…
For too long, these have been common realities in Michigan classrooms, but they no longer need to be hypothetical wishes for our educators.
​The Blueprint was developed by school finance experts and informed by hundreds of stakeholders across the state. Adequate and equitable funding will allow teachers to focus on teaching and will create classrooms where diverse needs are met with appropriate supports.
Importantly, adopting the Blueprint will not only improve outcomes for students receiving special education services; it will improve the educational experience for everyone. By strengthening staffing, reducing strain on general education classrooms, and stabilizing district budgets, the Blueprint will improve learning conditions for all Michigan students.
Now, at the start of a new year, lawmakers must take decisive action by adopting the Blueprint’s weighted funding model and redefining special education funding in Michigan. As we make our resolutions for the year ahead, let this be one we keep: a commitment to equitable, effective education funding that empowers every Michigan student to thrive.

(Photo by Jared Strong/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Farm Bureau is scheduled to host meetings across Iowa to help farmers navigate challenges like tighter margins, high interest rates and market uncertainty as they financially prepare for 2026. 
The meetings will examine some of the current drivers in the markets and discuss crop insurance considerations, risk management tools and transition planning for farmers. 
Iowa Farm Bureau Farmer Education Program Manager Zach Brummer said the organization wants farmers to have a “relevant look” at how these challenges affect profitability. 
“Farmers are making decisions in an environment with a lot more unknowns than we’ve seen in recent years,” Brummer said in a news release. 
Brummer said the series will give farmers steps they can take now to manage risks in 2026 as rising input costs, tariff volatility and “global uncertainty” are expected to persist as challenges for farmers.

An early projection of net farm income predicted declines of more than 20% for farmers in 2026 compared to 2025. A survey of agricultural economists from December shows economists rate row crop sectors with overall poor financial health and 46% of agricultural economists expect the ag economy to stay the same in 2026 as it was in 2025. Fifteen percent of surveyed economists predict ag economy conditions will get worse over the next 12 months. 
A contributing factor, as noted in the release from Iowa Farm Bureau about the event series, is ongoing uncertainty with foreign trade partners. 
China, the largest global purchaser of soybeans, did not purchase from the U.S. early in the season due to ongoing tariff conflicts with the U.S. and Chinese goods. While President Donald Trump secured a deal with China in October to purchase U.S. soybeans, farm groups have said they still need expanded markets — domestically and in other countries — to be profitable.
The federal government announced in December it would send $12 billion in one-time payments to farmers to help alleviate some of the financial strain farmers have suffered from market disruptions. The farm payments are expected to reach farmers by the end of February.
The Farm Bureau meetings will take place between Feb. 16 and Feb. 25 at six locations across the state. Economists, financial service consultants and crop consultants with Iowa Farm Bureau will be at the events, along with representatives from several local banks.
The events are free to Iowa Farm Bureau members, who can contact Ashley Lennon to register. 
Event schedule: 

Northwest Iowa Community College in Sheldon, Feb. 16 from 7:45 to 10:45 a.m.
Wall Lake Community Center in Wall Lake,  Feb. 16 from 12:45–3:45 p.m.

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)There is much about vaccines in the news these days. A great deal of it is thoroughly confusing. I would like to add a few comments — and hopefully not make a confusing situation worse.
I will say upfront  that I believe vaccines have provided a vitally important  contribution — perhaps the most important contribution — to the health of our population, especially the health of children.  Early in my career I saw children die or be left with lifelong disability from diseases that, for all practical purposes, are no longer a threat because of the availability of vaccines. Does that mean that vaccines are free of risks or that the threat of infectious disease has disappeared? Of course not. However, we must not allow anxiety resulting from some new questions to distract us from the fundamental importance of vaccines in dealing with the threat of infectious disease.
Among current infection threats, pertussis (whooping cough), hepatitis B and measles are all diseases of concern. Measles has probably gotten the most attention. The measles vaccine has been available for many years. It has been combined with vaccines for mumps and rubella (German measles) to produce the MMR shot. Widespread use of MMR has been highly successful, and in the year 2000, the elimination of measles in the U.S. was recognized by the World Health Organization. Until recently, the only outbreaks of measles in the U.S. resulted from cases brought in from other countries.










Because vaccine-preventable diseases are now rarely seen, the general public has largely lost appreciation for how dangerous these infections can be.


Now, however, questions have been raised about the safety of this vaccine, particularly questioning a possible link to autism. There has been a considerable increase in the diagnosis of autism. To a large degree, however,  this is due to a better understanding of the condition and expansion of the criteria for diagnosis.
No authentic scientific study has shown a link between vaccines and autism. In fact, over the last 25 years, more than 40 studies have looked for a link between vaccines and autism and have failed to demonstrate a connection. The publication which originally claimed a link between vaccines and autism was eventually shown to be based on falsified data. The study was retracted by the medical journal that published it, and the physician author had his medical license revoked.
Be that as it may, the questions raised have caused significant concerns, especially on the part of parents. As a result, the rate of measles immunization has declined significantly. That decline has led to multiple locally originated outbreaks. In 2025 in the U.S., there were more than 2,000 documented cases spread over 42 states. These have resulted in many hospitalizations with complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis. Three deaths were attributed to measles. These are the first deaths from measles in more than a decade. Virtually all of the complications have occurred in unvaccinated patients.
Measles is one of the most contagious infections known. Even casual contact with an infected person can result in transmitting the infection.  To make it even more complicated, infected individuals may spread the virus even before they develop symptoms.

Required immunizations for school attendance and for some employment have created controversy. The issue is complicated and contentious. I certainly accept, and support, the concept of individual freedom and responsibility regarding health care decisions. Problems arise, however, when those decisions directly impact the health and safety of other people.
To a large extent, I believe current vaccines are victims of their own success. Because vaccine-preventable diseases are now rarely seen, the general public has largely lost appreciation for how dangerous these infections can be. I fear the threat of infection is not taken as seriously as it once was, or as seriously as it should be.
We need to continually work to respect the right of individuals to control their own decisions. At the same time, we must do all we can to see that our society is protected from these major emerging public health threats. It is a major challenge.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/vaccinemeasles-1024x7181765533560-1-1024x1024.jpg,,,2026-01-13 09:11:44.284137

From CalMatters politics reporter Maya C. Miller:
State lawmakers are already taking legislative steps to “Trump-proof” California’s elections, starting with a bill designed to keep President Donald Trump off of California’s ballot in 2028.
The bill from Sen. Tom Umberg, a Santa Ana Democrat and chairperson of the Senate Judiciary Committee, would make it illegal for the California Secretary of State to place on the ballot any candidate for president or vice president who does not meet the constitutional requirements of those offices. 
The Constitution’s 22nd Amendment already states that no individual can hold the presidency for more than two terms.
Senate Bill 46 would take that one step further and require any candidate to affirm under oath, and penalty of perjury, that they are indeed constitutionally qualified for the ballot. An elector could challenge the qualifications of a candidate by petitioning the Superior Court of Sacramento.
“Apparently there’s some cockamamie scheme that exists in the mind of the president, and Alan Dershowitz, that he can run for a third term,” Umberg said, referring to the Harvard scholar and former Trump legal advisor who suggested the 22nd Amendment did not provide an airtight ban on a third Trump term. “It’s a belt and suspenders approach to make sure that his delusion doesn’t become reality.”
Umberg said that although 2028 is still years away, it was important to get the ball rolling early so other states could follow California’s example. Plus, 2026 is Umberg’s final year in the Senate. 

Umberg: “I have a sell-by date on my head, so that’s important for me, personally, to leave this as part of my legacy.”

SB 46 will be heard in the Senate elections committee this morning.

Turning 80 is typically a big milestone for most people, but in California it could also include one more perk: Getting out of jury duty for good.
The Assembly’s judiciary committee is expected today to weigh in on a bill that would enable Californians ages 80 and older to opt-out of jury service permanently without needing a note from a health care provider. Seniors who still want to be considered for jury duty could still do so.
There is no current age exemption for jury service, though residents 70 years and older can be excused due to a medical condition without a doctor’s note. There is a chance, however, that they must seek exemption repeatedly if they’re selected for service multiple times after they turn 70. 
The bill is supported by the California Senior Legislature, an advocacy organization for senior citizens, and has no formal opposition as of date. Assemblymember Patrick Ahrens, a Cupertino Democrat who introduced the bill, argues that continuously seeking exemption under current law can be disruptive and puts significant stress on older individuals.

Ahrens, in an interview with CalMatters: “Older individuals may have chronic health conditions, physical limitations or lack of technical skills. … (But) we can make the lives of older Californians easier while maintaining a responsible, diverse and just jury selection process.”




Former Dem, current GOP members kicks off campaign

Former state Senate Majority Leader Gloria Romero kicked off her campaign for lieutenant governor Monday, unveiling her bid as a Republican candidate for the state’s second-highest office.
Romero was first elected as a Democrat to the Assembly in 1998 before serving in the California senate from 2001 to 2009 representing east Los Angeles. During her time in the Legislature, she became the state’s first female Senate Majority Leader and authored a controversial “parent trigger” law that enables parents to change a school’s administration if the school performs poorly.
After leaving office, Romero left the Democratic party and joined the GOP, endorsing a Republican candidate in the 2021 gubernatorial recall election and Trump in 2024. When she switched in 2024, Romero said her biggest gripe against Democrats was over “school choice, education freedom and the right to have quality schools for all,” reports Newsweek.
In her campaign video, Romero sought to reach voters of both parties.

Romero: “Maybe you’ve never voted for a Republican before, and maybe you don’t agree on all the issues. That’s okay. But we need to hold Sacramento Democrats accountable for their failures on homelessness, affordability, crime, education and housing. I’m going to hold their feet to the fire.”

Romero joins a race that includes Josh Fryday, California Chief Service Officer under Gov. Gavin Newsom, State Treasurer Fiona Ma and former Stockton Mayor Michael Tubbs.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2026-01-13 13:47:08+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,"Keolis was once on thin ice over commuter rail concerns. Now, it’s a finalist for another lucrative MBTA contract.",Chris Lisinski,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/transportation/keolis-was-once-on-thin-ice-over-commuter-rail-concerns-now-its-a-finalist-for-another-lucrative-mbta-contract/,"Better on-time performance and major ridership milestones have boosted the outlook for commuter rail operator Keolis, which early in its tenure faced major scrutiny from Beacon Hill.","POLITICIANS AND BUREAUCRATS are usually circumspect when it comes to the future prospects of state contractors, especially when half a decade or more remains on an existing agreement.
That made it striking when then-Transportation Secretary Stephanie Pollack suggested in 2017 that Keolis, the French company in charge of running the MBTA’s sprawling commuter rail network, though not even halfway through an eight-year contract, was unlikely to earn an extension if the Baker administration had its way.
A few years later, though, the T changed course and kept Keolis in place. Then officials extended the contract again. And now, as the MBTA and the Healey administration prepare to weigh bids for the next lucrative, multiyear commuter rail operation contract, Keolis is still in the mix, tapped last month as one of three finalists in a joint bid with fellow French rail company Alstom.
It’s been a striking turnaround in reputation for a company whose first year in the role was marred by a disastrous winter and scrutiny over its management capabilities. And there may be a fairly straightforward explanation for it.
“Over time, they’ve become a much more competent operator,” said Pete Wilson, senior policy director at the advocacy group Transportation for Massachusetts. “Trains seem to be more on-time, the trains are clean when you ride them, you get a pretty good amount of communication from the engineers and conductors if something has gone awry.”
Former governor Deval Patrick’s administration picked Keolis in 2014 for an eight-year, roughly $2.7 billion contract. The deal, like others before it, outsources operations and management of the dozen commuter rail lines that collectively transport tens of millions of riders per year, though the T itself owns the trains and the tracks.
A good deal of the commuter rail’s dismal performance in the first year was, arguably, outside Keolis’s control. One storm after another slammed into the region in 2015, dumping a record 110 inches of snow that upended virtually every mode of travel.
It was also a different, pre-pandemic era. Most employees stranded by canceled trains and buses wound up missing work altogether, unable to pivot to a remote alternative.
“In 2015, there was no remote work. Most of us had never been on Zoom,” Pollack, who served as transportation secretary from 2015 to 2021, told CommonWealth Beacon. “If you didn’t get to work, you didn’t work. It wasn’t like you went home and turned on the computer.”
But some of Keolis’s issues lingered after the snow and ice melted. Insiders said Keolis in its first few years struggled with staffing, at times failing to have enough operators on the clock to run the full schedule of service laid out in the contract. Fare collection — before the installation of fare gates at North Station and South Station — was at times haphazard.
Plus, too many trains arrived late. The contract called for at least 92 percent of trips get to their final destination within five minutes of the scheduled time. Keolis missed that target by nearly 10 percentage points in its first, winter-obliterated year, and its on-time performance remained stuck below 90 percent from 2016 through 2019, according to MBTA data.
Beacon Hill did not hide its displeasure. Lawmakers warned of “management concerns” unrelated to the winter issues; in early 2017, Pollack publicly signaled that the Baker administration’s preferred approach would be to let the Keolis contract expire and go back to the market rather than trigger available extensions.
Brian Kane, executive director of the MBTA Advisory Board watchdog group, believes Pollack’s skepticism pushed Keolis bosses into action.

“Stephanie Pollack, I think quite frankly, scared Keolis headquarters. That caused them to send more folks and invest more money into this,” said Kane, who was part of the massive selection team that picked Keolis in 2014. “The last thing they wanted for their global reputation was to lose this deal, so I think in the short term, they staffed up.”
After that, officials recall, the relationship — and the T’s satisfaction with Keolis — improved. The French operator seemed to communicate more with MBTA bosses, and addressed some of the staffing shortages that had been causing headaches.
Both parties agreed in 2017 to share revenues from boosted fare collections. Before that, all of the money from paying riders went to the T; the deal allowed Keolis to earn a share for itself if fare revenue increased, incentivizing the operator to boost its fare collection efforts.
The outlook was on the upswing when an inflection point arrived that no one expected: the COVID-19 pandemic.
At the time, Keolis was nearly six years into the original eight-year contract. Because operating the commuter rail network is such an enormous undertaking, state officials expected to need 18 to 24 months of lead time to prepare for another round of bidding.
Consensus quickly grew that, with the world upside-down in the early months of the public health crisis, the safest approach was to keep Keolis around, despite the Baker administration’s prior skepticism.
“Would you have tested the market in June of 2020?” said Pollack, who is now a senior fellow at MIT’s Mobility Initiative. “We don’t know when lockdown is ending, we don’t know when people are going back to work.”
The MBTA’s oversight board voted unanimously in 2020 to extend Keolis for up to four years beyond its original contract expiration in 2022. The T awarded another one-year contract extension in 2024, keeping the French operator locked in through June 2027.
Since that early-pandemic decision, the commuter rail has continued to improve. From 2020 through mid-2024, Keolis hit or surpassed the target on-time performance rate.
Meanwhile, ridership has rebounded more on the commuter rail than on any of the T’s four major subway lines or its buses, at times even recording more monthly trips than in February 2020, the last full month before the pandemic hit.
The commuter rail network has been a bright spot nationally, too. A report from the federal Government Accountability Office published in May examined the ridership changes at 31 commuter rail networks across the country from the second half of 2019 to the second half of 2024.
The MBTA commuter rail ranked sixth overall in bringing back passengers. All five networks that did better — TEXRail in Texas, SMART in California, MetroRail in Texas, Tri-Rail in Florida, and the Downeaster in New England — each transported only a fraction as many riders as did the T’s commuter rail.
Experts said credit should be shared between Keolis and the MBTA itself, which embraced major schedule changes to run less service at traditional peak hours and more service in the middle of weekdays or on weekends. Trips now are more predictable, with a so-called “clock face” schedule offering service in the same window every hour (think 6:15 p.m. and 7:15 p.m., rather than 6:23 p.m. and 7:31 p.m.).
That seems to be a better fit for a post-pandemic work habits, in which many employees head into offices for only part of the day a few times per week.
Since 2018, the commuter rail has also offered a $10 weekend pass that proved even more popular after the pandemic, contributing to growing ridership.
“No one side is getting all the credit here,” said Janet Cheung, regional rail lead for advocacy group TransitMatters, who said the T and Keolis both deserve praise.
Pollack thinks the decision to extend Keolis opened the door to those improvements.
“If the [MBTA board] and Keolis and the T had not agreed to the four-year extension in those early months, and given COVID time to run its course, and time for the regional rail thinking to advance, and time for at least some people to start to come back to the places that commuter rail runs, commuter rail wouldn’t have the ridership it has in 2025,” she said.
In a statement to CommonWealth Beacon, Keolis North America CEO Brad Thomas touted improved on-time performance in the past five years, more frequent service during the day, and better fare collection as markers of success.
“Our passengers have a safer, more frequent, and more reliable service than ever before, while momentum toward the MBTA’s vision for regional rail has never been greater,” Thomas said. “Keolis remains fully committed to realizing that vision.”
The company is not without problems today. Last spring, Keolis canceled or delayed trains on the new South Coast Rail expansion soon after it opened due to staffing shortages, prompting the T to issue fines. A report from state Auditor Diana DiZoglio’s office last year also found the T failed to assess more than $3.3 million in performance-based penalties against Keolis.
But Keolis has at least fared well enough to earn a spot on the shortlist for the next long-term contract.
MBTA officials last month named three “teams” that will be able to vie for operation of the commuter rail starting in July 2027: the joint group of Keolis and Alstom, a consortium known as Mass Regional Rail, and another consortium known as Transdev North America.
Leaders of the transit agency plan to talk with those three finalists over much of the coming year about what they want the next stretch of commuter rail improvements to look like. Bids will be due in the fall, and the T is likely to pick a winner by the end of the year.
Each bidder has a French connection: RATP Développement S.A. is part of the Mass Regional Rail team, and Transdev’s parent company is based in France.
Mass Regional Rail also features a noteworthy familiar face. One of its members, Alternate Concepts Inc., was founded by former MBTA general manager Jim O’Leary, who previously chaired the Massachusetts Bay Commuter Railroad — which was replaced by Keolis as commuter rail operator in 2014, prompting a legal challenge.
Over the past decade, the MBTA has steadily increased its spending on commuter rail. In fiscal year 2015, the first with Keolis at the helm, the agency budgeted about $397 million for what it calls “total purchased commuter rail service.” The T’s current operating budget for fiscal 2026 allocates $599 million for that line item.
Much of the increase is a result of rising fuel prices. Other cost drivers have emerged over the decade, too, like the launch of service on the South Coast Rail extension, more frequent weekend service across the network, and new anti-collision technology.
Most experts agree the next commuter rail contract will be pricey. Kane expects it will surpass $10 billion, and so he wants lawmakers to take a more active role.
“This contract is too important and too big to be left to the MBTA procurement department alone to manage,” he said. “There need to be legislative oversight hearings of this entire process — not because anyone’s done anything wrong, I want to be very clear. It just is too big that it needs that next level of political scrutiny to make sure that the taxpayers of Massachusetts are getting a good deal.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/drawbridge1-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C647&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-13 08:58:03.556720

Chad Hanson
Chad Hanson, based in the southern Sierra Nevada mountains, is a wildfire scientist with the John Muir Project.


One year ago, in early January, the Eaton and Palisades fires devastated the communities of Altadena and Pacific Palisades. Driven by extremely dry, warm and powerful winds, the fires destroyed more than 10,000 homes and claimed at least 31 lives. 
How can we make sure it doesn’t happen again?
The good news is, science has provided a clear answer: The only effective way to protect homes and lives from wildfires is to implement direct measures to create fire-safe communities — including home hardening, defensible space pruning next to homes and businesses, and evacuation planning and assistance. 
This community-based approach is highly successful in saving towns from firestorms. 
Importantly, the evidence also indicates that vegetation removal and management beyond 100 feet from homes and other structures provide no additional safety benefit.
More bad news: State and federal politicians of both parties are supporting the wrong things.
At the state level, only 2% of all wildland fire funding is being allocated to the proven fire-safe community measures, while the other 98% is being spent ineffectively, mostly on activities in wildlands, such as logging and removal of chaparral, distant from homes.
And at the federal level, there are no requirements that any wildland fire funds be spent on fire-safe community measures. The Infrastructure Act of 2021 includes hollow language about community wildfire protection but focuses on logging in the “wildland urban interface.” 
The Act not only ignores many at-risk communities that are nowhere near forests — such as Altadena and Pacific Palisades — but it also defines the wildland urban interface so broadly that it allows backcountry logging on public lands, miles from the nearest home.
Even after the profound losses of homes and lives in the Eaton and Palisades fires, Congress’ response so far has been the so-called “Fix Our Forests Act,” proposed legislation currently in the Senate that would override environmental laws to expedite taxpayer-subsidized, backcountry logging of mature trees and clearcutting on public lands — in the name of wildfire management. 
More than 100 environmental groups strongly oppose it. Alarmingly and ironically, the act would eliminate the very environmental analysis that would inform land managers about whether a particular logging or chaparral removal project would worsen wildfires and increase threats to nearby communities.
This is not merely an academic concern. Many of the U.S. Forest Service’s own scientists are sounding the alarm, as evidence increasingly indicates “thinning” and other logging activities erode the natural windbreak that denser forests have, making fires spread much faster and more intensely. 
This means fires can reach towns more rapidly, giving people less time to safely evacuate and first responders less time to arrive and assist. 
Similarly, abundant science indicates that removal of chaparral — native shrub habitat— in the name of curbing wildfires tends to convert landscapes into far more combustible, invasive grasslands, which can carry flames more quickly toward nearby houses and businesses in southern California. 
As hundreds of scientists have warned, recent wildfires have raced through large areas of “thinned” forests and “fuelbreaks,” burning down entire communities.
The truth is, most people do not have the knowledge or resources to make their homes and communities fire-safe. Many people need assistance. Elected officials — Democrats and Republicans — must change course. Instead of advancing legislation that pleases logging industry campaign contributors, they should prioritize measures that directly help create fire-safe communities. Otherwise, the devastation of January 2025 is all but guaranteed to recur.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/011025_LA-Wildfires_JH_34.jpg?fit=1024%2C732&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-13 08:58:03.556720

Robert Howell
Robert Howell, a Republican running for Insurance Commissioner, is president of Exatron, a cybersecurity equipment manufacturer in Silicon Valley. 


With the first anniversary of the devastating Southern California wildfires approaching, CalMatters asked candidates for the 2026 state Insurance Commissioner race to share thoughts on what the state can do to help victims and stabilize insurers. This is the fifth response. Read the other candidate responses here, here, here and here.
California’s insurance system is not working for regular people. Homeowners are losing coverage, premiums keep rising and the state’s safety net is under strain.
This did not happen overnight. It is the outcome of years of weak oversight and a government that has been too willing to look the other way. 
The first problem is accountability. Insurers are allowed to pick and choose how they participate in California’s market. They sell auto insurance and other profitable products, then walk away from homeowners insurance when risk increases. 
That is not a balanced system. If companies want to do business in California, they should share responsibility for essential coverage that protects people’s homes. 
One reform worth pursuing is tying homeowners insurance participation to broader market access. If an insurer operates in a region and sells other lines of insurance, it should also be required to offer homeowners coverage there, subject to reasonable standards. Allowing companies to profit from California while abandoning homeowners pushes risk onto families and onto the state. 
Stronger enforcement around cancellations and nonrenewals is also critical. Entire neighborhoods are being dropped with little explanation and little notice. Families who have paid premiums for years are left scrambling through no fault of their own. 
That is not market forces at work. It is regulatory failure. Insurers should be required to explain large-scale withdrawals, and homeowners who invest in mitigation and fire hardening should see those efforts count. 
The second problem is cost. Californians are paying more and getting less. Premiums are rising, deductibles are higher and coverage keeps shrinking. Too often, these increases are approved without explanations that consumers can understand. 
That is why California needs an Insurance Payers Bill of Rights. Homeowners deserve enforceable protections. They should know why rates are going up, what they are paying for and what policy changes are being made. They should receive meaningful notice before cancellations or reductions in coverage, along with a real appeals process.
Insurance should not be a black box.
Price increases do not always appear as higher premiums. Insurers shift costs through exclusions, higher deductibles and fine print that quietly reduces protection. Those changes deserve the same scrutiny as formal rate hikes. If insurers cannot justify them clearly and in plain language, they should not be approved. 
Competition matters too. A market with fewer insurers and fewer choices puts consumers at a disadvantage. California should encourage responsible new entrants and create a predictable regulatory environment. Competition alone is not enough, but paired with strong oversight and consumer rights, it helps keep prices in check. 
We also need to be honest about the California FAIR Plan. FAIR was never meant to be the primary insurer for large parts of the state. Today, it faces exposure in the tens of billions of dollars. There is no realistic way to stabilize FAIR while it continues absorbing risk the private market is allowed to shed. 
If FAIR runs into serious trouble, the state will pay one way or another. That means homeowners and taxpayers. FAIR can only function as intended if the private market is restored and insurers are held accountable. 
This crisis will not be solved by putting another insurance insider in charge. Californians need an Insurance Commissioner who understands what it is like to be on the receiving end of a cancellation notice or a massive premium increase. The job is to stand up for consumers and restore a system that works for the people it was meant to serve.

Mississippi’s former welfare director and his former professional wrestler buddy sometimes discussed how their ideas – funded with millions of federal public safety-net funds – might help the lives of others. 
But they mostly talked about their own prosperity, exhibits read in federal court Monday demonstrated.

“Man you get me excited with all those money bags,” former Mississippi Human Services Department Director John Davis once texted former WWE star Ted “Teddy” DiBiase Jr.
DiBiase is standing trial for his alleged role in a broader welfare fraud scandal that auditors found resulted in the loss of roughly $100 million in federal funds meant to assist the needy from 2016 to 2020. And Davis, who pleaded guilty in 2022 and is cooperating with the prosecution as he awaits sentencing, finished his second day testifying against the wrestler Monday.
The trial deals specifically with the charges against DiBiase – 13 counts ranging from conspiracy, wire fraud, theft and money laundering. The trial could last weeks. But five days in, testimony and exhibits have at times touched on the broader network of people at play.
“I have seen first hand with my own eyes what a letter with the state seal & endorsement from the Governor himself can do,” DiBiase texted Davis, according to a government exhibit displayed in court. “What’s crazy is when you put that letter in a quazi (sic) educated quazi (sic) celebrity’s hands who genuinely and sincerely wants to change the world. The doors of the decision makers and gold brick shares fly open off the hinges. Like a Baptist church when their 60min Jesus fix is up and they got football and chicken waiting at home.”
Several inquiries begged to be explored, such as when the prosecutor asked Davis to identify the eight different agency employees or attorney general’s office lawyers who reviewed and authorized one of the agreements used as a vehicle to pay DiBiase. 
Or when Davis explained that a federal director from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services traveled to Mississippi “all the time because he liked what we were doing.” 
Davis is set to return to the witness stand for cross-examination by the defense Tuesday.

The first day of Davis testimony lingered on the bizarre and sentimental relationship between the two men, who bonded quickly and intensely over their shared religiosity and elaborate plans for their futures. 
The second day, the prosecution kept pummeling the jury with text messages that suggested Davis and DiBiase aimed to use their access to the nation’s welfare delivery system to generate lifelong security for themselves and their families. 
While DiBiase was receiving large payments totaling more than $3 million from the state’s welfare and food assistance programs, the two men were discussing buying property and starting a compound together in order to “enjoy life the way it’s meant to be,” one text read.
Some seemed like passive fantasies, while others were more specific: Should Davis buy the orange Kubota or the green John Deere tractor? Had DiBiase seen this property for sale on Magnolia Drive? Davis said he’d give up the main house for a cottage in the lower 40.
Meanwhile, in one of the most poverty-stricken states in the nation, Davis’ department was denying up to 98% of people applying for cash assistance from the same pot of funds they were using. Out of the roughly $86.5 million Mississippi receives annually from the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, it doles out about $4 million to families in need. 
Davis testified Monday that DiBiase was aware of the source of the funds he received.
“Fear is INEVITABLE,” reads screenshot from a power point former Mississippi Department of Human Services Director John Davis and wrestler Ted DiBiase Jr. used during their leadership training program called Law of 16.
Davis had worked for the department, starting out as a county-level eligibility worker assisting welfare applicants, for over two decades by the time DiBiase came along. When they met, Davis was also working as an adjunct professor and DiBiase was vice president of business development for a Christian insurance company called One Life America.
Both of their roles dealt with leadership development, Davis said. They texted about their desire to go into business together, combine the training concepts they’d devised and shop the product to businesses and other states as consultants. They pumped each other up.
“Your vision is so crystal clear and synergistic with mine that it’s got to be illegal,” DiBiase texted Davis.
When asked what DiBiase was doing alongside Davis on a da- to-day basis, Davis described him as “being a shadow and a person who could take notes and keep things straight.” 
“Taking meetings, going to things with the governor, the Governor’s Mansion, governor’s office,” Davis said. “… Anything I went to, he went to.”
While he was paid sporadically, DiBiase received an average of about $30,000 per week. 
Some employees at MDHS were earning annual salaries of $18,000, Davis testified Monday, about $350 a week.
Davis said his boss, then-Gov. Phil Bryant, had been receiving complaints about those workers delivering poor customer service, and that’s why Davis hired DiBiase to deliver talks to encourage them. Bryant, a Republican, was in his second and final term when he nominated Davis to lead MDHS in January 2016, and Davis was later confirmed by the state Senate. Davis resigned in July 2019.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/09172625/AP22265695336659.jpg,,,2026-01-13 08:58:03.556720

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)When a legislative audit on the efficiency of the Utah System of Higher Education was first introduced to the public in 2024, it prompted cuts and reallocations for academic programs, but it also pointed to a longstanding frustration for higher education leaders — a lack of collaboration between public universities.
“We have exceptional institutions of higher education, really amazing leaders, amazing faculty, serving the needs of our regions, yet I watch them all competing against each other. And what I see is a lost opportunity,” Geoffrey Landward, Utah commissioner of higher education told lawmakers then.
Now, the Utah System of Higher Education is aiming for change, planting the seed to turn the group of institutions into a real unified system, potentially starting during the legislative session that begins Tuesday.
Audit: Could cutting low-performing college programs help Utah’s academic outlook? 

“There will be potentially legislation this session about it, but it will be a very bare bones bill,” Landward said on Monday. “The intent would be to essentially just set up the very broad infrastructure.”
The draft would essentially direct the Utah Board of Higher Education to organize the system into regions with “vertical integration,” or some streamlined operations. 
The makeup of those regions and how the institutions would collaborate is still undefined, Landward said. The idea is that the board will work over the next couple of years with all interested parties to start building on that structure. 
But, Landward already has a good guess about how the plans could end up looking. He visualizes a set of regions organized geographically. For example, he can see the Wasatch Front divided into three regions, with one encompassing Salt Lake County and Tooele, another grouping northern counties, and a third with institutions in southern counties. Rural areas may see other structures. 
“If we can develop the system in a way where we can get better access to programs and institutions in rural Utah through this, that’s the whole point, or at least one of the primary points of doing this kind of reorganization,” he said.

Each region would have a technical college, either a regional or research university, and in some cases, also a community college, Landward said. Within the regions, there are opportunities for integrated admissions, or academic advising, and also integrated degree and certificate programming, specifically designed for students to move through the system.
“So if you’re admitted into Tooele Tech, for example, or Salt Lake Community College, that means that there’s automatic admission pathways for you to the University of Utah, and that the advising is done in partnership with the University of Utah,” Landward said. 
There are currently partnerships between schools like Salt Lake Community College and the University of Utah that make transfers better, “but it’s not as seamless as it could be,” Landward added.
The system redesign could, for example, allow a community college to design associate degrees to align with a university’s bachelor’s degree program. And university students could take general education courses at community colleges at a lower cost. 
Landward described the current system as “a loosely affiliated group of institutions” that capture some benefits of being a unified system, “but just on the edges.” Without change now, the system could face a series of shutdowns and mergers in the coming decades, he said.
“I still have institutions trying to be all things to all students, competing for students trying to grow, and that’s the way the system operates right now. I don’t think that’s sustainable,” Landward said. “I think that we have to make some drastic changes over the next few years, because demographics will shift. There’ll be fewer students enrolling and fewer resources to go around, and we have to be more efficient and smart about how we’re operating.”

“We will continue building on our success in education, bolstering public safety, conservatively budgeting and preparing for Alabama’s strong future,” Ivey said in a statement last week, though the office did not provide details.
According to a press release, Ivey is expected to celebrate the semiquincentennial of the United States with Huntsville-based business owner Rodney Smith, Jr., who started a lawn service for veterans, and students from Booker T. Washington K-8 in Birmingham.
“An Alabamian who steps up to help veterans, talented students who share their gifts through music and young people proving what is possible in classrooms once written off – good things are happening across our 67 counties, and these guests help tell our success story in Alabama,” Ivey said in a statement Monday morning.
Ivey will serve through her record 10th legislative session as governor. Ivey has served the longest continual time as governor in Alabama history. She assumed the office in 2017, after Gov. Robert Bentley resigned following a plea deal over campaign finance violations. 
The session will likely go by quickly, with lawmakers looking to get back to their districts to raise money – which they are forbidden to do while the Legislature is in session – and campaign for re-election.

The grants supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, including battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and efforts to capture carbon dioxide emissions.
The Energy Department said the projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Russell Vought, the White House budget director, said on social media that “the Left’s climate agenda is being canceled.”
U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said the administration’s action violated the Constitution’s equal protection requirements.
“Defendants freely admit that they made grant-termination decisions primarily — if not exclusively — based on whether the awardee resided in a state whose citizens voted for President Trump in 2024,” Mehta wrote in a 17-page opinion. The administration offered no explanation for how their purposeful targeting of grant recipients based on their electoral support for Trump — or lack of it — “rationally advances their stated government interest,” the judge added.
The ruling was the second legal setback for the administration’s rollback of clean energy program in a matter of hours. A separate federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as Trump seeks to shut it down.
A spokesman for the Energy Department said officials disagree with the judge’s decision on clean energy grants.
Officials “stand by our review process, which evaluated these awards individually and determined they did not meet the standards necessary to justify the continued spending of taxpayer dollars,” spokesman Ben Dietderich said. “The American people deserve a government that is accountable and responsible in managing taxpayer funds.”
Projects were canceled in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state. All 16 targeted states supported Harris.
The cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.
The city of St. Paul and a coalition of environmental groups filed a lawsuit after they lost grants.
Trump said in an interview last fall with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects that Democrats want. “I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said in the Oct. 1 interview.
Vickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, one of the groups that filed the suit, said the court ruling “recognized that the Trump Department of Energy vindictively canceled projects for clean affordable energy that just happened to be in states disfavored by the Trump administration, in violation of the bedrock Constitutional guarantee that all people in all states have equal protection under the law.”
The administration’s actions violated the Constitution, foundational American values and “imposed high costs on the American people who rely on clean affordable energy for their pocketbooks and for healthier lives,” Patton said.
Anne Evens, CEO of Elevate Energy, one of the groups that lost funding, said the court ruling would help keep clean energy affordable and create jobs.
“Affordable energy should be a reality for everyone, and the restoration of these grants is an important step toward making that possible,” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25364602346753-1024x685.jpg,,,2026-01-13 11:58:41.794281

In practice, it’s more akin to voodoo.
It starts, as state law requires, with the governor’s introduction of a preliminary version in January, as Gavin Newsom did last week, unveiling a $349 billion budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1.
Theoretically, the Legislature will spend the next four months going through its details, Newsom will make some revisions in May, and he and legislators will finalize a version for adoption by the June 15 constitutional deadline.
A few decades ago, that’s what more or less happened each year. Over the last couple of decades, however, it’s gone off the rails.
As Democrats gained overwhelming control of the Legislature, they resented having minority Republicans having any input. Their allies in the public employee unions sponsored a 2010 ballot measure to lower the vote requirement for budgets from two-thirds to a simple majority, thereby eliminating the need for Republican votes.
Proposition 25 had another unspoken consequence. It allowed so-called “trailer bills” to be enacted with the same simple majority votes and take effect immediately upon signing. Originally, trailer bills were to make legal changes needed to implement budget allocations. But one year at a time it morphed into vehicles for major changes in state law that had little or nothing to do with the budget, often drafted in secrecy and passed in batches with little scrutiny.
Years ago, a reporter who covered the Legislature coined an apt name for such measures, calling them “mushroom bills” because they grew in the dark, nurtured by manure.
Newsom has been especially eager to exploit the trailer bill loophole, often packaging much of his agenda in such measures, making them subject to closed-door negotiations with legislative leaders and using the budget’s appropriations for leverage.
Some mushroom bills backfired when their true impacts became known, embarrassing legislators who voted for them, and forcing them to backtrack. Having been burned, legislators indirectly refused to allow some issues to be handled through trailer bills, forcing Newsom to deal with them more or less in public.
Two years ago, for example, they balked at Newsom’s effort to include an overhaul of the California Environmental Quality Act in a trailer bill, leading to two years of negotiations that culminated last year in a CEQA reform measure.
Nevertheless, the trailer bill syndrome continues. The Capitol is waiting to see what Newsom has up his sleeve for the final budget of his governorship.
Even without the trailer-bill sideshow, forging a new budget will be difficult because Newsom has declared that the version he unveiled last week is basically a placeholder — an updated semi-clone of the current year’s budget — that must await more revenue data, particularly the all-important personal income tax returns due in April.
Newsom projects that the state will gain an extra $42.3 billion in revenue over three years, but faces doubt, especially from the Legislature’s budget analyst, Gabe Petek. In an initial appraisal of Newsom’s budget Monday, he continues to warn that the state could take a serious revenue hit if the high-flying stock market stumbles.
“These risks are severe enough that not incorporating them into this year’s budget, as the governor proposes, would put the state on precarious footing,” Petek wrote. He also reminded the Legislature that even if Newsom’s rosy scenario comes to pass, the state sill still face hefty deficits, saying “the state’s negative fiscal situation is now chronic.”
With a dead-on-arrival draft budget, deep differences over revenues, chronic deficits and pressure on Newsom and legislators to offset the effects of major cuts in federal aid — not to mention looming trailer bill issues — it’s hard to even find a starting point.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/010926-Budget-Presentation-FG-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-13 08:12:19.513246

The utility, which originally intended to pay back customers for six months of overpayment, is offering to provide refunds back to June 2017, the last month for which it has records. If the PUC wants more, the utility says, it will have to go to court and in the process, delay reimbursements to customers.
“This approach substantially exceeds the Companies’ legal obligations and ensures prompt compensation for impacted customers,” the company said in a filing Friday. 
Regulatory staff for the PUC want customers made whole for all of the overcharges back to 2002, and with interest, by estimating the overcharges preceding 2017.
In a late December filing, staff maintained that NV Energy’s own Rule 5(H) on adjusting billing errors expressly requires NV Energy to “refund for overpayment…back to but not beyond the established date on which the error or omission commenced.” 
NV Energy argues no rule regulates how overcharges are addressed in the north, and that Southern Nevada customers are entitled to recoup overcharges going back just six months. 
NV Energy contends “punitive measures based on the mistaken belief that the Companies were unjustly enriched are neither appropriate nor necessary.”
 The Commission’s rate-setting process, “ensured that these errors did not result in a windfall to the Companies. While some customers paid more than they should have, others paid less, and the overall revenue requirements remained balanced.”
The utility argues the PUC’s authority is limited, and that it must file a contested case, which “would significantly delay compensation to customers.”
NV Energy argues the PUC lacks the authority to order a refund based on a finding that the company overcharged customers, adding “the appropriate forum for any such relief is in court.” 
The utility contends the Nevada Administrative Procedures Act requires “that any order that would determine the legal rights or duties of a utility be in a proceeding that is a contested case, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing. There is no question that this proceeding is only investigatory in nature.”
“It’s time for NV Energy to take responsibility and demonstrate good faith by making customers whole instead of continuing to delay and dispute what is rightfully owed to Nevadans,” said Camalot Todd, communications director for Nevada Conservation League. 
NV Energy maintains it’s identified almost all of the customers who were overcharged, but its estimates have varied during the last year.
The utility initially acknowledged overcharging some 60,000 customers by roughly $17 million, the Current reported in May, but the company later found through an audit it had overcharged another 20,000  “previously unidentified ‘multi-family accounts’ for an undisclosed amount.” 
The company now contends it overcharged 45,338 customers – 37,571 in the south and 7,767 in the north. A spokesperson did not respond to the Current’s request for clarification. 
It’s unknown how much of the estimated $65 million in overcharges has been paid back. NV Energy first attempted to reimburse a portion of customers a total of $2.5 million, based on what PUC staff alleged was an inapplicable rule limiting reimbursement of overcharges to six months. 
A law passed by the Legislature last year in response to NV Energy’s failure to make customers whole requires that utilities pay back all overcharges with interest. In the future, active customers will get a credit to their bills, while former customers will receive a refund, according to the new law.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/NVEnergy_RC_003-scaled-e1683758765721-1024x629.jpg,,,2026-01-13 07:58:21.027573

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Legislation requiring paid political influencers to report to Indiana lobbying regulators heads to the Senate floor after a Monday committee vote, despite major concerns from regulators and First Amendment advocates — and the author’s admission the bill was drafted in a rush.
A ban on ranked choice voting also advanced.
Indiana already governs professional lobbyists paid to influence the legislative and executive branches, but Sen. Scott Alexander sees a gap.
“It’s really the influencers that we’ve been seeing that are influencing politics outside of the parameters of, for instance, the lobbyists,” he told the Capital Chronicle on Monday, after his Senate Bill 267 squeaked through the Senate’s Elections Committee.
Alexander, R-Muncie, wants transparency for those “paid to influence (or) paid to protest.”
Sen. Scott Alexander, R-Muncie, asked his colleagues to get his bill, which would regulate paid political influencers as lobbyists, through committee, but promised he’d make changes. (Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
His legislation focuses on “influence campaigns,” defined as attempts to mobilize the public to take some action or contact state officials — including via protest.
Executive branch leaders like the governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, comptroller, treasurer and attorney general count, and so would the legislative branch’s lawmakers. Also accounted for are candidates, employees, consultants and close relatives of both branches.
Someone who encourages another person to engage in an influence campaign — and pays that person at least $500 in a year — would be required to file with the Indiana Lobby Registration Commission within 24 hours of handing over the cash, beginning July 1.
They’d need to submit detailed information on themselves, their organization, others involved in the influence campaign, their goals and their expenditures, according to the proposal.
“We would like to support Senate Bill 267, because there is certainly a need for more transparency around money spent to influence the legislative process,” said Julia Vaughn, with elections watchdog Common Cause Indiana.
However, she said, the group is opposed “because we think it’s duplicative of current law for registered lobbyists, at least, and unworkable for those it would apply to.”
Vaughn observed, for example, that the giver of money would be responsible for disclosing how it was spent, although that duty is typically placed on the recipient.
Administrative, 1A concerns
Regulator testimony revealed deeper dilemmas.
The Lobby Registration Commission is one of just two legislative branch agencies, alongside the Legislative Services Agency, said Edward Ferguson, the entity’s executive director and general counsel.
“We question the wisdom of putting the ILRC in a position of having to deal with actions taken to influence executive branch members, especially since the executive branch has its own statute concerning lobbying,” Ferguson said, noting he’d been in touch with ILRC’s commissioners about the bill.

Lobbyists who earn at least $500 annually to influence the legislative branch file with the commission. Those who make at least $1,000 annually to influence the executive branch register with the Indiana Department of Administration.
“The ILRC has never in its history regulated lobbying and influencing in the executive branch,” Ferguson told the committee. “I see a separation of powers issue here.”
Furthermore, the 24-hour deadline for reports “seems unreasonable and a bit confusing,” he added, because payments for lobbying services are often made weeks or months after.
He anticipated the ILRC would be “swamped” with reporting problems.
The agency has just one full-time employee — Ferguson — and a part-time employee, supplemented by an additional staffer during peak registration and activity reporting periods, he said.
“Our current staffing level is ultimately insufficient” to handle Senate Bill 267, Ferguson continued, in contrast to an LSA fiscal impact analysis that said increases in workload “are within the routine administrative function” of the agency and could be absorbed with “existing resource and funding levels.”
First Amendment advocates, meanwhile, warned the legislation could infringe upon constitutionally protected paid advocacy.

Samantha Bresnahan, with the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana, said while the group supports transparency in government, “it must be balanced against constitutional rights.” The bill could “chill” political association and participation, she said.
“If what the bill’s authors hope to accomplish is to squelch paid protesters … this bill is not a way to accomplish that,” agreed Barbara Tully, with the League of Women Voters of Indiana.
Paid protester perceptions
Outrage over allegedly compensated paid advocacy is growing nationwide, although fact-checkers like Politifact have repeatedly found such accusations aren’t supported by evidence.
“I know that some of my colleagues thought there were some paid protesters during the redistricting fight,” said Sen. J.D. Ford, D-Indianapolis. Several demonstrations, both for and against President Donald Trump’s map-drawing push, were held before the campaign failed.
“Do you believe that … there are people that are being paid to protest?” Ford asked Alexander.
“Around the Statehouse? I would say there probably are,” he responded. “Yeah, yeah, for sure.”
Asked if his bill was aimed at paid protesters, Alexander told the Capital Chronicle, “No, not necessarily.” He acknowledged it could “catch” compensated advocates.
But, he emphasized, there’s “definitely not an intent to push down on free speech.”
Another colleague questioned whether social media influencers who are paid by political parties or outside groups would also have to report activity.

Lawmakers of both parties expressed misgivings following testimony, prompting Alexander to admit, “This is a bill that we got down to the wire on.”
Sen. Linda Rogers, R-Granger, asked if the bill could be held, but committee chair Sen. Mike Gaskill, R-Pendleton, noted the panel meets on Mondays and next Monday is a holiday. The deadline for bills to pass from committee is Jan. 26.
Legislative leaders plan to adjourn in late February, two weeks sooner than usual, to offset the cost of the two weeks they dedicated to redistricting in December — compressing the 10-week session into just eight.
“What I would like to ask the committee is that we go ahead and move the bill, if you think you can move it today with the promise from Sen. Alexander that he will work with us on a substantial revision on second reading,” Gaskill said. “I think that’s the only possibility at this time to give the bill the hope of moving forward.”
Several witnesses and committee members offered their assistance.
“I do think that it has potential,” said Sen. Stacey Donato, R-Logansport. “But, again, I offer the help to get it in a good spot, because right now it’s not.”
The legislation advanced on a 6-3 vote. Sen. Greg Walker, R-Columbus, joined two Democrats in opposition.
Ranked choice preemption moves
A prohibition on ranked choice voting was also voted out of committee.
Most elections use a single choice model. In a ranked choice version, voters rank the candidates in order of preference. If no candidate wins a majority of ballots on which they are listed as the top choice, the other rankings are used to determine a winner.
“Part of the problem with ranked choice voting,” said Sen. Blake Doriot, R-Goshen, is voters who only wish to support one candidate either complete the ballot to “vot(e) against that person at some point” — or skip the rankings and don’t get counted in later rounds.

“That scares us,” Doriot said, noting that Indiana Code is silent on the issue, and could be impacted by the results of a federal lawsuit, for example.
Opponents of his Senate Bill 12 indicated the ranked choice  approach could help bridge the partisan divide.
Tully said the league in Indiana supports ranked choice voting to “reduce the toxicity of negative campaigning, to advance those candidates who have broad support, to keep candidates and campaigns issues-focused.”
Advocates of the ban, including the Indiana Secretary of State’s Office, said ranked choice voting is complicated to administer and creates longer ballots for weary voters to fill out.
Jason Snead of the Honest Elections Project said Indiana should outlaw the system even though it’s not currently used, adding, “You should not wait for the ranked choice voting lobby to make Indiana a target.”
Brad King, the Republican co-director of the bipartisan Indiana Election Division, said the state’s home rule law already bars local units of government from using election procedures like ranked choice voting, but that it doesn’t prevent all litigation.
The legislation advanced on a 7-2 vote, along party lines.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)As Elle Neubauer drove before dawn past the darkened windows of the immigrant-owned businesses on Lake Street in Minneapolis, her co-pilot and friend Patty O’Keefe scanned the passing vehicles with binoculars, searching for signs of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.
As the sun rose, more community patrollers arrived on Lake Street, keeping eyes on the Ecuadorean grocery stores, Somali restaurants and Mexican taco shops that line the street. With such a high concentration of patrollers and relatively few federal agents in the area that morning, Neubauer and O’Keefe decided to head south to the suburb of Bloomington, where O’Keefe said she had encountered ICE the day prior.
The goal is to “distract them, to occupy their time,” O’Keefe said. “The more time they’re trying to get away from us, the less time they’re spending searching for people to abduct.”
The pair quickly located and started following a white Ford Explorer they suspected belonged to ICE. The driver began weaving through suburban parking lots with Neubauer close behind, seemingly trying to confirm he was being followed.
“They do and will say anything to try to intimidate and scare people,” Neubauer said that morning. “One of their favorite lines recently is, ‘This is your one and only warning.’”
The Explorer came to a stop in a hotel parking lot, and Neubauer parked nearby. The driver of the Explorer then pulled his vehicle behind Neubauer’s car, blocking the exit.
A man with a black face covering and a tactical vest peeking through his flannel shirt exited his car and approached the passenger door, gesturing for O’Keefe to roll down the window.

“No, thank you,” Neubauer said, smiling and waving at the man.
“Stop following us,” he said, his voice muffled through the closed car window and the gaiter. “This is your first warning.”
Neubauer and O’Keefe started patrolling their south Minneapolis neighborhood recently as the Trump administration has ramped up its mass deportation campaign in Minnesota, sending in thousands of ICE and Border Patrol agents, with more on the way. They are some of the many thousands of Twin Cities residents who have come together over the past year to protest ICE and divert the agents from their mission, often resulting in tense confrontations.
Minnesota has been the focus of President Donald Trump’s deportation efforts since December, when a right-wing media outlet published unsubstantiated allegations that Somali Minnesotans were funding terrorism with money stolen from government programs. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced “Operation Metro Surge” in December, which purported to target Somali immigrants, the vast majority of whom are citizens or legal permanent residents. 
The effort to disrupt ICE operations has only grown in the days after ICE agent Jonathan Ross fatally shot Renee Good in her car in south Minneapolis, as Minnesotans look for ways to push back against what many view as an occupation of the city by unwelcome federal forces. There are now at least four times more immigration agents in the state than there are Minneapolis police officers. 
Citizen observers are gathering on street corners and posting on social media to connect with each other, and immigrant rights organizations are quickly reaching capacity at training sessions for people who want to learn how to support and defend immigrants.
ICE did not respond to the Reformer’s emails for comment for this story.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Good was attempting to run over a federal agent in an act of “domestic terrorism.”Appearing on a Sunday morning Fox News show, Noem said her agency is investigating the funding behind anti-ICE operations, and claimed nonprofit organizations are training people to “distract them, assault them and do exactly what we’ve seen with these vehicle rammings.”
After the man finished talking to the patrollers and got back in the white Explorer, a second vehicle — a black GMC Yukon SUV— pulled in behind him, blocking in Neubauer’s car while the Explorer drove away.

Neubauer and O’Keefe followed the black SUV out of the parking lot.
“I wonder how many first warnings we can get today,” O’Keefe said, half-jokingly.
She evidently ran out of warnings two days later, when federal agents smashed in her car window, dragged her and her co-pilot out of the car, and held them for eight hours in the belly of the Whipple Federal Building.
Neighbors join forces to track ICE, warn potential targets
When Trump assumed the presidency for the second time, immigrant rights activists landed on a strategy to respond to the coming increase in immigrant arrests: rapid response networks. Grouped by geographic proximity, they would quickly arrive at the scene of an ICE raid to protest, warn nearby neighbors, tell detainees about their rights and convince agents to leave. A common tactic is pointing out that agents can’t enter private property without permission or a judicial warrant.
Around the country, as ICE deployments escalated in cities like Chicago and Los Angeles, anti-ICE protesters have adopted and spread the tactics of honking horns and blowing whistles to alert entire city blocks to agents’ presence. The practice has become common in the Twin Cities, especially since “Operation Metro Surge” began in December.
Over the past year, immigrant rights groups have hosted “know your rights” trainings for immigrants and rapid responders, outlining the laws governing ICE and the protocols observers should follow to avoid arrest. At these trainings, neighbors meet each other and plug into their local rapid response networks. 
Following cars, making noise and filming law enforcement operations is legal, according to Tracy Roy of the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota. Physically blocking ICE agents from making an arrest is not. (And getting arrested, Neubauer said, takes resources away from the movement, in addition to the high personal cost.)
Rapid responders have gathered en masse at protracted federal raids in Minneapolis and St. Paul in the past year, resulting in standoffs between protesters and ICE, in which ICE agents used physical force, pepper spray and tear gas on the demonstrators. 
But with the explosion in new agents arriving to the state, federal tactics seem to have shifted: ICE agents are conducting arrests quickly, in smaller groups than those that have provoked mass protest. By the time rapid responders arrive at the scene of a reported immigration raid or arrest — even if it only takes a few minutes — the ICE agents are often long gone. 
So, the rapid responders have gotten more proactive, setting off on neighborhood patrols, finding and following ICE agents to try to discourage them from making arrests. They also film the agents in action to document potential violations of the law.
“If they know that somebody is watching, they’re significantly less likely to stop somebody,” Neubauer said. “Often when they pull over and people hop on a whistle or on their horn, they’ll just leave.”

In group chats, neighbors using anonymous nicknames volunteer to assist with various aspects of the operation. No one assigns shifts or jobs; group members take on a needed role when they’re available, alert the group to their activities and let everyone know when they’re done.
The system is both highly organized and decentralized, with no clear leaders — just longer-time members of the network helping newcomers learn the communication style and security practices of the group.
As Neubauer drove on Friday morning’s patrol, O’Keefe monitored their local chat and listened to a group call. Both looked for what they’d learned were the hallmarks of ICE vehicles: out-of-state license plates, tinted windows, at least two people in the car — usually male, almost always masked.

When they spotted a suspicious vehicle in Bloomington, Neubauer maneuvered into position to follow it. An immediate giveaway that the vehicle belongs to federal agents, the patrollers said, is that the drivers quickly realize they’re being followed and start driving erratically. Early Friday morning, O’Keefe and Neubauer suspected a vehicle carried ICE officers; it aggressively accelerated towards Neubauer’s car while she made a U-turn at an intersection. Another vehicle they were following ran a red light, leaving the patrollers’ car behind.

“Well, if my plate wasn’t in their database, it is now,” Neubauer said Friday as she and O’Keefe followed the black SUV that had just boxed them in.
O’Keefe shared a description of the car and its license plate number so it could be added to the observers’ crowdsourced list.
As a countermeasure to the activists’ license plate tracking, ICE agents have been frequently switching license plates, drawing a warning from state regulators. 
Even after they lost the SUV — the driver cut abruptly across several lanes of traffic — the encounter was a successful waste of ICE resources, in the patrollers’ eyes. ICE had dedicated an entire vehicle to impeding the observers for several minutes, rather than conducting arrests.
“Deep breaths,” Neubauer said, reaching over to pat O’Keefe on the leg.

Managing one’s own emotions and staying calm is key to patrolling, because ICE agents are “emotional and not well-trained,” Neubauer said. 
‘I feel changed’
Neubauer and a different observer were following three apparent federal vehicles Monday when the convoy pulled onto a side street and came to a stop. Five agents hopped out of their vehicles, and one wearing a face covering and ICE vest approached the drivers’ side window as the others surrounded the car. 
As he approached the window, he greeted the driver with Neubauer’s wife’s legal name — the name on the car’s registration.
“If you keep following us…we’ll have to pull you out and arrest you,” the agent said. Neubauer and her co-pilot decided to keep following them — after all, they figured, they weren’t doing anything illegal.

The convoy took them straight to Neubauer’s house, where they stopped and idled for a few minutes before moving on. 
According to a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, ICE agents have routinely identified the drivers following them, then led them to the observers’ home — apparently using a law enforcement database to connect license plate numbers to drivers’ home addresses in an effort to intimidate observers.
On Monday, they took the intimidation tactics one step further. 
Two cars split off from the group, and Neubauer and her partner for the day decided to follow the third vehicle, a grey pickup truck. They stayed close behind for several minutes until they realized the truck was leading them towards the Whipple Federal Building. 
As Neubauer and her co-pilot followed the truck, agents returned to Neubauer’s house and banged on the front door. Her wife, who asked the Reformer not to publish her name out of fear of ICE, pretended she wasn’t home. The agents left after several neighbors stepped out of their houses and started blowing whistles.
When Neubauer realized what had happened, she called off the patrol and headed home.
“I feel changed, and afraid,” Neubauer’s wife said, looking at Neubauer. “I was very fearful — not for me, but for what could have happened to you.”
They set out on another patrol that afternoon, together.

Killed in the act
Since Ross shot and killed Good, immigrant rights activists and elected officials have referred to her as an “observer.”
When Neubauer saw video of the shooting, however, she noticed something that suggested Good may not have been trained, or experienced, in interacting with ICE: Her window was rolled down, and she was speaking to the agents, against the advice of many immigrant rights activists.
“The shooting on Wednesday was 1000% not Renee’s fault. It was an ICE officer panicking and shooting into her car,” Neubauer said. “If we can manage the emotions of ICE officers so they’re not panicking … they’re less likely to f*ck up and make a mistake and hurt someone.”
Several leaders of immigrant rights groups and members of Good’s local neighborhood rapid response network told the Reformer they did not know Good.
Even if Good were in the group chat, the people interviewed by the Reformer may not have known, because they use code names and generally do not know each other’s real identities.
Friday morning, one patroller spoke up in the group call to say their car had been boxed in and ICE agents were approaching.
Another group member repeated the collective mantra: Lock your doors, roll up the windows, do not engage.

Broken glass
Sunday morning, O’Keefe was patrolling south Minneapolis with her friend Brandon Sigüenza when they heard ICE agents had surrounded another patroller’s car and were deploying pepper spray. When they arrived at the scene, they saw two federal vehicles surrounded by people blowing whistles and honking horns, O’Keefe said.
The agents got back in their cars and drove away. O’Keefe and Sigüenza followed them down a residential street until the vehicles stopped in the middle of the road and agents came up to the car — again giving them a “final warning” to stop following the officers, O’Keefe said.
O’Keefe shouted through the closed windows that she wasn’t obstructing them and that they could move forward if they wanted to, she said.
Sigüenza, for his part, said he kept repeating Renee Good’s name.
As the agents were walking back to their cars, one turned around and sprayed pepper spray into the car’s intake vent, Sigüenza said. 
The pair continued following the convoy, O’Keefe honking her horn, until the agents stopped and got out of their cars again.
This time, they shattered both front windows and dragged Sigüenza and O’Keefe from the car, according to video captured by observers. Sigüenza said both of their phones flew from his hands, his landing in the frozen street. Agents handcuffed both activists and placed them in separate unmarked vehicles bound for the Whipple Federal Building, they said.
O’Keefe said the agents ridiculed her while she was in the backseat of the car. 
“You guys gotta stop obstructing us,” O’Keefe recalls one agent saying. Then, referring to Renee Good: “That’s why that lesbian b*tch is dead.”
O’Keefe became enraged, calling the agent a “f*cking bigot.” She committed his comment to memory and quoted it to everyone she could inside the Whipple Building, she said.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment Monday.
O’Keefe’s partner, Mitch Ditlefsen, called her as he was leaving his job as a prep cook at around 9:45 a.m.

“Someone picked up and said, ‘The owner of this phone has been abducted by ICE,’” Ditlefsen said. 
“I showed up, and there was just shattered windows and pepper spray, and no indication of where Patty and Brandon were,” Ditlefsen said. 
The pair said they spent eight hours in custody, mostly in holding cells with other U.S. citizens who said they were also arrested while protesting ICE. O’Keefe said she was never provided a phone call; Sigüenza was able to call his wife. 
While in custody, Sigüenza said, agents suggested they would pay him or expedite immigration proceedings for his relatives if he provided the agents with names of undocumented immigrants or protest organizers. Both were released without charges. 
Sigüenza said he’ll take a short break from patrolling for his wife’s sake — she feared for his safety long before his arrest — but he’s ready to get back out there. 
O’Keefe said the experience has strengthened her resolve, but also ratcheted up her fear. 
“They don’t realize this is coming from a deep place of love and empathy and care for my community,” O’Keefe said. “And that is a stronger feeling that I have in me than fear.”
Feeling besieged, a neighborhood fights back
When thousands of people showed up to mourn Good at a vigil the night she was killed, organizers urged attendees to get connected to their local immigrant defense networks in whatever role they are comfortable with.
Everyone has different skills and risk tolerances, Neubauer said, so there’s a role for everyone. For example, going door to door to meet one’s neighbors is one important way to increase safety and support people who may be staying home for fear of ICE, Neubauer said. 
“But honestly, I have too much social anxiety,” she said. “It was just too much for me to do that. And for whatever reason, my brain works in such a way where (patrolling) is less anxiety-inducing than talking to my neighbors door-to-door.”
She wouldn’t be able to deal with the emotional toll of patrolling without support from her wife, she said. The movement needs all kinds of help; whistles and volunteers to distribute them; plate checkers and people to coordinate among different networks in various languages; food delivery for immigrants sheltering in place.
And, more people in more neighborhoods who are ready to jump into action when ICE shows up next door.

Although the Declaration of Independence is not […],"(photo courtesy of C-SPAN).I was struck by the inspirational tone of the year-end report issued by Chief Justice John Roberts.
Roberts went back to basics with his review of the fundamentals spelled out by Thomas Paine in his “Common Sense” pamphlet and the principles laid out in the Declaration of Independence. Although the Declaration of Independence is not part of U.S. law, Roberts viewed the founding document as having “played a signal role in the nation’s constitutional, statutory, and common law.”
Roberts then highlighted points in U.S. history when the Nation made progress in vindicating the promise of the Declaration. He pointed to the abolition of slavery in the Thirteenth Amendment, the recognition of women’s right to vote in the Nineteenth Amendment, the recognition of equal rights in Brown v. Board of Education, and the adoption of the landmark civil rights legislation in the 1960s. Roberts saw these events as part of the “never ending quest to fulfill the Constitution’s promise of a ‘more perfect union’.”
Roberts wrote: “These national accomplishments illustrate that the responsibilities for livings up to the promises of the Declaration rest on all three branches of government as well as well as on each sucessive generation of Americans.”  Roberts placed particular emphasis on the critical role of federal judges in this process. Roberts wrote that the judges “must continue to decide the cases before us according to our oath, doing equal right to the poor and to the rich, and performing all our duties faithfully and impartially under the Constituion and laws of the United States.”
I consider the stirring words of this report to be truly inspirational. But what was the Chief Justice actually signaling to the nation with his words? Roberts devoted much of his leadership role as Chief Justice to undermining the “national accomplishments” he now celebrates. And in ruling on shadow docket cases, Roberts has repeatedly sided with the majority in undermining the role of lower federal court judges as bastions against abuses of executive authority.

Roberts wrote the majority opinion in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, 600 U.S. 181 (2023). Roberts in SFFA overruled decades of affirmative acton cases going back to the Bakke decision in the 1970s. The majority adopted what Roberts viewed as a “colorblind” approach to equal protection. Roberts rejected the theory that the Reconstruction era amendments, like the Thirteenth Amendment, allowed the government to give any affirmative relief to AfricanAmericans who had been subjected to the horrors of slavery. At the same time, Roberts ignored the key role Brown played in providing affirmative relief to African Americans by ordering the integration of public schools.
Roberts took an indirect swipe atBrown when he wrote a plurality opinion in Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, 551 U.S. 701 (2007). In a split decision, the Court found it unconstitutional for a school district to use race as a factor in assigning students to schools to achieve racial diversity, unless the district was remedying a prior history of de jure  Roberts wrote bluntly in his plurality opinion: “The way to stop discriminating on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.”
Roberts wrote the majority opinion in Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529 (2013). Roberts in Shelby County struck down the formula used for the preclearance requirement under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Under this formula in Section 4(b), those states with a long history of racial discrimination had to obtain preclearance from the Justice Department to make changes that might undermine the voting rights of African Americans. Roberts considered the formula in this landmark civil rights legislation to be outdated and no longer necessary.
In this term, the Roberts Court now has before it a case where the Court could strike down a more fundamental part of the Voting Rights Act – the Section 2 provision prohibiting racial discrimination in voting rights. See, Louisiana v. Callais, No. 24-109. The specific question presented in Louisiana is whether the Voting Rights Act still allows voters of color to challenge racially discriminatory voting maps in court.
On many questions associated with separation of powers, Roberts has consistently sided with the majority in using the Court’s emergency docket to give the Trump administration sweeping powers under its unitary executive theory. And in so doing, Roberts rejected the power of lower court judges to issue temporary injunctions to rein in abuses of executive authority.

So now, what are we to make of the Chief Justice’s inspirational year-end report? Is Roberts having second thoughts about his prior actions because of the imminent threat to democracy posed by Trump? The recent Trump invasion of Venezuala may feed that theory. If that is Roberts’ thinking, he could be signaling a change in course on how he approaches critical questions like tariffs, birthright citizenship, racial discrimination, or separation of powers.
The other possibility is that Roberts is presenting his inspirational theme just to placate an increasing angry public. Polling suggests the public no longer holds the Supreme Court in particularly high esteem. Roberts cannot reverse this trend with empty platitudes.
We should have some idea by the end of this term if the year-end report has any lasting significance.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/John-Roberts.jpg,,,2026-01-13 06:58:21.983621

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey legislators will have more to celebrate after swearing in Tuesday than their brethren of past years — they’re getting a giant pay raise.
A controversial salary hike that the Democratic-led Legislature passed on the last day of its 2022-23 legislative session takes effect Tuesday, when a new two-year legislative session starts.
Annual pay for the state’s 120 part-time legislators will jump 67% from $49,000 to $82,000, with the Senate president and Assembly speaker each getting roughly $27,000 extra a year for their leadership roles. Every legislator gets $150,000 annually to pay their staff.
Bill to limit plastic utensils in restaurants wins legislative approval

The legislative raises will cost taxpayers $9.8 million a year — $4 million a year more than previously.
Raises for New Jersey’s governor and lieutenant governor, which take effect with next week’s inauguration, are similarly eye-popping. Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill and Lt. Gov.-elect Dale Caldwell will make $210,000 each, up $35,000 from the $175,000 annual salaries Gov. Phil Murphy and Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way made.
Supporters of the salary hikes said lawmakers’ pay had stagnated since 2002 and should climb to keep up with the cost of living in one of the nation’s most expensive states. Legislators also have said they sometimes work outside of scheduled legislative days because of constituent services and other duties.
The law also hiked the salaries for 22 executive-branch officials, as well as the state Board of Public Utilities’ five commissioners, from $175,000 to $210,000 — although those raises began soon after Murphy signed the law in January 2024.
Critics had complained that the bumps would make New Jersey lawmakers among the highest paid in the nation, at a time of growing deficits and other budget challenges. Lawmakers passed a record-high $58.8 billion budget in June that included controversial cuts and budget diversions impacting colleges and universities, affordable housing, harm reduction work, and more.
New Jersey legislators now make more than any other state lawmakers outside of New York ($142,000), California ($128,000), Pennsylvania ($106,000), Illinois ($89,000), and Alaska ($84,000), according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
New York, California, and Pennsylvania have full-time legislatures, while Illinois and Alaska are considered “full-time lite,” which the conference defines as having fewer session days and smaller districts and staffs than truly full-time legislatures.
New Jersey’s part-time legislators typically hold other jobs and logged just 89 legislative days in 2025 and 90 in 2024.
Sherrill will be the ninth-highest-paid governor nationally, according to Business Insider.

(Stock photo by Imaginima/Getty Images)Dozens of data centers have been built in communities across Wisconsin, with more planned or in process. In many of these communities, the proposed data centers have sparked significant local opposition. 
Both Democrats and Republicans in the Legislature have proposed bills to regulate the growth of data centers as community leaders across the state have asked for more direction from the state government on the approval of what are often massive facilities. 
So far, the state has had little input on data center construction outside of a provision in the 2023-25 state budget which exempted data center construction projects from paying sales taxes. 
The Democratic bill, introduced last year by Sen. Jodi Habush Sinykin (D-Whitefish Bay) and Rep. Angela Stroud (D-Ashland), would require data centers to report the level of energy and water they’re using, fund the development of renewable energy projects and ensure the cost of increased energy demands aren’t passed on to regular consumers.
The Republican bill, introduced this month, also requires the Public Service Commission to prevent energy use and infrastructure costs from being passed on to consumers, requires the data center to use a closed-loop water cooling system to limit the amount of water needed and includes provisions that would require the data center company to cover the cost of restoring the land it’s built on if the data center is closed or unfinished. The bill also includes a provision that requires any renewable energy created to power the data center be sourced on site. 
Last year, the issue of data centers was a common theme on the campaign trail in Virginia’s gubernatorial race, as voters respond to the effects of hosting more of the centers than any other state. 
Here in Wisconsin, communities are grappling with how to make agreements with the big tech companies hoping to build the data centers, how to avoid the broken promises at the top of mind of many Wisconsinites after the Foxconn development in Mount Pleasant failed to live up to its lofty initial projections and how to manage the often huge demands the data centers make on local water supplies and energy. 
Despite those challenges, the construction of a data center can offer benefits to local governments — mostly by boosting property tax revenue from a development that won’t consume many local government services. 
Unlike many other issues, the question of data center development has not become politically polarized, with a range of positions among candidates of both parties. 
“Data centers are a new issue that has not taken on a partisan edge in the public mind,” Barry Burden, a political science professor at UW-Madison, said. “This is likely to change because among politicians Democrats are more skeptical about data centers and Republicans are more enthusiastic about them. If this partisan divide continues or even becomes sharper, the public is likely to begin mimicking the positions taken by party leaders. But at least for a while the issue is likely to cut across party lines.”
In Wisconsin’s crowded open race for governor, most of the candidates told the Wisconsin Examiner they were supportive of some level of statewide regulation on data centers. 
Democrat Missy Hughes’ campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this article and Republican Josh Schoemann’s campaign did not provide a comment by publication. Their public comments on the issue are included below. 
Mandela Barnes 
The former lieutenant governor said in a statement to the Examiner that it’s important that data center construction not increase utility rates, not damage the environment and use Wisconsin union labor. He also said the companies developing the centers need to meaningfully work with the communities they’re trying to build in. 
“A lot of communities feel left out of conversations about what is going on in their own backyard and that is not fair,” Barnes said. “Any development of this scale must meaningfully engage local communities and address their concerns and input throughout their proposal. We must also ensure that data center projects do not drive up utility rates for Wisconsinites or contribute to harmful pollution, and that they invest in training and hiring Wisconsin workers to staff these facilities.”
Joel Brennan 
The former secretary of the Department of Administration said in a statement from his campaign that the desire of tech companies to move fast is in opposition to the government’s need to engage the public transparently. 
“Wisconsinites shouldn’t have to foot the bill for AI or data center projects, period. At a time when affordability is a challenge in every community, taxpayers shouldn’t be on the hook for construction, operations, or higher utility costs. No one should have to worry about affording their heating bill because a data center has driven up energy prices,” he said. “It’s reasonable for people to have concerns about AI, and I share those concerns. The technology is moving fast, and companies often prioritize speed. Government’s responsibility is different: transparency, accountability, community engagement, and coordination with local communities who stand to be impacted by these projects. Data centers can create jobs and support local economies, but only if they’re done right — protecting taxpayers and our natural resources, and ensuring that the benefits truly serve Wisconsin communities.”
David Crowley 
At a gubernatorial candidate forum in November, Crowley was mostly supportive of data center development, saying the government shouldn’t be picking “winners and losers” and instead “make sure that this is fertile ground for entrepreneurs and businesses to either stay or move right here to the state of Wisconsin.”
In a statement to the Examiner, a campaign spokesperson said Crowley wants to encourage investment in Wisconsin’s economy while enforcing stringent environmental regulations, making sure companies pay the cost of increased energy use and giving local governments the power to say no to a data center project. 
“Growth that drives up rates or drains local resources is not innovation. It’s a bad deal,” the spokesperson said. “Communities will have clear authority to condition or deny projects based on energy and water use, demand transparency, and community benefit agreements, because the people who live with these projects deserve the final say. Crowley’s approach is simple: Wisconsin will lead in technology and economic growth without raising utility bills, without sacrificing our natural resources, and without letting Big Tech write the rules. Development will be transparent, accountable, and judged by whether or not it delivers real benefits to the people who live in Wisconsin.”
Francesca Hong
In a policy framework released last week, the Madison-area representative  to the state Assembly called for a moratorium on the construction of new data centers while the state works out how to responsibly manage their effects. Hong also wants to end sales tax and use tax exemptions for data centers, require the construction of more renewable energy sources and increase environmental protections on data centers. She is also a co-sponsor on the Democrats’ data center bill in the Legislature. 
In an interview with the Examiner, Hong said Wisconsin’s political leaders have a responsibility to listen to local opposition to data centers. 
“Our communities deserve long-term investments and contributions to their local communities,” she said. “The bipartisan opposition that is building coalitions against AI data centers means that elected officials have a responsibility to get more data on data centers, which is what informed our decision to support a moratorium on the construction of new data centers.” 
Hong said that on the campaign trail she has heard from voters who want Wisconsin to be “a hostile environment for AI data centers.” She added that it’s a bipartisan issue, which presents an opportunity to her as a Democratic socialist running for governor.
“I think there’s an opportunity here, not only for us to engage the left and bring them into electoral politics here in Wisconsin, but actually build that coalition amongst voters who are across the political spectrum and recognizing that as working class people, they’re getting screwed and they’re stressed, and they’re right to demand that their government do more to hold corporate power accountable,” she said. 
Missy Hughes 
At the November forum hosted by the Wisconsin Technology Council, Hughes, who as the former head of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation was involved in efforts to build the Microsoft data center at the former Foxconn site, promoted their positive potential for the state. 
“To have some of these data centers land here in Wisconsin, provide incredible property tax and revenue for the communities that are really determining how to pay their bills, how to build new schools, how to build new fire departments, it’s an opportunity for those communities to access some of that investment and to benefit from it,” she said, adding that a data center isn’t right for every community and local pushback should be considered. 
Sara Rodriguez 
A spokesperson for the current lieutenant governor said that she would issue an executive order to freeze utility rates while state officials develop a long-term data center plan. 
That long-term plan would include ways to prevent energy costs from increasing while making sure local residents get a say. 
“Sara strongly believes data center projects should be developed collaboratively with local communities. That means early community input, clear communication, and transparent planning to reduce misinformation and ensure projects make sense locally,” the spokesperson said. “Data centers aren’t the right fit for every community, but when done right they can bring real benefits — including jobs, redevelopment of otherwise unusable land, and new revenue that can help local governments lower taxes for residents, as we’ve seen in places like Janesville.” 
The campaign added that agreements with local governments must include provisions to prevent developers from bailing out and abandoning communities. 
“Sara also believes all details must be negotiated up front in binding agreements. If utilities make grid investments or communities commit resources, developers must be on the hook if a project is delayed or canceled,” the spokesperson said. “Families and local governments shouldn’t be left holding the bag. Wisconsin can support growth and innovation, but only if it’s fair, transparent, and doesn’t raise costs for working families.” 
Kelda Roys 
The Madison-area state senator is a co-sponsor of the Democrats’ data center bill and in an interview with the Examiner, said that as governor she’d support regulation that follows a similar framework to the legislation. 
“I think there needs to be a statewide strategy with guardrails that protect our workers, our environment and our consumers from massive price increases,” she said. “I’m very skeptical of this idea that the biggest and richest and most powerful companies in the world should get to just come in and pick off local communities and local elected leaders one by one and make these sweetheart deals in the dark that screw over the public. And I think in the absence of statewide standards and transparency, that is what is happening.” 
She said the state should use its sway to insert itself as a negotiating party in agreements with data center developers in an effort to keep energy costs low, reduce environmental impact and protect Wisconsin workers. 
She also said that the state government doing something to ease the budget crunch facing local governments will put those local officials in a better position when deciding whether or not to allow a data center to be constructed. 
“Part of the reason that we’re having this problem is that we have put local governments in an impossible situation because of the fiscal mismanagement and the harm of Republican politicians,” she said. “Communities will have more bargaining power when they don’t feel like, ‘Gosh, we’re desperate for more revenue, and our hands are really tied by the state. This is the only option,’ right? They will be in a stronger negotiating position if this is a nice to have, but not a necessary to have. And that’s the position that we want communities to be in. I want Wisconsinites to be able to have a say in our communities’ future, to be able to have an open and transparent process where we can say, ‘actually, we don’t think that this site is an appropriate one for a data center.’”
Josh Schoemann
The Washington County executive said at the November candidate forum there is an “abundance of opportunity” with data centers but that the state needs to be “very, very strategic and smart about where” data centers are built. 
Tom Tiffany 
The Republican congressman and frontrunner in the party’s primary has often opposed the development of large solar farms in and around his northern Wisconsin district, arguing they’ve taken too much of the region’s farmland out of commission. 
In a statement from his campaign, Tiffany said the development of data centers should be handled “responsibly.” 
“As demand for internet infrastructure continues to grow, data centers present new opportunities for economic development, but like any innovation, they must be developed responsibly,” he said. “Wisconsin families and small businesses should not be left footing the bill for increased electricity demand, local residents deserve a seat at the table when decisions are made about these projects, and taxpayer subsidies should not be used to build data centers on productive farmland. Growth should be responsible and transparent, without shifting costs onto existing ratepayers.”

(Photo by Hal Brown/New Jersey Monitor)The Legislature approved a plan Monday to expand New Jersey’s corporate tax breaks by almost $3 billion and grant Newark’s Prudential Center up to $300 million in new tax subsidies.
The votes in the Senate and Assembly came during hourslong voting sessions in the Statehouse in Trenton as the two bodies met for the last time in the 2024-25 legislative session. A new session begins Tuesday at noon.
Divided NJ Legislature gives final passage to three anti-ICE bills

Critics had blasted the bill as irresponsible during a time of fiscal belt-tightening and federal funding cuts.
Several Assembly Republicans slammed the subsidies as “corporate giveaways,” saying legislators should fund small businesses rather than billionaire sports owners and only add new spending that supports residents’ health, safety, and welfare instead of their entertainment.
Assemblyman Erik Peterson (R-Hunterdon) derided Monday — in which the Democratic-led Legislature approved multiple bills that included new spending and tax breaks — as “the majority party’s oligarch day, where we keep giving more and more money away.”
Supporters said the bill includes provisions to safeguard public money, while Prudential Center officials said the arena needs the subsidies to make $400 million in repairs and upgrades to a facility they say is a major economic driver for the city and state.
The Assembly passed the measure by a 49-22 vote, and the Senate, 31-6.
 Paid family leave
More small businesses would be required to offer paid family leave and temporary disability benefits to employees under a bill advanced in both chambers of the Legislature Monday.
The legislation would require employers with as few as 15 workers to offer paid family leave and cut in half the amount of time an employee would have to work annually to be eligible for the benefit. If signed into law, the bill would allow a worker to take paid family leave if they work for at least six months and 500 hours for their employer.
New Jersey law requires businesses to provide eligible workers with up to 12 weeks of paid leave to bond with a new child or to care for a loved one. Workers pay into the fund, and the benefits are based on a worker’s earnings.
The bill would also ensure that workers can return from paid leave to the same position they had before taking it. Advocates say it would include another 1.7 million workers who are not currently covered by the state’s family leave law.
In the Senate, the bill advanced by a vote of 31-7, and in the Assembly, 46-25.
 Magic mushrooms
Lawmakers also passed a bill to legalize therapeutic access to psilocybin, a hallucinogenic compound found in some mushrooms. The bill, which would apply to adults over 21, passed by a 35-4 vote in the Senate and a 48-23 vote in the Assembly.
Supporters say the drug treats chronic mental health disorders more effectively than existing therapies. Critics have complained about the bill’s $6 million price tag (to implement a pilot program) and said state officials should wait for the federal Food and Drug Administration to act, as it’s expected to do this year to approve the use of synthetic psilocybin.
 Cyberharassment
New Jersey lawmakers approved heightened penalties for cyberharassment of elected officials and other public employees in nearly unanimous votes Monday.
Under the legislation, electronic threats and the posting of obscene or lewd material meant to emotionally harm a public servant or their family members could earn between one and five years’ jail time, rather than the 18-month sentence provided for by existing law.
The bill would require the attorney general to promote education and training on cyberharassment and calls on the office to work with social media platforms to tighten harassment policies and create or expand offices dedicated to combating cyberharassment.
The Senate passed the bill 39-0 and in the Assembly the vote was 70-3.

A bill to create an appointed board to oversee district and charter schools in Indianapolis would unfairly dilute electoral power, critics said during a House hearing Monday, while supporters said it would ensure shared accountability and transportation for all students.
House Bill 1423 largely adheres to recommendations the Indianapolis Local Education Alliance submitted in December that would give power over taxes, buildings, and transportation for IPS and charter schools to the Indianapolis Public Education Corporation, which would consist of nine members appointed by the mayor.
The alliance’s recommendations would drastically change Indianapolis schools and reduce the power of the elected IPS school board, and could be replicated in school districts across the state facing declining enrollment and logistical challenges.
The four-hour hearing before the House Education Committee hearing marks the latest phase of state and local officials’ push to remake Indianapolis education, which started with the creation of the ILEA last legislative session and continued with the task force’s meetings in the second half of 2025. While those meetings, especially the final vote, were at times heated, testimony during Monday’s hearing was routine.
The bill doesn’t specify how the new corporation will distribute property tax funds to districts and charter schools, or how it will gain control of buildings that are financed by debt. Lawmakers still have to work out those details, said Rep. Bob Behning the bill’s author and chair of the House Education Committee.

This story was originally published by Chalkbeat. Sign up for their newsletters at ckbe.at/newsletters

However, Behning said the corporation will control — and eventually own — all district and charter buildings. The corporation will also determine a formula to distribute property tax funding.
The bill also doesn’t act on a recommendation from ILEA to increase funding for students with disabilities whose education is provided by IPS at a budget deficit. Lawmakers are unlikely to address that issue in a short session when they don’t discuss a state budget.
At the House committee hearing, supporters of the bill said it would create a shared system of accountability as well as a shared transportation system that would allow students to attend the school of their choice.
“I see students spending hours commuting, families struggling to coordinate rides, and young people missing opportunities simply because reliable transportation is not guaranteed,” said Ma’at Lands, founder and executive director of Rooted School Indianapolis, a charter school.
But dozens of speakers on Monday said the bill would significantly dilute the power of the elected Indianapolis Public Schools board, and that the ILEA ignored overwhelming support for an elected body to oversee schools.
Courtney Hawk, an Indianapolis parent, said she did not vote for an appointed board.
“If they raise my property taxes, I can’t vote them out. I can only hope that the mayor replaces them,” she said of the appointed board. “This violates a fundamental democratic principle: No taxation without representation.”
Bill significantly increases Indianapolis mayor’s power
Should the bill pass, the Indianapolis mayor could begin appointing members to the new corporation board immediately, but would have to do so by June 1.
Rep. Vernon Smith, a Democrat, questioned the idea of giving the Indianapolis mayor the power to appoint all nine members of the corporation board — a comment that earned applause from several people signed up to testify.
The Indianapolis Public Education Corporation would not oversee township school districts. Critics of the bill also said it would leave Center Township families with less electoral power than those in the other 10 school districts in Indianapolis.
“We don’t have a performance crisis that justifies stripping power from voters,” said parent Megan Hise, citing academic growth and graduation rates. “We have a success story that deserves stability and investment.”
But ILEA facilitator Michael O’Connor, who presented the bill at the hearing, said giving the mayor power over transportation, facilities, and uniform accountability “gives people a place to hold them accountable.”
Under the bill, the mayor would also be one of only three entities with the power to authorize charter schools. That’s led to concerns from representatives of Education One, the authorizing arm of Trine University, as well as charter school leaders and GOP Rep. Becky Cash, who said during Monday’s hearing that schools serving students with disabilities often have outside authorizers.
O’Connor said the ILEA frequently heard criticisms that there are too many charter authorizers, contributing to a lack of coherence in the system of education in Indianapolis.
More funding for students with disabilities unlikely
In presenting the recommendations to the House Education Committee, O’Connor said the bill was a faithful reflection of the recommendations of the ILEA — other than addressing the organization’s request for additional funding for students with disabilities.
IPS currently operates its special education program at a deficit of tens of millions of dollars, officials have said. Charter schools would like to continue using district services for their students, O’Connor said.
“Charters would like to utilize what is a very well-run special education program within IPS,” he said. “We believe that it is fair and equitable that that be fully funded, and be a service that could be provided by IPS, but it needs to be better funded by the state.”
But since lawmakers won’t pass a state budget this legislative session, they might be reluctant to discuss such a funding change.
A bill by Democratic Rep. Tonya Pfaff, who sits on the House education committee, calls for a comprehensive study of special education service costs to the state, schools, and families. But it’s unclear if the bill will get a hearing, Behning said.
Supporters like shared accountability for schools, buses, taxes
Speaking in support of the bill, IU Indianapolis student Kelin Peraza-Argueta said the legislation would offer a shared accountability system for schools — something that was missing when she searched for a school for her nephews.
“There were so many questions we had and so many unanswered, and we had no clear way to see which school would be best for them,” she said.
Democratic Rep. Ed DeLaney said the bill also creates oversight for charter schools that now receive or will soon receive property tax revenue under recent legislative changes. It also limits the number of charter authorizers and exempts Indianapolis schools from the $1 building law.
“I don’t see it as a perfect solution, but you’ve got to get to the core problem that generates this bill,” DeLaney said.
During testimony, Democratic Rep. Cherrish Pryror asked whether the city of Indianapolis would now be liable when IPS or charter schools are sued. The new layer of government would make it difficult for parents to know who they should go to with concerns, she said.
“I fear that if this were to go into effect, what we’re really doing is setting up IPS for failure, and it’s going to artificially lead to IPS being worse,” said Rep. Cherrish Pryor during testimony. “And if that happens, the legislature has to own it.”
Behning said the bill would not come back to the committee this week. The committee is meeting again Wednesday. The deadline for bills to pass the full Indiana House before heading to the Indiana Senate is Jan. 29.

The rule, put forward for public comment by the court in late November, would cover most ICE arrests, usually done under civil immigration warrants — which are administrative warrants, not judicial warrants. 
The proposal’s public comment period garnered a huge response, with over 2,500 comments posted to the court’s website over the course of just over a month. Most of the comments were submitted by individuals, but legal organizations such as the State Bar of Michigan Executive Committee and the Michigan State Planning Body also submitted comments in support of the proposed rule. Some elected officials also submitted comments in support, including Attorney General Dana Nessel and state Sens. Mary Cavanagh, Jeremy Moss and Stephanie Chang, all Detroit-area Democrats. 
“This rule update would align Michigan with other states to ensure that individuals conducting legal business at courthouses – regardless of their citizenship status – are able to do so without the concern that they will be subsequently arrested for a matter unrelated to their business at the courthouse,” says the statement from the senators. 
Nessel’s comments directly addressed the potential impact of such a rule on ICE enforcement. 
“The existence of, and ICE’s compliance with, its own prior policies shows that ICE can carry out its operations without making civil arrests in a courthouse. And there is nothing in the proposed amendment to suggest otherwise,” she wrote. “All told, the impact of the proposed amendment on ICE’s operations will be minimal, and any impact is far outweighed by the need to protect and preserve the people’s fundamental right to participation and accountability in the fair administration of justice.”
This rule would align Michigan with a number of other states that have enacted policies to limit ICE actions at courthouses, including New York, Connecticut and Illinois.

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator) A three-year analysis of Louisiana State Police data shows troopers use force against Black people at a rate that’s out of proportion with their share of the state’s population.
Black residents represent 31% of Louisiana population, yet they accounted for 902 use-of-force incidents involving state troopers from 2022-24, or 60.5% of all recorded, according to a data analysis report from Innocence and Justice Louisiana. White residents, who account for 61% of the state population, were involved in 341 or 23%. 
Another 11% of use-of-force incidents were reported with the race of the suspect listed as unknown, which could mean the disparities could be higher or lower, said Esme Lee, data and community coordinator for Innocence and Justice Louisiana.
“There was a high category of unknown citizen race entries in that incident data, so that does limit the precision of our analysis,” Lee said.

Racial disparities were present across all 10 State Police regional troops, with the largest occurring in Troop D in Southwest Louisiana, according to the report. Black and Native American residents in that area were involved in use of force incidents at a rate three times higher than their population percentages.
Capt. Russell Graham, State Police public affairs commander, said the data provided to Innocence and Justice Louisiana doesn’t provide the complete picture. In response to questions about the group’s findings, Graham provided the Illuminator a breakdown for 2024 that separates LSP vehicle pursuit interventions, or how troopers ended chases, from other uses of force. He acknowledged these details were not provided to Innocence and Justice Louisiana for its data analysis.
“While the numbers are accurate, it’s not a fair depiction of our stats,” Graham said about the Innocence and Justice report.
Lee said her organization considered how the FBI collects and reports use-of-force data for its database. The bureau does not exclude vehicle pursuits, listing them as a “reason for initial contact.”
“LSP’s current practice of including pursuits in its use-of-force data is therefore not inconsistent with national standards; rather, it reflects a more granular, tactic-level approach to capturing high-risk enforcement actions,” Lee said. “Reclassifying pursuits outside of use-of-force reporting would reduce transparency and break continuity with both LSP’s historical data and broader accountability norms.”
The State Police breakdown shows troopers ended 303 vehicle pursuits in 2024 with “termination techniques” such as stop spikes and other tire deflation devices. At the end of those pursuits, troopers used their stun guns 33 times, were “hands on” with suspects in 26 incidents and used firearms twice. 
Graham said the vast majority of Louisiana State Police pursuits are related to speeding motorists.
“We’re not looking at anything besides speed,” he said. “You’re not looking at the color of someone’s skin, whether they’re male or female or even what they’re driving. It’s troopers running down the road in one direction, catching somebody speeding in the opposite direction.”
Whether race is a factor in pursuits is analytically distinct from whether their impacts are racially disparate, Lee said. The Innocence and Justice report does not assert Louisiana State Police’s use of force is racially motivated, she stressed. Instead, it documents the disparate outcomes of such incidents.
“The analysis evaluates how policing is experienced and distributed in practice — not the subjective intent of individual officers,” Lee said. “Even when pursuits are initiated for speeding, repeated exposure to police contact, including pursuits, systematically increases the likelihood of escalation, serious use of force and harm. This distinction between causation and impact is intentional and central to the analysis.”
Separate from its vehicle pursuits, State Police reported 73 more “hands on” use-of-force incidents, 20 Taser incidents, two firearm discharges and one use of a chemical agent in 2024. 
After reviewing the data compilation from State Police, Lee noted it includes the same racial discrepancies as her report. It shows 307 Black suspects (64%) were involved in use-of-force and pursuit incidents, compared with 102 white suspects (21%). 
Public has struggled to access police discipline data
Lee’s data work will be uploaded to the Louisiana Law Enforcement Accountability Database, or LLEAD for short. The project that is independent of any policy agency will allow the public to search online for officers with a history of infractions.        
“The genesis of LLEAD was really wanting to be able to track officer histories of conduct and identify those patterns and practices of misconduct in order to aid our own case review,” Lee said, “but also to provide a public resource to individuals to hold officers accountable.” 
The organization, which focuses on post-conviction relief for the wrongly incarcerated, is gathering information from more than 600 police agencies across the state to catalog complaints and use-of-force incidents. 
A state law approved last year requires police departments statewide to report all use-of-force incidents that result in bodily injury. The impetus for the Shantel Arnold Act was a 2021 incident in which a Jefferson Parish sheriff’s deputy was captured dragging the law’s namesake, a Black woman, by her hair and slamming her into the ground. The sheriff’s office settled a civil lawsuit Arnold brought for $300,000, but the agency continued to employ her assailant, Deputy Jose Alvarado, despite a lengthy record of excessive force complaints.
Innocence and Justice is seeking all complaints against law enforcement officers for its database, including those deemed unsubstantiated through internal investigations to avoid instances where departments opted against discipline or dismissal for problem officers, Lee said.
The group has also requested full officer history reports from the Louisiana Peace Officer Standards and Training Council, the state body that certifies police. Lee said the council wants to charge Innocence and Justice $30,000 to fill its public records request, a cost that’s too pricey for the nonprofit. 
Reached by phone, POST Council executive director Jim Craft, a former Lafayette police chief, could not confirm or deny the cost of records provided to Innocence and Justice. He did say a request of that scope would create a tremendous workload for his staff, who he described as “very small and very busy.” The council tracks the status of some 28,000 law enforcement officers in Louisiana. 
State law requires police departments to notify the POST Council in instances of officer misconduct. The council, composed of police chiefs, prosecutors and the state attorney general, can revoke an officer’s certification, often a requirement to hold a job in law enforcement.
The disciplinary reporting also allows police departments to research a job applicant’s work and disciplinary history when hiring. New hires, retirements, resignations and deaths must also be reported, but Craft said not all police agencies provide this information on a timely basis. 
He expressed reservations about the Innocence and Justice LLEAD project because it will include unfounded complaints, resulting in some officers being wrongly “branded.”    
Graham said recent technology upgrades for Louisiana State Police will allow the agency to dive deeper into its use-of-force data so that it could inform training and practices for troopers. An online dashboard to make the information available to the public might also lie ahead, he added. 
Lee said she is encouraged that State Police “is investing resources in transparency and data accessibility.”

Some legislators are questioning the role and necessity of the state's top economic development shop ahead of the budget session.
The post Gov. Gordon asks lawmakers not to defund Wyoming Business Council appeared first on WyoFile .","Gov. Mark Gordon is asking the Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee to continue funding the Wyoming Business Council, as some on the panel question whether the state’s chief economic development office is necessary.
“I understand, it may be time for the Business Council to benefit from more careful scrutiny from the Legislature in how it goes about the tasks assigned to it,” Gordon wrote in a Jan. 7 letter to the committee. “A course correction may be warranted, but a wholesale defunding of the [Business Council] would be counterproductive.”
The letter was sent the same week the committee quizzed Business Council Chief Executive Officer Josh Dorrell about the organization’s successes and shortcomings. Committee members also pondered whether economic development is an appropriate use of state funds.
Appropriations Co-chair John Bear, a Gillette Republican and Wyoming Freedom Caucus member, asserted that offering businesses incentives to come to the state only makes them perpetually reliant on state help, using the analogy of a “self-licking ice cream cone.”

“I don’t think that’s the way free markets were ever intended to work,” Bear said. “My belief is the government has a responsibility to keep taxes and regulations low. That’s it. And that makes an environment where businesses can flourish.”
Sheridan Republican Ken Pendergraft said the Business Council’s mission inherently amounts to “flat out interference” with a free market by picking winners and losers.
It’s true, Dorrell told committee members, that the council discerns between applicants and says yes to some and no to others. It’s also the case, he said, that prior to 2020, it was probably too easy to get a grant from the council. But for the past five years, the council has self-imposed reforms to ensure that it is only “investing” in companies and publicly owned infrastructure that are self-sustaining and fit Wyoming’s economic priorities. 

Wyoming Business Council CEO Josh Dorrell.

“We’re not creating a self-licking ice cream cone where we’re propping businesses up,” Dorrell said. “In fact, if you look at the rule changes that we’ve made and the statutory changes that we’ve requested [from the Legislature], they are actually for self reliance. So what we are doing is in line, in a lot of ways, with what you’re saying.”
The council’s current roster of investments generate an estimated $30 million in annual “economic impact,” according to the organization. The council has also drawn attention over the past year to what it considers a damaging trend of “out-migration” among Wyoming’s youth. Fully addressing Wyoming’s economic development needs, Dorrell has said, might require an investment of up to $1 billion over several years.
The Business Council requested a budget of $112 million for the next biennium, or two-year budget cycle. But Gordon, in his recommendation to lawmakers, trimmed the request to $54.6 million. The governor did not include nearly $50 million for an ongoing broadband buildout effort.
Dorrell noted that in addition to his agency’s budget request, it is also asking lawmakers to join the council and its stakeholders in a longer discussion about how to realign the organization with a changing economic and political environment.
“We are very willing to not defend our programs, or to defend the efforts that we’ve taken so far, but rather to seek out the problem and address it with the right statutes and the right investment mechanisms. That’s what you have in front of you,” Dorrell said.

The question of whether economic development is the proper role of state government, Dorrell added, makes for a good discussion. But it doesn’t change the fact that Wyoming is in stiff competition with every state in the nation, he said, because they all heavily invest in economic development strategies that include business recruitment.
“You have to be able to compete. And the way you compete is interesting and it’s hard to explain. But you at least compete,” Dorrell told the committee.
Laramie Democrat Trey Sherwood said she likes the idea of a coordinated effort between the Legislature, Business Council and stakeholders to fully examine the organization and potentially craft reforms.
“It’s something I’m definitely interested in as an interim topic,” Sherwood said, “to really do a deep dive into your statutes and figure out what is no longer serving our businesses and our communities and where there’s programs that we could align with our shared values — to really build out strong communities and let the world know that we are absolutely open for business.”
Gordon, in his letter to the committee, implored committee leaders to examine, but not defund, the council.
“Throwing the baby out with the bath water would be short-sighted and significantly diminish Wyoming’s ability to compete successfully in President Trump’s considered efforts to bring industry back to America,” he wrote. “Wyoming always sought to get to ‘yes’ with the private sector. Defunding the state economic development agency is a flashing neon sign that Wyoming is ‘closed.'”
Though the Appropriations committee holds sway over budgeting decisions, the fate of the Business Council’s budget won’t be known until the full Legislature takes up the issue in February.

Special general council meeting Saturday to address “nepotism,"" ""conflict of interest"" and ""removal of 6 current business council members” resulted in standstill of all business. 
The post Eastern Shoshone Business Council upheaval closes tribal government office appeared first on WyoFile .","FORT WASHAKIE—Closure notices were posted on the darkened Eastern Shoshone Business Council office doors Monday, two days after a special tribal council meeting threw the leadership panel into upheaval.
“The Eastern Shoshone Business Council (ESBC) is shutting down the tribal offices effective on January 12th, 2026, until the Non-Sanctioned Eastern Shoshone Council Meeting Actions are resolved through tribal court,” the hot-pink notice read. 
The business council governs the tribe, one of two on the Wind River Reservation, overseeing tasks such as enacting tribal law and managing resources for the Eastern Shoshone people.

Because the office was closed, no individuals were available to answer questions. 
But notices and comments posted on the tribe’s Facebook account indicate all six members of the business council were removed by a vote of the general council during Saturday’s special meeting. The validity of that meeting and vote are now being challenged.  
Going into the meeting, current members on the panel included Chairman Wayland Large, along with Clinton Glick, Gloria St. Clair, Gus Thayer, Stanford Ware and Latonna Snyder. 
An agenda shared on the Eastern Shoshone Tribe’s Facebook Page on Dec. 30 listed as business items: “nepotism,” “mismanagement of Shoshone Rose Casino & Hotel” and “removal of all (6) current Shoshone Business Council Members.”
General council meetings are open to all enrolled members who are 18 or older. A quorum of 75 must be met within a certain time and all members vote. Roughly 4,000 enrolled Eastern Shoshone tribal members live on the reservation, according to the Interior Department.

According to Facebook chatter on Monday, a quorum did indeed vote to oust the panel and replace it with six new individuals. 
However, Monday’s notice on the office door — as well as prior public notices the tribe released — indicate challenges to the procedural validity of the petition at the center of the conflict and describe Saturday’s meeting actions as “non-sanctioned.”
All finances and business will be at a standstill as the offices are closed, according to the notice. 
“We apologize for any financial inconvenience this may cause you at this time,” the notice read. “We want to reassure you that we are working diligently to resolve these matters in a timely manner.”

Wyoming voters already amended the state constitution to guarantee residents' right to make their own health care decisions, columnist Kerry Drake writes.
The post Freedom Caucus, Gordon need to accept abortion bans’ overturn appeared first on WyoFile .","When far-right legislators who crafted and passed two laws banning abortions in Wyoming learned that those laws were declared unconstitutional by the state’s Supreme Court last Tuesday, I wondered what their next move would be.

Opinion

It didn’t take long to find out. The Joint Appropriations Committee, with six of its seven House members aligned with the Freedom Caucus and a senator who sponsored one of the bans, hid from the public that afternoon in a private meeting where they discussed how to punish the high court.
Fortunately, several people with direct knowledge of the meeting disclosed to WyoFile that the JAC talked about shrinking the Wyoming Supreme Court from five members to three.
Rep. Abby Angelos, R-Gillette, who called for the executive session, later told WyoFile that such a closed meeting is allowed under state law for members seeking legal counsel on an issue — in this case the judiciary’s budget. But it doesn’t take a lawyer to know that the Wyoming Constitution says the state’s high court can operate with three to five members. What did they need legal counsel for?
If the discussion was about the state budget, which the committee oversees, it should have been open to the public so everyone can hear why members think the court and budget should be shrunk. Whenever a Freedom Caucus member repeats its leadership’s claim that it wants to improve government transparency, raucous laughter is an appropriate response.
The official Freedom Caucus take on the ruling called it “a stain on the Wyoming judicial branch.” 
“After decades of liberal leadership in the governor’s office, the State Supreme Court has been filled with jurists who reject basic biology and human dignity,” the statement said. 
In the nearly six decades I’ve lived in Wyoming, we’ve never had what I would call a liberal governor. The majority of justices during that time have focused on what the law says, not a political ideology.
The current court interpreted a 2012 amendment to the state constitution to mean exactly what the majority of voters approved: “Each competent adult shall have the right to make his or her own health care decisions.”
Ironically, the idea for the amendment was the work of right-wing lawmakers trying to undermine the Affordable Care Act, which they derisively called Obamacare. 



The strategy backfired for them on abortion. Today’s Freedom Caucus and other anti-abortion advocates in the Legislature should have learned a lesson from their predecessors, who wildly ran down the railroad track to repeal Roe v. Wade at any cost and didn’t foresee that their own amendment was the train that would eventually run them over.
This coalition will keep blaming Wyoming’s fictitious “liberal leadership” for their court loss on the ill-conceived abortion bans, but if they want to know who’s really responsible, they should look in a mirror.
When the two abortion bans were immediately challenged in a lawsuit filed by OB-GYNs, a Casper women’s clinic, a pro-choice organization and women of childbearing age, the state argued that abortion isn’t health care. 
It’s a patently absurd position. A procedural or surgical abortion can only be obtained from a licensed physician, and a medication abortion must be prescribed by doctor and the medication dispensed by a certified pharmacy. Abortion care is included in medical training, clinical practice, and continuing medical education.
Here’s part of what the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says:
“Induced abortion is an essential component of women’s health care. Like all medical matters, decisions regarding abortion should be made by patients in consultation with their health care providers and without undue influence by outside parties.”
Here’s more common sense advice from the group: “Like all patients, women obtaining abortion are entitled to privacy, dignity, respect and support.” The Legislature’s bans stripped all of these from women.
As much as anti-abortion advocates demand the authority to tell women what reproductive health choices they must make, the Wyoming Constitution tells government officials and others to butt out because it’s none of their business. I’m grateful the state has a Supreme Court that stood up and upheld women making their own decisions about their bodies.
The JAC made no changes to the composition of the Wyoming Supreme Court last week, but that doesn’t mean the panel or individual legislators won’t try during the upcoming budget session. But I doubt they’ll get very far with reducing the size of the court, and there’s no guarantee it would change the court’s ruling on abortion.
What appears most likely to happen during the 20-day budget session that begins Feb. 9 is an anti-abortion constitutional amendment called for by Gov. Mark Gordon. Two legislators he’s often at odds with, House Speaker Chip Neiman, R-Hulett, and Sen. Cheri Steinmetz, R-Lingle, are already drafting a resolution to put the issue on the 2026 general election ballot.
I’m disappointed in Gordon’s response to the ruling. It may not have the clueless outrage that Secretary of State Chuck Gray expressed when he said it was a “left–wing activist decision totally out of touch with the Wyoming Constitution,” but it’s not far off.
Gordon called the decision “profoundly unfortunate” and said it “sadly serves to only prolong the ultimate proper resolution of this issue.”
Even more concerning was the governor’s statement that the legal question may be settled “for the time being,” but it doesn’t settle “the moral one, nor does it reflect where many Wyoming citizens stand,” including himself.
No one gets exactly the government he or she wants. Even the governor only gets one vote (and the power of the veto), and it’s not good public policy to keep demanding voters be asked the same question until the outcome meets someone’s personal moral code.
A 1994 ballot initiative banning abortion in Wyoming was soundly defeated, and the 2012 amendment guaranteeing citizens the right to make their own health care decisions was overwhelmingly approved. Now the Supreme Court has voted 4-1 to overturn two abortion bans.
Wyoming doesn’t need to give anti-abortion zealots another bite of the apple. But if lawmakers insist on it, voters need to say loud and clear that it’s not the government’s business to interfere with rights guaranteed in our state’s constitution.

It’s no longer about restraint, sovereignty or minding our own business. Under Donald Trump—and with Sen. Steve Daines cheering from the cheap seats—it’s now “War First, Diplomacy Last,” with the Constitution treated like a suggestion, not a rule.
Consider Venezuela. Trump orders a military strike, bombs Caracas, captures the country’s leader, seizes oil reserves, and then casually announces the United States will “run” the country. You know—just a light, totally-not-a-war war. Nothing to see here.
When the Senate finally did what the Constitution explicitly requires—voting to reassert Congress’s authority over war—every senator in the chamber made a choice.
Every senator, that is, except one.
Five Republicans—Rand Paul, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Todd Young, and Josh Hawley—voted with Democrats to advance a bipartisan war powers resolution blocking further U.S. military action in Venezuela without congressional approval. They did so knowing Trump would attack them for it. He did. He said they should “never be elected to office again.”
They voted anyway.
And Sen. Steve Daines of Montana?
He was the only U.S. senator who did not vote.
Not “no.” Not even an “I support war but own it” vote. Just absent. Missing. Vanished. When the Constitution called roll, Steve Daines was nowhere to be found.
That matters. This wasn’t a symbolic gesture or a messaging vote. It was Congress asserting its Article I authority—the power to decide when America goes to war. The very power the Founders withheld from kings, emperors, and presidents who wake up feeling decisive.
Everyone else showed up. Daines alone chose not to.
This is especially rich given that Daines has been perfectly comfortable praising the operation afterward. He applauded “peace through strength,” because nothing says peace quite like bombing a capital city and announcing you’ll “run” another country. He eagerly echoed Trump’s language about Nicolas Maduro being a narco-terrorist—perhaps true, but also completely beside the constitutional point.
The Senate vote wasn’t about whether Maduro was a bad guy. It was about whether one man gets to drag the United States into open-ended conflict without congressional approval.
Five Republicans answered that question with courage.
Steve Daines answered it with silence.
This isn’t an accident or a scheduling mishap. Daines has a record. He has previously voted against war powers limits and consistently sides with expanding presidential authority over Congress’s role. When it came time to put that position on the record—when Montanans could clearly see where he stood—he opted out.
That’s not leadership. That’s political cowardice dressed up as absence.
Montanans deserve better. They deserve a senator who shows up for the hardest votes, not one who hides when the Constitution becomes inconvenient. Daines owes this state an explanation—why he alone failed to vote, why he ducked accountability, and why cheering war is easy but defending Congress’s role is apparently too much trouble.
America First has become War First.
Diplomacy last.
And Steve Daines?

Jason Zachary of Knoxville telling a group that Sexton had been working with the White House for six weeks on immigration policy.
“It is strong legislation,” Zachary said on the video. “The president’s behind us. The president has promised his support on social media for us, and we are being told Tennessee will go first.”
Zachary confirmed Monday that Sexton met with White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, believed to be largely responsible for the zealous efforts by Immigration and Customs Enforcement to deport immigrants without permanent legal documentation. 










Now that we have a willing federal partner in this fight, the legislature will be working hand in hand with the Trump administration to protect our citizens from the illegal immigration scourge that has gone on far too long.


– Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, R-Oak Ridge


Massive deployment of ICE nationally has led to at least five deaths, including the shooting of 37-year-old Rene Nicole Good by an ICE officer in Minneapolis last week, sparking protests nationwide. 
The Trump administration claims the shooting was justified, while critics of ICE deployment say it was avoidable and want the agency to stop its operations.
Immigration traditionally has fallen under the purview of the federal government. But Tennessee lawmakers have grown more active on immigration restrictions, last year creating an immigration enforcement bureau whose operations are exempt from the Public Records Act. 
In addition to setting up an immigration czar and division, the bureau makes grants to local law enforcement agencies for immigration enforcement.
Zachary, a Knoxville Republican, said Tennessee House and Senate leadership met four to five weeks ago and discussed plans for immigration bills.
“Everybody is on board,” he said on the video.
Lawmakers are likely to bring back a bill that passed the Senate requiring school districts to check students’ immigration status and either charge tuition or block enrollment. The House version of the bill ran into constitutional problems and the possibility it could cost the state $1.1 billion for violating laws against discrimination.
McNally, an Oak Ridge Republican, said Monday, “Tennessee has long been a beacon for state-led immigration restriction and this session will be no different. The federal government under President Trump has put a priority on sealing our borders and hastening the return of illegal immigrants to their native lands. We will do all we can to assist in that effort.”
None of the bills have been filed yet, but the Republican-led legislature will work to “aggressively enforce” and strengthen laws against undocumented immigration and improve cooperation with federal authorities, McNally said.
Legislation is expected to ensure no immigrants without legal documentation receive public benefits and that people who live in the state, including students, are in the country legally, McNally said. He added that legislation will target those who interfere with ICE enforcement to punish them “severely.”
“Now that we have a willing federal partner in this fight, the legislature will be working hand in hand with the Trump administration to protect our citizens from the illegal immigration scourge that has gone on far too long,” he said in the statement.
Tennessee law already prohibits immigrants without legal documentation from receiving public benefits. It also requires students without documentation to pay out-of-state tuition at public universities.










When the majority signals yet another round of 'crackdown' legislation, we should be honest about what this is: not a thoughtful public safety strategy, but a political strategy — one that targets immigrant families to score points while working people are struggling with rising costs.


– Sen. London Lamar, D-Memphis


Local officials and governments that decline to participate in immigration actions could be a target.
Metro Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell caught the ire of key lawmakers and federal officials this summer because of an executive order requiring city employees’ interactions with immigration officials to be reported promptly. He was also accused of “doxing” federal agents in publishing several of their names on a public website, though those were said to be inadvertent and then redacted.
Scrutiny of the Nashville mayor started after he made critical comments about immigration stops by ICE and the Tennessee Highway Patrol over two days in May in South Nashville, home to many immigrant residents.
Democrats are not expected to support the bills, saying lawmakers should focus on kitchen table issues such as cutting the cost of living.
Sen. London Lamar, a Memphis Democrat, said immigrants are being forced to bear the brunt of a Republican agenda.
“Tennessee Republicans have already made life extraordinarily difficult for undocumented people in our state. So when the majority signals yet another round of ‘crackdown’ legislation, we should be honest about what this is: not a thoughtful public safety strategy, but a political strategy — one that targets immigrant families to score points while working people are struggling with rising costs,” Lamar said.
Memphis lawmaker wants to make safe havens from ICE

Democratic Rep. Gabby Salinas has filed a bill that would prohibit ICE from going into public schools and churches, creating a safe haven for immigrants.
The Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition criticized the plan, saying lawmakers are avoiding important matters such as fully funding schools, reducing the sales tax on groceries and making health care more affordable.
“This reveals how desperate these elected officials are: they’re collaborating with Stephen Miller, a known white supremacist, to distract us from their failure to help our families put food on the table or fully fund our schools,” said Lisa Sherman Luna, executive director of TIRRC.
Luna said Miller has “proudly” separated families as part of the administration’s deportation policy and stated that he wants “zero” refugees or immigrants in the country regardless of legal status.
She predicted more people than ever will be ready to turn out at the Capitol and contact representatives in protest of the legislation.
TIRRC reported a new national poll shows 42% of Americans want to abolish ICE amid grassroots support for removing the agency from the state. More than 1,100 people signed a letter calling for ICE to leave Tennessee, and nearly 1,000 residents attended Nashville and Memphis vigils to mourn Good’s death and seek accountability. 
ICE is playing a key role in the Memphis Safe Task Force where federal agencies are combining with state and local law enforcement, as well as the Tennessee National Guard, for suppression of crime and undocumented immigration.
Fifty percent of those surveyed by Civiqs opposed abolishing ICE, led by males at 58% and Republicans at 85%.

The colorless gas seeped from relatively few industrial facilities and commanded little public attention.
All that changed in 2016, when the Environmental Protection Agency completed a study that found the chemical is 30 times more carcinogenic than previously thought.
The agency then spent years updating regulations that protect millions of people who are most exposed to the compound. In 2024, the EPA approved stricter rules that require commercial sterilizers for medical equipment and large chemical plants to slash emissions of ethylene oxide, which causes lymphoma and breast cancer.
It was doing what the EPA has done countless times: revising rules based on new scientific knowledge.
Now, its ability to do that for many air pollutants is under threat.

In government records that have flown under the radar, President Donald Trump’s EPA said it is reconsidering whether the agency had the legal authority to update those rules.
Chemical companies and their trade organizations have argued that the EPA cannot reevaluate hazardous air pollution rules to account for newly discovered harms if it has revised them once already.
It doesn’t matter if decades have passed or new information has emerged.
If the EPA agrees, environmentalists fear that the decision could have wide implications, significantly curbing the EPA’s ability to limit nearly 200 pollutants from thousands of industrial plants. The next time new science reveals that a chemical is much more toxic, or that the amount of pollution released from a factory had been underestimated and would cause legally unacceptable health risks, the agency would not be able to react.
“It’s a poor reflection on this administration’s claim that they are actually interested in clean air,” said Ana Baptista, a professor of environmental policy and sustainability management at The New School. “By saying we’re no longer going to consider science, it’s abdicating your mission.”
The EPA didn’t address ProPublica’s questions about the ethylene oxide reevaluation or its broader implications. Instead, the agency pointed to a March press release about how it was reconsidering multiple air pollution rules issued by President Joe Biden’s administration, including the ones for chemical plants and commercial sterilizers. “EPA is committed to using the gold standard of science during these reviews,” a spokesperson said in an email. “Since day one, EPA has been clear that providing clean air, water, and land for all Americans is a top priority.”
The EPA’s reconsideration focuses on the Clean Air Act, the country’s most powerful air quality law, which regulates hazardous air pollutants for different types of industrial operations. There’s a specific rule for oil refineries, for instance, and another for steel mills. Within eight years after each rule is published, the EPA is required to conduct an assessment, called a residual risk review, to decide if an update is necessary.

These assessments use detailed data on the quantity of emissions coming from each facility, the toxicity of each chemical and other information on how the chemicals are released and dispersed in the air. The combined data reveals how the emissions put local residents at risk of cancer, respiratory diseases, reproductive harm and other health problems.
If the EPA determines the overall risks exceed what’s allowed under the law, the agency must tighten the rules.
The Clean Air Act doesn’t say whether the EPA is required to conduct additional residual risk reviews after the first one. Nor does it specifically prohibit the agency from doing so.
As far back as 2006, the EPA under President George W. Bush asserted that the agency had the right to revisit and revise the rules based on risk.
The issue became newly relevant in 2021, when the EPA’s Office of Inspector General cited the new conclusions about the toxicity of ethylene oxide. The office estimated that nearly half a million Americans were exposed to unacceptable cancer risks from industrial emissions by chemical plants, commercial sterilizers and other facilities pumping out ethylene oxide.
In its report, the inspector general’s office advised the agency to “exercise its discretionary authority to conduct new residual risk reviews” as needed when “new data or information indicates an air pollutant is more toxic than previously determined.” (The inspector general was a Trump appointee.)
The EPA had already conducted the first, mandatory risk reviews for large chemical plants and commercial sterilizers in the early 2000s. In response to the inspector general report, the agency launched additional reviews using the updated science on ethylene oxide. Ultimately, the EPA determined the health risks were unacceptable and revised the rules to lower them. The agency asserted that the Clean Air Act “does not limit our discretion or authority to conduct another risk review should we consider that such review is warranted.”
Louisiana’s LNG export boom will fuel higher electricity costs, report finds

According to the EPA’s estimates, the new regulations for chemical plants under the 2024 revised rule would cut the number of nearby residents who are exposed to unacceptable cancer risks from 90,000 to 3,000.
But the chemical industry opposed the stricter rules. Industry representatives disagreed with the EPA’s new assessment of ethylene oxide, contending that it overestimated the risk the chemical posed, and argued the agency didn’t have the authority to conduct those risk reviews. In a 2023 letter, the American Chemistry Council said “the Agency has erred in conducting a new risk review,” as “the plain text” of the Clean Air Act “indicates that EPA actually lacks this authority.”
Similarly, the Louisiana Chemical Association submitted public comments on the chemical plant rule stating the “EPA has no statutory authority to conduct a second risk review” and that doing so was “arbitrary and capricious.”
David Cresson, president and CEO of the association, told ProPublica that the trade group supports “protecting the public’s health through regulatory frameworks that are lawful, while remaining based in sound science.”
Brendan Bradley, a spokesperson for the American Chemistry Council, said the organization had no further comment on the issue.
After Trump was inaugurated, one of his appointees to the EPA let the industry know the agency was conducting a “reconsideration” of the two rules focused on ethylene oxide emissions. Last spring, Principal Deputy Assistant Administrator Abigale Tardif, a former oil and gas lobbyist, hinted at how the EPA might challenge those rules.
In letters addressed to trade groups representing commercial sterilizers and chemical plants, Tardif said the agency was reconsidering multiple issues related to the rules, including the “EPA’s authority and decision to undertake a second residual risk review” under the Clean Air Act, as well as “the analysis and determinations made in that review, and the resulting risk standards.”
Tardif didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Lawsuits over Ascension economic records challenge secrecy of industrial deals

The agency also filed a regulatory notice about its plans to revise the 2024 chemical plant rule. Citing the part of the Clean Air Act that deals with the updated rule assessments, the notice said the EPA had “identified items for reconsideration around its CAA section 112(f)(2) residual risk review authority.”
While the stricter ethylene oxide rules are technically still in effect, the Trump administration has exempted dozens of large chemical plants and sterilizer facilities from following them as the agency works through a formal process that is widely expected to result in watered-down standards.
If the Trump EPA does decide it lacks the legal authority to conduct multiple risk reviews, the agency might still have the authority to strengthen hazardous air pollution rules by using a separate part of the Clean Air Act, said Abel Russ, a senior attorney at the Environmental Integrity Project, an advocacy group. That section of the act allows the EPA to update a rule if agency scientists conclude that better pollution-control technology is affordable and available. But limiting the agency’s ability to conduct residual risk reviews would be a serious blow to the act, Russ said, “kneecapping” the agency’s authority over these toxic pollutants.
Environmental groups will almost certainly sue if the EPA concludes it does not have the legal authority to revise hazardous air pollution rules more than once based on risk. Russ called industry’s comments absurd and said they don’t account for the reality that our knowledge of industrial pollution is changing all the time.
As ProPublica reported in October, the agency recently received clear evidence that many industrial facilities are leaking far more pollution than the companies that own them previously reported. In 2023, researchers who conducted their own air monitoring in the industrial corridor of Louisiana known as Cancer Alley found much higher concentrations of ethylene oxide than expected. For more than half the areas they sampled, the local cancer risk from ethylene oxide would be unacceptable if residents were exposed to these concentrations over a lifetime.
If the EPA decides it lacks the legal authority to conduct multiple risk reviews, it would find itself in the position of not being able to take action even if the agency confirmed similar results.
“The whole premise of risk assessment is that it’s based on the best available science,” said Kimberly Terrell, a research scientist at the Environmental Integrity Project. As our knowledge grows, researchers tend to find that chemicals are linked to additional health effects, she added, so blocking these updates “pretty much ensures” the EPA is underestimating the risks.

Bryan Smith, R-Taylor, will return to the West Virginia Capitol for the 2026 legislative session in a wheelchair after numerous surgeries in the last year left him partially paralyzed. (Photo by Amelia Ferrell Knisely/West Virginia Watch)West Virginia House member Bryan Smith will return this session in a wheelchair after numerous surgeries in the last year left him partially paralyzed.
Smith, 55, will reside in a medical facility during session and be transported to the state Capitol for the 60-day legislative session, which begins Wednesday. 
“My number one motivation is I didn’t want to feel that I was letting my county and my district down,” said Smith, a Republican who was sworn in last year to represent Taylor County and a sliver of Marion County. He replaced long-time House member and Republican Amy Summers, who retired from the Legislature.
“I want to do the very best I can for Taylor County and District 73,” Smith said. 
His medical emergency began last May, not long after the 2025 legislative session ended. Smith underwent a surgery that resulted in serious complications, including internal bleeding. It prompted an emergency surgery.
After returning home to Grafton, West Virginia, Smith said that in late July, his dog kept whining while putting her paw and head on his stomach where he felt pain.
“She kept continuing on, so finally I said, ‘Hey, if you’re if you’re this concerned, then we were having it checked out,’ and I’m glad we did, because when we finally got down to down to the emergency room at Ruby Hospital, come to find out that I had an internal hernia,” Smith said. 
After a series of other medical issues and surgeries, including having part of his bowel removed and a back operation, Smith woke up Dec. 2 without feeling in his legs.
Smith said medical professionals have “no idea what caused me to be paralyzed.” He has since regained some feeling in his toes and legs but remains dependent on a wheelchair. 
Medical staff will assist Smith during his day at the state Capitol, where he serves on numerous committees.  Smith works as an administrative assistant at West Virginia University Medicine; he said his work is providing his medical assistance during this time.
“I do have a little bit of movement in both my legs so that’s one reason [WVU Medicine] transferred me down here, because I’m not ready to resign because I didn’t want to leave Taylor county unrepresented,” Smith said.
“If I could find a way to make it happen, I wanted to, and if I couldn’t, I was willing to step down,” he added.
The state Capitol, completed in the 1930s, can be difficult to navigate in a wheelchair due to its layout and tight spaces. 
“There’s a lot of tight spaces, especially getting out of the offices is very, very tight … and getting through security and through the metal detectors, I about took one out the other day,” he said.
Smith’s desk was moved in the House Chamber to accommodate his wheelchair. 
In his first year, Smith sponsored or cosponsored 57 pieces of legislation, including a bill that will enact stricter voter ID requirements this year. The measure, signed into law by Gov. Patrick Morrisey, requires a photo ID — typically a driver’s license, passport or a resident identification card — to vote in-person. It eliminated several previously accepted options at polling places that can validate identity, including a Medicaid card and utility bill.
Smith joined other House Republicans last year to sponsor a bill that would prohibit homeless people from camping on public property throughout West Virginia. The measure sought to impose fines of up to $500 and up to 30 days in jail for homeless people who use camping paraphernalia, including tarps, cots, beds, sleeping bags, blankets or portable cooking facilities and similar equipment on governmental or public property, grounds or lawns. It passed the House but the Senate did not take the bill up for a vote.
This year, he plans to focus on an anti-spoofing bill to protect residents and developing what he called a comprehensive approach to helping West Virginians who are facing homelessness and substance use disorder.
“We need to get them help, true help, and give them an opportunity to get back on their feet,” Smith said. “So that’s something that’s very dear to me.”
House Speaker Roger Hanshaw has told reporters that the Republican-led House will be focused on economic development and job creation during the upcoming 60-day session. As part of a focus on workforce development, Hanshaw said lawmakers will be eyeing another pay raise for the state’s teachers and school service personnel.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Gov. Tony Evers, who is entering his final year in office, is calling on lawmakers to help him accomplish some of his priorities in 2026 including providing property tax relief and taking action to blunt the effect of cost-shifting from the federal government to states by the Trump administration.
Evers decided to not run for a third term last year, leading to the first open race for governor since 2010. During a press briefing Monday, he told reporters “nope” when asked if he had thoughts on who in the crowded Democratic primary field could best build on his work.
While he wouldn’t comment on the field, Evers said that working on affordability in Wisconsin would be one of his top priorities — and likely one of the top issues in the 2026 campaign cycle. 
Evers said he is focusing on what can be accomplished in the final year of his term rather than what he and his wife may do once he retires from office. 
“We’ve worked hard for seven years and… we have a year left and it’s not all about me. All of the things that need to be addressed, many of them can be. I feel very strongly that legacy is just doing the right thing for the people of Wisconsin,” Evers said, adding he wants to leave Wisconsin in “a better place.” 
The Wisconsin Legislature has work days scheduled through March, though Evers said work may need to go into April to get the state’s business accomplished. He said lawmakers could run for office and work at the same time. 
“I think it will help no matter who is running for reelection, both the Republicans and Democrats, actually spending some time not getting out of town as early as possible and let’s do some things for the people of Wisconsin,” Evers said. “It’s bad politics to say we’re done in February, we’re done in March and we’ll see you at the polls.” 
Evers said 2026 is starting after a year of “historic and bipartisan wins” for Wisconsinites. He highlighted actions taken in the state budget including providing state funding directly to child care centers, increasing school funding and investing in the University of Wisconsin system, and said he wants to build on that work in the rest of his term. “Our budget was a win for Wisconsin kids, families and our state’s future, but there’s no denying the final budget looked different from what I proposed,” he said. 
Evers noted that the state ended the fiscal year with nearly $4 billion in reserves and $2 billion in a rainy day fund. He said projections from the Department of Revenue that will be released soon show that the state could also bring in as much as $1 billion more than this year. 
Tax relief, school funding
Evers said one of his top priorities is taking action to soften the impact of property tax increases. He called on lawmakers, again, to pass a slate of policies he has proposed that could result in $1.3 billion in tax relief. 
Wisconsin taxpayers’ December bills included the highest increase since 2018 — the result, in part, of Evers’ controversial 400-year line-item veto, which extended a two-year increase in the amount of money districts can raise from local property taxpayers for centuries into the future, as well as lawmakers’ decision to not provide additional state aid to schools, pushing many districts to use their additional taxing authority and others to go to referendum, asking local residents to pay more.
“Look, I get it: Republicans love to blame my 400-year veto for property taxes going up,” Evers said. “The problem with that is Wiscosinites were going to referendum before increasing the number of years — long before. The question would be why? Because of a decade of Republicans consistently failing to meaningfully invest in our kids and K-12 schools. That has consequences including forcing Wisconsinites to raise their own property taxes.” 
Evers said that he wasn’t saying relief needs to be accomplished in one particular way, but that the state will be in a “world of hurt” if nothing is done about property taxes.
Proposals on the issue that he has suggested include a state program to encourage local governments to freeze property taxes, increasing state aid to public schools to help reduce tax levies and increasing the school levy tax credit. 
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) has also named lowering property taxes as one of his top priorities for the year, though he and other Republicans have focused on the school revenue limit increases that are in place due to the partial veto Evers issued on the 2023 state budget. Evers brushed off the criticism, saying school districts were seeking property tax increases through referendum way before his veto.
“Before that 400-year veto, we were going to referendum all the time, so they can use that as an excuse if they want but let’s just get this done,” Evers said. 
Evers also called on lawmakers to provide additional funding for special education. He and lawmakers put funding in the budget they calculated would bring the state’s share of special ed costs to 42% of districts’ expenses in the first year of the budget and 45% in the second year, but the Department of Public Instruction has issued revised numbers showing that the funding allocated in the budget likely won’t be enough to meet those rates.
“This has to be fixed before the Legislature goes home this year. I’m calling on the Legislature to invest the necessary funding to ensure the agreed upon percentages… are met — or better yet, make the appropriation sum sufficient,” Evers said. Sum-sufficient appropriations are not fixed amounts of money but cover costs for programs even if they fluctuate.
Evers also said lawmakers should take action to exclude certain items including diapers, toothpaste and over-the-counter medications from the state’s sales tax. 
Evers said he is also open to looking at Republican proposals to eliminate taxes on overtime and tips but wants to consider more “universal” forms of tax relief. Republican lawmakers have been working to advance proposals that would align state tax policies with the new federal policies that were adopted last year.
Dealing with the Trump administration  
In his letter to lawmakers, Evers told them they may need to take action to blunt the effects of Trump administration policies. 
“With more chaos being created every day in Washington, new challenges continue to emerge and evolve that deserve our immediate focus and attention,” Evers wrote to lawmakers. “This includes responding to President Donald Trump’s and Republicans in Congress’ ongoing efforts to shift hundreds of millions of dollars in federal program costs to Wisconsin taxpayers and our state’s future budgets.” 
A recent change to federal law means that the state could be at risk of losing more than $200 million annually in federal funds for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) program if the benefit payment error rate climbs above a certain level.
Evers told reporters that he is in conversations with lawmakers about a potential investment to ensure that the error rate for the state’s Foodshare program remains low. The state Department of Health Services has said that $69 million would help implement quality-control measures and cover the cuts the federal government has made to administrative costs.
The Trump administration has also recently frozen funds to five Democratic-run states, including Minnesota, due to child care fraud while also increasing reporting requirements for states receiving child care funds to cover services for low-income kids. 
Evers said Wisconsin, not one of the five, is in a good position to ensure accountability in the system as the state already made significant changes after a fraud scandal like Minnesota’s was uncovered in Wisconsin more than 15 years ago.
A 2009 Pulitzer prize-winning investigation by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel uncovered significant fraud within the state’s WisconsinShares program that led to criminal indictments and prompted the state to implement protections. 
“We’re making sure we’re doing everything and we are in a good place,” Evers said. “There’s lots of auditing going on… so I think we’re in a great place.”
ICE shooting in Minneapolis
Evers told reporters that it is a “huge mistake” by President Donald Trump to exclude Minnesota from the investigation into the death of Renee Good at the hands of an ICE agent last week.
“Should the people of Minnesota or Minneapolis be a part of that investigation? Hell yes,” Evers said. “When the federal government comes in and talks about things in terms of you’re going to do this or that… you want to be part of the conversation and there’s none of that going on.” 
Evers said in response to a question about whether ICE was welcome in Wisconsin, “We can handle ourselves, frankly. I don’t see the need for the federal government to be coming into our state and making decisions that we can make at the state level.” 
However, Evers stopped short of endorsing a proposal from Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez that would bar ICE from certain areas.
Rodriguez, who is running in the Democratic primary for governor, proposed on Monday that the state ban ICE from courthouses, hospitals and health clinics, licensed child-care centers and daycares, schools and institutions of higher education, domestic violence shelters and places of worship unless there is a warrant or an imminent threat to public safety.
Evers said when asked about the proposal that he would look at it, but that “banning things will absolutely ramp up the actions of the folks in Washington D.C.”
Evers on what else might get accomplished in 2026
Evers said he is “confident” there will soon be a proposal to release $125 million in state funds to fight PFAS contamination that members from both sides of the aisle can support. He said his administration has spent the last several months in conversation with Republican lawmakers on the issue to try to reach a compromise.
Evers said that he hopes they will be able to do the same for the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship program, which is set to expire this year. 
Evers said he is open to exploring options for getting WisconsinEye, the nonprofit that provided livestream coverage of state government similar to C-Span until it went dark last month, back online, but said he isn’t supportive of just giving the nonprofit state funds without a match requirement.
WisEye  went offline  Dec. 15 due to financial difficulties. There is $10 million in state funding for the organization that was set aside by lawmakers and Evers for an endowment, but the organization has to raise matching funds to access it.
“I think there has to be some skin in the game,” Evers said of WisEye. 
The organization launched a GoFundMe on Monday to help raise $250,000, which would cover its expenses for three months. By the end of the day, the organization had raised more than  $4,000.
Evers also called on lawmakers to pass legislation that would extend Medicaid coverage for new mothers from 60 days to a year. Vos has opposed the bill and stopped it from receiving a vote in the Assembly, even as it passed the Senate with only one opposing vote and has more than 70 Assembly cosponsors.
“I’m hoping 2026 will be the year that the Speaker finally decides that bill will make it to my desk,” Evers said.
Evers also outlined his hopes that lawmakers will take action to help lower the cost of health care and prescription drug prices including by capping the price of insulin at $35, passing legislation to audit insurance companies when their denial rates are high and creating new standards to increase the number of services health insurance companies must cover. 
Evers also called on lawmakers to provide funding for two sites that closed last year, one in Green Bay and the other in Chippewa Falls, that housed homeless veterans. He said ideally the Veterans Housing and Recovery Program would receive the nearly $2 million  as he proposed last year.  
Evers said he hadn’t seen the GOP-authored bills that passed the Assembly unanimously that would create a new state grant program that would go to organizations that serve homeless veterans. 
“Whatever we can do to solve that issue,” Evers said. “Any of the things I’ve talked about today, if something happens individually, great. We have to get that done, so if they come up with a plan that I feel confident it’s going to work… then I’d sign it.”

“The Rural Health Transformation Program is intentionally structured as a time-limited, performance-driven initiative, not a permanent expansion of state government,” Gailyn Markham, communications director for the state Department of Health, told West Virginia Watch in an email. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s office announced Dec. 29 that West Virginia had secured $199 million for 2026 from the Trump administration’s Rural HealthTransformation Fund. 
“The $199 million investment for 2026 provides a transformative foundation to improve health outcomes, expand access to care, and strengthen families and communities throughout West Virginia,” Morrisey said in a news release at the time. “This award positions our state to deliver better care closer to home and build a healthier future for generations to come. It is also the highest per capita award of any state that West Virginia touches.”
The federal fund is part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump signed into law July 4, 2025. The program will dole out $50 billion fund to approved states over the next five years, with $10 billion distributed each year starting fiscal year 2026. 
Congress added the rural health fund to the legislation as concerns were raised that Medicaid funding cuts in the bill could lead to the closures of rural hospitals. The Republican megabill will cost state hospitals $1 billion per year when it’s fully implemented, according to the West Virginia Hospital Association. 
In a news release last month, hospital association president Jim Kaufman said the organization is thankful for Morrisey’s “visionary leadership” in securing critical resources for the state’s rural health care system. 
“This nearly $1 billion investment over five years represents a transformational opportunity to address longstanding challenges in rural health care delivery,” Kaufman said in the statement. 
The same day Morrisey announced federal funding for the year, the state Department of Health announced it would hire a team of nine staff members for the positions of director and deputy director, along with seven program managers to oversee different aspects of the state’s plan. 
The positions are not listed on the West Virginia Division of Personnel website. In each of the job listings on the job search site Indeed.com, the positions are described as an “at-will” for up to five years, depending on continued funding through the Rural Health Transformation Program.
“Compensation will be commensurate with executive-level public service, experience, and qualifications,” the job listings say. “This position includes full state benefits and travel reimbursement for statewide engagement.”
For the director position, the state seeks someone with a master’s or doctoral degree in public health, health administration, business, medicine or a related field along with a minimum of 10 years of senior leadership experience in health system transformation, public health administration, or large-scale program management, among other qualifications. 
Under Morrisey’s plan for the federal program, schools, libraries and other community institutions in rural West Virginia would be outfitted for use in telemedicine. The state also plans to use the funding to address the state’s health care worker shortage by recruiting high school students to health care careers, adding health care faculty at regional and technical colleges and using financial incentives to attract and keep providers in rural areas. 
Another of the initiatives, the Rural Health Link, would provide patients access to transportation to medical appointments using public buses, rideshare services and volunteer drivers.

About two dozen second graders sat on the carpet at the front of Jacquelyn Anthony’s classroom, reviewing how to make tens. “Two needs eight!” the students yelled out together. “Six needs four!” 
“The numbers may get a little trickier,” Anthony told them next. “But remember, the numbers we need to make 10 are still there.” The students then turned confidently to bigger calculations: Forty-six needs four ones to make a new number divisible by 10; 128 needs two to make 13 tens. 
At the end of the hour, the second graders slung on their backpacks, gathered their Chromebooks and lined up at the door before heading to English and social studies class across the hall. While most schools wait until middle school to transition students from one class to another, kids at the Baton Rouge Center for Visual and Performing Arts do so starting at age 6 or 7. It’s part of a strategy known as departmentalizing, or platooning. 
Anthony, rather than teaching all four core subjects, specializes in math. The school’s new facility, built in 2025, was designed with departmentalizing in mind: The classrooms have huge glass windows, so teachers can see their next class preparing to line up in the hallway.
“Teaching today is so different than it was a long time ago, and there are so many demands on them. And the demand to be an expert in your content area is very high,” said Sydney Hebert, magnet site coordinator for the art-focused public school in the East Baton Rouge Parish school district. “We want to make sure that our teachers are experts in what they’re teaching so that they can do a good job of teaching it to the kids.”
As schools contend with a decades-long slump in math scores — exacerbated by the pandemic — some are turning to this classroom strategy even for very young students. In recent years, more elementary schools have opted to departmentalize some grade levels in an attempt to boost academic achievement. The share of fourth- and fifth-grade classrooms operating on this schedule has doubled since the year 2000, from 15% to 30% in 2021. Often, that means educators will specialize in one or two subjects at most, such as fourth-grade English language arts and social studies, or fifth-grade math and science. The theory is that teachers who specialize will be more familiar with the content and better able to teach it.

That may be particularly important for math: Studies have shown that some early elementary school teachers experience anxiety about the subject and question their ability to teach it. Educators also say that the curriculum and standards for math and English in the early grades are changing rapidly in some districts and have become more complicated over time. In a departmentalized setup, it’s also far less likely that math instruction will get shortchanged by an educator who prefers spending time on other subjects.

But while some schools swear by this model, the research on it is mixed.
One prominent 2018 study on the practice in Houston public schools found it had a negative effect on test scores, behavior and attendance. The study doesn’t explain why that was the case, but the researcher said it could be because teachers on this schedule spend less time with individual students.
Another study published in 2024 analyzing Massachusetts schools had different outcomes: Researchers found moderate gains in academic achievement for ELA and a significant boost to science scores for students in departmentalized classes. The results in math, however, showed few gains. 
Generally, teachers specialize in the subject they are most comfortable teaching. When a school departmentalizes for the first time, principals typically look at each educator’s test score data over time to determine whether they should specialize in math or reading.
“There are some arguments that, at least if it’s someone who likes the subject, who is passionate about the subject, you have a greater chance of them doing a better job of delivering instruction,” said Latrenda Knighten, president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. “But you’ll find mixed reviews.”

Yet there are a few reasons why the strategy is typically reserved for students in older grades, according to school leaders: Spending all day with one teacher increases the bond between the teacher and student, which is important for younger children. In Baton Rouge, Anthony teaches 50 students throughout the day instead of the same 25 students all day.
“Teachers want to get to know their students,” said Dennis Willingham, superintendent of Walker County Schools in Alabama. The district departmentalized some fifth grade classrooms decades ago, but recently added third and fourth grade classes on this schedule. “You tend to see less departmentalization below third grade because of the nurturing element.” 
It’s also generally more challenging for young students to quickly change classrooms, even for electives, which means lost instructional time. Smaller elementary schools may also struggle to hire enough teachers to schedule all of them on a departmentalized setup.

But increasingly, schools that are satisfied with this approach for older grade levels are trying it out with their younger grades, too. 
After the pandemic, the San Tan Heights Elementary School in Arizona changed its curriculum to one that was more rigorous, and it became harder for the third-grade educators to master the standards of all four subject areas, said Henry Saylor-Scheetz, principal at the time.
He proposed that third graders be taught by separate math, English language arts and reading teachers. “I told them, let’s try it for a semester. If it doesn’t work at the end of the year, we’ll go back,” Saylor-Scheetz said.
Ten days into the experiment, teachers told him they never wanted to return to the old schedule. In the subsequent years, the school added more classrooms on this model until, by 2023, all K-8 students were departmentalized. For the last few years, teacher retention at the school was 95%, according to Saylor-Scheetz.
Saylor-Scheetz, who last year became principal of a nearby middle school, credited the change for helping the school improve from a C rating on its state report card — a rating it had stagnated at every year since 2018 — to a B rating as of 2022. Since then, more schools in his Arizona school district have shifted to this schedule. 
“I’d love to see this become something we do as a nation, but it is a paradigm shift,” Saylor-Scheetz said. “There’s merit in doing it, but there has to be a commitment to it.”
At Baton Rouge Center for Visual and Performing Arts, students in first through third grades have two partner teachers, one for math and science and another for ELA and social studies. The school has been operating on this schedule for third- through fifth-grade students for more than a decade. Eight years ago, its leaders decided to try it for first- and second-grade students, too, and were pleased with the results. 
On a December morning at the school, young students talked quietly with each other in the hall as they lined up to go from math class to English language arts. All told, the switch took less than five minutes. “We’re at the end of the second nine weeks, so we’ve had a lot of practice,” said GiGi Boudreaux, the assistant principal. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The strategy has not always been successful, though.
During the pandemic, administrators also attempted to departmentalize its kindergarten classes. It didn’t work as they’d hoped: It was a challenge to get the 5-year-olds to quickly change classes and focus on classwork again once they did. Parents also didn’t like it. The school then tried moving teachers from classroom to classroom instead of moving students, but the educators hated it. 
“It was too much, so we didn’t do it after that,” said Hebert.
The Baton Rouge school doesn’t have comparison data to show that students perform better in a departmentalized setup, but most educators in the school prefer it, Hebert said. Third-grade test scores from 2015 — before the school departmentalized its younger grade levels — showed 73% scored “advanced” and “mastery” level on the state ELA test, and 56% scored advanced or mastery on the math test. In 2025, 80% of third-grade students scored advanced or mastery in ELA and 55%t in math.
“I know that the teachers like it better, and the kids have adapted to it,” Hebert said. 
Teachers meet weekly with their partner teachers and grade-level counterparts to discuss their classes and progress on the state standards. Once a quarter, all of the math teachers across the grades meet to talk about strategies and student performance. 
Related: Teachers conquering their math anxiety 
At Deer Valley Unified School District in Arizona, departmentalizing some classrooms has helped reduce teacher turnover, said Superintendent Curtis Finch, particularly for early career educators, who can find it challenging to master the content and standards of all four subjects.
“If you’re not confident in your subject, then you don’t have good examples off the top of your head. You can’t control the room, can’t pull the students in,” Finch said. 
There are drawbacks though, Finch acknowledged. In a self-contained classroom, teachers can more easily integrate their different lessons, so that a math lesson might refer back to a topic covered in reading.
And even though Anthony, the second-grade math and science teacher in Baton Rouge, loves teaching math, she also misses the extra time she could spend with each student when she had the same 25 children in her class all day for the entire school year. 
“It was a joy for me to be self-contained and to build that little family,” Anthony said. “I think the social emotional needs of students are best met in that type of environment. But being solely a math teacher, I do get to just dig in and focus on the nuance of the content.” 
For Anthony’s partner teacher across the hall, Holley McArthur, teaching 50 students ELA and social studies is easier than having to teach 25 students math. 
“This is my thing: reading books, comprehending and finding answers, meeting their goals,” said McArthur, who has taught in both kinds of classrooms over three decades in education.  
While McArthur’s kids were at recess this mid-December day, the veteran teacher was grading their reading worksheets. A new student had transferred in from out of state midyear, and she was still evaluating his reading skills. 
“I think you still get to know the kids, even if you just have them for three hours a day, because I’m not doing the hard math with them.”

Forever War, Part 3: This story is the third in a series of stories about the PFAS crisis in North Carolina.
FORT FISHER, N.C.—On a sunny, brisk afternoon in mid-December, Kerri Allen peers from the deck of a ferry, crossing the Cape Fear River from Fort Fisher, on a coastal barrier island, to Southport, a small town on the mainland, near where the river meets the sea.
Allen has lived near the water all of her 30-plus years. She competes in outrigger canoe races and calls herself an “East Coast mermaid.” She knows how to read a river, and at times her life has depended on that skill. She has paddled this rugged stretch of the Cape Fear River when winds were wailing and whitecaps were walloping her boat. She now works as coastal management program director for the N.C. Coastal Federation.
On this day, from the port side of the ferry, the river looks as deep and dark as midnight. A light southwest wind pushes serrated waves against the hull.
“There is a lot going on under the water,” Allen says, as she scans the horizon. “Tidal currents, river currents, basin currents.”

Allen is taking the 35-minute ride with her fellow environmental advocates: Lindsay Addison, a coastal biologist with the Audubon Society, and Kemp Burdette, the Cape Fear Riverkeeper. They’re showing me the potential impacts of a proposed federal dredging project: Shorelines and beach spits that are buffeted by wakes of enormous container ships, and vulnerable bird habitats on barrier islands that could be coated with PFAS-contaminated silt.
And, of course, the Cape Fear River itself. It’s a repository for industrial chemicals and fertilizers that have drained from farms and lawns, and microplastics that have invaded every aspect of human existence, even our brains.
The advocates have spent the last year fending off myriad environmental assaults under the Trump administration, including the loss of wetlands protections, the weakening of the Endangered Species Act and the rollback of PFAS regulations in drinking water.
These threats—and many others—are now weighing on the advocates’ minds as they fight a different battle, the billion-dollar, six-year dredging project proposed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
To accommodate larger ships heading up the Cape Fear River to the Port of Wilmington, the Corps would dredge 28 miles of the river up from its mouth near Bald Head Island, north along the Fort Fisher ferry route and upstream to the port. The dredging would deepen the shipping channel to 47 feet, from its current depth of 42 feet, federal records show, and widen some segments by as much as 500 feet—equivalent to one and a half football fields.
By the time the Corps is finished, 35 million cubic yards of silt and sand, plus the creatures that live in it, would be scraped and slurped from the riverbed.
The Corps would dispose of roughly half the material at a permitted ocean disposal site; the rest—sand and silt likely contaminated with PFAS—would be slathered on hundreds of acres of public beaches, bird-nesting islands and imperiled wetlands.
From the ferry deck, the Military Ocean Terminal Sunny Point comes into view across the vast river expanse. Operated by the U.S. Army, it is the world’s largest military terminal. It stores and ships explosives, artillery shells, Howitzers, grenades and other ammunition. If the United States is embroiled in a conflict—or assisting with one—the weapons likely ship from Sunny Point.





Parts of the terminal are contaminated with toxic PFAS found in firefighting foam, military testing has shown. Studies have also found contaminants from terminal seeping from the groundwater into tributaries of the Cape Fear.
University scientists and state environmental regulators have also found the forever chemicals in river water, fish, birds and alligators, as well as in sediment north of the port.


Despite the likelihood of contamination, the Corps doesn’t intend to test the dredging material for PFAS, according to a Draft Environmental Impact Statement released in September. In fact, the 260-page document doesn’t mention PFAS at all.
Even if the Corps did find PFAS in the dredging material, it’s unclear if they would be prohibited from disposing of it. There are currently no federal standards or regulations to guide decisions related to PFAS contamination in sediment, a Corps spokesman said.
Because sediment tests have a limited shelf life, the spokesman said, samples collected now would be outdated by the time the Corps would begin dredging the river in five to 10 years.
If the dredging project comes to fruition, the spokesman said, the Corps would test the sediment in the engineering and design phase “to meet all applicable requirements” and guide decisions about where to place the material.

Burdette has battled for PFAS regulations since the compounds were detected in the Cape Fear River in 2017. He’s from Wilmington and unknowingly drank contaminated water much of his life. His two children, now in their teens, drank it. His father drank it and died of kidney cancer, which research has linked to exposure to GenX, a PFAS compound.
Burdette has wrestled alligators so scientists could take their blood. His organization, Cape Fear River Watch, sued the state and Chemours, the chemical manufacturer responsible for discharging GenX and other forever chemicals into the Cape Fear. The state and Chemours agreed to a consent order that required the company to stop its contaminated discharges into the waterway.
Last fall, Burdette paddled an aluminum rowboat to Chemour Fayetteville Works on the river to test whether a PFAS compound called TFA was in water outfalls from the plant. He found disturbingly high levels of the ultra-short chain compounds.
Now Burdette is again fighting for the river he knows so well, and on behalf of the people who depend on it.
A Gritty, Loud, Noxious Port
The ferry turns gently toward the west as the advocates aboard rattle off additional probable harms from the dredging: The increased wake and wave action from the enormous ships would erode shorelines and drown bird eggs and chicks in their nests. Roughly 1,000 acres of wetlands would be permanently lost. Endangered Atlantic Sturgeon, which live on the river bed, would be dismembered by the ships’ sharp keels.
Allen is concerned that there is no monitoring plan for the environmental impacts. The Cape Fear River is so impaired, she says, that crabbers describe the river as dead.
Allen, in her mid-30s, is blond and athletic with a wide smile. She was born in Raleigh, but moved to Wilmington as a teenager. She originally planned to become an artist, and her creative streak manifests in her Coastal Federation office at Wrightsville Beach.
Not only does she have a graceful array of seashells, but also a collection of sand: Black sand, white sand, sand from Hawaii, sand from San Francisco, sand from Costa Rica, sand with large grains, sand with small grains, even sea glass, all housed in 100 small antique bottles with cork stoppers.
Sand is placed on beaches as part of routine maintenance, but there is no legal requirement to test the material for PFAS, even in areas known to be contaminated. Credit: Lisa Sorg/ Inside Climate News
Had it not been for a high school oceanography class, Allen could be painting ocean scenes. But as part of the class, she visited a marsh where she retrieved the shell of a tulip mollusk, a type of large sea snail. She was hooked. Now she’s a coastal geologist.
Allen and her fellow advocates have scrutinized the economics of the proposal. Federal documents show the financial benefits of the $1.2 billion proposed project are few and barely meet the Corps’ benefit-cost threshold for reasonableness. The state legislature would have to appropriate $339 million to cover a quarter of the costs.
The total cargo volume flowing through the port is expected to remain steady with or without a harbor improvement project, according to the Corps’ analysis. Yet, the Corps, and before it, the State Ports Authority, justified deepening the shipping channel to accommodate larger vessels. Otherwise, ships would have to “light load”—carry less weight to the port, which could entail more river traffic.
In other words, fewer trips, but bigger ships.
The 284-acre Port of Wilmington lies just two miles south of downtown. Unlike the city’s waterfront promenade, restaurants and tourist shops, the port is gritty, loud and noxious.
Along Burnette Boulevard, Kinder Morgan, the Houston-based pipeline company, operates a chemical, petroleum and asphalt storage terminal. EcoLab injects shipping containers with the neurotoxin methyl bromide to fumigate logs. In the backyards of Sunset Park residents looms Enviva’s dome of wood pellets, sourced from North Carolina forests and bound for Europe to be burned as fuel.
The port is crucial to Wilmington’s economy, but receives just 1.3 percent of the nation’s marine shipping traffic. It handled about 7 million tons of cargo in 2022, most of it container shipments, according to State Port Authority figures.
In February 2020, the State Port Authority released a feasibility study about improving the shipping channel, which, unsurprisingly, found it would benefit the port.
The findings have since prompted accusations of self-dealing, especially in light of an eviscerating federal review. After the state submitted it to the assistant secretary of the Army for Civil Works, that office identified more than two dozen major weaknesses and unresolved issues.
The state Department of Transportation, which oversees the port, did not respond to emails from Inside Climate News seeking comment.
The Port Authority underestimated the project’s impact on river flooding associated with sea-level rise, failed to account for the effects of climate change, and claimed, without evidence, that unless the shipping channel was deepened and widened, the port would close.
“As written, the planning objectives are unclear and could potentially lead to the pre-selection of an alternative plan,” Corps documents read. “In many cases, the report uses qualifying words, such as may, potentially, and just, to lessen the description of project impacts.”
Nonetheless, Congress authorized more than $839 million for the project, but with a caveat: The study’s shortcomings had to be fixed before lawmakers would consider releasing the funding.
In 2022, the task fell to the Corps.
PFAS in the Fish
The ferry docks at the Southport terminal after crossing the river in about 35 minutes, and the trio of environmental advocates heads for the fishing pier. It’s nearly empty in December, but during high season, the pier is jammed with anglers eager to catch a red drum or Atlantic croaker for dinner.
Those fish are among seven saltwater species that contained PFAS in their tissues, according to sampling conducted by the state Department of Environmental Quality.
In 2023 and 2024, DEQ tested 77 fish caught between Wilmington and Southport—the same stretch of the river that the Corps would deepen and widen—for the compounds. DEQ presented preliminary data to the state Secretaries’ Science Advisory Board last October that showed PFAS were present in all seven saltwater species sampled, as well as in river water.
The agency found 13 types of PFAS disbursed among the fish. PFOS, which the chemical industry phased out in 2002, was detected in all of the samples.
Two compounds found in several fish, PFMOAA and PFO5DA, can be traced back to Chemours, 100 miles upstream.
The saltwater fish findings build on previous DEQ sampling that detected high levels of PFOS in eight species of freshwater fish commonly caught in the river segment upstream of Wilmington, between Chemours and the Bluffs on the Cape Fear.
The results compelled state health officials in 2023 to issue a fish consumption advisory for those species, recommending that pregnant women eat none and that others limit their intake to no more than seven meals in a year.
The state health department is evaluating options for future fish advisories, including consideration of guidelines proposed last September by the Great Lakes Consortium for Fish Advisories.
Research on PFAS and Birds
Addison is in her 40s and, in the winter, wears flannel and a knit toboggan to protect against the wind. She has been a coastal biologist with the Audubon Society in Wilmington for 15 years and grew up in Florida, surrounded by nature and books. Her father was a biologist, and she spent her childhood playing outside, roaming the woods behind her elementary school while she waited for her mother, a teacher, to finish working.
“Outside, you might go to the same place over and over,” she says, “but you don’t know what you’re going to see or what’s going to happen. It’s never the same.”
Even her hobbies dovetail with her professional life. Like the protagonists in the British mysteries she reads, Addison observes the natural world, what belongs and what seems out of place.
“Birds are a thing everyone can get behind,” says Lindsay Addison, a coastal biologist with the Audubon Society. Credit: Lisa Sorg/Inside Climate News
Addison loves birds. She has a figurine of a killdeer in her office—but if she had to name a favorite shorebird, it would be the American oystercatcher. (The Carolina wren, a yardbird, is second, Addison says. “They’re pert.”)
“Birds are a thing that everyone can get behind,” she says. “They are a great uniter.”
American oystercatchers live on coastal salt marshes, mudflats, and islands. They are sociable introverts who are loyal to their mates and will return to the same spot to nest every year. If an island were a parking lot, Addison says, an American oystercatcher would return not just to the same lot, but “to the same parking space.”
American oystercatchers, as their name suggests, eat oysters. And scientists have found oysters contaminated with the compounds along the Southeast Atlantic Coast..
Some birds living along the Cape Fear River have also been contaminated with PFAS. In 2017, Addison, EPA scientists and University of Rhode Island researchers tested chicks that had died of natural causes from three locations: Massachusetts Bay, Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island, and the Cape Fear River Estuary in North Carolina.
They found 16 types of PFAS in the livers of royal terns, sandwich terns, laughing gulls and brown pelicans from the Cape Fear River Estuary. These included PFOS and two compounds associated with Chemours.
Chicks from the Cape Fear Estuary contained significantly greater concentrations and numbers of PFAS than juveniles from Massachusetts Bay or Narragansett Bay, researchers found. A royal tern chick from the estuary had the highest total of PFAS of all the birds tested: 390 parts per trillion.
Over the past two years, Addison, along with the U.S. Geological Survey and the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, conducted a second study. They took blood samples from living brown pelican chicks to see if their immune systems have been affected by exposure to PFAS. The results are pending.
If the Corps places contaminated dredge material on the bird nesting islands, that could further expose them to compounds. The “likely presence of PFAS is a major concern” for DEQ, according to an agency spokesperson.
“We need to find out before we do it,” Addison says. “You can’t un-ring the bell.”
Back Before the House
Emily Donovan, co-founder of the environmental group Clean Cape Fear, couldn’t make the ferry trip. Instead, she prepared to testify before the U.S. House Environment Subcommittee.
Donovan routinely speaks in public; sometimes it seems like she’s on tour. Seven years ago, she first appeared before the House Environment Subcommittee, where she pleaded with federal lawmakers to authorize and fund a comprehensive, nationwide PFAS Human Exposure Study and to regulate all of the compounds, not piecemeal, but as a class.
Last May, she addressed 100 people from the pulpit of Ocean View United Methodist Church in Oak Island, North Carolina, to unveil findings about PFAS in sea foam along the state’s beaches. Coincidentally, that was the day EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced he would roll back drinking water regulations for GenX and four other PFAS chemicals—regulations Donovan and other North Carolina environmentalists had fought for more than a decade.

This time, though, Donovan felt nervous. She had little time to finesse her remarks. House Democrats had contacted her on short notice to appear before the committee about proposed PFAS exemptions under the Superfund law, which governs hundreds of sites nationwide that are contaminated by hazardous waste.
The hearing at the Rayburn Building in Washington, D.C., was on the 18th of December: A week before Christmas, in the middle of Hanukkah and on the final day of Congress in 2025. She wondered if anyone was listening or even cared.
Clad in a black turtleneck sweater, Donovan sat at a hearing table with three other witnesses, all of whom represented industries that favored the Superfund exemption.
The Trump administration had kept the hazardous materials designation for PFOA and PFOS, enacted under President Biden. That classification places those compounds under the purview of the Superfund program, which allows the EPA to force polluters to pay for cleanups, rather than taxpayers.
Now, Congress was weighing a legal exemption for “passive receivers,” entities that didn’t produce the compounds but had unknowingly accepted contaminated material: farmers, wastewater treatment plants, even seaside beach towns.
Initially, the proponents’ arguments seemed reasonable. But as the hearing wore on, observers learned the EPA already absolves passive receivers from governmental liability. However, proponents say that without the exemption, they are still vulnerable to third-party lawsuits.
Those claims are disingenuous, Donovan told the committee, whose Democratic members agreed. The passive receiver exemption could shield polluters from accountability, she said. For example, in North Carolina, the state regulates water and wastewater utilities. In turn, the utilities often end up processing discharges of toxic chemicals from industries like plastics manufacturers and textile companies,
This gives polluting industries cover: the utility is on the hook to DEQ, not them, Donovan said.










“Our beaches are coated in an atrocious amount of PFAS in sea foam.”


–   Emily Donovan, Clean Cape Fear


“Yet here we are debating whether to weaken accountability for two types of PFAs that haven’t been in commercial use for over a decade,” she said.
Donovan was part of a research team that found PFAS-contaminated sea foam along several Brunswick County beaches in southern North Carolina. Of the 12 sea foam samples, Caswell Beach and nearby Oak Island had some of the highest levels. These are the same places where the Corps could soon place 2 million cubic yards of dredge material from the Cape Fear River.
“Our beaches are coated in an atrocious amount of PFAS in sea foam, the highest ever recorded in literature to date,” she told the committee. “The discovery of these toxic levels of PFAS contaminating our local beaches is yet another public health threat lawmakers and regulators have no idea how to address.”
Seaside Towns Divided on Dredging 
Sand is existential for coastal communities. Without a steady replenishment, the sand is carried to sea by storms—some of them supercharged by climate change—and the constant barrage of wakes and waves. Without sand, there are no tourists. And without tourists, the coastal economy folds like a beach chair.
Beach renourishment can cost seaside towns tens of millions of dollars. This is why the prospect of the Corps delivering free sand from the dredging project is nearly irresistible.
The Corps is required under federal law to evaluate whether to test dredge material for contaminants of concern, such as pesticides, metals and PCBs. If the material is in an area with a history of spills or known contamination, the Corps is required to test it for a list of chemicals before disposing of it either inland or at a designated ocean site. PFAS are not on that list.
In the Draft Environmental Impact Statement, the Corps bases its conclusions that sediment contains “acceptable concentrations” of toxic contaminants on tests conducted from 2013 to 2016. Those tests did not include PFAS; not until 2017 did the public know PFAS had contaminated the Cape Fear River.
Scientists have already shown that PFAS can settle in sediment in rivers and lakes worldwide, from Michigan to China. Ralph Mead, a scientist at UNC Wilmington, found the compounds in sediment samples in the Cape Fear River at the dam 39 miles north of Wilmington. Eleven PFAS were found in estuarine sediments in Charleston, S.C.
Erin Carey is the deputy director and conservation policy lead for the North Carolina chapter of the Sierra Club. She lives in Wilmington with her husband and stepson, and grew up in rural Vermont, where, as a child, she became an environmental advocate.
In third grade, she started a petition to bring a rock, about the size of a loaf of bread, into the classroom where she could store it at her desk. All of her classmates signed the petition, which did not sway the teacher. “Not only did it not work,” she says. “But I didn’t get the rock and I had to stay in for recess.”



In sixth grade, she started a boycott to advocate for dolphin-safe tuna. Carey wanted to “save the world” and become a marine biologist. She moved to Wilmington, where she earned two degrees in environmental and marine science.

But “there weren’t a lot of ‘save the world jobs’ out there,” Carey says, so she took whatever science job she could.
She worked at the microbiology lab at Wilmington’s Sweeney water treatment plant years before scientists discovered PFAS entering and leaving the facility. In Carteret County, she inspected small wastewater treatment plants, where her job entailed peering into vats of raw sewage. At DEQ’s shellfish sanitation program, she pureed oysters to test them for E. coli bacteria.


Finally, one day when she was surfing in Costa Rica, she got the call that she’d been hired at the Sierra Club in North Carolina. Since then, she’s seen some environmental victories—state rules on emissions of methyl bromide, a neurotoxin—and losses. Under Trump, millions of acres of wetlands, including thousands in North Carolina, are losing protection. “The wetlands fight will be, [and] is, the most daunting and most terrifying change we’ve seen come out of the Trump administration.”
Polling shows that the environment falls below the economy in importance, she says. “It may, but I don’t think that that’s a full picture of how emotionally connected people are to the environment. Despite the body blows that we take, the energy from the public, love for the environment and for nature, the need to protect it, that seems intrinsic to being human. That makes it worth it.”
Carey says environmental groups have spoken with the Corps about their PFAS concerns, but “they’re taking the stance that it’s not regulated and we don’t have to do anything about it.”
“No, you don’t have to,” Carey says of the Corps, “but you could do your job and protect people.”











“Despite the body blows that we take, the energy from the public, love for the environment and for nature, the need to protect it, that seems intrinsic to being human.”

Caswell Beach Mayor George Kassler said he is unaware “that anyone is concerned with PFAS from material placed on the beach.” He said the town is relying on the “Corps’ assurance” that chemical testing of the material would occur as outlined in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement.
In Oak Island, elected officials haven’t taken a public stand on whether it would accept sand from the dredging project. The Town Council “has not yet had the chance to discuss this topic in an open meeting,” a town spokesman said.
Other municipalities, though, have either opposed the project or asked for concessions similar to those made when the Georgia Ports Authority expanded the Savannah Harbor.
The Southport Board of Alderman passed a resolution earlier this month that urged state and federal policymakers to require a “comprehensive, long-term, and fully-funded environmental mitigation and adaptive management plan.”
This would require the State Port Authority to deposit $500 million in an escrow account to fund future mitigation projects to address as-yet-unknown environmental harms caused by the dredging.
Kure Beach officials passed a similar resolution. They also urged the relevant agencies to protect Battery Island and the surrounding Cape Fear River islands “as irreplaceable ecological assets,” ensuring that mitigation measures “fully safeguard the habitats supporting nearly a third of North Carolina’s coastal shorebird population.”

The Village of Bald Head Island, a wealthy enclave in and near a maritime forest four miles from the mainland, would receive 1.6 million cubic yards of dredged sand. But that offer isn’t enticing enough to counter the potential environmental and property damages; in mid-December, village officials voted unanimously to oppose the project.
Bill Cary, an attorney with the powerful law firm Brooks Pierce, which is representing Bald Head Island, wrote to the Corps that the village is still recovering 25 years after the previous dredging project. It has spent more than $2.8 million a year addressing the damages, including shoreline erosion.
Brooks Pierce also hired ports and shipping expert Asaf Ashar, a University of New Orleans research professor emeritus, who, in 40 pages of analysis, concluded that the Corps’ economic projections are incorrectly calculated and unsupported.
“Considering the size of the projected expenditures, the environmental impacts, the prior criticisms and the time and expense of the new analysis,” Cary wrote, “one would expect the 2025 economic considerations to be thorough, well-documented, supported by available data, and based on sound, consistent analytical principles. It is none of those things.”
What’s Next
A motorboat passes by the Southport pier. Its wake travels beneath the pilings and thwacks the stone rip-rap that protects the waterfront from flooding. Multiply the power of that wake by 1,000, even 10,000, from ships traveling the river, and the force of the water can annihilate a shoreline.
Addison points out Battery Island, which lies about a half mile across the river from the Southport pier. At 100 acres, it is one of the largest wading-bird areas in the state, as well as a sanctuary for chicks because no mammals, other than the occasional unfortunate deer, can swim there.
Many of the birds “read” the island for the high tide line and build their nests above it, she says. But sometimes the incoming water, whether from gusty winds or big boats, tops the line and drowns birds in their nests.
When ferries and ships pass the island, they create a tsunami effect: Water is sucked from the shore, but then slams back and gradually sloughs off the shoreline. The birds are running out of higher ground. Thirty-year-old cedars are falling into the sea.
“It’s one of the islands we’re most concerned about,” Addison says. “There’s a pretty wicked current. It’s striking how far a boat wake can travel.”
The state Wildlife Resources Commission owns many islands near the river, which the Audubon Society manages. The commission is also concerned about the damage wakes could inflict on birding islands from large ships, especially on Battery Island.
“There was no information on wave heights and how far wakes would progress onshore,” the WRC wrote in its public comments to the Corps. “A single overwash causes a nest to be lost. This permanent loss of nesting and roosting habitats along with potential site abandonment by birds should be considered and mitigated appropriately.”
The project would alter 1,000 acres of wetlands from freshwater to saltwater, which supports entirely different ecosystems. The Corps would be required to mitigate those impacts at other locations within the river subbasin, but the harm—including inundation of some wetlands and wake erosion of others—would be extensive and permanent.
“This project will increase salinity up the river,” said Carey of the Sierra Club. “It will change the nature of ecosystems and forests. The idea of killing off wetlands and then just assuming that they will become just a different kind of wetland—eventually—there’s no analysis behind that. It’s just an assumption.”
Carey likens the project to a scene in the film Jurassic Park: “Jeff Goldblum says, ‘your scientists were so focused on whether they could do something, they didn’t think about whether they should.’”
An Uncertain Fate 
On the pier, Burdette scrolls on his phone, searching for photos of Atlantic sturgeon. They are endangered in North Carolina and, because they live on the river bottom, can be mowed down by the sharp keels of ships.
He points to the shoreline where the boat’s wake just dissipated. “This one I found right over there,” he says, having found the photo of a sturgeon on his phone. “And this one—is missing part of himself.”
Cars and trucks line up to load onto the ferry back to Fort Fisher. It is mid-afternoon but already the sun is nodding toward the horizon. Burdette glances at his watch, 30 minutes until high tide. The ferry heads up and then back across the river to Fort Fisher. Even though the advocates know the area by heart, there is always something beautiful to see.
“Wow, look at that boat,” Allen says, pointing ahead.
The long fingers of the sun have bathed the vessel in hues of butter.
The conversation turns to what could happen next. Under state law, DEQ must conduct a consistency review for federal projects that could affect the coastal zone. The agency’s Division of Coastal Management analyzes the project to evaluate whether it complies with the state’s approved coastal management program, including the dredge and fill law.
Coastal Management officials are expected to complete the review by Jan. 20.
The division has three choices: It could issue a letter of “concurrence,” which allows the project to continue. A letter of “conditional concurrence,” requires changes to the project for it to proceed. An “objection” cancels the project unless the Corps appeals to federal court or enters into mediation with the state.
The Corps could issue its Final Environmental Impact Statement as early as next spring. Even if the project clears the regulatory hurdles, it’s unclear if Congress and the state legislature will appropriate the funds—and when.
The ferry heads north and east. From the starboard side, Burdette points to a dredging barge, slouched in the water, laden with dirt. The barge is headed south, and likely out to sea, to dump it.
Out here on the water, I feel small, humble, inconsequential. “Ecosystems, the ocean, the tides, hurricanes, these are not things you can negotiate with,” Addison says. “We can, we can observe them and appreciate their beauty, but we do not control them. The forces are big and impersonal, and that, to me, is comforting instead of intimidating.”
Ten minutes after sunset at Kure Beach, just north of Fort Fisher, the skies have turned from indigo to lilac. The sand is damp and cold. A half dozen hardy tourists take selfies against the backdrop of ocean waves breaking on the shore.
Those forces require beaches to be routinely smoothed and mended. Behind the orange snow fence, slumps a backhoe and a heap of sand.

(Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)Tribal leaders in North Dakota are urging their citizens to carry tribal IDs and other forms of identification amid reports of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detaining Native Americans in Minnesota. 
At least five tribal citizens were reportedly detained by ICE last week in Minneapolis, reported ICT, an Indigenous news organization. Four are citizens of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, and the fifth is a descendant of the Red Lake Nation, the news organization reported. 
Reports of Indigenous people being targeted by ICE agents prompted Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chair Steve Sitting Bear to issue a public safety alert on social media Friday.

Standing Rock is working on a designated telephone line to ensure tribal members know their rights if they come into contact with immigration agents, Sitting Bear said in a statement.
“Our Nation is a sovereign government and our members are not immigrants,” he said. “We are not subject to immigration enforcement on our own lands.”
The Spirit Lake Nation and Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate in a joint statement with the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe said ICE’s activities in Minnesota have “caused fear and uncertainty” among their citizens.
The joint statement also condemned the killing of Renee Good by an ICE agent on Wednesday.
“As Dakota people, we are reminded of the sacrifices of our ancestors and the enduring impacts of displacement and violence experienced by our Nations,” the tribes said.
Tribal governments have advised tribal members to carry tribal identification cards, certificates of degree of Indian blood or other official documentation.
The warnings come as at least 2,000 ICE agents are in neighboring Minnesota, with Homeland Security Director Kristi Noem reportedly ordering additional federal agents to the area.

“As tribal nations, our fundamental rights are not granted, they are inherent and written in our treaties, our sovereignty, and our laws,” North Dakota Native Vote Deputy Director Kendyl Harrison said in a statement to the North Dakota Monitor. “Any attacks or discrimination on any Indigenous person is a clear violation and intrusion upon those rights.”
Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Chairman Jamie Azure in a Facebook post also denounced ICE’s activity as “divisive and abhorrent.” He told tribal citizens that ICE cannot go on tribal land without the consent of the tribe. 
In addition to the incidents in Minneapolis, ICE reportedly detained multiple Arizona tribal citizens last year, with one woman nearly being deported in November, according to the Arizona Mirror.
Tribal leaders also urged citizens who are approached by immigration agents to contact their respective tribal governments, as well as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Native American Rights Fund.
“We’re seeing the same reports that Native people are being unlawfully detained as U.S. citizens,” said Matthew Campbell, deputy director of the Native American Rights Fund. “It appears that there is certainly unlawful force and violence being used in these detentions.”
He said the organization is investigating the reports. Campbell invited any tribal citizen who has been detained by ICE to contact his organization.
“We certainly welcome speaking to them to understand the issues and what has been happening, and looking at what a lawsuit may look like,” he said.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
This article is part of a collaborative investigation into Mississippi’s Deadly Prisons.
An investigation by The Marshall Project-Jackson, Mississippi Today and other local reporting partners found that understaffing and gang violence in Mississippi’s prisons led to dozens of incarcerated people being killed in the last 10 years. Their killers seldom face consequences, and their families are often left without answers. 
Of the nearly 50 homicides we identified, just eight killers have been convicted.
Over the course of a year, reporters from The Marshall Project, Mississippi Today, the Clarion Ledger, the Hattiesburg American and The Mississippi Link reviewed thousands of pages of court records, incident reports, and federal and state government death records. We interviewed families who have lost loved ones behind bars, formerly incarcerated people, former guards, attorneys and corrections experts.
Following our investigation, Mississippi Department of Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain said in October 2025 that the department would review unprosecuted homicides and deaths ruled to be of undetermined causes. 
Yet three months later, there have been no additional indictments or convictions in open homicide cases.
The 2026 legislative session began Jan. 6. So far, House Corrections Chair Rep. Becky Currie stated that she plans to introduce legislation to advance prison health care reform. No legislation addressing prison violence, understaffing or homicides has been introduced. 
Here are five key points from our investigation — and what the federal government and other states have done to stem their own prison violence:
1. Prison homicides are not isolated incidents. They are the result of long-documented failures of the state to protect those in its custody. 
Many of the violent, preventable deaths we investigated showed the same factors: Chronic understaffing, lax oversight and gang control. These issues have been documented for decades in civil lawsuits and in investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice. 
2. The killings have not stopped. 
After the stories were published in September, our reporting team identified three additional men who were killed behind bars in 2025. At East Mississippi Correctional Facility in Meridian, 41-year-old Aaron Harrison was killed in July. According to an incident report, Harrison was receiving medical treatment after appearing pale and yellow. A nurse practitioner observed bruising on his lower abdomen. The incident report stated that Harrison’s cause of death was unknown, but the state medical examiner later determined his death to be a homicide caused by blunt force trauma. 
Three months later, 23-year-old Cameron Roby succumbed to injuries following an assault at the same facility. Also in October, 29-year-old Donald Jones was beaten to death by his cellmate at Wilkinson County Correctional Facility, according to prison incident reports. No one has been criminally charged in connection with any of these deaths. 
3. The chief problem is prison understaffing.
Most of the documented killings were beatings or stabbings that occurred when staff were either absent, outnumbered or poorly trained to handle the violence. 
From 2015 through 2025, we discovered multiple accounts of a victim being beaten, killed and not found until hours later. In February 2025, officials at Wilkinson County Correctional Facility received a call that an incarcerated person had died in the prison. They found Jonathan Havard strangled to death in his cell, according to an incident report.
In December 2021, Ronnie Graham was beaten in the early hours of the morning. He spent nearly five hours passing in and out of consciousness before being found foaming at the mouth, according to prison incident reports and a Justice Department investigation. He died shortly after. 
When there is not enough staff in a prison, functions like security counts are neglected. Gangs and violent individuals take advantage of these security gaps. 
Deputy Corrections Commissioner Nathan Blevins told lawmakers in September that about 30% of the funded corrections officer positions were vacant. 
“No prison can operate safely with that kind of staffing,” said David Fathi, director of the ACLU National Prison Project.
4. Investigations into prison killings are shrouded in secrecy.
Families are often left without answers. When they did get answers, they typically learned details about their loved ones’ deaths through a whisper network of incarcerated people, insiders, advocates, and, in some cases, from journalists. Family members report little communication with state prison officials. 
Mississippi’s public records law also makes it difficult to find out what happened. The Mississippi Public Records Act exempts law enforcement investigative documents. It is up to the law enforcement agency — in this case, the Department of Corrections — to decide if a document is investigative. MDOC officials used this exemption broadly throughout our investigation, but reporters were able to obtain information through other sources.  
5. Official accountability is elusive. The federal government and other states enacted more oversight. 
Mississippi prison death investigations are handled internally. The corrections department ultimately decides whether to pass its investigation to the local district attorney’s office for prosecution. 
An individual who kills another incarcerated person can either be held accountable through a criminal charge or an internal prison write-up called a rule violation report. Often, they receive neither. Of the 42 homicides examined in our investigation, just eight cases led to suspects pleading guilty in criminal court. A few received a rule violation that led to a loss of privileges, including the use of the phone and buying items from the commissary. 
Outside of the prison system, there is scant oversight to hold corrections officials accountable for misconduct, root out corruption and investigate allegations of abuse. In some states, there are independent oversight bodies or officials who handle these tasks.
For example, Virginia created an ombudsman’s office to inspect its prisons and investigate complaints. The office received more than 500 complaints from June through August last year, which included excessive force, prolonged isolation and delayed medical care. 
New York’s prisons are monitored by an independent agency. The Correctional Association of New York conducts inspections and interviews with incarcerated people and prison staff. The organization publishes reports and maintains a public dashboard with data on staffing, deaths, suicide attempts and more. 
In 2024, the Federal Prison Oversight Act was enacted, creating an ombudsman office and granting the Justice Department’s inspector general office authority to inspect federal prisons. The legislation comes after investigations found rampant sexual abuse, preventable deaths and neglect in federal prisons. 
In Mississippi, the Legislature established a Corrections and Criminal Justice Oversight Task Force in 2014, but it has virtually no authority, said André de Gruy, the state public defender and a task force member. The task force offers criminal justice policy recommendations to the Legislature that are focused on reducing the prison population.
De Gruy said he often receives calls from former clients and their family members about the dangers in prison.
“Not everybody has that ability to call and have a connection to somebody who can actually look into something, and put (it) on the commissioner’s radar,” he said. 
He proposed the creation of an ombudsman’s office for Mississippi, similar to those for Virginia and federal prisons. 
Victims’ families in Mississippi have also sued the prisons. However, such cases are difficult to win, civil rights lawyers said. There are legal protections like qualified immunity, which can shield officials from being held responsible for the deaths.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/09160431/260113_JAC-MS-PRISONS-5-TAKEAWAYS-v2.jpg,,,2026-01-13 06:12:28.055757

(Getty Images)The federal government has drastically scaled back the number of recommended childhood immunizations, sidelining six routine vaccines that have safeguarded millions from serious diseases, long-term disability, and death.
Just three of the six immunizations the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it will no longer routinely recommend — against hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and rotavirus — have prevented nearly 2 million hospitalizations and more than 90,000 deaths in the past 30 years, according to the CDC’s own publications.
Vaccines against the three diseases, as well as those against respiratory syncytial virus, meningococcal disease, flu, and covid, are now recommended only for children at high risk of serious illness or after “shared clinical decision-making,” or consultation between doctors and parents.
The CDC maintained its recommendations for 11 childhood vaccines: measles, mumps, and rubella; whooping cough, tetanus, and diphtheria; the bacterial disease known as Hib; pneumonia; polio; chickenpox; and human papillomavirus, or HPV.
Federal and private insurance will still cover vaccines for the diseases the CDC no longer recommends universally, according to a Department of Health and Human Services fact sheet; parents who want to vaccinate their children against those diseases will not have to pay out-of-pocket.
Experts on childhood disease were baffled by the change in guidance. HHS said the changes followed “a scientific review of the underlying science” and were in line with vaccination programs in other developed nations.
HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist, pointed to Denmark as a model. But the schedules of most European countries are closer to the U.S. standard upended by the new guidance.
For example, Denmark, which does not vaccinate against rotavirus, registers around 1,200 infant and toddler rotavirus hospitalizations a year. That rate, in a country of 6 million, is about the same as it was in the United States before vaccination.
“They’re OK with having 1,200 or 1,300 hospitalized kids, which is the tip of the iceberg in terms of childhood suffering,” said Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a co-inventor of a licensed rotavirus vaccine. “We weren’t. They should be trying to emulate us, not the other way around.”
Public health officials say the new guidance puts the onus on parents to research and understand each childhood vaccine and why it is important.
Here’s a rundown of the diseases the sidelined vaccines prevent:
RSV. Respiratory syncytial virus is the most common cause of hospitalization for infants in the U.S.
The respiratory virus usually spreads in fall and winter and produces cold-like symptoms, though it can be deadly for young children, causing tens of thousands of hospitalizations and hundreds of deaths a year. According to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, roughly 80% of children younger than 2 who are hospitalized with RSV have no identifiable risk factors. Long-awaited vaccines against the disease were introduced in 2023.
Hepatitis A. Hepatitis A vaccination, which was phased in beginning in the late 1990s and recommended for all toddlers starting in 2006, has led to a more than 90% drop in the disease since 1996. The foodborne virus, which causes a wretched illness, continues to plague adults, particularly people who are homeless or who abuse drugs or alcohol, with a total of 1,648 cases and 85 deaths reported in 2023.
Hepatitis B. The disease causes liver cancer, cirrhosis, and other serious illnesses and is particularly dangerous when contracted by babies and young children. The hepatitis B virus is transmitted through blood and other bodily fluids, even in microscopic amounts, and can survive on surfaces for a week. From 1990 to 2019, vaccination resulted in a 99% decline in reported cases of acute hepatitis B among children and teens. Liver cancer among American children has also plummeted as a result of universal childhood vaccination. But the hepatitis B virus is still around, with 2,000-3,000 acute cases reported annually among unvaccinated adults. More than 17,000 chronic hepatitis B diagnoses were reported in 2023. The CDC estimates about half of people infected don’t know they have it.
Rotavirus. Before routine administration of the current rotavirus vaccines began in 2006, about 70,000 young children were hospitalized and 50 died every year from the virus. It was known as “winter vomiting syndrome,” said Sean O’Leary, a pediatrician at the University of Colorado. “It was a miserable disease that we hardly see anymore.”
The virus is still common on surfaces that babies touch, however, and “if you lower immunization rates it will once again hospitalize children,” Offit said.
Meningococcal disease. Vaccines have been required mainly for teenagers and college students, who are notably vulnerable to critical illness caused by the bacteria. About 600 to 1,000 cases of meningococcal disease are reported in the U.S. each year, but it kills more than 10% of those it sickens, and 1 in 5 survivors have permanent disabilities.
Flu and covid. The two respiratory viruses have each killed hundreds of children in recent years — though both tend to be much more severe in older adults. Flu is currently on the upswing in the United States, and last flu season the virus killed 289 children.
What is shared clinical decision-making?
Under the changes, decisions about vaccinating children against influenza, covid, rotavirus, meningococcal disease, and hepatitis A and B will now rely on what officials call “shared clinical decision-making,” meaning families will have to consult with a health care provider to determine whether a vaccine is appropriate.
“It means a provider should have a conversation with the patient to lay out the risks and the benefits and make a decision for that individual person,” said Lori Handy, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.
In the past, the CDC used that term only in reference to narrow circumstances, like whether a person in a monogamous relationship needed the HPV vaccine, which prevents a sexually transmitted infection and certain cancers.
The CDC’s new approach doesn’t line up with the science because of the proven protective benefit the vaccines have for the vast majority of the population, Handy said.
In their report justifying the changes, HHS officials Tracy Beth Høeg and Martin Kulldorff said the U.S. vaccination system requires more safety research and more parental choice. Eroding trust in public health caused in part by an overly large vaccine schedule had led more parents to shun vaccination against major threats like measles, they said.
The vaccines on the schedule that the CDC has altered were backed up by extensive safety research when they were evaluated and approved by the FDA.
“They’re held to a safety standard higher than any other medical intervention that we have,” Handy said. “The value of routine recommendations is that it really helps the public understand that this has been vetted upside down and backwards in every which way.”
Eric Ball, a pediatrician in Orange County, California, said the change in guidance will cause more confusion among parents who think it means a vaccine’s safety is in question.
“It is critical for public health that recommendations for vaccines are very clear and concise,” Ball said. “Anything to muddy the water is just going to lead to more children getting sick.”
Ball said that instead of focusing on a child’s individual health needs, he often has to spend limited clinic time reassuring parents that vaccines are safe. A “shared clinical decision-making” status for a vaccine has no relationship to safety concerns, but parents may think it does.
HHS’ changes do not affect state vaccination laws and therefore should allow prudent medical practitioners to carry on as before, said Richard Hughes IV, an attorney and a George Washington University lecturer who is leading litigation against Kennedy over vaccine changes.
“You could expect that any pediatrician is going to follow sound evidence and recommend that their patients be vaccinated,” he said. The law protects providers who follow professional care guidelines, he said, and “RSV, meningococcal, and hepatitis remain serious health threats for children in this country.”

(Getty Images)As we transition from the glow of the Christmas tree and Hanukkah candles into the cold reality of a new tax year, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) tucked a little something extra into our financial stockings — a way to turn 2026 charitable giving into something extra for the causes we care about.
When the OBBBA emerged, debate first centered on its potential to weaken the safety net for vulnerable families. Those concerns remain valid. But the law also raises practical questions like “how can households use the available tax benefits beginning in 2026 to help backfill community services and nonprofit missions harmed by the OBBBA?”
The new Section 70424 advantage
Starting for the 2026 tax year, Section 70424 of the OBBBA allows individuals who claim the standard deduction to also deduct charitable contributions of up to $1,000 for single filers and $2,000 for joint filers. By allowing everyday Kentuckians to claim charitable deductions without sacrificing the standard deduction, the OBBBA rewards community-minded giving in the same way it has long rewarded sophisticated tax planners. 
The result is a simpler, fairer system that empowers Kentucky’s teachers, tradespeople, factory workers and retirees to more easily support local causes, keep more of what they earn and play a direct role in strengthening communities we call home. It also moves charitable tax incentives beyond a system that long favored those with accountants tasked with finding the newest, trendiest tax shelters.

For a couple filing jointly in the 22% federal tax bracket, a $2,000 deduction results in about $440 in federal tax savings. Rather than directing those dollars through government programs, the deduction allows households to decide where their support goes. In practical terms, the OBBBA shifts some spending discretion from government to individuals, giving Kentuckians greater flexibility to support the causes and organizations they value most.
 Converting tax relief into civic insurance

By allowing Kentuckians to direct more of what they earn, the OBBBA shifts some power from Washington to households. Beginning January 2026, families can redirect a portion of their tax savings to “qualified organizations,” generally 501(c)(3) nonprofits, creating a form of civic insurance against federal budget reductions. Rather than government-directed spending, this approach allows private generosity to partially backfill or strengthen important services, ensuring that individuals and families, not just government, play a direct role in deciding which missions matter most. In Kentucky, here are some ideas how that choice can be put into practice:

Supporting food security: Cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) shift the burden to local food pantries and church-based shelters like God’s Pantry, the Kentucky Food Action Network and the Kentucky Association of Food Banks. Small donations pooled across a community allow food banks to purchase in bulk and maintain operations precisely when demand for services is anticipated to rise.
Shoring up health care: Reductions in Medicaid and Affordable Care Act funding create tighter margins for Kentucky’s nonprofit hospitals and rural health clinics. Kentucky taxpayers can help sustain the health care safety net for the uninsured. Organizations like the Kentucky Rural Health Association, the Kentucky Primary Care Association and ARH Foundation for Healthier Communities would certainly welcome the added charitable support, especially given the current environment where the amount of federal support is uncertain.
Sustaining independent media: As the OBBBA renders federal support for public broadcasting more vulnerable and local newsrooms shrink, supporting entities like Kentucky Educational Television (KET), local NPR stations (such as Louisville Public Media, WEKU in Richmond or WKMS in Murray), and nonprofit news outlets like the Kentucky Lantern ensures that educational programming and nonpartisan statehouse reporting continue outside of federal funding cutbacks and corporate media consolidation.

A cultural shift toward generosity
The OBBBA, despite its valid criticisms, encourages a culture of charitable giving rooted in the libertarian idea promoted by economist Milton Friedman that lasting social progress comes from voluntary exchange rather than government mandate. 
By also establishing a minimum threshold for high-income itemizers, the OBBBA ends a longstanding imbalance in which the wealthy received tax benefits for modest contributions relative to working families who received none for their sacrifice. The result is a more level playing field, one that allows households of modest means to support the causes closest to them while accessing deductions once reserved almost exclusively for the wealthy.
Perhaps the most significant practical benefit, the deduction offered in the OBBBA allows individuals to claim charitable gifts of up to $1,000 for individuals or $2,000 for joint filers without having to give up the standard deduction. For the first time, families can support their communities with benefits previously available only to those who itemized their deductions and still enjoy the simplicity and tax advantages of the standard deduction. 
The 70424 provision turns individual tax relief into a form of civic insurance: year-end bonuses, holiday gifts or even personal savings can be directed to civic-minded nonprofits, helping backfill gaps from federal retrenchment and ensuring that Kentucky’s communities remain strong long after the holiday decorations are stored.

(Thomas Cooper/Special to Colorado Newsline)2026 is a big year for Colorado voters. The midterms will require Coloradans to weigh in on a new governor and a U.S. senate seat, in addition to 20 state Senate elections and the usual U.S. and state House of Representative elections.
Messaging from all candidates — especially Democrats — is increasingly focused on affordability, leaving some issues, like climate change, in the dust. Yet political candidates that neglect to include climate change in their messaging and policy platforms are making a mistake.
Affordability and climate change are inherently and intimately bound; climate issues are kitchen table issues and Colorado’s 2026 candidates should not forget it.

There is no topic more fitting for the kitchen table than food. According to a Politico poll, the rising cost of groceries is more concerning to Americans than even housing and health care. And for good reason: In the past five years grocery prices have increased by an estimated 25% to 29%, a price hike that low- and middle-income Coloradans feel acutely. And while there are a medley of reasons that food prices are rising (inflation, bird flu, corporate consolidation, the Trump administration’s tariffs), climate change is a leading cause.
Affordable food prices depend upon consistent food production, which is exactly what is at stake as the climate warms and erratic weather like droughts, floods, freezes, heat waves and hurricanes become more common. In 2024 alone, extreme weather events in the U.S. caused $20.3 billion of losses for farmers. Climate change is expensive for farmers and consumers.
 Extreme wildfires
It’s widely known that climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of wildfires by exacerbating droughts and lengthening the fire season. Twenty of Colorado’s largest wildfires ever recorded have occurred since 2001. And these wildfires don’t just pollute the air and traumatize nearby residents — they impact many Coloradans by driving up home insurance prices.
Between 2018 and 2023, Colorado’s home insurance premiums increased by 58%, elevating the state to the unfortunate rank of No. 6 in the country in terms of the most expensive home insurance market. In an already undersupplied housing market, in an economy with chronic inflation, climate change’s impact on the cost of owning or renting a home only adds fuel to the fire.
Energy bills are another classic kitchen table issue interconnected with climate change. The greater temperature extremes arising from climate change force consumers to use more energy to cool and heat their homes. Beyond that, utility providers increase energy rates when they have to make large investments — such as upgrades to make their infrastructure less likely to spark wildfires on dry, windy days.
Climate change creates dozens of other direct and indirect burdens on society that taxpayers must bear. Wildfires and air pollution exacerbate and cause respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, leading to higher health care costs that eventually impact insurance premiums. Extreme disasters and heatwaves lead to fatalities and expensive infrastructure damage. A study by the World Economic Forum estimates that climate change will cost the world between $1.7 trillion and $3.1 trillion per year until 2050, considering damages to infrastructure, property, agriculture and human health. Another study estimates that damages from climate change will cost the global economy $38 trillion per year.
 Cheaper energy
Common sense solutions to mitigate the cost of climate change deserve the attention of Colorado’s aspiring lawmakers. For example, renewable energy sources are cheaper over their lifetime compared to natural gas and are getting cheaper each year. Supporting and speeding the state’s transition to renewables will pay off for consumers in Colorado, much as it did for Texans: Between 2010 and 2022, wholesale electricity costs decreased in Texas cumulatively by $27.8 billion due to the production of wind and solar energy. Similarly, helping consumers electrify their vehicles and appliances will decrease individual energy costs in the long-term.
Supporting Colorado’s local food systems, including local distribution and processing centers, can undermine corporate consolidation that prevents price competition. A stronger local food system could also protect consumers from volatile grocery prices by eliminating reliance on global supply chains vulnerable to natural disasters.
There are also many strategies that can benefit communities and the climate while also mitigating the costs of climate change. Conserving old-growth forests and wetlands can safeguard carbon sinks while also providing natural resiliency to floods and wildfires. Urban design that prioritizes trees, parks, bike lanes and pedestrian access not only encourages car-free transit but also lessens the intensity of heatwaves, improves air quality, and beautifies neighborhoods.
Many Americans already understand that climate change is a kitchen-table issue. Climate change costs Coloradans money, but decisive action can reduce the harm and cut some costs drastically. As the midterms creep nearer, voters should recognize that any candidate ignoring climate change is leaving one of the best policy frameworks for achieving affordability on the (kitchen) table.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)As state lawmakers trek to Richmond for the 2026 General Assembly session that begins Wednesday, some state senators sought more answers from the University of Virginia at a hearing on Monday. 
The hearing, hosted by the Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee’s Education Subcommittee, built on a December meeting with the institution’s leadership about the governing board’s search for a new president and its decision to sign a controversial agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice. 
The DOJ agreement and the naming of Scott Beardsley as the institution’s new president last month capped a tumultuous year for UVA, which, along with other colleges, faced public scrutiny over their leadership boards after Senate leaders rejected several of outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s appointees. Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger had urged UVA to hold off selecting a president until she took office and all board vacancies could be filled.
Monday’s discussions were held ahead of the General Assembly Session so the subcommittee could better understand the UVA board’s decision-making process and address concerns raised by state leaders.
Rector Rachel Sheridan told lawmakers Monday that waiting for the full complement of the board to be filled before selecting a new president would have taken too much time, as the board was also balancing calls for the institution to have stability and leadership.
“Our view is that the board needs to act in the best interest of the university, and every decision that we have made, the board has tried to act in the best interest of the university,” said Sheridan. “Whether that was under Rector Hardy’s leadership or under mine. I truly believe that the board and every individual have operated in the best interest of the university.” 
Sheridan said with that reasoning in mind, the board ultimately decided to hire Beardsley as the institution’s 10th president. who also attended the subcommittee hearing. Beardsley, who also attended the subcommittee hearing, is the former dean of the UVA Darden School of Business and his tenure there was defined by record academic rankings, expanding student access, and strengthening faculty excellence, the university stated.
In November, Spanberger also said the board members “severely undermined” public confidence in their abilities amid the DOJ agreement. Lawmakers, UVA faculty, and community organizations echoed her sentiments.
In April, the DOJ claimed UVA’s admissions, hiring, diversity, equity and inclusion programs violated federal civil rights laws and that its campus culture was inhospitable to Jewish students. The federal government’s investigations, seven in total at UVA, were part of a broader effort by President Donald Trump’s administration to align colleges and universities with its views and to crack down on DEI policies on campuses nationwide. UVA leaders refuted the claims but in October signed an agreement with the federal agency to suspend the probes.
The subcommittee questioned Sheridan on the institution’s decision to enter into the agreement amid concerns by some lawmakers, mostly Democrats, that alumni and faculty opposed it and said it opened the school up to legal liability, conflicted with existing law, and infringed on state sovereignty. Two of the seven civil rights investigations were closed as of Dec. 1, 2025. 
Sheridan pointed to a December testimony by then-interim president Paul Mahoney, who said the agreement suspended costly and disruptive investigations and preserved institutional autonomy and academic freedom. Mahoney called the DOJ agreement the “best option available to us.”
UVA interim president to senators: Agreement with DOJ to pause probes was ‘best option available’

“I do think that the agreement with the DOJ was very fully explained to the committee,” Sheridan said. “If it’s necessary to discuss it again, the interim president would be the best person to do that. He negotiated that agreement. The board does not approve settlement agreements or litigation settlement agreements, but we were aware and supportive of the decision to enter into the agreement.”
The DOJ investigations also prompted the departure of the university’s former president Jim Ryan, who resigned in June..
Ryan wrote in November that Sheridan and Vice Rector Porter Wilkinson worked with the DOJ and Youngkin’s office to pressure him to resign.
Senators asked Sheridan if she agreed with Ryan, noting possible differences. Sheridan neither disputed nor endorsed Ryan’s account, focusing instead on her own memory of the proceedings and a forward-looking approach.
“I’m only going to comment on my recollection of events,” Sheridan said. “I have not now, nor will I ever say anything about Jim Ryan’s recollection of events. Those are his recollections of events. They’re not mine, and … I think that the tone of this conversation … is about how UVA needs to move forward. And at this juncture, I’m not going to have a ‘he said, she said,’ over what Jim Ryan put in the letter.”
On Monday, Democratic senators expressed concern that the governing board and the institution must demonstrate a genuine commitment to fostering a diverse and equitable campus culture amid legal and political pressures. Additionally, they urged the board and institution to rebuild trust with the UVA community after recent events.
“We will continue to aspire to be the best public university in the country, and to be all about excellence and to deliver the best we can,” Beardsley responded to the subcommittee.
Presidents Gregory Washington from George Mason University and Michael Rao from the Virginia Commonwealth Institute were also in attendance to address the subcommittee on similar challenges and priorities at their respective universities, including funding, student diversity and sustaining institutional success. 
Over the next few months, lawmakers will discuss higher education funding in Virginia to address costs for students and institutions.
The General Assembly is also expected to consider changing how governors appoint members to public college and university boards in Virginia, a matter that reached the Supreme Court, and Spanberger is expected to fill several board vacancies after taking office on Saturday.

(Photo by Evan Visconti/Virginia Mercury) President Donald Trump’s administration has set in motion efforts to repeal the Roadless Rule, a 2001 administrative mandate that put 45 million acres of the least developed forest land under protection from logging and construction of roads. As the nation observes the rule’s 25th anniversary, Virginia’s federal lawmakers and advocates are calling for its preservation and say hundreds of thousands of acres of forests could be at stake if it is axed.   
The federal government has framed the proposed repeal as necessary for forest management against wildfires.
“This move opens a new era of consistency and sustainability for our nation’s forests. It is abundantly clear that properly managing our forests preserves them from devastating fires and allows future generations of Americans to enjoy and reap the benefits of this great land,” USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a June meeting of the Western Governors’ Association when the proposed rule change was announced.

Environmental advocates have said since last summer that repealing the rule will lead to land degradation, sediment pollution, and create risks to clean water sources. It would also open up large swaths of the 400,000 acres of the protected forestland in Virginia to logging and potential new roads.
“The Forest Service is ignoring the fact that most wildfires are caused by humans and start within 50 yards of a road,” said Sarah Francisco, director of the Virginia office of the Southern Environmental Law Center.
The Roadless Rule protects national forests from being developed in an effort to maintain clean water, habitats, recreation and old-growth forests. Virginia has a total of 1.6 million acres in the National Forest System, while only a fraction is protected under the rule.
Hundreds of thousands of public comments have been posted since the proposed change was announced, the overwhelming majority of which oppose repeal.U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, and U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, are working to gather more public input to potentially stop the U.S. Forest Service from changing the rule – or bring legislation to codify the protections in law.
“They could undo 85% of that nearly 400,000 acres,” Kaine said in a press conference on Monday.
The senator, joined by McClellan and representatives from the Southern Environmental Law Center and Virginia Wilderness Committee, explained that the water that comes from the forests in the Shenandoah mountains, where the majority of Virginia’s protected forests are, is critical to clean water downstream of the Potomac and James Rivers.
“This administration will literally pave the way towards an increased oil and gas leasing, mining, and other harmful development that would cause us to lose what makes these protected lands so special,” McClellan said.
Members of the logging industry have viewed the Roadless Rule as an anti-logging regulation that they feel limits where the industry can work. Scott Dane, the Executive Director of the American Loggers Council, told the Virginia Mercury in June that more has to be done to maintain the health of the forests. However, the rule already has carve outs regarding forest and wildfire management. 
Kaine has been working to pass legislation to add more Virginia land to the Roadless Rule protections. He explained that the U.S. Senate will often package public lands bills together to be passed all at once, which has led to delays for his proposed legislation to advance. 
But with U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina retiring at the end of the year, who also has proposed public lands legislation, Kaine hopes they can move the bills forward as part of senate tradition to honor retiring lawmaker’s legislative goals.
When Kaine was lieutenant governor and then governor of Virginia, the Roadless Rule faced challenges from the Bush Administration that were ultimately fought off in court. 
Portions of the protected lands across the country that haven’t been given additional congressional safeguards would be at risk for development, should the Forest Service finalize the repeal of the rule. Kaine said that Congress can either pass legislation to codify the protections for all 45 million acres, which would hinder the administration from repealing or changing the rule without an act of Congress, or lawmakers can demand a congressional review  to challenge the rule change.

Virginia joins Chesapeake Bay states, D.C. in new watershed agreement

In December, Virginia, five other states, Washington, D.C., and federal leaders committed to an update of one of the most influential drivers of policy across our region: the Chesapeake Bay Agreement. Now the new Spanberger administration and General Assembly have a golden opportunity to make a lasting impact on the livability of our communities, Virginia’s economy and our quality of life.
The agreement guides an unparalleled federal-state effort to clean up the Chesapeake Bay over the next 15 years. But its impact reaches beyond the Bay. It is an effective tool to advance climate resilience, conserve farmland and forests, upgrade infrastructure, manage valuable fisheries and reduce pollution in rivers and streams. 
These are not only environmental issues, but cost of living and quality of life issues, too. 
Industries ranging from tourism to seafood to outdoor recreation are vital to Virginia’s economy. They all depend on clean water. The closure of beaches and rivers, or the loss of shellfish harvests to pollution, have real costs to businesses. 
Furthermore, as we saw in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, the rising costs to both lives and livelihoods from intensifying flooding and storm damage are undeniable. 
The solutions to these problems are not radical, but they do require forward thinking. With smart decisions and investments now, policymakers can set Virginia on a path to not only meet the commitments it made in the Bay Agreement, but also lay the foundation for a more prosperous future for all Virginians.
One of the first ways leaders can make an impact is by ramping up programs that have already demonstrated success and promise the greatest return on investment. 
In 2025, Virginia celebrated the completion of oyster habitat restoration in six rivers, part of one of the largest oyster restoration projects in the world — exceeding goals of the previous Bay Agreement. By funding a long-overdue oyster stock assessment, Virginia will have the knowledge to build on this success, optimize its oyster recovery efforts and aid the growth of the oyster industry.  
Similarly, Virginia should increase funding for the Virginia Conservation Assistance Program. This program has shown success again and again, supporting private property owners, schools, and community organizations in installing nature-based projects that reduce stormwater pollution — one of the biggest challenges to improving our rivers and streams.  
At the same time, promising initiatives like the Pay-for-Outcomes program are ready to scale up. By incentivizing innovation and only paying for results, the program means taxpayers are getting guaranteed reductions in water pollution for their money. And it’s popular; in its first year, demand outpaced allocated funding by nearly six to one, according to data from the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality. 
This session, legislators should also support proactive policies that save the commonwealth money by investing in the future. 
First, they can ensure Virginia rejoins the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). Not only does this multi-state program help combat climate change, it also generates funding for energy efficiency projects that alleviate electric costs for vulnerable Virginians. Critically, it also pays for projects that protect homes and businesses from flooding. 
Getting these funds flowing again as soon as possible is essential for Virginia’s economy. According to a recent report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, every $1 not invested in resilience today can cost communities up to $33 in lost economic activity down the road. As the federal government pulls back support for climate resilience and disaster relief programs, state action is even more urgent. 
Policymakers can also protect our most cost-effective buffers against storms, pollution, and heat: our trees and wetlands. Virginia is losing both at alarming rates. Identifying and protecting corridors where wetlands can migrate to avoid rising sea levels, and giving local governments the authority to protect their tree canopy, are two basic steps to begin reversing these trends.
Bills that change how localities can conserve trees amid development await Youngkin’s approval

Finally, legislators can make a true investment in Virginia’s future prosperity by increasing environmental education opportunities statewide. Not only will this help equip students with the critical-thinking and problem-solving skills that are necessary to succeed in a rapidly changing economy, it will also help Virginia address the complex environmental challenges of the 21st century. 
There’s an old adage that the best time to plant a tree was yesterday; the next best time is today. By enacting forward-thinking policies and smart investments now, Virginia’s leaders will put us on a path to not only meet environmental commitments, but also plant the proverbial trees that will bear fruit for all Virginians long into the future.

(Photo by Scott Housley/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)New federal guidance to reduce the number of vaccines recommended for all children from 17 vaccines down to 11 comes as states already are charting their own courses on vaccine policy.
The new federal guidelines mention a directive issued by President Donald Trump in December calling to align the U.S. vaccination schedule with “peer” countries, including Denmark, that recommend fewer childhood vaccines — even though those countries provide more robust government-funded health systems.
At stake are requirements for attending public schools, where most states have seen lower vaccination rates since the pandemic, as well as insurance coverage that makes vaccines affordable. At least 17 states have announced they will disregard the new federal guidance.
Many have created formal alliances to share health information. The Northeast Public Health Collaborative, composed of Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York state, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and New York City, announced Monday it will continue following guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics.











Literally children’s health and children’s lives are at stake.


– Dr. Sean O’Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ committee on infectious diseases



“The science is clear. Vaccines remain the best protection for keeping children and communities healthy,” the collaborative said in its announcement. “The vast majority of American adults and parents believe routine childhood vaccines are important for public health.”
The American Academy of Pediatrics held a news conference this month to denounce the changed recommendations from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“Literally children’s health and children’s lives are at stake,” Dr. Sean O’Leary, chair of the association’s committee on infectious diseases, said at the Jan. 5 event. “There’s no evidence that skipping or delaying certain vaccines is beneficial for U.S. children. What we do know is that whenever children go without recommended vaccinations, they’re at risk for these diseases that we can prevent.”
And governors of 14 states have formed another alliance to share public health information, including on vaccines. The updated CDC guidance “creates confusion and introduces unnecessary barriers for families who want to protect their children from serious illness,” said the Governors Public Health Alliance in its Jan. 6 news release. The governors are all Democrats, though the group says it is nonpartisan.
New Jersey moves
One of the states rejecting federal guidelines is New Jersey.
Jeffrey Brown, the acting commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Health, issued an executive order in December opting to keep older federal recommendations for a birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine, despite changes in federal guidelines from the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.
Brown also urged state lawmakers to pass a bill formally decoupling state recommendations from federal rules on Jan. 5, the same day the new federal guidelines were released. The legislation would allow independent action on vaccines without such orders and would also require insurers to cover the vaccines, Brown said.
States break with FDA restrictions on COVID vaccines, ensuring broader access

The legislation “makes it very clear that the department of health can rely on expert bodies outside the ACIP when making vaccine recommendations that make sense for public health,” Brown said in his testimony before the Assembly health committee.
Novneet Sahu, the state’s deputy health commissioner, also testified and said federal changes reflect a dangerous “adoption of conspiracies and conjecture” about vaccines.
“When federal leaders fail and misinformation spreads, state policies and practices must empower New Jerseyans to receive accurate, evidence-based information about infection disease prevention tools like vaccines,” Sahu testified.
The bill, which passed in the state Senate in December, was approved by the committee in a 6-3 vote. The bill was passed by the state Assembly Jan. 12 and now heads to Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy’s desk.
One of the “no” votes in the health committee was Republican Assemblyman Erik Peterson, who said at the hearing that he distrusts the state health department because of decisions about nursing homes during the pandemic.
“You have a lot of derogatory things to say about the federal government. But some of us have no faith in the health department here in the state of New Jersey,” Peterson said.
Changes elsewhere
Similar changes to vaccination policy are happening this year in the 23 states and the District of Columbia where vaccine recommendations that govern schools are tied to federal guidelines, said Andy Baker-White, senior director of state health policy at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. The association is tracking the new and proposed changes in 14 states and the district.
Many are setting up their own advisory committees or task forces to make vaccine recommendations. In many states, the guidelines are tied to school vaccination requirements, insurance coverage of vaccinations and rules allowing pharmacists to give vaccinations.
CDC vaccine officials resign while childhood vaccination rates decline

Brown, the New Jersey acting health commissioner, said in his testimony that insurance requirements are an important part of the state’s bill, saying it “would make sure that people can continue to get reimbursed for vaccines even if ACIP [the federal advisory committee] removes vaccines from the schedule or changes those recommendations.”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in its announcement, said there would be no changes in insurance coverage for any of the vaccines, even though some are no longer recommended for all children.
AHIP, a health insurance trade group, said there had been no coverage changes and that all vaccines recommended as of September would be covered at least until the end of this year.
Florida has held public hearings on Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis’ proposal to remove a requirement that children receive the hepatitis B, varicella (chickenpox) and haemophilus influenza B (Hib) vaccines in order to attend public school.
In Louisiana, there was an unannounced policy change in 2024, forbidding health workers from holding vaccination events or promoting COVID-19, flu or mpox vaccinations. That has made it hard for mothers like Crystal Rommen, director of Louisiana Families for Vaccines, an advocacy group that supports timely vaccinations.
Rommen said she had to organize other mothers of small children this year to make sure they got a COVID-19 vaccine.
“We have these policies that create more hesitation or doubt for parents,” said Rommen, a social worker with a 10-year-old son and a 7-year-old daughter. “I rallied my mom friends together, got a list of parents and children that wanted their child to get the COVID vaccine before my pediatrician could justify ordering enough doses. I’m kind of a bulldog. I’m gung-ho.”
The new federal guidelines continue to suggest 11 vaccines for all children, including measles, mumps and chickenpox. In announcing the guidelines, the CDC said reducing vaccinations aligns with “international consensus” while “strengthening transparency and informed consent.”
Vaccination rates are declining. They might get worse as states relax rules.

But experts said Denmark is not the right model for American policy.
Denmark has fewer undetected cases of some diseases, partly because of more access to health care and testing, so vaccinating large numbers of children doesn’t always make sense, a Danish specialist told Science magazine in a Jan. 7 article.
“The United States is not Denmark, and there is no reason to impose the Danish immunization schedule on America’s families,” Dr. Andrew Racine, president of the AAP, said in a statement.
The new guidelines have “more flexibility and choice” for six vaccines, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said, recommending them only for high-risk groups or for “shared clinical decision-making” rather than for all children: rotavirus, COVID-19, influenza, hepatitis A and B, and meningococcal disease.
That term means that doctors and parents should decide together, but it has caused confusion and reduced use in the past when applied to COVID-19 vaccines for all ages, according to a University of Pennsylvania survey.
“Expecting parents to engage in shared decision-making with health care providers about routine, thoroughly studied childhood vaccinations suggests that the public health community has doubts about the safety and efficacy of these vaccines when it does not,” said Patrick E. Jamieson, director of the university’s Annenberg Health and Risk Communication Institute in a statement.

Wisconsin’s open race for governor has led to a crowded Democratic field in the primary, and the state’s Republican party sought on Monday to call out two of those candidates by name in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. 
“[State Rep.] Francesca Hong, [former Lt. Gov.] Mandela Barnes, and other radical progressives are trying to destroy our state. From wanting to defund police, raise property taxes, and bring socialism to Wisconsin, it is clear that they are out of touch with the needs of Wisconsin families,” the post states. 
However, the initial post made by the party included a graphic of Hong and Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, not Barnes. A screenshot of the original post was posted by Civic Media Political Editor Dan Shafer on X.
Crowley is the first Black person to serve as Milwaukee County executive and Barnes, a former candidate for the U.S. Senate, served as the first Black lieutenant governor in the state of Wisconsin. The two Democrats are the only Black candidates in Wisconsin’s race for governor. There are no Black candidates in the Republican field.

Henry McMaster releases his 2026-27 budget recommendations at the Statehouse in Columbia, South Carolina, on Monday, Jan. 11, 2026. (Photo by Seanna Adcox/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Raising teachers’ salaries by $2,000, ensuring all students can eat breakfast for free, and expanding 4-year-olds’ access to full-day kindergarten are among Gov. Henry McMaster’s recommendations for the 2026-27 budget.
The $14 billion proposal he released Monday marks the last of his 10-year tenure. The 2026 session that kicks off Tuesday marks his final chance to persuade the Legislature to meet his longstanding funding goals, continue priorities they’ve approved in the past, and pass items they’ve ignored.
The governor’s executive budget is only a proposal. McMaster has had more success with his recommendations than previous GOP governors, largely because he works with legislators through the process.
The release of his entire plan came a week after he previewed requesting $1.1 billion in additional money for roadwork to counteract inflation that’s driving up construction prices.
SC governor asks legislators to spend $1.1B more on roadwork as inflation drives up costs

The additional $150 million he suggests putting toward teacher salaries would set the pay floor statewide at $50,500 for teachers’ first year in the classroom. Four years ago, he set a goal of reaching $50,000 by 2026.
“Well, it’s 2026 now, and we’re almost there,” said the Republican governor, noting teachers’ minimum starting pay was $30,113 when he took office in January 2017.
An additional $2,000 boost this year would represent a 68% increase over a decade. The governor’s recommendation would boost state-funded minimums by $2,000 across the so-called teacher salary schedule, which pays teachers according to their years in the classroom and level of college degree.
Most school districts use local property taxes to pay more. Charleston County pays the most, with teachers there starting at nearly $67,400 this school year, followed by Beaufort County, where the salary floor is about $60,100. On average, the minimum starting pay across all districts is already $50,430, according to an analysis of districts’ salary schedules.
Under the increased flexibility that legislators gave local officials several years ago, only the 21 school districts that pay the minimums would be required to increase salaries by the full $2,000. The other school districts could use their share of state aid however they choose, but districts generally have used it to keep boosting their pay scales higher as they compete for teachers.
Free breakfast
McMaster pointed to Arkansas in pitching another recommendation: Last year, that GOP state began providing free breakfast for all K-12 children in public schools, regardless of their parents’ income.
South Carolina should too. Children who start their school day with a meal can better concentrate and pay attention in class, McMaster said.
Roughly 60% of South Carolina’s public school students live in poverty. Many schools already offer free meals to all students under a federal program.
Extending that to every school for breakfasts only — not lunches — is expected to cost $8.7 million, according to the state’s fiscal experts.
Since 2018, legislators have encouraged participation in the federal program for universal cafeteria meals but balked at using state taxes to close any gaps.
McMaster would eventually like for lunches to be free too. But his office did not have estimates on that cost.
Asked about Republicans’ prior opposition to the idea, he said, “We’re trying to fill their minds. We ought to fill their bellies so we can fill their minds more easily.”
Universal 4K
The GOP governor said the state should also make full-day preschool available to all 4-year-olds regardless of their parents’ income.
“We should go to universal. We will one day. I think it’s just a matter of time,” he told reporters. “The more you help the younger children, the more you help them up to where they can learn, the better they’ll be. I’m hoping it won’t be long before 4K is universal.”
But completing that goal would have to come under a future governor. His budget recommends spending $10 million to expand access in private preschools to the children of parents making up to 300% of the federal poverty line. For a family of four, that’s $96,450, according to the latest federal guidelines.
His proposal comes 20 years after the Legislature created a state-paid, full-day program for 4-year-olds in response to a Circuit Court ruling that the state did not do enough to help poor children succeed. Legislators initially limited the program to at-risk children in districts that sued the state 13 years earlier. Eligibility wasn’t expanded statewide until 2021, though legislators didn’t require school districts to participate.
In South Carolina’s dual 4K system, the state Department of Education oversees public school programs, while First Steps — a separate agency tasked with preparing children for school — oversees state-paid classes in approved, private schools and child care centers. Parents can choose either option, where slots are available.
This year, 18,411 children are enrolled statewide, a 30% increase since 2021. Just one district, Greenville County, continues to opt out, according to the governor’s office.
Private centers have nearly 1,900 unfilled slots this year, according to First Steps. McMaster believes making more parents eligible for the program would fill them. The state’s education oversight agency would determine availability in public schools.
“I believe that is the key to the future,” he said of the 4K program.
Other scholarships
Under his proposal, more students in kindergarten through college would also qualify for state-paid scholarships.
The law McMaster signed last year to reinstate K-12 scholarships for private tuition requires the Legislature to fund at least 15,000 slots for the upcoming school year. Both McMaster and state Superintendent Ellen Weaver recommend providing 20,000 scholarships instead, which would double this year’s enrollment cap and cost an additional $61.4 million.
The scholarship itself will rise from $7,500 this school year to $7,634 in 2026-27, as per the law’s required annual adjustments.
New additions in McMaster’s budget request include $15 million for Meeting Street Scholarships, expanding on a privately funded program started by Charleston businessman and philanthropist Ben Navarro. The state aid would not replace what he and other private donors have funded since 2020. Instead, more high-achieving, low-income students statewide could go to college for free, according to McMaster’s office.
The program provides each participating student up to $40,000 over four years to cover tuition, housing, food or other expenses not covered by federal Pell grants and other scholarships, allowing them to earn a degree without racking up debt.
College spending
For all in-state students, McMaster wants public colleges to keep tuition rates frozen for a seventh consecutive year. His budget recommendation would collectively provide an additional $39.2 million in exchange for that guarantee. His office’s formula for divvying out that money rewards colleges with higher numbers of South Carolina high school graduates.
Last year, college presidents sought permission to raise tuition through a staggered system that would keep rates steady for students while they’re in college, while allowing rates to increase with each freshman class. McMaster promised to veto the idea, and legislators squashed it.
$2.3B more sought by SC colleges includes extraterrestrial request

“We have to educate our young people and college tuition is getting so high, some can’t go,” he told reporters.
As for college construction requests, McMaster recommends providing $115 million to the Medical University of South Carolina for a top-tier cancer hospital. That’s about a third of what the college is asking for the project.
MUSC estimates that new cancer cases in South Carolina adults will rise 18% between 2023 and 2028, then jump by 30% over the next 15 years.
“That’s a lot of cancer. That’s a lot of worry,” McMaster said. “If you catch it quickly, it’s better. Everyone, don’t forget to have your checkups regularly.”
The hospital will “deliver best-in-class cancer care and cutting-edge clinical trials for all South Carolinians,” reads his executive budget.
That’s the only specific college construction project his budget would fund. All colleges and universities would get a share of $82 million for maintenance, renovations or new builds. Technical colleges would split $40 million total. Each college would decide how to spend their share.
McMaster renewed his request for a study of South Carolina’s 33 two- and four-year public colleges. He wants the state’s employment agency to contract an independent analysis of the state’s higher education system. Legislators have ignored that request since he first recommended it in 2024.

(Photo by Will Steinfeld/New Hampshire Bulletin)Weeks before a lawsuit against a recent New Hampshire voting law goes to trial in federal court, state lawmakers are pushing to tighten voting requirements further.
The House passed a bill this month that would eliminate the ability for high school or college students to use their student identification cards to vote. Instead, under the proposed law, those students would be required to present an ID issued by the federal government or any U.S. state, such as a driver’s license, government ID card, or passport.
The Republican-led chamber also advanced legislation to end the ability for local election officials to personally identify voters they know and allow them to vote without identification.
The two bills — which will both need approval from the Senate — were passed on Jan. 7, the first day that lawmakers returned to the House after a monthslong break. And they highlighted an ongoing push by Republicans to impose no-excuses laws requiring proof of residency, citizenship, and identity in order to vote and register to vote in New Hampshire.
Rep. Ross Berry, a Weare Republican and the chairman of the House Election Law Committee, argued the state has made major strides toward building trust in elections through a series of recent laws requiring more documentation and verification to vote.
To Berry, the previous voting process — in which people could register without showing citizenship documents and could vote on Election Day without showing identification — was a “farce.” In both cases, voters were required to sign legally binding affidavits stating they were qualified to vote on penalty of perjury. But Berry said because their ballots were accepted after they signed the affidavits, the process left the possibility of fraud. 
“In order to have the general will of the people, you have to know who’s voting in your elections,” Berry said, addressing the House Wednesday. 
It’s a contention at the heart of the yearslong partisan war over elections. Democrats and voting rights groups say the instances of voter fraud are vanishingly small and that the affidavit system still allowed for the prosecution of illegal voters. Imposing stricter requirements, on the other hand, could bar otherwise eligible voters from being able to vote, impeding on their rights, they argue. 
The political fight has persisted through the recent passage of state laws requiring IDs at the polls with no exceptions, and mandating that people newly registering to vote in the state provide hard-copy proof of their U.S. citizenship via a birth certificate, passport, or other document.
That latter law, passed in 2024 under House Bill 1569, is the strongest proof-of-citizenship statute in the country, and is currently being challenged by a number of voting rights groups. Those groups, which include the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire and the progressive Elias Group, allege that the laws are unconstitutional. A multi-week trial in that case is scheduled for February. 
Addressing House Bill 323, the legislation to bar student IDs as forms of identification, Democrats have denounced it as an unnecessary barrier to voting. Rep. James Newsom of Hopkinton dismissed concerns that people are using fraudulent student IDs to vote, noting that there have been no known examples in the state. 
Newsom argued that the process to obtain a student identification card from the University of New Hampshire — which requires fingerprints — is robust. 
“With zero cases of voter fraud of this type, this bill will not improve election security,” he said. “Zero minus zero is still zero.”
Instead, Newsom and other Democrats said the law would have the effect of turning away legitimate voters who live in New Hampshire from being able to vote in the state. And they have charged that Republicans are targeting students in college towns, which tend to vote for Democrats. 
“The reality behind this bill is a blatant attempt to unconstitutionally prohibit students who are already registered and qualified voters in New Hampshire from exercising their undeniable constitutional right to vote,” Newsom said. 
Berry and other Republicans reject the charge that the laws impose major barriers to vote, and compare the documentary requirements to those needed to drive a car. Berry argued all the recent stricter voting laws strike a balance between accountability and ease.
Republicans have made a mission of “trying to get to a system where it’s easy to vote and it’s actually not easy to cheat, and that you know who’s voting in your elections,” Berry argued. 
And he said it is necessary to ban student ID cards because it is too easy to forge student ID cards.
“This is kind of the last buttoning up of five years worth of work,” Berry said. Five Democrats joined Republicans to vote for the bill last week. 
House Republicans continued that effort by passing House Bill 317, which bars election officials from personally identifying voters. Republicans had argued the process was impossible to verify and was vulnerable to abuse; Democrats called it another “roadblock” to voting. 
“It is the classic bill that is a solution in search of a problem; it also takes a needless swipe at the integrity of our outstanding election officials,” wrote Rep. Gerald Ward, a Portsmouth Democrat, in a written argument ahead of the vote. 
One Republican effort fell short last week: an attempt to amend the New Hampshire Constitution to require that voters “actually reside” in their place of domicile to vote failed to get a three-fifths supermajority vote in the House necessary to advance. 
But as lawmakers hurtle into the 2026 session, the efforts to tighten voting laws are continuing. Lawmakers will consider Republican bills to prohibit voters who are legal residents of other states from registering to vote in New Hampshire; to allow the Secretary of State’s Office to conduct random audits of voters’ citizenship status; and to require stricter identification requirements for people voting by absentee ballot and for overseas voters. 
Not all proposals are partisan. Rep.

Without access to timely care, people’s mental health can worsen, said Becky Carroll, the study’s author and director of policy research and analysis at Health Policy Institute of Ohio.   
“We also did some focus groups with parents and caregivers of children needing mental health services and just asked about their experiences and some of them talked about wait lists two years long to get into a certain provider,” she said. “It’s problematic and it’s widespread.” 
But there’s no data to show where those wait lists are the longest, Carroll said. 
There are only 11 facilities in Ohio that offer youth inpatient services, according to the study.
“Eleven around the state is just really not many, and when the workforce gets more specialized, the provider has to be more specialized,” Carroll said. “It makes sense that as you get more and more specialized, there are fewer providers that can provide that care.” 
There are 53 counties that do not have a child psychiatrist and only seven counties had more than 10, according to the study. 
Ohio had 365 child and adolescent psychiatrists in 2024, according to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. 
Ohio had a 353% surge in demand for behavioral health services from 2013 to 2019, but the behavioral health workforce expanded only by 174% during that same time period, according to the Ohio Council of Behavioral Health & Family Services Providers. 
It’s a math problem, said Ohio Council CEO Teresa Lampl. 
“We just simply don’t have enough people to provide care for the people that need care,” she said. “When people have to wait, they do deteriorate. Sometimes they end up in the hospital. Sometimes they need a higher level of care, and then we end up treating them maybe longer.”
This may cause patients to be referred to their primary care provider as a short-term intervention until they can see a mental health professional, Lampl said.
There are workforce shortages among all levels of mental health care for kids and the worst shortages are for clinicians trained to care for children with the most intensive needs, Carroll said. 
“We’re seeing a lot of turnover in mental health professionals and burnout,” she said. 
That turnover can be especially hard on a child who has developed a relationship with a provider who leaves.  
“There’s also the aspect of when the child or the family starts with a new a new professional, they have to tell their story over again, which is problematic in terms of just taking the time to do that, and that may be traumatic to relive the story that they’re telling,” Carroll said. 
“It kind of takes a while to find a person that you click with sometimes, and if there are only a few options … then I think that can be pretty problematic.” 
Mental health reimbursement rates are lower than physical health practice areas, Carroll said. 
“That is a major deterrent for people going into the field when they’re not going to end up making much money,” she said. 
Ohio families looking for mental health services for children ages 6-11 report having a harder time than for older children, according to the study. 
Families with private insurance experience report having a harder time finding treatment for their children than families with public insurance, like Medicaid. 
“One of the key challenges ultimately ends up being an insurance parity issue,” Lampl said. “… It’s much harder if you have private insurance than it is if you have Medicaid, because Medicaid recognizes a wider range of professionals and recognizes a wider range of services.”

(Photo by Evan Popp/ Maine Morning Star) Political activity is creating conflicts at Maine polls at the same time federal funding cuts are hindering election security training. Amid this, voter turnout in the state has reached new heights.
These are among the conclusions of the state’s latest reports on election procedures presented by Secretary of State Shenna Bellows during the session’s first meeting of the Maine Legislature’s Veterans and Legal Affairs committee on Monday. 
“If people want to have their minds and hearts open to the accuracy and the safety and security of our elections, they simply have to look at what’s in front of us this morning,” said committee co-chair Sen. Craig Hickman (D-Kennebec).
The reports together paint a picture of heightened political tension and opportunities for conflict at polling places, but also demonstrate the staying power of the checks and balances in Maine’s election procedures.  
“People are not trusting our elections based upon narratives,” Hickman said. “These are the facts.” 
More Mainers participated in the November 2025 election than any other referendum election in the last 15 years. A total of 492,008 voters cast ballots, which amounts to about 47.4% of registered voters.
As of the latest available data from Jan. 1, Maine had 1,038,603 active status voters, comprising 90.6% of Maine’s voting age population. With 217,262 records cancelled after required voter list maintenance activities, the state recently underwent the largest list maintenance initiative since the establishment of the central voter registration system 19 years ago. That means Maine has a 99.93% active status for all its registered voters.
President Donald Trump’s Department of Justice has questioned Maine’s high voter participation in its requests for sensitive voter information, now understood as a means to carry out citizenship probes.  
Bellows twice rejected these requests, which demanded Maine’s full voter registration list, along with names of officials who handle the list’s maintenance, the number of ineligible voters the state identified due to noncitizenship and voter registration applications from specific time periods, among other information. 
Maine asks court to throw out DOJ lawsuit seeking access to sensitive voter data

The DOJ has since sued Maine and roughly half a dozen other states for not turning over the information. 
Political activity
The majority of complaints received by the Department of the Secretary of State on Election Day were about political activity at polling places, with a couple resulting in law enforcement getting involved, according to the latest Biennial Election Transparency Report.
Bellows’ department received several complaints from voters and poll workers about aggressive behavior by petitioners collecting ballots for a conservative group’s citizen’s initiative to roll back Maine’s inclusive policies, which for two decades have guaranteed transgender students the right to participate on teams and use school facilities aligned with their gender identity under the Maine Human Rights Act.
“There were petitioners who were very assertive in trying to collect signatures and following people to their cars or using strong language to criticize them for failure to sign the petition,” Bellows said.
A previous working group established under Bellows’ predecessor, now-State Auditor Matt Dunlap who is running for Congress in the second district, examined political activities at the polls and recommended further limiting it. Prior legislators decided not to move in that direction. Currently, the political activity ban is for a 250-foot radius around a polling site.
“This election, the level of political activities at the polls certainly led to some significant challenges and administration of the elections for the clerks to maintain calm and order at the polling place itself,” Bellows said.
Election clerks have repeatedly told Bellows’ office that they don’t feel comfortable reporting threats because statewide right to know laws make their personal information public and open them up to threats.  
As a result, Bellows recommended the committee consider making those reports confidential or allowing for personally identifying information to be redacted.
Early last year, the Trump administration cancelled federal funding for election security, including threat reporting and security training. In Washington, D.C., last week, Bellows said she spoke with other state leaders about how states and localities can fill the gap, such as pooling resources to do their own national Tabletop the Vote exercise, where election administrators discuss hypothetical security threats, which has previously been hosted by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.
Checks and balances
The legislative committee will send a letter to the Maine Attorney General’s office requesting an update on its investigation into the mishandling of absentee ballots last election cycle, members decided on Monday.  
In September, 250 Maine absentee ballots were allegedly delivered to an unnamed person’s Amazon delivery box in Newburgh, outside the chain of custody. 
Based on the state’s absentee ballot tracking procedures, the number of ballots missing in Ellsworth corresponded to the number of ballots received in Newburgh. In response, the Secretary of State’s Department decided not to use UPS or the U.S. Postal Service to deliver the remaining 2025 ballots and instead used Vital delivery, a company that typically delivers medical supplies and requires more extensive background checks for employees.
Bellows defended Maine’s absentee ballot process, stating that its redundant checks and balances prevented fraud in this case. 
“I have friends who don’t trust our elections and I don’t really pin it to what just happened,” said Rep. Laura Supica (D-Bangor). “I pin it to a larger national conversation and what happens on social media, on TikTok, Facebook, that is putting out paranoia and weakening our trust.” 
Supica said this instance underscores the importance of Maine maintaining paper ballots. 
But other legislators remained skeptical of election security. Rep. Quentin Chapman (R-Auburn) asked what Bellows is doing to ensure the citizenship of voters who register at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, a process that began under Bellows’ tenure. 
“Only citizens are offered the opportunity to register to vote,” Bellows said, with proof of citizenship coming from a birth certificate, U.S. passport or naturalization paperwork. On the back end, municipal clerks check that those obligations have been met when completing the registration, she said. 
The Trump administration began repurposing a data tool to identify noncitizen voters at the same time the DOJ started asking states for copies of their voter rolls. 
Federal officials acknowledged that the DOJ shared voter roll information with Homeland Security to search it for noncitizens, and Bellows and other secretaries of state have raised concern about the federal government using voter records for citizenship probes.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Web_Photo_Editor-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-13 05:11:48.687731

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)In late December, The Washington Post reported that Merrimack is one of 23 sites across the United States where the Trump administration plans to build a new ICE detention facility as part of its aggressive deportation campaign, citing a leaked document from the Department of Homeland Security. The local response over the ensuing weeks has been intense.
“I’m almost 70 years old,” Mike Tranchemontagne, of nearby Nashua, said. “I never thought I’d be living in a police state, and that’s what we’re turning into.”

Immigration and Customs Enforcement, commonly known as ICE, is seeking contractors to help convert industrial warehouses into a network of detention centers across the country to hold immigrants the federal government wants to deport, the Post reported. Under the plan, seven new facilities would hold 5,000 to 10,000 people each and 16 new smaller feeder facilities would hold up to 1,500 people each. Detainees would be booked and held at the smaller facilities for a few weeks before being transferred to one of the large facilities. The administration plans to put one of the smaller facilities in Merrimack, according to the newspaper’s reporting.
Gov. Kelly Ayotte, speaking to reporters last week, said her administration has heard nothing from the federal government about a potential ICE facility in New Hampshire.
“This whole discussion about it, to me, is, at this point, a speculative discussion,” Ayotte said. “I would expect, if this were a real plan, which I don’t know yet because it’s been media speculation at this point, that there would be a process in which members of the local community would have an opportunity to weigh in, as, I would think, at some point the state would be consulted. But none of that’s happened yet.”
Ayotte also questioned who would staff a Merrimack facility given the fact there is already an ongoing staffing shortage in New Hampshire state prisons.

Tranchemontagne was one of hundreds who gathered outside Merrimack Town Hall Thursday protesting the plans. While the demonstration began as a reaction to the news of a potential detention center in Merrimack, it grew to become a protest about ICE action across the country and the Trump administration’s actions writ large. The protest came one day after an ICE officer shot and killed U.S. citizen Renee Good in Minneapolis, and many protesters held signs referencing the shooting or wore stickers bearing Good’s name. 
“I love my country and I disagree with just about everything that’s happened in the last year,” Tranchemontagne said. “Just total lack of concern about law and order, the Constitution, due process, on and on and on. I mean, it’s unfathomable.”
State Rep. Wendy Thomas, a Merrimack Democrat, believes such a facility would be both a moral and practical issue.
“ICE is a lawless, thug-ridden agency that is not following procedure,” Thomas told the Bulletin. “They’re not following laws. They’re terrorizing people around the United States. We don’t need people like that in our town. They violate human rights on a regular basis.”
Thomas argued “building this facility would make Merrimack complicit in those abuses.”

However, she also pointed to planning and zoning concerns.
“Even if you set aside the moral crisis, and we shouldn’t, this proposal is still a terrible deal for our town,” she said. “Detention centers are often exempt from local property taxes or generate far less revenue than traditional commercial development. That means lost property-tax income for Merrimack, while the costs fall squarely on our residents, our fire department, police and emergency medical services would be expected to respond to a high-risk facility.”
She also worries about the traffic a facility could add to the Daniel Webster Highway, Merrimack’s main artery.
Max Goddard grew up in Merrimack. He worries the former Anheuser-Busch plant — which the multinational beer company announced would close sometime in early 2026 — would be the chosen site for a detention center. (The Trump administration has not publicly specified where any detention center might be located or publicly confirmed or denied the Post’s reporting.)
“I took prom pictures at the Anheuser-Busch plant,” Goddard said during the protest, “which might be the site of this future concentration camp. And I think it would be a tragedy to take what is formerly an icon of this town, and a thing that everyone goes to, and to turn it into something so sickeningly horrible.”
Merrimack Town Hall closed early Thursday in anticipation that more people would show up than it could handle, and Merrimack Police Department officers and Hillsborough County sheriff’s deputies were on scene. Protests against ICE activity in general and the Merrimack plans specifically also took place in Concord and Manchester. Other towns identified in the Post’s reporting, such as Roxbury, New Jersey, and Jefferson, Georgia, also saw resistance and demonstrations.
Erin Walthour, who travelled from Grantham to the Merrimack protest Thursday, said she was horrified reading the federal government’s plans to create a network of detainment centers.
“​​That’s what the Nazis did,” she said.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original article.)The Ohio Supreme Court is considering the meaning of probable cause when it comes to inspections of rental homes, in a case that could have major impacts to Ohio tenants and landlords alike.
The state’s highest court heard arguments last week from CF Homes, LLC, and the Department of Development Services for the City of North Canton, on an appeal from the Fifth District Court of Appeals.
The city enacted laws in 2022 establishing a rental registry, which it argues is a way to keep rental properties in compliance with health and safety standards, including the presence of things like smoke detectors and proper ventilation.
The case centers on whether or not North Canton had the right under Ohio’s probable cause standard to inspect a rental property, despite the fact that the owner, CF Homes, declined the inspection.
Probable cause is a legal standard to which officials like law enforcement must adhere in order to search premises or arrest someone for a particular charge, for example. Often, probable cause is noted when police want to enter a home where criminal activity is alleged.
In this case, the city of North Canton said they had probable cause for an “administrative inspection,” in order to determine a six-unit rental property’s compliance with health and safety standards.
The Stark County Common Pleas Court approved a warrant for the inspection, leading to an appeal by CF Homes to the Fifth District Court of Appeals. The appellate court agreed with the trial court, leading the company to take the case to the Ohio Supreme Court.
The appeals court cited a U.S. Supreme Court case from 1967, in which “inspection programs” were aimed at “securing city-wide compliance with minimum physical standards for private property,” unlike in a criminal investigation, according to court documents.
Attorneys representing CF Homes said the city needed more proof of the need for an inspection than they were given, especially considering the company said no allegations of hazardous conditions were made.
Legal aid groups across Ohio have jumped in on the case, supporting the city ordinances as ways to help “ensure that the rental housing stock in North Canton meets minimum safety requirements,” and also allow the city to protect low-income tenants.
Attorney Maurice Thompson, on the side of CF Homes, asked the court to “leave undisturbed” the original public meaning of probable cause, meaning the government would be required to provide evidence that an inspection was needed, not just the potential for a hazardous situation.
“Because the protections of the home are so important and are so strong in Ohio, I don’t think we should leave this issue twisting in the wind,” Thompson said. “The government has to justify getting into a home.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXBrendan Heil, an attorney representing North Canton’s Department of Development Services, argued probable cause standards could be met by showing that the property “may become hazardous,” not just in a situation when a hazard already exists.
In the case of CF Homes, Heil said the inspection was deemed necessary partly because “the property was aging” and because the building had not been searched before.
Arguments on the North Canton side met with many questions and challenges from Ohio Supreme Court justices.
Justices Pat DeWine and Pat Fischer went back and forth with Heil and an attorney from the Ohio Attorney General’s Office also on the side of the city government, to question the standard of a potential hazard as meeting probable cause.
“Unless ‘may become hazardous’ is just something that applies to any property over a certain age, it seems kind of a meaningless standard,” DeWine said.
Fischer contended that any apartment could become hazard, though some may not, an argument Heil acknowledged as true.
“And so the tenants are going to be invaded whether there’s probable cause or not,” Fisher responded. “Is that what you’re saying?”
The North Canton attorney said showing that the apartment is aging and had never been searched before “is the showing that it may become hazardous.”
“We’re merely saying that as long as you’re promulgating a reasonable legislative reason to inspect for health and safety, you can satisfy the ‘may become hazardous’ under the statute,” Heil said.
He further argued that proactive inspection of a home can be an “excellent tool” in protecting tenants from having to go through tedious court proceedings, like withholding rent through municipal court action, to force problem landlords to fix health and safety problems.
“This prospective inspection would be much quicker because it would happen before the violations would even get to the point of the tenant withholding the rent,” Heil said.
Chief Justice Sharon Kennedy took hold of that argument, pointing out that proactive inspections would circumvent the need for probable cause actions.
“You just said that there’s no violation, so there no probable cause … there’s no reason to enter the premises because the government has no knowledge that there is actually a violation,” Kennedy said.
Samuel Peterson, of the Ohio Attorney General’s Office, further argued the standard to warrant an inspection can be met in the belief that things “may pose a hazard.”
“You don’t have to have an objective belief that there is an existing hazard,” Peterson said.
Kennedy posed a hypothetical situation to Peterson in which she received a certificate of occupancy for a building, proof she was compliant with the law up to that point.
“What you are now saying to me is the government has the right to enter my premises any time they want to inspect anything they want if I’m renting my premises, even though I’ve complied with everything under the law when I built my structure,” Kennedy said.
Peterson doubled down, arguing that to ensure health and safety, “there are certain times that it would be appropriate.”

Bottom Row: Ohio Democratic U.S. Reps. Emilia Sykes, Marcy Kaptur, Greg Landsman, Shontel Brown and Joyce Beatty. (Graphic by Morgan Trau, WEWS from official congressional photos.)With all five Ohio Democratic U.S. representatives supporting a bill to restore expired Affordable Care Act subsidies, last week 3 of 10 Ohio Republican U.S. representatives defied President Donald Trump and voted with Democrats to restore them as well.
The clock has been ticking for Congress to address the rising health care costs as insurance premiums are already increasing for some Ohioans on ACA, or Obamacare, plans.
Despite Democrats fighting for the subsidies, which led to the government shutdown in the fall, Congress let them expire at the end of 2025.
But on Thursday evening, a group of Republicans broke with Trump and helped pass a Democratic bill that would revive the tax credits for three years.
“I’ve been telling our House leadership that we need to address this because this is gonna be a problem, and they refused to address it,” Republican U.S. Rep. Dave Joyce, OH-14, said.
Joyce, from Geauga County, was one of the seventeen Republicans across the country who joined Democrats. It wasn’t his ideal plan, he said, but he wanted to help provide stability.
“All we’re doing is kicking a failed system down the road for a little bit longer, but we can’t punish the people at home just because the people in D.C. can’t come to a decision and fix the problem,” Joyce said.
Republican U.S. Reps. Max Miller, OH-7, and Mike Carey, OH-15, also broke ranks.
“The partisan Obamacare system as it exists has raised costs for everyone, but I want to give Ohioans certainty as we work to unravel the higher costs Americans face from the failed policies of the past,” Carey, representing parts of the Columbus suburbs, said in a statement.
Miller, from the western suburbs of Cleveland, helped push the legislation to a vote. U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson had refused to bring the bill to the floor, but Miller signed the Democrats’ discharge petition prior to his yes vote on the legislation.
“Obamacare has failed, but pulling the rug out from under Ohio families without an alternative would be irresponsible,” Miller, who was traveling and couldn’t do an interview, said in a thread on X.
But U.S. Rep. Bob Latta, OH-5, and the other six remaining Ohio Republicans held the party line and voted against extending the benefit.
He was traveling on Friday, but previously, he told us that he knew the system had to change, but said that what the Democrats want was too expensive.
“They want $1.5 trillion, and now they’re saying the federal debt’s gonna be going up to $38 trillion,” Latta, who represents much of Northwest Ohio and also Lorain County, said in November.
We reached out to each Republican representative; many were busy, but the team of U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan, OH-4, sent along an interview he did with Newsmax. In it, he said he thought it was a bad deal and didn’t make sense financially.
Democratic U.S. Rep. Emilia Sykes, OH-13, was grateful to her colleagues for their support.
“The majority of the Ohio delegation in the House voted for this, and so hopefully that helps our senators support this as well, but this is just the first step,” Sykes, from Akron, said.
We reached out to the Democratic representatives, as well. U.S. Reps. Joyce Beatty, OH-3; Shontel Brown, OH-11; and Marcy Kaptur, OH-9, all applauded the vote.
“I hope that with my vote, assuming the Senate can pass something, half a million people will find their lives less burdened with worry about health insurance cost,” Kaptur, from Northwest Ohio, said.
The bill now goes to the Senate, where Republicans have been more vocal against it.
Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Jon Husted’s team told us that he “remains willing to consider any good faith negotiations that include a crackdown on the fraud in the system that is wasting taxpayer dollars.”
Joyce told us that Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno, who didn’t respond to request for comment, was working on a deal.
Kaptur said that the GOP “better not” force a government shutdown if they can’t come up with an acceptable plan, but she is hopeful a deal can be reached.
“I’m looking for some senators that actually care about the country… Don’t hold this up anymore,” she said. “It’s been too worrisome for people who are hanging in the balance.”
She is also concerned about her three Republican colleagues, ones who helped pass the bill.
Joyce was asked if it was worth it to break from the president if the plan does not end up passing the U.S. Senate.
“I represent the people of the 14th district proudly, and I will continue to do that,” Joyce said. “And people of Northeast Ohio know that I’ve got their backs.”
As for GOP leadership?
“I don’t work for leadership, they didn’t put me in,” Joyce said. “The people in the 14th District put me here, and I represent them, and I’ll do it to the best of my God-given ability until they tell me no more.”
When asked about facing backlash, the representative said that he needed to vote the way he did.
“This is real… This is a big problem, and they didn’t want to address it,” Joyce said about House leadership. “And if this is what it takes for them to finally dunk their head in the water and realize, ‘We got a problem here,’ well, then, I’m glad I did it.”

Ohio’s drive to boost reading scores using the science of reading has had a rocky start in the two years since Gov. Mike DeWine fought for the change, with scores going the wrong direction.
Even with millions spent on new textbooks, and teachers required to take online science of reading training, third grade English Language Arts proficiency fell from 62% in spring of 2023 to 61% earlier this year.
A jump in 2024 to 65% proficiency turned out to be a mirage, as third graders fell right back again last school year.
It’s still unclear whether the scores are cause for alarm or just a natural part of the transition as Ohio joins the flood of states shifting to phonics-heavy lessons to help students decode and understand words better. Some supporters of the science of reading believe small gains should happen almost immediately, even if it takes longer for large improvements statewide.
“We haven’t seen much progress yet,” said Chad Aldis of the Fordham Institute, one of the advocates of adopting the science of reading. “This is disappointing.”
Others urge patience, with some districts that adopted the science of reading early, saying they are on the verge of students showing improvements.
In the Elyria school district about 30 miles west of Cleveland, educators are hoping their patience will soon pay off.
Andrea McKenzie, Elyria literacy specialist acknowledged that scores haven’t improved since the district switched to the science of reading in 2022. But she said this year’s third graders, the first to be using the new curriculum since kindergarten, are on track for an 11 point jump in proficiency rates, according to scores on standardized progress tests.
“This is the moment I have been waiting for,” McKenzie said. “I’ve been waiting for these students to get to third grade to see this through, so I feel like this is the year.”
Though most schools adopted the science of reading right after DeWine started his push early in 2023, Ohio law gave schools until this fall to fully make the switch. Teachers need time to adjust and embrace a new approach. And even Mississippi, whose “miracle” reading gains are the model for Ohio and other states, took a few years before making gains that caught notice.
“Last school year, we had districts who were in very different places in their implementation of science of reading,” said Chris Woolard, chief integration officer of the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce. “We had some of those early adopters that have been doing this for a few years. We had others who are (still in) early stages.”
He stressed that this ongoing school year is the first that all schools must be fully using the science of reading, a “really important” consideration when evaluating results.
Melissa Weber-Mayrer, Ohio’s chief of literacy, said this year is “pivotal” since schools now have to be fully using science of reading, but she also cautioned that it could be three to five years before scores grow statewide.
“Looking locally, we will see things start to move,” she said. “But it might be in a grade level, in a school, maybe in one elementary building within a larger district.,” she said.
Elyria, a district of just under 6,000 students, could be one of those pockets. The district’s four elementary schools were named Science of Reading Champions by DeWine last spring for quickly adopting materials and instruction, even as that district’s reading scores are still not rising.
Third grade reading proficiency in that district fell from 45.8% of students in 2023 to 43.8% on state tests this spring.
But the district has been pushing hard to adopt the science of reading, with the school board voting in 2022 to shift to the Core Knowledge Language Arts curriculum and start using it that fall.
The district had 34 teachers start two-year Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading (LETRS) training — a program many consider the gold standard of science of reading — in 2022, with 30 more starting in 2024 and another 22 starting this school year.
The district also hired two literacy specialists in 2022 to help the one already there work with teachers on reading lessons and with students that need extra help.
The change now has kindergarten teacher Lindsay DeCoster giving students focused lessons on letters, their sounds and how to move their tongues and teeth to pronounce them.
“In the past, we have been skipping over this part… like they don’t need to know how to rhyme, they don’t need to know initial sounds and things like that,” DeCoster said. “If you don’t understand how your mouth needs to look and what your mouth needs to do to make those sounds, then you’re not gonna be able to.”
Lindsay DeCoster, a kindergarten teacher in the Elyria schools in Ohio, helps a student use a mirror to look at how her lips, teeth and tongue move to pronounce different sounds. (Photo by Patrick O’Donnell, The 74.)
DeCoster, now in her 17th year as a teacher, said LETRS training improved her teaching immensely.
“I just didn’t know what I didn’t know as far as everything that really goes into teaching a child how to read,” she said. “We’ve now broken it down to the smallest, smallest component.”
With so many states adopting the science of reading in just the last few years, experts were unable to point to many strong studies showing how fast scores change after adopting the science of reading. That’s partly because districts and schools adopt new curricula, add coaches, and train teachers at different speed and intensity, often varying within a single school, as in Elyria.
But Stanford University professor Thomas Dee, who studied how low-performing schools in California improved using that state’s Early Literacy Block Grants, said changes can happen quickly if classroom methods truly change too.
He found that low-performing California students improved by about a third of a year’s worth of learning over two years, after changing the curriculum, training teachers, and adding tutoring and afterschool programs using the grants..
“I think it’s reasonable to expect measurable improvements in student literacy to follow fairly quickly on the heels of evidence-aligned changes in teacher pedagogy,” Dee told The 74. “The major concern I have is that state declarations for the Science of Reading may not translate quickly—or indeed ever—into responsive changes in classroom practices.”
Teachers, he said, can fall back into old practices of having students “guess” at words using context or pictures – practices that Ohio banned in its 2023 state reading law – but which can’t be tracked.
Aldis also noted that Ohio is not gaining in another important way that can show progress — whether lower-scoring students are doing better and closing the gap to becoming proficient.
Fordham reported last month that the opposite is happening. More third graders are scoring as “limited,” the state’s lowest rating, an equivalent to an F, than before — 20.9% this year compared to 19.1% in 2023.
One factor, Aldis said, could be Ohio dropping its requirement in 2023 that third graders must read well to advance to fourth grade, which motivated students and teachers to show gains on a deadline.
Casey Taylor, the literacy policy director for ExcelinEd, the education advocacy group formed by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, worked on reading efforts in the early days of Mississippi’s shift, as well as in North Carolina, which started a similar push in 2021.
She said Mississppi saw some gains in schools that used literacy coaches extensively within two years, but she cautioned, “It still took several years before we really started to see those performance levels shift at a broad, systemic approach.”
Mississippi, the second-worst worst state in reading when its literacy campaign launched in 2013, didn’t really excel for six years, she said.
“We saw some gains in the 2015 NAEP, but it wasn’t until 2019 that the nation really took note, because that was the first time we reached the national average on fourth grade reading,” she said.
North Carolina, she said, has started seeing gains on standardized progress tests teachers give their students, but not on tests like the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) yet.
Though he wants to see faster improvement in Ohio, Fordham’s Aldis agreed with Taylor in one major way — making real gains takes a long-term commitment.
Ohio, Aldis said, has a history of abandoning improvement projects that don’t show quick results and moving on to something else.
“These reforms are just too important to follow that same path,” Aldis said. “We need to stick with it.”

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)On Dec. 18, the arts world was shocked by news that the board of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts had voted to change the name of the world-famous institution to The Trump-Kennedy Center, effectively immediately.
The new title in full is the “Donald J. Trump and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.”
As explained by the public relations office for the center, the unanimous vote by the board “recognizes that the current Chairman (President Trump) saved the institution from financial ruin and physical destruction.” The office continued by saying “The new Trump-Kennedy Center reflects the unequivocal bipartisan support for America’s culture center for generations to come.”
It remains to be seen whether renaming the Kennedy Center will require formal approval by Congress. In the meantime, new signage has been mounted on the building’s exterior.
This episode is of great interest to me as the author of “The Real Ike: Eisenhower Fact and Fiction.” In my book, I make a strong case for renaming this cultural center on the banks of the Potomac River as the Dwight D. Eisenhower Center for the Performing Arts. (See Chapter 16 — “Ike the Cultural Warrior: The Eisenhower Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington DC.”)
Let me explain.
Washington, D.C., had venues for theater and music when President Eisenhower took office in 1953, but no facility in D.C. compared with the best in other world capitals. Especially lacking were theaters designed for ballet and grand opera. Ike had growing concern that Washington’s inadequate cultural life did not promote the proper image for the great power that the United States had become. This issue was especially concerning at this point in the Cold War, when a positive image of the U.S. abroad was paramount.
In July 1955, Eisenhower signed Public Law 128 creating the “D.C. Auditorium Commission,” which included planning for the design, location, financing and construction in the District of Columbia of a civic auditorium including an Inaugural Hall of Presidents and a music, fine arts and mass communications center. This was the origin of the concept of a future national center for the performing arts.
Eisenhower had personally experienced patronizing comments from foreigners about his country’s lack of culture: “Many years ago when we were in Europe, it was not too rare at all to hear our country spoken of as another colony. When a European spoke of coming to America, he would say, ‘we are going out there next year to see you people,’ and it was in sort of a condescending tone.”
On September 2, 1958, Eisenhower signed the National Cultural Center Act — Public Law 85-874. His dream was now definitely on its way to becoming reality. Ike’s message to the nation was clear: “The cultural center belongs to the entire country. The challenge of its development offers to each of us a noble opportunity to add to the aesthetic and spiritual fabric of America.”
In February 1960, during his last year in office, Eisenhower called for a “President’s Commission on National Goals.” This nonofficial body’s purpose was to develop a broad outline of national objectives and programs for the next decade and even longer. The commission’s final report was issued in late November 1960, just a few weeks before Eisenhower left office.
This 32-page document could rightly be viewed as a philosophic think piece meant to accompany his now famous televised “Farewell Address” to the nation given Jan. 17, 1961, warning of the dangers of a “military-industrial complex.” The report included a strong statement about the critical importance of the arts and surely reflected Ike’s own personal views.
“The arts are a vital part of human experience,” the report read. “In the eyes of posterity, the success of the United States as a civilized society will be largely judged by the creative activities of its citizens in art, architecture, literature, music and the sciences.”
In March of 1969, Eisenhower was in Walter Reed Hospital dying of congestive heart failure. Just four days before he passed away – and against his doctors’ wishes – Ike took the time to dictate and signed a letter to composer Irving Berlin.
Berlin had written patriotic songs for World Wars I and II and many other popular songs such as “White Christmas,” “There’s No Business Like Show Business” and “God Bless America.” He had even composed Eisenhower’s “I Like Ike” election campaign song in 1952. The former president’s admiration and affection for Berlin was longstanding. The letter to Berlin was the last written by Ike.

Dear Irving:
I have cajoled my doctors and nurses into letting me dictate this letter — it is a brief but very sincere note of thanks to you for the wonderful melodies you have created over the years.
A good part of my days here at Walter Reed are occupied with expert treatment by attentive doctors and nurses and some reading, but always with background music. I have wanted you to know what pleasure you have brought to me not only during my recovery but for so many years. No music has meant so much to me as yours.
I hope all is well with you and yours — please do not bother to respond.
With warm regard to you and Mrs. Berlin in which Mrs. Eisenhower joins.
Cordially,
DDE

The national cultural center in Washington, D.C., was begun by Eisenhower and then pursued by Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon before opening in 1971. We owe a debt of gratitude to all four of these presidents. But if not for the fateful events in Dallas in November 1963, future audiences might have been enjoying opera, concerts and theater in the grand “Eisenhower Center for the Performing Arts.”
A soldier, politician, writer, painter, music lover: Ike was a true Renaissance Man.
Perhaps upon learning of Ike’s historic role in the creation of the center, President Trump might be persuaded to give this national treasure the name it deserves: the Eisenhower Center for the Performing Arts. If not, I would be open to a compromise with new signage declaring it the Trump-Eisenhower Center for the Performing Arts.
Alas, dream on.

(Getty Images file photo.)Bill Gates recently made headlines by suggesting that climate change is no longer a priority, but the American public begs to differ.
No matter how much tech billionaires try to distract us, increasing power costs and our worsening climate are directly connected to corporations like Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon racing to dominate the AI landscape.
It’s an issue well known to Ohioans. Ohio is home to over 200 data centers, one of the highest figures in the country, and recent reporting has tied that growth to rising utility prices in the state.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the price of energy has risen at more than twice the rate of inflation since 2020, and Big Tech’s push for more power-hungry data centers is only making it worse.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The data centers proliferating across the country drive up energy costs by powering energy-ravenous generative AI, cloud storage, digital networks, and other energy intensive programs — much of it fueled by coal and natural gas that exacerbate climate change.
In some cases, data centers consume enough electricity to power the equivalent of a small city. The wholesale price of electricity in areas housing data centers is up a whopping 267 percent from five years ago — and everyday customers are eating those costs.
Americans are also shouldering increasing costs of an extreme climate.
The Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard noted that insurance prices rose 74 percent between 2008 and 2024 — and between 2018 and 2023, nearly 2 million people had their policies canceled by insurers because of climate risks.
Meanwhile, home prices have gone up 40 percent in the past two decades — meaning the cost of home repair and recovery from climate disasters has also grown, all while wages remain stagnant.
Data centers aren’t just putting our wallets at risk. Power grids across the country are already strained from aging infrastructure and repeated battering during extreme weather events.
The additional pressure to feed energy-intensive data centers only heightens the risk of power blackouts in emergencies like wildfires, deep freezes, and hurricanes. And in some communities, people’s taps have literally run dry because data centers used all the local groundwater.
Worse still, Big Tech’s AI energy demand has triggered a resurgence in dirty energy with the construction of new gas-powered energy plants and delayed shutdowns of fossil fuel-powered plants. The tech industry is even pushing for a revitalization of nuclear energy, including the planned 2028 reopening of Three Mile Island — site of the worst nuclear power plant disaster in U.S. history — to help power Microsoft’s data centers.

Everyday people bear the costs of Big Tech’s hunger for profits. We pay it in rising energy bills, our worsening climate, our lack of access to safe water, increased noise pollution, and risks to our health and safety.
It doesn’t have to be this way. Instead of raising our bills, draining our local resources, and destabilizing our climate, Big Tech could create more energy jobs, lessen our power bills, and sustain communities.
We can demand that tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon uphold their commitments to use 100 percent renewable energy and not rely on fossil fuels and nuclear energy to power data centers. We can insist that data centers only go where they’re wanted by ensuring communities are given full transparency and protection in how they’re affected by power usage, water access, and noise pollution.
The current administration is ignoring its obligations to the American public by refusing to rein in Big Tech. But tech billionaires still have a responsibility to the very public they depend on for their existence.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Heading into the Florida Legislature’s 2026 session, quashing illegal immigration remains a headlining agenda item for Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Republican-dominated state House and Senate.
Here are some of the bills to keep an eye on.
SB 1380/HB 1307
Sponsored by Sen. Jonathan Martin and Rep. Berny Jacques, these bills represent the largest immigration package filed so far for this session.
The provisions include:

Fines for employers who ignore their workers’ documentation status.
Criminal charges for hiring more than 50 undocumented immigrants.
Rebuttable presumption that undocumented out-of-state drivers are at-fault in car accidents.
Denying undocumented immigrants bank loans.
Requires law enforcement investigating car accidents to verify whether the parties are legally in the country.
Bans translators or interpreters in licensing procedures.
Creates penalties for failing to use E-Verify ahead of submitting worker compensation claims.

SB 1542
Very similar to Martin’s  and Jacques’ legislation, this bill was filed Friday by Sen. Jason Pizzo, an independent. His bill would create fines for employers who fail to use E-Verify at all — not just those who don’t do so in filing workers’ compensation claims.
It would also require law enforcement to use E-Verify to investigate a detained person’s immigration status, and bans businesses that have violated the bill from ever receiving any public contract in the future with any public agency in this state.
SB 1052
Filed by Sen. Erin Grall, this bill instructs public colleges and universities to exclusively admit students who are “citizen[s] of the United States” or “lawfully present therein.”
It would prevent migrants illegally in the country from participating in state-funded adult general education programs, which include classes for GED and English as a second language that help “adult learners gain the knowledge and skills they need to enter and succeed in postsecondary education.”
HB 197/SB 1278
Proposed by Rep. Berny Jacques and Sen. Jonathan Martin, these bills require every business to use E-Verify, a federal database verifying a worker’s immigration status.
This expands a 2023 law that mandated E-Verify for public employers and businesses with at least 25 employees. Now, all businesses regardless of private/public status or number of employees must use the database, the bill says.
HB 991
Sponsored by Rep. Jenna Persons-Mulicka and Rep. Dana Trabulsy, this bill would require new Florida voters to show proof of U.S. citizenship.
The measure also:

Requires documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote.
Mandates that the Florida Department of State review existing voter registrations for citizenship status and forward names to supervisors of elections to request proof of eligibility from voters.
Requires driver’s licenses and state ID cards to display citizenship status.
Expands information-sharing on citizenship status between the Department of State, the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (DHSMV), and jury coordinators.
Creates a new post-election audit process.
Makes changes to the recount process.
Makes new restrictions on campaign contributions from foreign nationals

HB 985
Filed by Rep. Berny Jacques, this bill is very similar to Persons-Mulicka’s bill.
The measure:

Requires election supervisors to verify citizenship status by using the Systemic Alien Verification for Entitlements or “SAVE” program administered by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
Mandates election supervisors “who have determined that false affirmations have been made on a voter registration application” to refer the application to the Florida Office of Election Crimes and Security.
Information received by the DHSMV indicating that a registered voter has received a driver’s license in another state “shall be considered a written request from the voter to have his or her name removed from the statewide voter registration system.”
Narrows the list of IDs that can be used at the polls.
Adds new requirements for voters who registered using a Florida ID.
Expands the use of provisional ballots for voters whose citizenship can’t be verified.
Creates additional steps for vote-by-mail requests.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Legislative leaders kick off the 60-day session Tuesday with an eye toward school funding. 
Here are just a few of the matters that lawmakers have put forward.
The Senate released its plan to address “a myriad of accountability problems” in the school voucher system. After the program opened to all students, it became apparent that administrative and statutory problems needed to be addressed, lawmakers discussed during early pre-session committee hearings. 
That bill, SB 318, unanimously approved by the Senate appropriations committee, would:

Create a dedicated fund for the scholarship programs as opposed to the existing practice of lumping those funds together with all school funding.
Require a minimum $250 million fund to offset unexpected costs related to school choice scholarships.
Establish scholarship clear application and acceptance deadlines for distributing scholarship money. The old system led confusion over whether to send the money to private or public schools.
Provide the state access to scholarship funding organizations’ databases.
Require the Department of Education to investigate written complaints from parents, students, and schools regarding school choice laws and investigate fraudulent activity and overpayment. 

The House is yet to propose any fix to the system.
Gov. Ron DeSantis proposed creating guidelines that scholarship funding organizations must meet to remain eligible to administer the program.
DeSantis also would require uniform paperwork for withdrawing a student from public school, as well as verifying the location of a student before dispersing funds. 
Also, DeSantis proposes a declining enrollment supplement, to support schools that experience decreasing enrollment. 
This could be an issue negotiated during the last days of session, given that in 2025 leaders could not reach a budget agreement on time. 
Sen. Don Gaetz, R-Crestview, is sponsor to a bill, SB 896, that would permit professors, university faculty, and teaching assistants to openly carry firearms on campus through the guardian program.
Similarly, the governor proposes including the Florida college and university systems in the guardian program, allowing qualified school personnel to carry firearms for security. 
‘Harmful to minors’
Sen. Stan McClain, a Republican from Ocala, is taking another run, along with Rep. Doug Bankson, a Republican from Apopka, to create more aggressive standards in determining what books in school libraries can be considered “harmful to minors.” 
McClain presented the matter last session, but it only made it through one of its three committees amid First Amendment concerns.
More bills

Rep. Tom Fabricio, a Republican from Miami Lakes, and Sen. Clay Yarborough, a Republican from Jacksonville, proposed bills in their respective chambers requiring teachers and personnel to swear an oath to the Constitution and nonpartisanship. Those bills have been referred to committees.
Another bill, proposed by Republicans Sen. Danny Burgess and Rep. John Snyder, would require portraits of former Presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln in classrooms across the state. The Senate version has its first committee hearing this week. 
Lawmakers proposed renaming a road at each public institution of higher education after conservative activist Charlie Kirk. 
Republican Rep. Paula Stark of St. Cloud and Democratic Sen. Kristen Arrington of Kissimmee proposed requiring recess for students in grades 6-8. 
Republican lawmakers Yarborough and Rep. David Borrero of Hialeah proposed prohibiting schools from discriminating against students or personnel based on political or ideological viewpoints. 
Sen. Alexis Calatayud, a Republican from Miami, proposed a policy that would place, upon the request of parents, cameras in classrooms.

Ron DeSantis, speaking at Grace Christian School in Valrico on Sept. 3, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)After seven productive years in office, Ron DeSantis will give his final “State of the State” address as Florida governor Tuesday morning at the Florida Capitol.
Mainly because he’s already achieved so much during his two terms in office, this session isn’t expected to be a legislative blockbuster — certainly, nothing along the lines of 2023, when the governor was coming off a 19-point re-election victory and was just a few months away from entering the 2024 presidential race. The Legislature enacted a smorgasbord of conservative policies. “I don’t know that there was any meat left on the bone after this legislative session,” DeSantis summarized afterward.
This year, two of the biggest issues he wants to tackle may not  move at all before lawmakers gather for the traditional “sine die” hanky drop on Friday, March 13, ending the regular session.
The governor’s office declined to comment for this story.
Property Taxes
Take his proposal to substantially reduce if not outright eliminate property taxes for homesteaded properties. Even DeSantis doesn’t want the Legislature to act yet.
“I don’t know that it necessarily is something that you do in the regular session,” DeSantis said last week during a press conference in Steinhatchee.
It wasn’t an off-the-cuff remark. Speaking in Jacksonville in October, the governor floated the idea that lawmakers could “potentially have a special session on property tax right in the middle of the Republican primary season in July or August.”
Senate President Ben Albritton appears in synch with the governor, saying last week that he was “certainly open” to addressing property taxes later in the year.
The House, led by Speaker Daniel Perez, has other ideas. Members have already held committee meetings advancing four joint resolutions that could end up on the ballot for voters to consider later this year. Tension between the two chambers on policy emerged last session, when Perez pushed for a permanent reduction in sales taxes but Albritton walked away from the deal after DeSantis said such a plan would be “dead on arrival.”
University of Central Florida political science professor Aubrey Jewett thinks the Republican Party ultimately will come together on a plan to reduce property taxes later this year.
“I think that tax cuts are still largely the glue that holds the Republican Party together, and so this thought of offering a big property tax cut in some ways will be a litmus test for Republicans,” Jewett told the Phoenix.
“It doesn’t matter if you’re a Trump Republican, if you’re a DeSantis Republican, if you’re a libertarian Republican — the thought is, you’re going to get behind this.”
DeSantis has already set aside $300 million in his proposed 2026-2027 state budget to support “ongoing policy considerations,” arguing any statewide property tax relief framework must be implemented in a “fiscally sound manner” for all of the state’s counties, including its 29 fiscally constrained counties.
Congressional Redistricting
DeSantis has already called a special legislative session for April to concentrate on redistricting Florida’s 28 congressional seats. Albritton has said that timing works for him, but the Florida House has already held two committee meetings on the issue — opening another fissure with the upper chamber.
“He’s now explicitly pointing toward an April special session after the regular session ends,” said former St. Petersburg Republican state Sen. Jeff Brandes, now president of the nonprofit Florida Policy Project, which he founded. “That tells you it’s not a side issue, it’s a priority with national implications.”
Democrats insist any redistricting plan would constitute an “illegal” gerrymander in violation of the Florida Constitution. The governor disagrees, maintaining the state “will be forced to do it” because of an expected U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the Voting Rights Act that could ban districts based on race.
One potential problem with that theory is the timing: DeSantis has called the special session for April 20-24. However, the high court might not rule until it concludes its annual term in late June.
AI
One legislative proposal the governor has been pushing for hard is an AI “Bill of Rights” for Floridians regarding artificial intelligence, which among other things would ensure they don’t get hit with massive electric utility price increases to run AI data centers.
Even after Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a uniform national policy on AI to deter state-level regulations, DeSantis said it wouldn’t stop Florida. “You should read it and see. First of all, an executive order can’t block states,” he said last month. “You can preempt states under Article 1 powers through congressional legislation on certain issues, but you can’t do it through executive order.”
A proposal filed by in the House by Rep. Philip Griffitts Jr., R-Panama City Beach (HB 1007), would create a new regulatory framework for data centers.
Another bill (SB 482), sponsored in the Senate by Tom Leek, R-Ormond Beach, would create the “Artificial Intelligence Bill of Rights.” The legislation includes the right to pursue civil remedies against use of artificial intelligence to “slander, libel or defame.”
Banning vaccine mandates
Another goal that DeSantis set forth months ago is to eliminate vaccine mandates from Florida statutes. The governor and Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo made the announcement in eastern Hillsborough County in September, before conferring with legislative leaders. Five months later, it’s not certain whether rank and file legislators have bought into the concept.
As of this past Friday, no bills had been filed by legislators addressing the issue. Legislation (HB 917) filed by Rep. Jeff Holcomb, R-Spring Hill, would require every licensed health care provider authorized to vaccinate children to advise parents and legal guardians of the “unique risks, benefits, safety, and efficacy of each vaccine included on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule.”
Everglades restoration and water quality
DeSantis has boasted of his financial support for Everglades restoration and water projects during tenure in Tallahassee. In his proposed 2026-2027 state budget, he recommends more $810 million toward Everglades restoration on top of nearly $8 billion overall during his administration to that end.
However, construction of the immigrant detention facility known as “Alligator Alcatraz” atop a mostly idle airstrip in the Everglades prompted a federal lawsuit by environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians, who said it was constructed without environmental reviews as required under the National Environmental Policy Act.
A federal judge in Miami last summer ordered the facility to wind down operations but a federal appellate panel put a temporary hold on that decision.
Legacy time
DeSantis goes into this year with his political future uncertain. Whether he intends to run for president again, he’s certainly young enough (47) to try. Vice President J.D. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio lead in most early GOP public-opinion surveys.
A Cabinet seat might be available in the second half of Donald Trump’s term — either at the Department of Defense, where public speculation suggested he might have subbed in for Pete Hegseth when his confirmation was looking fuzzy a year ago) or attorney general. And there’s always the possibility of a Supreme Court appointment.
UCF Professor Jewett thinks the congressional redistricting and property tax efforts indicate the governor wants to close his tenure with a bang.
“He can already take some credit with adding four more Republican seats [in the 2022 congressional redistricting.] Florida’s responsible for the current congressional majority and, by redistricting again, if he could get, two, three, four, and maybe five more seats — just really gerrymander like crazy — that could help his political future,” he said.
The bid for property tax reduction in particular would be a big-ticket win to take on the road for a future national candidacy, Jewitt said.
“If he could oversee the first state to actually eliminate property taxes for homeowners — all of those things are not just about policy, right? To me, they’re about him solidifying his legacy as a conservative governor who got a lot of things done and who has a future as a presidential candidate.”
DeSantis technically may be a “lame duck,” said Tara Newsom, a political science professor at St. Petersburg College, but his actions in recent months suggest he has a lot of juice left.
“Floridians and everyone else with their eyes on the White House are watching whether DeSantis can take on property tax reform and mid-decade redistricting. With the setting of the special session in April, it looks like he is still a force to watch,” she said.
“If I were advising him as a legacy play, I’d also put ‘pay down debt, build reserves, and keep the state’s balance sheet strong’ at the top of the list,” said Brandes. “Use this final year to bank wins that look responsible in hindsight, not just loud in the moment. In other words, a victory lap that doesn’t leave the next administration with a structural hangover. This is all setting up for a 2028 run for presidential run.”
Former Hillsborough County Republican Rep. Mike Beltran, who wasn’t shy in opposing DeSantis at times when he served in the Florida House from 2020-2024, believes DeSantis missed his best opportunity to stay active in federal politics when he opted not to appoint himself to succeed Marco Rubio in the U.S. Senate a year ago.
“He does these bold things like sacking [former Hillsborough County State Attorney] Andrew Warren, what he did with the congressional maps [in 2022]. Nobody thought we could have gotten a six-week abortion bill through in 2023. He does a lot of bold stuff — I thought he could sit around in the Senate, fundraise, hang out for 10-12 years and then make another run for president.”
Veteran political strategist Barry Edwards agrees. DeSantis’ decision not to appoint himself to succeed Rubio (instead of choosing Ashley Moody) will likely hurt his prospects for higher office, he said. He suggested the governor use his final last year in office to shore up relations with Republican lawmakers, who won’t be nearly as deferential to him once he signs his final budget later this year.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/0-1-1-1024x771.jpeg,,,2026-01-13 00:11:42.881854

(Here is Part One.)
Here we review the new Council on Housing Development; revised parking rules; conversion of commercial and mixed-use zones to middle housing; transit-oriented development; priority housing development zones; and the Connecticut Department of Housing’s new role as a developer as well as funder.
Council on Housing Development
Critics of the new Act have already started to bemoan a new housing bureaucracy created by the Act, and the new Council on Housing Development is one of the focal points (Section 14).
The Council will have 18 members, starting with the Governor, the State’s Responsible Growth Coordinator (an Office of Policy & Management employee), the OPM Secretary, the Department of Housing Commissioner, the Commissioners of Environmental Protection and Economic Development, the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority Director,  the Connecticut Municipal Development Authority Director, and legislative leaders.  The President of the Senate and Speaker of the House act as chairs.  
The Council’s stated duty is to advise the Responsible Growth Coordinator about regulations and guidelines, funding decisions, and approving municipal and regional housing growth programs.  Other roles assigned by the Act include acting as a board of appeals if the OPM Secretary rejects a housing growth plan or regulations drafted to carry out other Act initiatives.
Again, candidly, it is difficult to envision the members of this Council carrying out meaningful reviews of housing growth plans and proposed zoning regulations.  Moreover, if the Council evolves into an active, hands-on housing agency, the Act will be a far cry from “towns take the lead” in promoting affordable housing proclamation.
Parking
Excessive parking requirements are a well-known exclusionary zoning technique. 
Parking spaces consume land and therefore restrict density.  The Act modifies the power of local land use commissions to require parking spaces and deny applications based on parking (Sections 18-21).  A confusing feature of the parking sections is that although they focus on required parking spaces in residential development, a traditional zoning topic, the Act toggles between “zoning commissions” and “municipality” as the implementer, for no apparent reason.
First, the Act states that no commission shall reject any application for residential development “solely on the basis” that it fails to meet off-street parking requirements, unless the commission or its zoning officer finds that a lack of parking “will have a specific adverse impact on public health or safety that cannot be mitigated through approval conditions. . . .”
But then the Act retreats from this broad statement, providing that “a municipality” may require minimum parking for a residential development of more than sixteen dwelling units, but the developer must be allowed to submit a “parking needs assessment,” and the commission or zoning officer – another switchback from municipality– “shall condition the approval” on parking not exceeding one space for each studio and one bedroom units and two spaces for all larger units, or the number of spaces recommended by the needs assessment, “whichever results in the least required number” of off-street spaces. An implication is that a commission may not deny any development plan of less than 16 units based on inadequate parking.
The Act then explains the required elements of a parking needs assessment: existing available spaces, public transit options, projected needs, and any other relevant studies.
The Act allows a municipality to adopt one or two “traffic mitigation districts,” not more than four percent of the total land area, where minimum spaces can be specified for residential developments of fewer than 16 units, provided that the needs assessment process described above must be an administrative option.  The purpose of this provision is not clear.
In addition, the Act extends General Statutes § 8-2c, which allows payments of a fee-in- lieu of parking requirements, to any residential or mixed-use development with 16 or more units “or any commercial development.”
In one of its few direct mandates regarding zoning regulations, the Act repeals the 2021  provision allowing an opt-out from parking standards stated in the Zoning Enabling Act and thus establishes the parking rules outlined above as the required statewide system.
Transit-oriented communities and developments
Another program in the new Act establishes standards and incentives (Sections 11, 12) for “qualifying transit-oriented communities,” which are municipalities that are home to rapid transit facilities or regular bus service, or border such a municipality.  (We note that while train stations are essentially fixed for the long term, bus service is easily changeable.)  A qualifying municipality may establish, with OPM approval (based on a lengthy list of considerations), a “transit-oriented district,” which must allow as-of-right:

Transit community “middle housing” development, defined as nine or fewer units;
Developments of ten or more units that meet § 8-30g set-aside (30 percent) affordable standards; and
Developments on land owned by the municipality or its public housing authority, “any not-for-profit entity” or any “religious organization” as defined in General Statutes § 49-31k.

All units in these developments must remain affordable for at least 40 years at rents or prices equivalent to not more than 30 percent of the annual income of households earning 60 percent or less of the statewide or area median income, whichever is less.  It should be noted that this income qualification standard is close but not identical to § 8-30g, creating another point of confusion.
A qualifying transit-oriented community must also allow as-of-right the conversion of any residential or commercial development into any of the three types of developments listed above.  “As-of-right” means approvable based on objective regulatory standards rather than a discretionary permit, and without a public hearing.
A notable feature of this section is that it directs the transit-oriented regulations to allow  § 8-30g set-aside developments of ten or more units to be approved as-of-right, which presumably means without the zoning commission evaluating whether the development will create a substantial public health or safety concern that clearly outweighs affordable housing need.
Developments of ten or more dwelling units may allow “ground level commercial uses,” excepting developments by religious organizations (we assume because religious organizations cannot claim commercial use as part of their mission).
Developments of more than ten units that are not allowed as-of-right must still meet affordable percentage requirements stated in the “Connecticut Housing Finance Authority’s Housing Needs Assessment.”  This introduces yet another unclear metric.
We believe there is a significant typographical error in the Act’s § 11(i) on page 48, which appears to say that a qualifying transit-oriented community will be eligible for additional OPM funding if it adopts “zoning criteria” whose affordability rules exceed the CHFA Needs Assessment, develop public land or public housing, or encourage homeownership.  Section (i) and (j)(2) refers back to subsection (h), which should be subsection (g).
Following a pattern in the Act that, in over view, undermines the enforceability of proposals, the transit-oriented provision ends with a statement that communities seeking OPM approval of transit-oriented districts may seek exemptions or may opt out of the program entirely.
Middle housing and mixed-use development
Separate from transit-oriented districts, the Act (Section 16) amends General Statutes § 8-2s by requiring each municipality’s zoning regulations to allow, by a “summary review” process, transit community middle housing development or “mixed-use development” on “any lot that is zoned for commercial or mixed-use development.”  In addition, the “TOD” regulation “may allow” transit community middle housing “on any lot that allows for residential use subject only to summary review.”  
In other words, the Act, in another confusing twist, allows transit-oriented middle housing as a development type on any lot zoned commercial or mixed-use, even if not located within a transit-oriented district.
“Summary review” means that a zoning application is approvable based on standards in the regulations such as setbacks, lot size, and building frontage without a public hearing and without “discretionary zoning action” such as a variance, special permit, or special exception.  However, the commission or zoning officer must make “a determination that a site plan conforms to the regulations” and “public health and safety will not be substantially impacted….”  Two pertinent questions about this provision will be whether the requirement of conformance to the zoning regulations could essentially nullify the goal of a non-discretionary approval, and whether a public health and safety determination can be made without a public hearing.
While the more streamlined approval process is enticing, a transit community middle housing development is limited to two to nine units –which in our experience is well below what most developers would consider economically viable.  
Also, the phrases “zoned for commercial use” or for “mixed-use development” are unclear at best.  “Commercial” is a term of art.  If a zone allows some uses that could be considered commercial but the zone has some other name, is it a “commercial zone?”  And “mixed-use” is not defined.  Moreover, does the final sentence about “a residential use subject only to summary review” refer to the middle housing/commercial/mixed use or the residential use?  This is another example of unclear drafting that vetting could have resolved.
Priority housing development zones
The Act contains a voluntary program, to be administered by the Department of Housing, for “priority housing development zones” (Sections 8-10).  Such zones must:

Be located within an existing “residential or commercial district” that is “suitable” for the type of development the PHDZ program allows;
Be consistent with the state plan of conservation and development; and
Encompass no less than ten percent of the “developable land” within the municipality.

The zone’s regulations must:

Be consistent with the municipal or regional housing growth plan;
Be “likely to increase production of new dwelling units” (note “affordable” not specified);
As required by General Statutes §§ 8-2 (b)(4-6), provide housing opportunities including multi-family for all residents of the municipality and the region;” promote housing choice and economic diversity; and “expressly allow the development of housing” identified in the state’s “consolidated” housing plan and the State Plan of Conservation and Development;”
Permit multi-family housing “as of right;”
Allow single-family houses at a minimum of four units per acre, townhouses and duplexes at six per acre, and multi-family at ten per acre; and
Require only a site plan or subdivision approval, no special permit or special exceptions.

However, a zoning commission may “modify, waive, or eliminate dimensional standards” such as building height, setbacks, lot coverage, parking ratios, and road standards to support the minimum densities.
PHDZ regulations may allow a mix of business, commercial, and non-residential uses if such uses are “consistent” with the as-of-right residential uses and required densities.
A PHDZ may overlay an historic district unless the historic district’s requirements render the PHDZ “out of compliance” with what PHDZs require.  The Act does not state how this relates to the historic district “certificate of appropriateness” requirement.
A PHDZ must be approved by the Commissioner of Housing, who may, one year later, rescind the approval based on a “lack of building permits or other indications of progress toward construction of dwelling units. . . .”
The PHDZ rules are borrowed in part from the Incentive Housing Zone program adopted in 2007 and still on the books at General Statutes §§ 8-13m to 8-13x.  That program largely fizzled in the 2008-2011 recession when the General Assembly declined to appropriate financial incentives that were a quid pro quo for amending regulations.  
As will be discussed in Part Three of this series, under Housing Growth Plans, the requirement that PHDZ regulations must be “consistent” with municipal or regional growth plans is problematic because the Act does not contemplate the adoption of housing growth plans until 2028 and 2029.  In addition, the ability of zoning commissions to modify or eliminate enacted regulations, and of the Commissioner of Housing to rescind a PHZD approval after one year based on lack of progress, will have a chilling effect on use of this program.  
Respectfully, it is difficult to envision a municipality utilizing this program.
Department of Housing powers
The Act (Section 48) grants the Department of Housing a package of new powers by which the DOH may not only fund development but act as developer and manager, akin to what public housing authorities may do.  
DOH must report its activities under this new program to the new Council on Housing Development.  It is not clear if this section replaces the existing statutes regarding the Connecticut Housing Authority, General Statutes §§8-119ZZ to 8-122.
Tweaks to § 8-30g moratorium rules
The Act slightly modifies the point system by which municipalities subject to § 8-30g may achieve a four-year moratorium (Sections 16, 41).   
It awards an additional one-quarter (0.25) point for units in a transit community middle-housing development.  If a municipality has adopted a priority housing development zone and received DOH approval of that zone, its moratorium points threshold is reduced from the greater of two percent/75 points to the greater of 1.75 percent or 65 points.  
In the case of a municipality that has adopted a municipal or regional housing growth plan, has more than 20,000 dwelling units, and has previously obtained a moratorium, its required points for a next moratorium are reduced to 1.5 percent of its total housing units, with no alternative minimum.  Units constructed by or in conjunction with a housing authority achieve an additional 0.25 points per unit.
Tim Hollister and Andrea Gomes are land use attorneys at the Hartford office of Hinckley Allen.  They both work regularly on affordable housing development.  
In 2022-23, Hollister co-chaired a statewide working group tasked by the legislature with reviewing all of the affordable housing plans (so-called “§ 8-30j plans”) prepared by nearly all municipalities and providing recommendations on how such plans could be improved.  In September 2024, he published here a five-part series about affordable housing reform and in July 2025, a two-part series explaining House Bill 5002, the one vetoed by the governor in June 2025, and what could be done to fix it.
Gomes regularly represents clients before local and state agencies and in state court. She has assisted with obtaining municipal approvals and litigating affordable housing matters and property disputes such as quiet title actions, easement disputes, nuisance actions, and adverse possession cases. 
Attorney Raphael Podolsky also contributed to this series.

Wes Moore to a second term, even as the first-term Democrat's job approval numbers continue a downward trend, according to a new poll.","Gov. Wes Moore (D) talks to reporters in November. A new poll shows the governor is still popular, but his popularity continues to wane. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Roughly half of Maryland voters said they would vote to reelect Gov. Wes Moore to a second term, even as the first-term Democrat’s job approval numbers continue a downward trend.
The poll released Tuesday by Annapolis-based Gonzales Research & Media represents a mixed bag for the governor.
“If the election were today, Moore would be reelected, but the election isn’t today,” said Patrick Gonzales, a veteran state pollster. “It’s 10 months away. We have a session that is going to be rather problematic, I suspect, for the governor. Where we are six months from now, where we are on Labor Day, that’s going to matter. That’s how I see it.”
The poll of 808 registered Maryland voters who said they were likely to vote in 2026 was conducted between Dec. 21 and Jan. 6. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.5%.
Gonzales also asked who voters would support if the 2026 election were held today.
Moore, with 49.9%, tops a generic Republican and third-party candidate. The number is driven by nearly 76% of Democrats who said they would give Moore a second term.
Democrats hold a 2-1 registration advantage over Republicans in Maryland, making up slightly more than 50% of all registered voters in the state.
Predictably, 81% of Republicans said they would back a Republican candidate. Unaffiliated voters are more evenly split, with 35% saying they would vote for Moore and 32% favoring the unnamed Republican.
Gonzales noted that polling data suggests voter discontent over pocketbook issues: affordability, the economy and taxes. Nearly six in 10 voters who responded said they believe they are paying too much in taxes.
“They’re paying too much for their electricity,” he said. “They’re paying too much in taxes and people are [angry].”
All of which is a harbinger for a potential pocketbook election, he said.
Gov. Wes Moore has seen a narrowing of the separation between voters who approve of his job performance and those who disapprove since entering office. (Gonzales Research & Media Services)
Gonzales noted that of those who said they pay too much in taxes, “a hypothetical Republican candidate bests Moore by 13 points, 47% to 34%.”
Another 41% said they believe they pay “the right amount” in taxes. Just 1% said they believe they should pay more.
Last year, Moore and the General Assembly increased taxes by a projected $1.6 billion,  part of a plan to close a projected $3.3 billion structural budget deficit.
The expectation was that the tax increase, coupled with one-time fund shifts and some cuts, would fill the spending gap and leave $300 million for the fiscal 2028 budget year.
Those expectations fizzled. The state faces a $1.5 billion projected structural deficit for the coming budget year. Officials point the finger at federal actions including the loss of 25,000 federal jobs since President Donald Trump took office.
Republican candidates in recent history enjoyed late election year surges tied to one or more so-called pocketbook issues. In 1994, Ellen Sauerbrey lost to Parris Glendening by just 6,000 voters. In 2002, Robert Ehrlich became the first Republican elected governor in nearly four decades. In 2014, Larry Hogan won the first of two consecutive elections. He was the first Republican to do so since Theodore McKeldin.
Downward job approval trend continues
Moore entered office in 2023 enjoying approval of roughly six in 10 Marylanders. He peaked in Gonzales’ September 2024 poll, when 64% of those surveyed approved of his efforts. The gap between those who approved and those who disapproved in that poll was 35 points.
Since then, there has been a downward trend. Last March, there was a 19-point separation. In Tuesday’s poll, 52% said they approve of the job Moore is doing compared to 41% who disapprove, three points lower than a Gonzales survey in March 2025. The governor has performed similarly in other surveys, including the Institute for Politics at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.
Beneath those top-line numbers in the Gonzales poll, the survey shows a continuing trend of voters who are changing their minds about Moore’s efforts.
The current poll shows an 11-point separation between those who approve and those who disapprove. And for the first time since Gonzales asked about Moore’s job performance, the number of those who said they strongly disapprove is larger than those who strongly approve.
Roughly one voter in three said they strongly disapproved of Moore’s job performance heading into the final session of the current term — a 7-point change from March.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Moore lost ground with Democrats, Republicans and unaffiliated voters. While 73% of Democrats approved of Moore’s performance, that was down from 83% in March 2025. At the same time, those who disapproved increased five points, to 18%.
In March, one-fifth of unaffiliated voters declined to offer an opinion on Moore’s job performance. Now, just 10% declined to answer: 41% of independent voters approve of the governor’s performance — a 7-point increase from March — but 49% said they disapproved, also an increase of seven points.
Democratic optimism
Moore’s job approval numbers come even as the Gonzales poll shows an uptick in overall sentiment about the direction of the state.
Of those surveyed, 47% said the state is moving in the right direction compared to 44% who said the state is on the wrong track.
The results are an improvement from last March when 50% said the state was on the wrong track and 41% said things were moving in the right direction.
The results don’t track directly with Moore’s job approval numbers.
“It’s not solely tied to whether people think taxes are too high,” Gonzales said. “There are other factors that play into what seems like a contradiction in the poll. I wouldn’t get all bollixed up on that.”
Instead, Gonzales said national politics and the impending midterm elections — a referendum on Trump — may be in play. Democrats nationally are eying the potential to retake a majority in the U.S. House in November.
“When we did the poll in March, Trump had just taken office and Democrats were a bit demoralized,” Gonzales said. “Now they’ve got that eye of the tiger, Rocky and Apollo Creed running on the beach mentality back and 70% of Democrats see things moving in the right direction for them.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC_4543-1024x681.jpeg,,,2026-01-13 00:11:42.881854
,Mississippi Today,2026-01-13 04:08:42+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Hinds DA Jody Owens alleges federal agents plied him with alcohol, entrapping him in bribery scheme",Anna Wolfe and Molly Minta,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/12/jody-owens-alleges-entrapment-bribery-scheme/,Jody Owens,"Hinds County District Attorney Jody Owens filed hundreds of pages of documents in federal court Monday containing salacious quotes from undercover agents, an interview with a now-convicted felon, a transcript of a federal grand jury interview and a photograph of an undercover FBI agent smiling at an open fridge full of alcoholic drinks. 
The federal government swiftly filed an emergency request for the judge in Owens’ federal bribery case to permanently seal the motion and the attached exhibits, claiming it violated a protective order in the case and could “influence the jury pool.” 
Owens is charged with eight criminal counts, including conspiracy, bribery, racketeering, wire fraud, money laundering and making false statements. He has pleaded not guilty, and his 68-page motion points to his likely defense — entrapment. 
“In its unrestrained zeal to ‘get something’ on Owens, the Government made material misrepresentations in the indictment; concealed evidence; lied to the Grand Jury; induced Owens after he rejected criminal overtures and exhibited reluctance; strategically used alcohol to target Owens, who is a diagnosed alcoholic, to break down his resistance, overcome his reluctance, and elicit incriminating statements,” the motion reads.

Former Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and former Jackson City Councilman Aaron Banks have also pleaded not guilty, and a trial is scheduled for July. 
The FBI sting began in 2023, when agents came to Jackson impersonating wealthy, out-of-state developers seeking to invest in downtown. 
In the course of their operation, Owens allegedly helped the developers bribe Lumumba by translating the agents’ cash into checks from multiple supposed campaign donors, and forking over the funds while on a yacht in south Florida. According to documents obtained by Mississippi Today, the fictitious developer group had invited Lumumba to Fort Lauderdale, just outside Miami, under the guise of a fundraising event, including a sunset cruise.
Lumumba then allegedly called his planning and development director in exchange for the money and asked him to move up a deadline in a bid for proposals, theoretically giving Owens’ new developer friends an advantage. Photos of Lumumba talking on the phone and Owens handling cash appear inside the indictment.
The federal government also accused Owens of bribing Banks with $10,000 for his future vote on the project.
The federal indictment is chock full of quotes from Owens, taken from hours of tape the undercover agents recorded during their conversations with the district attorney. Owens’ brow-raising remarks – which he described as “cherry-picked” and “drunken, locker room banter” – extend to topics far beyond the alleged bribery scheme. 
“We can take dope boy money,” Owens is quoted in the indictment as saying, “… but I need to clean it and spread it.”
The indictment alleges Owens told the agents he was mixing their cash with “dope money and drug money and more than a million dollars” and storing it at the district attorney’s office. 
But the indictment does not include charges related to these comments. This is another thing Owens’ motion challenges. 
“The Government intentionally used a ‘speaking indictment’ to foment public anger and acrimony toward Owens resulting in widespread conclusions of guilt with no regard for due process,” the motion reads.
Owens’ motion includes similarly detailed descriptions of the FBI’s attempts to learn about his activities, despite the government’s claims in grand jury testimony that Owens “inserted” himself into its investigation. 
Months before the real estate developers came to town, the motion claims, the FBI had set its sights on broaching Owens’ network by turning a law enforcement officer and former candidate for Hinds County Sheriff, Torrence Mayfield, who was also working as the district attorney’s bodyguard. 
With the help of a jailhouse informant and a convicted felon who runs a Jackson nightclub, Owens’ motion claims the feds indicted Mayfield on federal firearm charges in 2022 after he bought a rifle for the nightclub owner. In 2025, Mayfield pleaded guilty to one charge of making false statements to a gun dealer. 
Owens’ motion says the feds sat on the indictment until they got to town. Then, Owens claims they used it to pressure Mayfield, arranging a SWAT team to arrest the unsuspecting man in April 2023 as he was “leaving a health club wearing a plastic suit to help him lose weight.” 
For more than three hours, the motion says agents interviewed Mayfield as he “sat handcuffed in the backseat sweating profusely in his plastic suit.” He told them about his suspicions of corruption in city government and local law enforcement. 
“And you got to understand, we have heard all those things from the County, the City, like everything,” one of the agents told him. “We just are now hearing a position where you could get something.” 
The motion repeatedly cites this interaction, claiming it shows the government wanted to “get something” on Owens. The motion also alleges the federal government concealed this transcript from the defense. 
“To coerce Mayfield, the FBI agents repeatedly reminded him that prison was in his immediate future unless he could ‘come up with something,’” the motion reads.
Owens’ motion lingers on a paragraph from the indictment in which the government asserts the undercover agent initially made contact with the district attorney after casually happening on his lounge, Downtown Cigar Company.

The government claimed a lobbyist the agent was meeting with while in town recommended the establishment. The inclusion of that detail puzzled some onlookers when the indictment was unsealed in November 2024.
And Owens alleged in his motion that it was a misrepresentation by the government. Instead, his lawyers assert that the informant knew what he was doing when he stepped into Owens’ establishment.
The motion claims the FBI began investigating Owens long before the cigar shop scene. Specifically, it pointed to a September 2022 email in which a local FBI agent discussed Owens’ businesses and wrote, “Also, we are getting Jody added as a subject to one of our investigations but that hasn’t happened yet.” 
But when a U.S. Department of Justice lawyer asked FBI special agent Lawrence Correll during an October 2024 federal grand jury proceeding whether Owens had been a target of the FBI “as somebody that had been previously mentioned as somebody who was taking bribes” at the launch of the investigation, Correll said Owens was not, according to the transcript reviewed by Mississippi Today. 
Correll answered affirmatively when the attorney asked whether the initial FBI agent had “just happened to kind of run into Owens.”
“And is it accurate to say that Owens kind of then inserted himself into this bribery scheme?” the attorney asked, and Correll responded, “That’s correct.”
The filing includes several images of Owens with a beverage in his hand, including one in which he appears slumped over, holding his head in his hand, and two with his face on the table. 
The undercover sting carried out in Jackson from 2022 to 2024 resembled FBI operations that ensnared public officials in other cities. The agents treated a councilman from Cincinnati to the same treatment, a yacht ride and an outing to a Miami cabaret club, according to news reports.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/07003728/829A5237-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-12 23:12:15.515789

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)After a marathon voting session marked by tense debate, the Legislature Monday night sent a package of bills that would limit local police cooperation in immigration enforcement to Gov. Phil Murphy’s desk.
The trio of bills includes a bill that would codify the state’s Immigrant Trust Directive, a 2018 order from the state attorney general that restricts when state and local law enforcement can aid federal immigration agents.
NJ lawmakers pass bill to expand protections for women in prison

Activists who packed the rafters in the Assembly chambers in Trenton’s Statehouse cheered loudly after the bill’s passage, hailing it as a landmark moment for immigrant rights at a time when the Trump administration is pursuing an aggressive mass deportation policy. The bill passed the Assembly 46-26 and the Senate 23-13.
The Legislature’s action comes less than a week after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis, leading to widespread condemnation from Trump critics.
“I, myself, was an immigrant who came here in 1978 at the age of six, and never in a million years did I ever think that we would be in a place like this today,” said bill sponsor Assemblywoman Ellen Park (D-Bergen). “It really breaks my heart because I feel that my family has achieved the American dream.”
Provisions of the bills would:

Prohibit law enforcement from engaging in “racially influenced policing,” like stopping someone based on their suspected immigration status and asking someone’s immigration status unless relevant to a criminal investigation.
Mandate that prosecutors inform criminal defendants of immigration consequences, limit prosecutors from telling a jury about a defendant’s immigration status in certain cases, and prevent prosecutors from assuming a non-citizen defendant is a flight risk when assessing whether they should be jailed before trial.
Bar government entities and health care facilities from collecting private information — like place of birth or social security number — in certain instances.
Direct the attorney general to develop policies for some locations — hospitals, public schools, shelters, places of worship, and courthouses — where assisting federal civil law enforcement would be prohibited.
Prohibit a government entity from selling, sharing, or transferring license plate information unless required under a warrant or required by law, and require any entity that shares records to provide notice to the person whose information was shared.
Require state officials to develop training programs explaining the legislation and mandate all state, county, and local law enforcement officers to complete the training within 60 days.
Mandate annual reporting to the attorney general about when police officers aided federal immigration agents, to be posted online.

The bills were introduced less than two weeks ago and must be signed or vetoed before Murphy leaves office Jan. 20.
While Murphy has not said whether he would sign the bills, he conditionally vetoed the bill addressing data collection, requiring both chambers to reconvene on the measure and make minor edits before passing it again (the final version passed the Assembly 45-21 and the Senate 24-12).
“I commend the sponsors for their commitment to protecting the privacy rights of all people present in this State, who might otherwise be deterred from applying for government benefits and services, or seeking needed health care or other assistance out of fear that this information could be used against them and their families by the federal government,” Murphy wrote in the conditional veto. 
Immigrant advocates have been urging the Legislature to codify the directive for more than a year. Amy Torres, executive director of New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, called Monday’s votes a “hard-earned win.”
“As these bills move to the Governor’s desk, New Jersey is one step closer to becoming a place where fear no longer dictates people’s lives,” Torres said in a statement. “This legislature has made it clear: the answer to this world’s uncertainty can be found by leading with our values. While this isn’t a finish line, it is long-awaited steady ground. These protections are a leg up on the chaos and confusion that have controlled immigrant lives for too long.”
Republican opponents of the legislation contend it creates “sanctuaries” for criminals, hinders law enforcement operations, and undermines federal immigration laws.

Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia (R-Sussex) said New Jersey has “already seen what happens when that system fails.” Fantasia noted that a Red Bank man who entered the United States illegally was charged with killing a mother and her child in an alleged drunk driving crash last year.
“That tragedy did not happen in a vacuum. It happened because of an enforcement breakdown,” she said.
Sen. Raj Mukherji (D-Hudson) said it’s a different time in America, citing the Minneapolis shooting that left Renee Good dead. The Trump administration says the agent who shot Good was defending himself from her attempts to drive her car into him.
Mukherji, who was born in India and has lived in the United States nearly his entire life, said the New Jersey legislation would restore trust between communities and law enforcement that has dropped as a result of the federal government’s actions.
“My kids and my wife and I are of a color where I wonder if I should be carrying around a passport card or a copy of my passport, because Americans are being detained and even deported by this ICE,” he said.

Kevin Ryan, D-Montville, is certain to make history.","The special election Tuesday to fill the vacancy left by the death of Rep. Kevin Ryan, D-Montville, is certain to make history, regardless of who wins an off-cycle winter contest enlivened by story lines of bruised feelings, litigation and an 11th-hour surprise.
Voters could put a member of a state-recognized Connecticut tribe in the General Assembly, apparently for the first time, or a Republican in the 139th House District seat for the first time. It was held exclusively by Ryan since its lines were drawn after the 1990 Census and took effect in 1992.
And, just to add a little spice, there is at least an outside chance the results will be thrown out and a second special election ordered in the district, which spills across portions of Ledyard, Montville and Norwich.
The Democratic candidate is Larry Pemberton Jr., a member of the Eastern Pequot tribe, and, until very recently, an unaffiliated voter, an element of his bio that might not have been widely known on Dec. 3, the night he won the Democratic endorsement on a 9-3 vote in Montville.
The Republican nominee is Brandon Sabbag, a businessman who struggled with homelessness as a young man. And, as was disclosed Monday afternoon by The Day of New London, he also has a criminal record, with convictions for misdemeanor assault and felony witness tampering in 2018.
There is a third candidate whose name is not on the ballot but still is playing a role in two ways: Mark Adams, a Republican endorsed by the local Independent Party, is suing over his exclusion, and he is campaigning as a write-in candidate. He was the GOP nominee in 2022 and 2024.
A Superior Court judge declined to last week to dismiss Adams’ lawsuit, which claims the secretary of the state’s office wrongly refused to accept his Independent Party nomination papers over a technicality — a missing signature. Should he succeed, the remedy could be a new election.
“There is a lot of drama, a lot of expense for an election that only is going to have a 10-month impact,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford.
The prize in the special election is completing the remainder of Ryan’s term. In 10 months, the seat will be on the ballot again, with a full two-year term at stake. Given the hard feelings surrounding each party’s endorsement, the winner could face a primary this summer.
Neither Sabbag nor Pemberton could be reached for comment Monday.
Online court records show Sabbag was arrested in February 2016 and charged with the misdemeanor crimes of third-degree assault and third-degree strangulation. A year later, he was charged with witness tampering, a felony.
He pleaded guilty on Feb. 13, 2018 to the charges in both cases and was sentenced to probation. In a text message to The Day, he indicated the charges arose from a dispute with his romantic partner.
“There was a time when we were homeless and in a bad way,” he wrote. “Faced with those dire circumstances, we fought as many couples do.”
He told The Day they remain a couple.
“Since then, we have pulled our lives together with God’s help,” he wrote. “We all have a past. I am thankful that God’s grace is sufficient for me and he has saved me from the man I once was.”
Candelora said that Sabbag addressed the episode forthrightly.
Sabbag had previously spoken publicly of his homelessness, including in remarks to the Connecticut Mirror, but not his criminal record.
On the Democratic side, Pemberton won the endorsement over Billy Caron, a member of the Montville town council for 20 years and a long-time friend of Ryan’s. Caron was a pall bearer at the funeral.
Pemberton, who also lives in Montville, is the treasurer of the Eastern Pequot Tribal Nation, which is recognized by the state but not the federal government. His brother in law is Rodney Butler, the tribal chairman of the Mashantucket Pequots, the owner of the Foxwoods Resort and Casino. 
He was backed by state Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, whose district includes Ledyard, Norwich and a portion of Montville. Osten is a long-time ally of the Pequots and Mohegans, and she is confident that if Pemberton is elected, he will be the first tribal member to serve in the General Assembly.
Osten’s role is a source of some hard feelings.
Caron complained that Osten interfered, lining up delegate support for Pemberton at a time when he was not yet was a registered Democrat. 
“I’ve never seen a state senator get this deep in something like this,” Caron said. “At this point, it’s kind of crazy how it went about. The delegates, none of them knew he wasn’t a Democrat.”
Caron said he has heard from some voters who intend to write in his name as a protest. Caron has not filed as a write-in candidate, so those votes will not be counted.
Osten acknowledged encouraging Pemberton to run, but she said she was not responsible for delivering delegate support.
“I didn’t have to. He called all the delegates himself,” Osten said. “Some people like to give me credit for things I didn’t do. If If they want to give me credit for it, fine.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0107_SR_CapitolMugs_067-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-12 22:58:25.843263

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Maryland Public Defender Natasha Dartigue stressed that the launch Monday of a new partnership to change the state’s criminal justice system is not just another “task force.”
“This launch is a call to action,” Dartigue said at the public defender’s training center in Linthicum Heights. “The work will be difficult at times, and it will be long. We won’t solve the problems in weeks or even months, but as long as we stay committed and keep impacted communities at the center of every decision … we can make significant change in Maryland.”
The launch of the Maryland Justice Partnership, which will be led by the public defender’s office, comes two days before the General Assembly convenes Wednesday for the 90-day legislative session in Annapolis. The timing is intentional: Dartigue said the launch was scheduled now “because we need coordinated implementation as bills move through committee.”
The partnership aims to implement recommendations of the Maryland Equitable Justice Collaborative, a historic alliance between the public defender and the Maryland Attorney General’s Office that dissolved Nov. 26, after two years of work.
The group presented 18 recommendations to end mass incarceration that include decreasing use of excessive by police, increasing mental health services in jails and improving the parole process. About three dozen groups of state agencies, law enforcement personnel and nonprofit and community organizations, among others, were part of that collaborative.

Some of those same individuals, such as Gordon Pack, traveled to Linthicum Heights Monday to join the new partnership.
“The beautiful thing about collaboration and having the state involved in these things is that you can see things from every perspective,” said Pack, a formerly incarcerated individual who now does advocacy work focused on reforms to probation, parole and reduce recidivism in jails and prisons.
At least one state official who joined Pack and dozens of other criminal justice reform advocates was Betsy Fox Tolentino, acting secretary for the Department of Juvenile Services.
“We’re going to be able to hear from lots of different stakeholders, really listen closely [and] understand how everyone’s experiencing the system,” she said in a brief interview after the launch Monday.
“When we understand that, then we can come together and come up with real solutions that get the outcomes that we want to see for all our young people, all our communities,” Tolentino said.
Some work will focus on youth, according to a partnership summary, calling for the state to institute restorative practices, expand graduation pathways to complete GED programs without leaving school and strengthen judicial training for judges to understand adolescent brain development, implicit bias and trauma.
Another push is to for the state to stop automatically charging youth as adults, legislation that is scheduled to be reintroduced this year and sponsored by Sen. William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery) after failing in the 2025 session.
The bill last year would have raised the age at which a youth could be tried as an adult, from 14 to 16. It also would have made those 16 and younger eligible for juvenile court if charged with certain crimes, including first-degree assault, third-degree sex offense and certain offenses involving firearms.
Two other pieces of legislation the collaborative did support passed in the 2025 session: the Second Look Act, which gives those incarcerated for at least 20 years the ability to petition for a sentence reduction, if they met several other criteria; and medical and geriatric parole, whih requires parole hearings for those over age 60 who are incarcerated with severe medical conditions.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Similar to the collaborative, the new partnership will comprise six implementation hubs: community safety and crisis response; pretrial justice and diversion; behavioral health justice; fair sentencing and parole reform; community reintegration and stability; and youth justice and educational equity.
A main statistic the partnership likes to cite about the importance of its work: Blacks account for about 30% of the state’s population, but make up about 71% of the state’s prison population.
Terri Collins-Green, director of social work in the public defender’s office, said work to reduce mass incarceration must also include assessing mental health.
“When mental health services are inaccessible … [they] are too often met with law enforcement rather than care,” she said.

On the opening day of what promises to be a 10-day trial over which regulations should remain in place under Missouri’s voter-approved abortion rights amendment, lawyers for Planned Parenthood argued the restrictions were “petty, demanding and increasingly aggressive,” and became increasingly so as more anti-abortion lawmakers were elected to the statehouse.
“The most consistent thing about abortion provisions in Missouri is that it’s been inconsistent,” Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which operates clinics in Columbia and the Kansas City area, testified Monday. 
As the trial kicked off in a Jackson County courtroom, the Missouri Attorney General’s Office renewed its plea for access to abortion patient records, including patient complaints and ER transfers. So far, a judge has denied the state’s attempt to access these records.
“We’ve had to fight tooth and nail to find smoking gun evidence,” Peter Donohue, an assistant attorney general, said Monday after appealing the court’s decision to allow Planned Parenthood to submit a summary chart of patient complications rather than records.
Vanessa Pai-Thompson, an attorney with Planned Parenthood Federation of America, called the state’s continued efforts “a last-ditch attempt to find a there there.” 
Abortion rights returned to Missouri one year ago. Access never did

Assistant Solicitor General Alexandria Overcash painted for the judge a picture of a hypothetical woman faced with an unintended pregnancy. Maybe she’s young and lacks a strong safety net. Maybe she can’t afford a baby, or is unsure if she is ready to be a mother.
Then Overcash detailed a world where the woman goes to an abortion provider and is shown an ultrasound. A state-mandated informed consent booklet is handed to her with other options and she is required to wait 72-hours before she can get an abortion. 
This scenario, Overcash said, exists if the state’s current abortion regulations are upheld as part of a system designed to protect women in “emotionally fraught and medically-risky circumstances.” 
But the first two witnesses in the case, called by Planned Parenthood, said dozens of unnecessary restrictions ensure access to abortion remains limited, if not impossible. As a result, only a few dozen in-clinic abortions were performed in recent years, as restrictions continued to pile up, compared to more than 20,000 a few decades earlier. Medication abortion remains inaccessible.
These restrictions came to a head in 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion and Missouri’s trigger law banning nearly all abortions went into effect. 
Two years later, 52% of Missourians voted to add reproductive health care protections, including access to abortion up to the point of fetal viability, into the state constitution. The amendment prevents the state from denying, interfering with or otherwise restricting abortion. 
Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri sued the state a day after the vote, asking that a few dozen abortion regulations, commonly referred to as “targeted regulation of abortion providers” or TRAP laws, be struck down as unconstitutional under the new amendment.
The regulations, which will be dissected in court over the next two weeks, include: 

The state’s near-total abortion ban, as well as gestational limits on abortion.
The required distribution of Missouri’s informed consent booklet prior to an abortion.
A 72-hour waiting period between an initial appointment and an abortion.
A requirement that the same doctor who saw the patient at the initial appointment also provide the abortion.
A ban on prescribing medication abortion to patients via telemedicine.
A requirement that only doctors be able to provide abortions.
Abortion facility licensing requirements, including building specifications.
Mandatory pelvic exams prior to the administration of medication abortion.
Admitting privileges and a written transfer agreement at a nearby hospital.
Complication plan for medication abortion that must be approved by the state health department. 
Providers who prescribe medication abortion must carry tail insurance that is effective for 21 years after the abortion takes place. 
All pregnancy tissue removed during procedural abortions must be submitted to a pathologist for review.

If the courts decide to strike down these regulations, Missourians will be able to access abortion closer to home and earlier in pregnancy, Dr. Margaret Baum, chief medical officer with Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, based in eastern Missouri, Springfield and Illinois, testified Monday.
The regulations being challenged in the lawsuit caused frustration for patients and made it difficult to hire and retain staff, Wales testified, especially for providers under the threat of criminalization. 
“I felt under a microscope. I felt targeted. This is nothing like what I’ve experienced in a nursing home or hospital,” Wales recalls clinic staff saying.

(Courtesy of City of Omaha)OMAHA — The publicly funded Omaha Inland Port Authority has taken new strides — including hiring three more top managers and greenlighting the purchase of long-awaited business park property — to help attain its goal of creating jobs and economic prosperity in one of Nebraska’s poorest areas.
Authorized by a 2021 state law, the port authority essentially launched in mid-2024 when the Omaha City Council confirmed its nine-member governing board. The entity is empowered with economic development tools, including the ability to issue revenue bonds for construction in a district spanning roughly 3,000-acres of northeast Omaha near Eppley Airfield.
In recent weeks, the board and Garry Clark, who was installed last summer  as OIPA’s inaugural executive director, assembled the economic development team to guide an initial $120 million investment into the district by the state.

Public records show the three new hires, who bring a combined five decades of experience, earning salaries ranging from $135,000 to $165,000 a year. Clark’s salary is $210,000. 
Another person is likely to be hired to coordinate a planned “innovation district” within the boundaries, said Thomas Warren, an OIPA board member who is also Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr.’s chief of staff.
“We are at a critical juncture,” said Warren. “It’s important we establish the proper foundation … and we have leadership in place now to administer the funds and to carry out the goals and objectives defined in the legislation.”
Key tasks before the group include oversight of about $90 million the Legislature directed from pandemic recovery funding to create a shovel-ready industrial business park. The board is working with a private developer selected by the state to carry out that project, which is supposed to draw jobs and economic vitality. Another major undertaking is establishment of an “innovation district” for tech  jobs and housing, launched with another $30 million allocated by the Legislature.
 Pivotal step

At its monthly meeting last week, the OIPA board took a significant step in what has been a tumultuous and yearslong process toward producing the business park.

While Gov. Jim Pillen in January 2024 awarded the funds to a development team led by the Omaha Economic Development Corp., Burlington Capital and Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce, a tweak in state statute required the developers to get buy-in from OIPA. The board had withheld the release of all but about $7.4 million from the developer until certain assurances were met.
Board action last week released roughly $40 million more of the grant, allowing the development group to potentially acquire three sites on which to develop the business park. The remainder will be disbursed in monthly installments over the next year, Warren said. 
OIPA board members and the development team declined to disclose one of the three locations, saying it was premature and could jeopardize the transaction. The other sites are 5906 Abbott Drive, a 13-acre site with a new 150,000-square-foot warehouse and 148-stall surface parking area; and Enterprise Industrial Park, near 16th and Locust Streets, which has about 41 developable acres and environmental cleanup costs.
It is possible that not all three purchases become final. Developers say they’re still exploring other sites as well.
The development team has scheduled a public meeting for 6 p.m. Wednesday at the Venue at the Highlander in North Omaha to discuss progress, including “news about land acquisition.”

“We want to keep the community informed and involved every step of the way,” said Michael Maroney, CEO of the Omaha Economic Development nonprofit. A news release asks that community members come to share ideas and give input. 
George Achola, a Burlington spokesman, said splitting the business park project into multiple sites — rather than a single 160-acre tract earlier pursued as a priority — should not deter from the original mission. 
“I don’t think it changes the original objective,” he said. “The whole North and South Omaha recovery plan was about how to put into place activities that will generate jobs, be economic drivers for the community and improve the aesthetics. Those objectives are still there.”
Execution of the park grant has been delayed by factors including OIPA demands that the developer be clearer with financial details and more transparent with area residents. Early on, the proposal was mired in controversy over potential displacement of longtime homeowners to make way for the industrial-focused project at the sprawling tract west of the airport and north of Carter Lake, which  has since been eliminated from consideration. 
Current sites do not call for residential relocation, officials have said. Clark said one could become home to a hub where creative and cutting-edge forms of housing are built for distribution.  
 Innovation District update 

 

OIPA sends letter to state, demands balance of funds 
The Omaha Inland Port Authority has upped its demand for the remainder of $11.2  million it believes it is due from the state.
An attorney for the OIPA sent a Jan. 7 letter to State Treasurer Joey Spellerberg, asking that the $8.9 million balance be released by Wednesday.
Levy thanked Spellerberg for the $2.3 million released in December but said the port authority is due the remainder of state interest funds.
“This timeline should allow ample time to respond and avoid further delay and unnecessary action,” said the letter by David Levy of Baird Holm Law. 
State officials have denied transferring any more funding, saying that after the end of fiscal year 2025 budget reconciliation, the interest amounts in the applicable fund and available to the port authority was $2.3 million.
Reached Monday, a Treasurer’s Office spokesperson that it was preparing a formal response and had no other immediate comment.


Also new at the port authority is the completion of a roughly 100-page consultant’s report on the planned innovation district, in which the state has invested $30 million. Legislation approved in 2024 called also for at least 150 new apartments and 20 new houses in the district.
Led by HR&A Advisors, the consulting team including local partners Lamp Rynearson and Vireo, was paid $546,000 and worked several months, including holding community input meetings, on producing a “roadmap” to building wealth and opportunities. 
The report said the first phase of the district should deliver the mandated 170 residential units and a dedicated innovation building of about 100,000 square feet for retail, office and flexible space. 
Other sources — including discounted or free land, tax-increment funding and low-income housing tax credits — are likely to help subsidize the first phase, consultants said. Their report said other public funding options such as the Port Infrastructure Development Program and Omaha’s Capital improvement plan and philanthropy should be pursued.
Clark said the goal is for the port authority district to be self-sustaining in the future, with operational revenue envisioned from sources such as rents, events, corporate and philanthropy sponsorship and private investment. 
The board has yet to review the HR&A report and determine how to implement the consultant’s findings. 
Among report highlights:

Community workshops revealed a preference for the district to follow a “re-imagined urban area” model without homeowner displacement. That means a mix of uses that “embraces the reuse of existing buildings, preserving the neighborhood’s historic architecture while creating new investment opportunities.” 
Top programming areas sought by community members included an entrepreneur revolving loan fund, homeownership assistance programs and funding for owner-occupied home repairs.
Top industries to focus on included construction, agriculture, financial, bio-based manufacturing and media/entertainment technologies. Another idea was health innovations that could involve institutions like Nebraska Medicine and University of Nebraska Medical Center.




 Team expands at Omaha port authority 

The new year starts with three additional economic development experts hired to help build and operate Omaha’s Inland Port Authority district. The area is one of five such districts across the state designed to help increase jobs and economic development.

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)A divided Legislature approved a bill Monday that would limit restaurants’ ability to provide their customers with plastic utensils and condiment packets.
The bill, if signed into law by Gov. Phil Murphy, would require full-service restaurants to provide dine-in customers with only washable, reusable utensils, and it would bar them from giving takeout customers single-use cutlery unless the customer asks for it.
Casual dining restaurants, like fast food restaurants, would be able to provide disposable utensils or single-use condiment packets to all customers only upon request.
In all cases, restaurants would only be able to provide customers with single-use utensils and condiments in the amounts a customer requests.

“We have the single-use bags under control in New Jersey. Literally billions of bags are being taken out of the environment. I’m hoping with the utensil bill that we’ll greatly reduce the amount of plastics that are out in the environment,” said bill sponsor Sen. Bob Smith (D-Middlesex), who chairs the body’s environment committee.
The Senate approved the measure in a narrow 21-15 vote (21 votes are needed to pass). It passed the Assembly 43-24.
School cafeterias, health care facilities, and correctional facilities would not be subject to the bill’s restrictions, and it would not apply to food court restaurants until two years after it goes into effect.
Smith said he hopes changes in how the public views plastics would eventually end the need for those exemptions, which he said helped secure the bill’s passage.
“I’m hopeful that there’ll be an evolution. The truth of the matter is that the reasons for the requests for exemptions are pretty weak,” he said.
The bill would also permit casual dining restaurants to make single-use utensils available through self-serve dispensers, a provision key to winning support from some of the bill’s one-time opponents.
“We appreciate Senator Smith’s willingness to work with us and to incorporate several of our proposed amendments to improve the bill’s workability, including allowing utensils and condiments to be made available in open, self-service trays,” said Amanda Stone, vice president of public affairs for the New Jersey Restaurant and Hospitality Association. “We believe collaboration is essential to reducing waste without placing unnecessary burdens on small businesses or their customers.”
The measure won little support from Republican lawmakers.

Assemblyman John Azzariti (R-Bergen) said the ban would boost costs for New Jersey businesses and inconvenience consumers even before considering the fines that would enforce the prohibition.
“People by and large do not like the plastic bag ban, and they will not like the limitations on plastic utensils and micromanagement of condiments by this legislation,” he said on the Assembly floor.
All food service businesses would be barred from dispensing packets containing multiple disposable utensils or condiments 12 months after the bill goes into effect. The bill goes into effect at the start of the seventh month following its signing.
Prepackaged food items that come with a disposable utensil or single-use condiment would be exempt from the bill’s restrictions, and the bill would not bar restaurants from providing single-use cups for condiments.
Restaurants that violate the bill’s limits would first face a warning. On a second offense, they would face a $100 fine, which escalates to $250 for subsequent offenses. Money collected by those fines would flow into a state fund that pays for litter pickup, recycling grants, and graffiti removal.
The move to limit the use of disposable utensils is the latest in a series of moves to lessen the amount of plastic waste in New Jersey.
The state has barred grocery stores and food service businesses, among others, from dispensing single-use plastic bags and some polystyrene foam packaging since May 2022, and stores have been barred from providing plastic straws absent a customer request since late 2021.
Smith said he hopes to pass legislation requiring packaging producers to incrementally reduce their use of non-recyclable packaging and phase out certain hazardous packaging materials.
“Not that I’m happy with any plastics, but you shouldn’t be using plastics with toxins in them. That’s like a double or triple hit. That will be the next step, I hope, in the next term,” Smith said.

(Photo courtesy of Washington State Department of Transportation)Last month’s heavy flooding inflicted at least $40 million to $50 million of damage on Washington’s highways, state transportation officials estimated to lawmakers Monday. 
The state Department of Transportation has responded to dozens of locations due to flooding, officials told lawmakers. The state has signed 16 contracts for emergency repairs. A few more are still to come. 
The cost figures the agency provided are preliminary. 
“We’re still compiling costs, so it is a range at this point,” Steve Roark, the agency’s Olympic region administrator, told the House Transportation Committee.
It’s unclear how much federal funding will be available to cover those costs. Gov. Bob Ferguson will ask President Donald Trump for a major disaster declaration to open up funding. 
The most notable example of infrastructure damage from the December storms is U.S. Route 2. 
The highway, a major east-west crossing in Washington over the Cascades, was closed for over two weeks along a nearly 50-mile stretch between Skykomish and Leavenworth. Parts of the roadway collapsed entirely.
But the state has since reopened the highway on both sides of Stevens Pass for limited travel with temporary fixes. Permanent repairs will take months.
Specifically, work on the stretch of Highway 2 from milepost 58 to milepost 70 on the east slopes of the pass likely won’t be done until July. 
The still-closed segment through Tumwater Canyon near Leavenworth could reopen by March. That work includes rebuilding the roadway embankment. Further work will then be needed over the summer when the weather is warmer. Transportation Secretary Julie Meredith has said there are more than 16 washed-out or damaged areas in Tumwater Canyon.
There’s currently a detour around this area using the Chumstick Highway, but officials caution that this is a rural county road and not a recommended route for cross-state travel.

On the western end of Highway 2, near Skykomish, the state is developing plans to replace a culvert and make other permanent repairs.
Repairs on other highways will also take a while.
On U.S. 12 near Naches, the “roadway was gone,” Roark said. He hopes to have the highway repaired by the end of the month.
Repairs to U.S. 101 south of Forks on the Olympic Peninsula are anticipated for the summer, at earliest. It’s an area prone to landslides. About 20 years ago, the state built a retaining wall to support the highway embankment. 
“And we’re going to get to do it again,” Roark said, noting a “big section of roadway is moving into the Bogachiel River.”
U.S. 101 is open to alternating one-way traffic.
And similarly, on State Route 542, also known as the Mount Baker Highway, one-way traffic is getting drivers up to the ski area. 
“There’s quite a bit of work to do here to restore the drainage and repair the roadway,” Roark said. “We anticipate getting that contract underway soon. I don’t have an estimated date I can give you for repairing the roadway, but the work’s going to get underway fairly shortly.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/State-Route-542-damage-december-flooding-1024x771.jpg,,,2026-01-12 20:57:25.135347

Brown",,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2026/01/12/maryland-republicans-2026-session/,"For the second straight year, Maryland legislators arrive in Annapolis with a budget shortfall of more than $1 billion. But GOP lawmakers, the minority in both House and Senate, say the deficit is a new opportunity to hone their small-government message.","Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey, Jr. (R-Upper Shore) says lawmakers should restrain spending to address the state's $1.5 billion budget deficit in the 2026 legislative session. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)For the second straight year, Maryland legislators are arriving in Annapolis with a budget shortfall of more than $1 billion.
In the eyes of the GOP, the minority party in both House and Senate, the deficit presents a new opportunity to hone a small-government message.
“Government has out-sized itself,” said Senate Minority Leader Steve Hershey (R- Upper Shore). “We’ve gotten to the point where there’s more government than people need.”
Because Democrats hold commanding majorities in each chamber, and a Democrat sits in the governor’s mansion, Hershey acknowledges that his party’s role will be a “responsive” one.
“We are going to take a good look at the type of legislation that comes in from the majority party and see the issues that they think are important,” Hershey said. “Because we know what’s important to Marylanders, and that’s the affordability, energy and accountability of government.”
To resolve last year’s budget woes — to the tune of $3.3 billion — lawmakers enacted a combination of budget cuts and tax and fee increases. Then came Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) announcement of a buyout offer for state workers and government-wide hiring freeze.
But the arrangement didn’t provide a lasting fix. In November, state officials told lawmakers that they were projecting a roughly $1.5 billion deficit for the 2027 fiscal year — five times more than what was predicted at the end of the last legislative session.

And from there, matters may only get worse, said state officials, who noted that pressures such as inflation, Medicaid costs and the consequences of tariffs were all to blame for the worsening deficit picture.
“When we talk about the budget this year … It’s about the $3 billion deficit next year and a $3.5 [billion deficit] the following year,” Hershey said. “We want to address not just the structure, but the symptoms. Why are we getting to that point?”
Ask Republican leadership, and the medicine might be paring back state spending, including on the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, a costly “unfunded mandate” for the state’s education system, in Hershey’s words.
House Minority Leader Jason Buckel (R-Allegany) said that the Blueprint money is well-intentioned, and some elements are worth keeping, but “we just can’t afford it.”
“Spending money is not necessarily the immediate pathway towards success in education,” Buckel said. “You also have to be fiscally responsible to your taxpayers. You can’t just simply say the answer is always more.”
On Thursday, Moore announced a $10.2 billion allocation for education in his proposed budget, a $373.8 million increase over the previous fiscal year. His proposal includes $480.5 million for school construction.
“Maryland has the talent and the drive to have the best schools in the country, but that requires more than just high standards — it requires us to continue making historic investments,” Moore said in a statement.
Buckel said that the legislature should halt raises for some state employees, while ensuring that law enforcement and mental health services are properly staffed and funded.

“We have to hire more people in corrections, public safety and the sort of mental health professions, because if you let those things go, it has deleterious effect on all of your society,” he said. “We have to restrain the growth in state employment. We have tremendous state employees — I think they have been the recipient of quite a bit of raises over the last four or five years.”
During an election year, legislators on both sides of the aisle seem intent on avoiding tax increases, and focusing on pocketbook issues, though with vastly different approaches.
Energy bills, for instance, are once again likely to draw significant debate. And while many Maryland Democrats have put blame onto regional grid operator PJM — arguing that it failed to plan for massive surges in demands primarily caused by data centers — Republicans have argued that the state’s climate mandates have made matters worse.
By law, the state must reduce its carbon emissions 60% below 2006 levels by 2031. Moore has also previously touted his goal for the state to rely entirely on clean energy by 2035.
Hershey argues that observers need not look any further than the recent ballooning of the Strategic Energy Investment Fund. Fueled by utilities, that can make alternative compliance payments in lieu of purchasing renewable energy, the fund has grown exponentially in recent years. The General Assembly tapped into the fund, which pays for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, last year to provide ratepayers with an $80 refund on their utility bills, and to help balance the budget.
“Generators can’t get enough renewable energy. Our goals are too high,” Hershey said. “As soon as Gov. Moore takes overpayments from electric bills and puts it into the general fund, that’s a tax.”
This General Assembly session is also likely to feature sparring between Constellation — which already owns several power plants in the state and has proposed a new natural gas plant — and Exelon, its former parent company that by law can’t build and operate generation, but wants to.
Hershey, for one, is open to the idea of allowing Exelon to build generating plants, though with guardrails. Constellation is a private company, meaning its power plant would be funded by investors, whereas Exelon can use ratepayer funds.
“There’s a way to take a look at it,” Hershey said of Exelon’s proposal. “It’d be very specific on making sure that this is not rate-based, and at the same time making sure that customers aren’t paying for anything until electrons are being generated.”

Amid President Donald Trump’s (R) widespread immigration crackdown — which doubled the number of arrests by immigration enforcement in Maryland last year — the issue is also likely to feature prominently in this year’s legislative session.
In some Maryland counties, the sheriff’s departments enter into agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to let deputies take on certain immigration enforcement abilities. In Maryland, those partnerships, called 287(g) agreements, are largely restricted to the jail-based model of the agreement, where jails can execute administrative immigration warrants on people already in their custody.
Lawmakers are expected to take up legislation in the 2026 session that would ban such agreements, after Democrats’ unsuccessful attempt to do so last legislative session.
Buckel calls the effort is performative “virtue signaling.”
“If you’ve taken the right to be here unlawfully – and I understand that — I couldn’t imagine growing up in Ecuador and wanting a better life and you can’t get into the United States. I might take that chance too,” Buckel said during a December interview. “But if you came in illegally and did the best you can, and then it turns out you’re a member of MS-13 and you’re dealing drugs and you get thrown in the Montgomery County jail, I don’t understand why we wouldn’t allow the law enforcement officials for those individuals to work with the federal government.”
Hershey, who argued that Maryland should “let the feds continue to do their job,” with regard to immigration, said he believes that 80% of Marylanders wouldn’t list immigration issues as their biggest concern — even though Democrats will focus on it closely.
“This will be just used to take the focus off what the real important issues are — and that’s whether or not the Democrats are going to raise taxes this year,” Hershey said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026_jan12_hersh_sitdown6-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-12 20:57:25.135347

Republican legislative leaders in the House say the projected budget deficits faced by the state are a good opportunity to trim the fat on state budgets, while Democrats point to large income tax cuts approved over the last few years that have created a “self-inflicted budget crisis.” 
“This isn’t a big deal,” House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, said Monday at a press conference. “It’s going to be easy to get through.” 
Idaho Gov. Brad Little submits plan to balance state budget without repealing Medicaid expansion

The latest state reports show an estimated $40.3 million state budget deficit by the end of the current fiscal year, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. That deficit has been projected to grow to between $555.2 million and $1 billion for the next fiscal year. 
“The Idaho Legislature blew it,” Assistant Minority Leader Sen. James Ruchti, D-Pocatello, said Monday. “It voluntarily reduced revenue year after year for five years.”
The non-partisan, nonprofit the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy issued a report in November showing that the state Legislature’s income tax cuts over the last five years have reduced state revenue by a total of around $4 billion, the Sun reported. 
Idaho Gov. Brad Little in his annual State of the State address put forth his plan to balance the budget, and said Idaho was well-positioned to “weather the revenue challenges ahead.”
 Republicans eye tax relief, potential cuts of Medicaid 

Within the first few weeks of session, lawmakers must decide whether or how to conform to federal tax changes made under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed by Congress. Those changes will reduce state revenue by over $100 million — although estimates vary widely.
“The Big Beautiful Bill has 39 components that deal with taxes, and I firmly believe the Legislature is going to conform with most, if not all of them,” Moyle said. “And that’s good, because it’s tax relief for all Idaho citizens. So we’re in good shape that way, and we will do that one first, and then we might look at some other stuff, but make sure that we conform to as many of those 39 as we can.” 
Little on Monday proposed $45 million in Medicaid cuts, but not a full repeal of Medicaid expansion — the program approved in 2018 by voters through a ballot initiative to expand coverage to those who fell in the gap between traditional Medicaid coverage and those who qualified for subsidies to afford health care through the state health insurance marketplace. 
Moyle signaled support for a potential repeal, saying its costs have increased. 
“If we keep dumping all that money in the Medicaid hole, it’s going to have an effect on those other budgets,” he said. “So I hope we look at it, hope we discuss it, and maybe in those discussions we can come up with a path forward.” 
 Democrats call for repeal of school choice tax credit, use of rainy day funds, protecting expansion

The Idaho legislative Democratic leaders argued that the state’s budget concerns could be fixed by eliminating the $50 million school choice tax credit, a program approved last year that makes available $5,000 grants to be used for educational expenses such as private school tuition. 
House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, said the state should also consider using state reserves, known as the Rainy Day Fund, and postponing the $400 million total tax cuts approved last year until “we can afford it.” 
The Democrats opposed cuts to Medicaid expansion because it would remove health care coverage for around 90,000 people, and that it would negatively impact the economy by removing the federal funds that go to the program.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A state board governing charter schools has decided it’s seen enough from Proud To Partner Leadership Academy and voted Monday to “pull the plug” on the school.
The Statewide Charter School Board made the rare decision to issue a notice of termination to the charter high school in southwest Oklahoma City. Seven board members voted in favor and two abstained.
The decision sets in motion the process of closing the school once the current academic year ends and voiding its charter contract. The 100 students attending the school, known as PTPLA, then would have to return to their neighborhood school districts or find another educational option.
The board placed PTPLA on probation in November over financial, operational and academic quality concerns. Members of the state board grew frustrated with what they considered to be an uncooperative response from the school’s leadership. 
“That’s what we always ask for is a spirit of cooperation and desire to work together to improve the outcomes at the school,” board Chairperson Brian Shellem said after Monday’s meeting. “As it continued to progress, it seemed like it got harder and harder.”

State officials said they still had more questions than answers after three months of probation and multiple meetings with PTPLA.
The board’s staff made three visits to the school this fall and reported seeing only one teacher giving instruction. PTPLA leaders contend the report is inaccurate.
Rebecca Wilkinson, executive director of the state board, said she observed students with a computer open but not logged in, others not completing any work, seven who were sleeping or had their heads down, and some who were unable to say what course or topic they were studying, all of which raised concerns about the school’s educational quality.
PTPLA, which opened in 2024, faced scrutiny over weak finances, as well. It laid off four teachers in October and finished the previous school year in a budget deficit. 
State officials also complained of missed deadlines and other unfulfilled obligations by the school’s administration.
“My opinion is it’s time to pull the plug,” statewide board member William Pearson said before the vote. “It’s time to move to termination.”
Despite the school’s struggles, PTPLA leaders told the state they had “nothing to fix.”

School founder and Superintendent Dawn Bowles said her students now face the prospect of returning to “schools that were not serving them in the first place.”
“Our next feat will be, what is our next move to make sure that we don’t drop the ball on the ones that we’ve committed to serving,” Bowles said. “We will continue to serve them. We will continue to educate them. We will continue to provide opportunities outside of education, and we will continue to be their village as we move forward because this is what we consider to be the greater way.”

(Photo by Whitney Downard/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)With months to go before November’s gubernatorial election, state Treasurer and Republican frontrunner Stacy Garrity used her first candidate appearance of 2026 to repeatedly attack Gov. Josh Shapiro at a Pennsylvania Press Club event on Monday in downtown Harrisburg. 
Garrity took her first shot at Shapiro 15 seconds into her half hour speech, painting him as someone “who talks to the national press first” rather than state-level media. She mentioned the sitting governor by name at least 30 times. 
She earned the state GOP’s endorsement in September, but still must secure her spot in the general election by winning the May primary. She is currently running unopposed. Garrity first won her state row office position in 2020 and was reelected in 2024. 










We will utilize the God-given resources under our feet to fuel the technological revolution of the 21st century.


– Stacy Garrity, Republican candidate for governor


Reflecting on her three decades of service with the U.S. Army Reserve, where she rose to the rank of colonel, Garrity shared the story of an abused Iraqi woman and her children who she said she helped secure a divorce. 
“I’m pretty sure that I am the only American to get an Iraqi woman divorced,” she quipped. “(She) was one of the individual tragedies of war that’s too often lost in the shuffle … Today, all across Pennsylvania, there are individual crises that go unacknowledged and unknown every day.”
These crises included steep electricity bills, struggling to afford food and fatal drug overdoses — all issues Garrity pinned to Shapiro.
“The hard truth is that Josh Shapiro has failed all of them. Poverty, abuse, addiction — they’re not just an inner city issue. These are cancers plaguing every one of our communities,” Garrity said. “Those aren’t statistics; those are individual lives failed by Josh Shapiro.” 
Garrity campaign tries to walk back election denial

She accused Shapiro of blaming Trump for the state’s problems and not taking responsibility. Recognizing the pushback she received after calling Pennsylvania “mediocre” last month, Garrity said, “Pennsylvania is not reaching our potential, and the buck stops at Josh Shapiro’s desk.”
“Pennsylvania has, can and should lead, But Josh Shapiro’s failure has driven us into mediocrity,” said Garrity. “I don’t accept mediocrity and I don’t believe Pennsylvanians do either.”
Rather than suing the Trump administration — as Shapiro has repeatedly done — Garrity said she would “ work with President (Donald) Trump to make sure that Pennsylvania gets back on the right track.“ 
Several Democrat-led states have utilized the legal system to retain federal funds or defend state laws. For example, Pennsylvania joined a litany of states that sued over food assistance funding cut by the Trump administration during last year’s federal shutdown. 
When asked, Garrity declined to identify any areas where she disagreed with Trump. It’s something the state Democratic Party condemned in a statement alongside criticism of her views on abortion and prior statements questioning the results of the 2020 election. 
“Stacy Garrity’s flailing campaign was on full display as she doubled down on her extreme, toxic positions,” said a party statement. “Garrity made it clear Pennsylvanians cannot trust her to do what’s right for working families.” 
 A Garrity administration

Garrity briefly touched on her achievements in office, including investments in college savings plans and tripling assets under PA ABLE, a program that benefits Pennsylvanians with disabilities. Additionally, her office has prioritized returning millions of dollars to taxpayers and distributing state-held military decorations — including Purple Hearts, Bronze Stars and one Gold Star — to veterans.
“I guess you could say we’ve gotten stuff done,” panned Garrity, invoking Shapiro’s administrative catchphrase. “You see, getting stuff done is not a catchy political pathway. It’s something I’ve prided myself in accomplishing at every point in my life — because I believe actions speak louder than words.”
Shapiro’s version often includes the explicative, or “Get s*** done.” He has used that wording, for example, to describe the rapid rebuilding of a damaged bridge outside of Philadelphia. 
“My question for Josh Shapiro: What about 3,000 deficient bridges found in nearly every community across our commonwealth?” Garrity said. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
She pitched ending “wasteful” turnpike transfers, adding accountability for transit agencies — a reference, perhaps, to the evergreen debate about SEPTA funding in Harrisburg — and prioritizing freight. Additionally, she said artificial intelligence would be used to “predict maintenance needs, reduce congestion, prevent waste, and deliver projects faster and cheaper.”
Despite public skepticism over the deployment of AI and the resource-hungry data centers that power it, Garrity enthusiastically shared her vision for growing its development by tapping into the state’s natural gas stores.
“We will utilize the God-given resources under our feet to fuel the technological revolution of the 21st century. Pennsylvania can power the world, but only if the Shapiro administration stops its moratorium,” said Garrity. 
Former Gov. Tom Wolf signed a moratorium on new drilling leases for oil and gas in state parks in forests prior to Shapiro taking office. Natural gas prices are currently sinking to new lows and eating into profit margins. 
Noting that nearly two-thirds of the state’s 67 counties are rural, she said there were “a lot of areas where you can put data centers” in welcoming communities. Grassroots groups have popped up across the state opposing such efforts. 
Garrity also vowed to improve the state’s education rankings, specifically by addressing reading achievement in third grade and making sure students were proficient in math and reading before entering high school. 
 Garrity campaign positions

The gubernatorial candidate briefly touched on a bevy of issues, including the following:

Lieutenant Governor: Citing the recent news of state Sen. Doug Mastriano’s (R-Franklin) decision not to run against her, Garrity said there’s been “renewed interest” in the competition to be her running mate. “I know that we will have the absolute best partner as lieutenant governor when the time’s right,” she told reporters in a brief scrum following the luncheon. 


The 2020 election: When asked if Trump won the 2020 election, she said “absolutely not,” though in 2022 she said otherwise. “Just to be clear, that was at a Trump rally and … it’s easy to get caught up in a Trump rally. But I have to tell you that, after the 2020 election, I know Joe Biden was the president. I was painfully away of it.” At a separate 2021 rally, Garrity said the previous November’s election would be “tarnished forever.” She later told the Capital-Star her comment was about just one state Senate race, not the overall outcome. 


Property taxes: Garrity called the state’s property tax rate “one of the highest in the nation” and vowed to lower bills for seniors. The Tax Foundation ranks the Pennsylvania rate as the 13th highest in the country. 


Abortion: “My position on abortion has never changed: I am pro-life, but I am for exceptions.” She didn’t list those exceptions at Monday’s event.


Recreational marijuana legalization: Garrity said she didn’t believe there was “as much revenue in the legalization of marijuana as you would think,” instead advocating for natural gas drilling to bring more revenue to the state. She mentioned Ohio. In that state’s first full year of marijuana sales, it netted over $700 million in its first year, though Garrity said she thought it was “under $300 million a year.”


Voter rolls: Garrity said she would comply with the Trump administration’s request for the state’s voter rolls, which the commonwealth has resisted so far. Democratic critics and groups like the Committee of Seventy have criticized the push by the Department of Justice. 


On potential ICE enforcement: Garrity indicated she would be “cooperative” with a goal to have safe communities. “You can see how states that cooperate, the results are far different than states that have not been cooperative.” Last week, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis while federal agents shot two other people in Oregon. 

Taxpayer upgrades to Shapiro’s private home: “Everybody wants the governor and his family to be safe.” Rather than criticizing the security improvements made following the firebombing at the Governor’s Residence last year, she said she supported a legislative proposal to put a lien on the property to recoup taxpayer dollars if Shapiro ever sold the home.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_8232-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-12 19:58:11.083828

Wes Moore named three delegates to the House, bringing it to full force days before the start of the session, and shuffled Public Service Commission chairs, making Kumar Barve chair in place of the retiring Fred Hoover, in political notes.","Gov. Wes Moore named three new delegates to the House on Monday, and shuffled chairs on the Public Service Commission, making Kumar Barve chair to replace retiring Fred Hoover.Gov. Wes Moore (D) appointed three new delegates Monday to fill the last three vacancies in the House, just two days before the General Assembly convenes for 90-day legislative session for 2026.
Moore named Gabriel M. Moreno of Howard County to fill the District 13 seat vacated by Vanessa Atterbeary; Derrick Coley was tapped in District 24 seat in Prince George’s County that was held by Jazz Lewis; and Darrell Odom Sr. will replace Kevin Harris in District 27A, which straddles Prince George’s and Charles counties. All three are Democrats, nominated by their county Democratic Central Committees.
“Each of these leaders has a proven track record – from empowering vulnerable communities and serving in vital county government roles to protecting our state and nation,” Moore said in a statement. “These are dedicated public servants, and I am grateful that they each raised their hands to represent their districts in Annapolis.”
Odom and Coley served on the central committee in Prince George’s.
The Prince George’s committee overwhelmingly chose Odom on Dec. 31 to replace Harris, who held the seat until he was elevated to the District 27 Senate seat, which also includes a portion of Calvert County. But four days later, on Jan. 3, Charles County Democrats selected Yanelle Moore, who chairs the county’s school board.

	Moore eventually chose Odom, who served 31 years in the Army and Coast Guard. He also worked as an acting fire chief in Prince George’s.
The committee unanimously selected Coley to replace Lewis, who stepped down to accept a job as a lobbyist for his alma mater, the University of Maryland, College Park. Coley works as a deputy director in the county’s Department of the Environment.
On Wednesday, Howard County Democratic Central Committee selected Moreno to replace Atterbeary, who stepped down to focus on her race for Howard County executive. Moreno, who served as a member of the central committee, becomes the first Latino to represent the county in the General Assembly. Moreno is an attorney who works as the CEO of the Luminus Network Inc., a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of the immigrant community in Howard County and across the state.
The three appointments mean both the 141-member House and the 47-member Senate begin the 2026 session at full strength.
Musical chairs for the chair
Moore also announced Monday that Maryland Public Service Commission member Kumar Barve is swapping seats with PSC Chair Fred Hoover, who resigned as chair.
The switch means Barve’s term, which would have ended in 2029, will now end on June 30, 2028, and Hoover, whose term would have been up in 2028, is not extended through 2029, a PSC spokesperson said.
Both appointments still have to be approved by the Senate, but the governor’s office said the switch takes effect immediately.
No reason was given for Hoover’s resignation, but Moore said in a prepared statement that Hoover “exemplifies what it means to be a public servant and has been a tremendous partner in our efforts to build a cleaner, more reliable, more affordable energy system.”

“I’m grateful for the work Chair Hoover has done for our state, and I have full confidence in Commissioner Barve, who understands the importance of energy sustainability and grid reliability,” his statement said.
Hoover, in the same statement from the governor’s office, said it has been an honor to serve as PSC chair “during such a transformative time for Maryland’s energy sector. I am proud of what we have achieved over my past three years as chair of the commission to modernize our energy system and advance our State’s clean energy goals.”
Before being appointed to the PSC in 2023, Barved served 32 years representing Montgomery County in the House of Delegates, serving as the Democratic majority leader from 2003 to 2015, and as chair of the Environment and Transportation Committee from 2015 to 2023.
In a statement from the PSC, Barve thanked Moore for the opportunity to lead the commission “during this extraordinary period of energy transition in Maryland and in our nation.”
He said he, Moore and Hoover “agree that this moment in history requires an assortment of new policy and legislative approaches – to control energy bills and to build a more stable and sustainable energy grid. I will boldly collaborate with the Maryland Energy Administration, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Maryland General Assembly,” Barve’s statement said. “I look forward to continuing our advocacy on behalf of Maryland ratepayers before the regional grid operator, PJM, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota and the Twin Cities are suing the Trump administration to stop its latest immigration enforcement surge, alleging that the increased federal actions are unconstitutional and a violation of federal law.
Attorney General Keith Ellison at a Monday press conference called the immigration enforcement surge an “invasion.”
“The deployment of thousands of armed, masked (Department of Homeland Security) agents to Minnesota has done our state serious harm. This is, in essence, a federal invasion of the Twin Cities and Minnesota, and it must stop,” Ellison said.
Tensions between federal agents and protesters continue to escalate following the Wednesday killing of Renee Good by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross.
The suit alleges that the influx of federal agents under the Trump administration’s “Operation Metro Surge” harms Minnesota’s police powers and violates state sovereignty, according to the lawsuit. These rights are guaranteed under the 10th Amendment, the lawsuit states.
(The 10th Amendment argument was once used by Jim Crow states that resisted civil rights laws, but Ellison and the cities are seeking to use the oft-derided 10th as a tool to protect civil rights.)
Ellison and the cities are also alleging that the federal agents are using unreasonable force against Minnesotans and arresting people without warrants, regardless of their immigration status and based on their perceived race  — violations of the federal Administrative Procedure Act.
Illinois and the city of Chicago on Monday also filed a similar lawsuit against the Trump administration. Illinois is suing over allegedly unlawful tactics used by Customs and Border Protection and ICE agents in the state.
The Trump administration will likely fight the Minnesota and Illinois lawsuits.
Cities and states in the past have sued the Trump administration to stop the deployment of National Guard troops. Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court left in place a ruling by a federal judge in Chicago that bars the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops in Illinois.
But the high court has let immigration officials arrest people based on their appearance and what language they speak, with the court’s conservative super-majority consistently giving Trump wide latitude to exert executive power.
The Trump administration has said that fraud of public programs is a driving factor behind the immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota.
But Ellison said that stopping fraud is a pretext for the Trump administration to punish its political opponents.
“The real reason — it’s no secret. Donald Trump and his administration have been targeting people, cities and states that don’t agree with him politically,” Ellison said. “The Trump administration’s decision to target Minnesota and Twin Cities is motivated by a desire to retaliate against Trump’s perceived political opponents.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260107_637-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-12 19:58:11.083828

(File photo courtesy of Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority)New Mexico’s utility regulators have asked a San Juan County judge to order a third party takeover of private water utility Rosa Joint Ventures after allegations the utility did not turn over ownership under a prior agreement and failed to pay $275,000 in state fines.
Rosa Joint Ventures serves about 230 people near Aztec, according to the state’s drinking water database. Rosa Joint Ventures could not be reached for comment on the filing Monday, as calls to phone numbers listed for the utility played an automated message stating the number was disconnected. An emailed request for comment remained pending Monday afternoon.
The Jan. 8 legal filing said management of Rosa Joint Ventures failed to relinquish control of the utility and turn over water delivery to a new organization, the Sambrito Mutual Domestic Waters Consumer Association, which the commission ordered in 2021 after three years of hearings.
The New Mexico Public Regulation Commission regulates all privately-owned utilities in the state, including about 20 or so, mostly small, water utilities.
In a news release, Commissioner Patrick O’Connell said the PRC needs the court’s help to ensure the utility will deliver services in a “safe and reliable” manner.
“The Commission is committed to ensuring the health of our communities and the utilities that serve them,” O’Connell said. “Every order we issue is aimed at serving the public interest and Rosa Joint Ventures has shown no interest in complying with our orders.”
The PRC’s request for a receivership highlights the ongoing struggles of water safety and reliability in rural and small towns across the state and follows a similar request seeking state intervention in Timberon in September.
Along the same lines, the New Mexico Environment Department last May sued the Camino Real Regional Utility Authority in Sunland Park over longstanding problems with reliability and exceedingly high levels of arsenic.
In a December 18 PRC meeting, John Kreienkamp, a hearing examiner, told commissioners that the agency was convening a task force to “better serve the public and regulate these small water utilities.”
He said that would include determining the financial status of each utility, including the cash on hand and rates structure. It would also require information about water sources, and projected demand, and compliance with the environment department’s sanitary standards. As of December 18, they had contacted five of the 20 utilities, he told commissioners.
“We’re reviewing the responses that we’re getting from the small water utilities to figure out what our next steps are,” Kreienkamp said.
PRC Chair Gabriel Aguilera praised the effort.
“It will help us make sure that utilities are compliant with our annual reporting, and we understand their financial health, but more importantly than that is the potential to avoid these situations that leave people without water,” Aguilera said.
Concerns over the state’s water systems have also reached state lawmakers. During a Legislative Finance Committee hearing in November, a coalition of New Mexico municipalities and rural water systems said they would need an extra $200 million to fully fund water infrastructure projects across the state.

(Photo by Katheryn Houghton for KFF Health News)LODGE GRASS — Brothers Lonny and Teyon Fritzler walked amid the tall grass and cottonwood trees surrounding their boarded-up childhood home near the Little Bighorn River and daydreamed about ways to rebuild.
The rolling prairie outside the single-story clapboard home is where Lonny learned from their grandfather how to break horses. It’s where Teyon learned from their grandmother how to harvest buffalo berries. It’s also where they watched their father get addicted to meth.
Teyon, now 34, began using the drug at 15 with their dad. Lonny, 41, started after college, which he said was partly due to the stress of caring for their grandfather with dementia. Their own addictions to meth persisted for years, outlasting the lives of both their father and grandfather.
It took leaving their home in Lodge Grass, a town of about 500 people on the Crow Indian Reservation, to recover. Here, methamphetamine use is widespread.

The brothers stayed with an aunt in Oklahoma as they learned to live without meth. Their family property has sat empty for years — the horse corral’s beams are broken and its roof caved in, the garage tilts, and the house needs extensive repairs. Such crumbling structures are common in this Native American community, hammered by the effects of meth addiction. Lonny said some homes in disrepair would cost too much to fix. It’s typical for multiple generations to crowd under one roof, sometimes for cultural reasons but also due to the area’s housing shortage.
“We have broken-down houses, a burnt one over here, a lot of houses that are not livable,” Lonny said as he described the few neighboring homes.
In Lodge Grass, an estimated 60% of the residents age 14 and older struggle with drug or alcohol addictions, according to a local survey contracted by the Mountain Shadow Association, a local, Native-led nonprofit. For many in the community, the buildings in disrepair are symbols of that struggle. But signs of renewal are emerging. In recent years, the town has torn down more than two dozen abandoned buildings. Now, for the first time in decades, new businesses are going up and have become new symbols — those of the town’s effort to recover from the effects of meth.
One of those new buildings, a day care center, arrived in October 2024. A parade of people followed the small, wooden building through town as it was delivered on the back of a truck. It replaced a formerly abandoned home that had tested positive for traces of meth.
“People were crying,” said Megkian Doyle, who heads the Mountain Shadow Association, which opened the center. “It was the first time that you could see new and tangible things that pulled into town.”
 
The nonprofit is also behind the town’s latest construction project: a place where families together can heal from addiction. The plan is to build an entire campus in town that provides mental health resources, housing for kids whose parents need treatment elsewhere, and housing for families working to live without drugs and alcohol.
Though the project is years away from completion, locals often stop by to watch the progress.
“There is a ground-level swell of hope that’s starting to come up around your ankles,” Doyle said.
Two of the builders on that project are Lonny and Teyon Fritzler. They see the work as a chance to help rebuild their community within the Apsáalooke Nation, also known as the Crow Tribe.
“When I got into construction work, I actually thought God was punishing me,” Lonny said. “But now, coming back, building these walls, I’m like, ‘Wow. This is ours now.’”
  Meth ‘Never Left’ 

Meth use is a long-standing public health epidemic throughout the U.S. and a growing contributor to the nation’s overdose crisis. The drug had been devastating in Indian Country, a term that encompasses tribal jurisdictions and certain areas with Native American populations.
Native Americans face the highest rates of meth addiction in the U.S. compared with any other demographic group.

“Meth has never left our communities,” said A.C. Locklear, CEO of the National Indian Health Board, a nonprofit that works to improve health in Indian Country.
Many reservations are in rural areas, which have higher rates of meth use compared with cities. As a group, Native Americans face high rates of poverty, chronic disease, and mental illness — all are risk factors for addiction. These conditions are rooted in more than a century of systemic discrimination, a byproduct of colonization. Meanwhile, the Indian Health Service, which provides health care to Native Americans, has been chronically underfunded. Cutbacks under the Trump administration have shrunk health programs nationwide.
LeeAnn Bruised Head, a recently retired public health adviser with the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, said that despite the challenges, tribal nations have developed strong survival skills drawing from their traditions. For example, Crow people have held onto their nation’s language; neighbors are often family, or considered such; and many tribal members rely on their clans to mentor children, who eventually become mentors themselves for the next generation.
“The strength here, the support here,” said Bruised Head, who is part of the Crow Tribe. “You can’t get that anywhere else.”
  Signs of Rebuilding 

On a fall day, Quincy Dabney greeted people arriving for lunch at the Lodge Grass drop-in center. The center recently opened in a former church as a place where people can come for help to stay sober or for a free meal. Dabney volunteers at the center. He’s also the town’s mayor.
Dabney helped organize community cleanup days starting in 2017, during which people picked up trash in yards and alongside roads. The focus eventually shifted to tearing down empty, condemned houses, which Dabney said had become spots to sell, distribute, and use meth, often during the day as children played nearby.
“There was nothing stopping it here,” Dabney said.
The problem hasn’t disappeared, though. In 2024, officials broke up a multistate trafficking operation based on the Crow reservation that distributed drugs to other Montana reservations. It was one example of how drug traffickers have targeted tribal nations as sales and distribution hubs.

A few blocks from where Dabney spoke stood the remains of a stone building where someone had spray-painted “Stop Meth” on its roofless walls. Still, there are signs of change, he said.
Dabney pointed across the street to a field where a trailer had sat empty for years before the town removed it. The town was halfway through tearing down another home in disrepair on the next block. Another house on the same street was being cleaned up for an incoming renter: a new mental health worker at the drop-in center.
Just down the road, work was underway on the new campus for addiction recovery, called Kaala’s Village. Kaala means “grandmother” in Crow.
The site’s first building going up is a therapeutic foster home. Plans include housing to gradually reunite families, a community garden, and a place to hold ceremonies. Doyle said the goal is that, eventually, residents can help build their own small homes, working with experienced builders trained to provide mental health support.
She said one of the most important aspects of this work “is that we finish it.”
 
Tribal citizens and organizations have said the political chaos of Trump’s first year back in office shows the problem with relying on federal programs. It underscores the need for more grassroots efforts, like what’s unfolding in Lodge Grass. But a reliable system to fund those efforts still doesn’t exist. Last year’s federal grant and program cuts also fueled competition for philanthropic dollars.
Kaala’s Village is expected to cost $5 million. The association is building in phases as money comes in. Doyle said the group hopes to open the foster home by spring, and family housing the following year.
The site is a few minutes’ drive from Lonny and Teyon’s childhood home. In addition to building the new facility’s walls, they’re getting training to offer mental health support. Eventually, they hope to work alongside people who come home to Kaala’s Village.
As for their own home, they hope to restore it — one room at a time.

“Just piece by piece,” Lonny said. “We’ve got to do something. We’ve got these young ones watching.”

Alander Rocha/Georgia RecorderThe hallowed halls of Georgia’s state Capitol were abuzz Monday as lawmakers, lobbyists and everyday citizens flocked to the Gold Dome for the start of the 2026 legislative session.
For lawmakers in the state House and Senate, that means a 40-day countdown to introduce, deliberate and finalize laws for the upcoming year has officially begun. The calendar for this upcoming session, which also includes days off for holidays and committee meetings, will run from mid-January until early April. The 2026 session is also the second in a two-year cycle, meaning bills that didn’t make it across the finish line in 2025 could get a second chance this time around.
On the first day of the session, both chambers signed off on this year’s legislative schedule but not without some debate. The House passed the schedule with a 150-to-27 vote after some lawmakers objected to the Legislature being in session on Eid al-Fitr, a major religious holiday in the Islamic faith that marks the end of Ramadan. There are at least four Muslim lawmakers currently serving in Georgia. 
In the Senate, the resolution passed unanimously, but not without criticism from Sen. Nabilah Parkes, a Duluth Democrat who is Muslim.
“I am voting yes today for the good of the order, but moving forward, we should have an inclusive calendar,” she told the chamber. 
Under the calendar adopted Monday, a key deadline for bills to clear at least one chamber is set for Friday, March 6, and the last day of the session will be Thursday, April 2. 
New leadership in the Senate
The Senate kicked off the start of the 2026 legislative session by electing Sen. Larry Walker III, a Perry Republican to be the new president pro tem. Walker, who has served in the Legislature since 2015, is the son of former House majority leader Larry Walker Jr., who retired from the Legislature in 2005. 
“My father taught me that while we sit on different sides of the aisle, or come from different areas of the state, or different perspectives, we are all bound by a common duty to leave Georgia better than we found it,” Walker said in a speech following his election.
The position of president pro tem, which is the second-highest in the chamber, was previously held by state Sen. John Kennedy, a Macon Republican who resigned from his seat in December to focus on his bid for lieutenant governor. A special election to fill Kennedy’s seat will be held on Jan. 20.

In the House, three new lawmakers made their debut: Two Democrats, Rep. Akbar Ali of Gwinnett County and Rep. Eric Gisler of Watkinsville, and one Republican, Rep. Bill Fincher of Canton. All three were elected through recent special elections. 
The chamber also held a moment of silence for Fincher’s predecessor, Mandi Ballinger, who died last year after a long battle with cancer.
Two House seats are currently left vacant after Reps. Karen Bennett and Lynn Heffner announced their resignations last week. Bennett, a Stone Mountain Democrat, was indicted for unemployment fraud shortly after she stepped down, while Heffner, an Augusta Democrat cited damage to her home from Hurricane Helene as the reason she could no longer fulfill a state law requiring representatives to live in the districts they represent. Another House Democrat who was charged with unemployment fraud, Rep. Sharon Henderson of Covington, was present for the first day of the session Monday.
On the Senate side, two lawmakers — Democrat Jaha Howard of Smyrna and Republican Jason Dickerson of Canton — also made their first appearance as state senators.

In an interview with the Georgia Recorder, Dickerson described the experience of being a newly elected lawmaker as “surreal.”
“When you see your name up on the board for the first time, that’s when it really hits home,” he said.
But the new elected officials are not the only big change under the Gold Dome: Lawmakers returned Monday to a newly renovated state Capitol that has been restored to its original 19th century appearance, with some 21st century amenities – like a USB-C port – added to the desks. 
“You probably noticed, this people’s house is looking a little bit brighter today in every essence of that word,” House Speaker Jon Burns said. 
Advocates raise their voices
Lawmakers weren’t the only ones gearing up for the beginning of the session. Several advocacy groups held press conferences to encourage civic engagement and draw lawmakers’ attention to policy issues.
The ACLU of Georgia held a “Pack the Capitol” event alongside organizations like Indivisible Georgia Coalition and ProGeorgia to kick off the beginning of the 2026 session.
“Every law passed under this gold dome impacts 11.2 million Georgians,” said ACLU of Georgia policy and advocacy director Christopher Bruce. “That’s why the legislators need to listen more to the people than the politics. They need to listen more to the Georgians than the lobbyists.”
Georgia SNAP seeks at least $60 million after federal budget cuts

The Poor People’s Campaign and Georgia Interfaith Public Policy Center also held a press conference to advocate for the state’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to be fully funded. In the fall, Georgia’s SNAP administrators signaled they would need more than $60 million in additional state dollars to maintain their staffing levels amid federal cuts to the program. More than one in 10 Georgians use SNAP to buy groceries.
Wesley E. Myrick, executive director of the Georgia Interfaith Public Policy Center, said that fully funding SNAP not only helps ensure that every Georgian has access to food, but also sustains the businesses in local communities.
“Making sure that seniors, disabled persons, students and families with children have access to fresh fruits, vegetables and proteins is a critical issue for our state,” Myrick said in an interview.
Republican lawmakers in both chambers are floating additional tax cuts this session amid growing concerns about affordability, with the House proposing cutting property taxes and the Senate vying to eliminate Georgia’s state income tax by 2032. Myrick argued that those tax cuts would only benefit a segment of the population, while fully funding SNAP would help the state overall.
“Not every Georgian is a homeowner, so they’re not going to benefit from tax credits,” he said. “But every single Georgian can benefit from the economic impact of SNAP on local businesses that employ people in every corner of our state.”

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Reports from oversight visits conducted by U.S. Rep. Jason Crow’s staff show the immigration detention center in Aurora is close to hitting its newly increased population capacity. 
About 1,200 people were in custody at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility at the end of September. The facility recently increased its capacity from 1,360 to 1,530 detainees, and while Crow’s office did not get an exact number, ICE staff on Jan. 5 told Crow staff the facility was “slightly below capacity.”

Federal law gives members of Congress the authority to conduct unannounced oversight visits of immigration detention facilities. Crow, an Aurora Democrat, attempted to visit the facility in July but was denied entry, prompting a lawsuit brought by Crow, Rep. Joe Neguse of Lafayette and other members of Congress. 
A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s policy that requires at least a week’s notice for members of Congress to conduct an oversight visit to Department of Homeland Security facilities. But after Minnesota lawmakers were denied access to an ICE facility in Minneapolis Saturday, Democrats asked the judge for an emergency hearing. 
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem implemented a new policy that requires seven days notice for lawmakers to conduct oversight visits, saying facilities funded through last year’s One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act do not need to comply with a 2019 appropriations law that allows for unannounced visits at facilities that hold immigrants. 
The Jan. 5 report from Crow’s office says the Aurora facility’s segregated transgender pods were consolidated into one pod, which holds “a few transgender detainees.” Other transgender individuals were moved to the general population, the report says. It also says “grandfathered” transgender detainees continue to receive gender-affirming medical care at the facility. 
Much of the information Crow’s office asked of ICE was not made available, and facility staff redirected his team to the ICE Office of Congressional Relations.
ICE did not respond to a request for information on the Aurora facility’s population, including the care available for transgender individuals.  
The Aurora facility, privately run by The GEO Group for ICE, is the only ICE detention center in Colorado. Documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado show that the Trump administration contracted with The GEO Group in December to run another ICE detention center out of a dormant prison in Hudson. 
Crow’s staff and Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper’s staff conducted a seperate visit to the Aurora facility in December.

Here's where they don't.,"While New Mexico legislators and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham largely agree on how to spend state money in the upcoming fiscal year, some key differences have emerged through a review of budget docs. (Anna Padilla for Source NM)While New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and state legislators mostly agree on how to spend more than $11 billion in state funds during the next fiscal year, some key differences have emerged in budget proposals unveiled ahead of the legislative session starting Jan. 20.
Budget experts from both branches presented Monday to the state House Appropriations and Finance Committee, which is tasked with introducing the budget bill for lawmakers to consider when the Legislature meets for its finance-focused 30-day session. 
Wayne Propst, secretary of the New Mexico Department of Finance and Administration, and Charles Sallee, director of the Legislative Finance Committee, both told the committee that their budget proposals reflect the tough economic conditions impacting the state and the rest of the country. 
“We are in a period of declining or moderating revenue growth. The executive budget is an attempt to recognize that,” Propst said at the beginning of his remarks. 
Despite the economic forces that are prompting fiscal architects to craft smaller budgets, Propst began his presentation with what he said was good news: Moody’s, the global credit rating agency, on Friday upgraded the state’s bond issuance rating. Propst said the upgrade reflects the state’s years-long strategy to invest record oil and gas revenue into revenue-generating trust funds. 
State legislators’ proposed $11.1B budget doesn’t fully fund universal child care plan for NM

As for the budget, the governor seeks just over $11.3 billion for state operations in FY27, which represents a roughly 4.7% increase over the current fiscal year ending July 1. The Legislative Finance Committee is pushing an $11.1 billion budget, representing a 2.5% increase over last fiscal year. 
The roughly $230 million difference can be accounted for, according to Source New Mexico’s review of the two budget proposals, in just a few of more than 125 line items detailed in budget documents.
The biggest difference relates to funding for the Early Childhood Education and Care Department, the agency the governor has tasked with implementing her universal childcare proposal. The governor’s budget seeks a little over $465 million for the agency, which is $163 million more than the LFC has called for in its budget. 
The extent to which the Legislature will fund the governor’s proposal during her last year in office is shaping up as a key battle during the session. State Rep. Nathan Small (D-Las Cruces), told Source last week that the LFC budget is a starting point for negotiations. 
Another major difference between the two budgets centers on the state Health Care Authority, which administers major federal health and nutrition programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The governor seeks $80 million more than the LFC for the HCA, which currently has an operating budget of slightly more than $2 billion. 
Sallee said Monday that he believes Medicaid, and therefore the HCA, is overfunded by roughly $150 million, especially ahead of cuts to statewide enrollment expected due to the federal “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” 
The budget proposals also reveal a potential fight over the fate of the embattled McKinley County District Attorney’s office. Lawmakers in last year’s session slashed District Attorney Bernadine Martin’s funding due to concerns about her performance; they then provided additional funding to the DA next door and asked him to take over Martin’s cases. 
Since then, New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez has taken action to remove Martin from office. She is facing a trial before the Supreme Court in March that will determine whether she will be removed from office.

According to the budget records, the Legislature seeks to continue funding to the judicial district Martin now runs at the same level as last year, roughly $283,000, but Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s budget seeks to restore funding to roughly $3.8 million, on par with other district attorneys across the state. 
Apart from those key differences, the two budget proposals largely agree. The median difference on more than 130 programs is 1.2%, according to a Source review, and the governor and the Legislature have identical spending proposals on eight line items, including the New Mexico Compilation Commission, the Public Employee Labor Relations Board and the Economic Development Department.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The U.S. Supreme Court denied a request Monday from Story and Shelby counties requesting a review of a lower court’s ruling that county ordinances pertaining to a carbon sequestration pipeline were preempted by federal pipeline regulations. 
The lawsuit was between the counties and Summit Carbon Solutions, an Iowa-based company seeking to build a carbon sequestration pipeline across the state. 
In October 2022, county supervisors from Story and Shelby counties enacted local ordinances that established setback, permitting, emergency management and abandonment standards for hazardous materials pipelines within the counties.

Summit sued the counties later that year, arguing the ordinances were preempted by federal pipeline safety standards. The courts ruled in favor of Summit in the lawsuit, which has also paused similar lawsuits with other counties from progressing. 
Shelby and Story county supervisors voted in August to take the issue to the U.S. Supreme Court after their requests for a rehearing at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in Omaha was denied.
Property rights coalition proposes more limits on eminent domain in South Dakota

The appeals court upheld a December 2023 decision from the federal court in the Southern District of Iowa that said county ordinances cannot interfere with federal safety standards and pipeline routing decisions made at the state level. 
In a statement, the Shelby County Board of Supervisors said it would be consulting with its legal counsel and weighing its options “moving forward.” 
“Shelby County was surprised and disappointed by the denial by the U.S. Supreme Court to hear such an important case addressing local control authority and protections,” the statement said. 
The denial was listed in the high court’s orders on Monday along with a number of other denials. The court did not offer an explanation for the denial. 
Summit Carbon Solutions declined to comment on the decision. 
Tom Buis, CEO of American Carbon Alliance, said in a statement that the decision allows “important progress to continue.” Buis said carbon capture projects create new markets for farmers, boost ethanol production and “keep Iowa competitive.” 
“We remain confident this technology is good for Iowa and good for American agriculture,” Buis said in a statement. 
The Iowa Legislature is again expected to take up the issue of eminent domain and regulation around carbon sequestration pipelines during the current session. An Iowa House Judiciary subcommittee is scheduled to take up House Study Bill 507, which bans the use of eminent domain for carbon pipelines, at 4 p.m. Tuesday.
Landowners in opposition of the project, many of them from Shelby County, plan to lobby Tuesday against the sequestration pipeline at the Iowa State Capitol.

The group of conservative Republicans has promised cuts since last spring, but won’t say where and how deep. 
The post Wyoming Freedom Caucus aims at state spending, voting machines and the judicial branch in 2026 priorities appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming Freedom Caucus revealed Monday its top five legislative priorities for the 2026 budget session, including a plan to “return to pre-pandemic spending levels and curb growth of government,” according to an announcement from the group. 
“Each of these priorities was driven by the people of Wyoming,” the caucus, a group of conservative Republicans who control the House, wrote. “Every bill is well-vetted. We’re ready to return to the Capitol to deliver real wins for the people of Wyoming.”
The four other priorities include: making pen and paper ballots “the default voting method,” making it easier for parents to sue “when their rights are violated,” removing “obscene pornographic materials” from the children’s section of all public libraries and codifying “public access to judicial opinions, orders, and oral arguments.”
The Freedom Caucus also outlined priorities ahead of last year’s session, but that plan focused instead on immigration, property taxes and certain investment practices. The group gave itself a deadline to pass those five priority bills in the first 10 days of session — dubbing it “The Five and Dime Plan.” 
At the onset of the legislative off-season in April, the Freedom Caucus told voters it would take inspiration from the Trump administration’s efforts to cut federal jobs and spending by “DOGE-ing Wyoming’s budget.” 
Those efforts included forming a subcommittee to scrutinize the Wyoming Department of Health’s budget, the largest of any state agency. 
In November, the group held a press conference in Cheyenne to reiterate its determination to shrink the state’s budget but did not provide specifics as to where or how deep cuts would go. Instead, Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, said the group was “setting some targets” and had its eye on pre-pandemic spending levels.
Budget specifics were still lacking Monday in the group’s press release, which again described an intention to “return to pre-pandemic spending levels.”
Budget
“It’s 2026, which means this legislative session is a budget session. It’s past time to get unchecked spending growth under control in Cheyenne,” the Monday press release states. 
This week, the Joint Appropriations Committee, which is largely comprised of Freedom Caucus members, is “marking up” the budget following three weeks’ worth of budget hearings. The committee is slated to have a budget bill by the end of the week.
Bear, who chairs the House side of the committee, opened Monday’s meeting with some remarks. 
“There’s been a lot of rumors out there that this more conservative Legislature is going to cut the budget 30%. I have spoken to many people and calmed their nerves that that is not the case,” Bear said. 
On Friday, during the committee’s one public comment period, several faith leaders from across the state testified in support of lawmakers fully funding mental health services. More specifically, they pushed back on the suggestion that churches or religious groups take on professional mental health services.

In November, Wyoming Public Radio published a story about Bear and his reported desire to see churches become more involved with addressing the state’s mental health needs. Bear pointed to the story Friday. 
“I think a lot of this has come about because of comments that I made in an article, which, if everybody reads those comments in context, they’ll understand that we don’t legislate on theory or ideals,” he said. “We legislate in the real world.”
Bear again addressed Friday’s public comment on Monday. 
“We heard last Friday that many in the public who came to comment expected a 15% cut to the Department of Health,” Bear said. “My vice chair and I were very clear that that was not the case. No such cuts were proposed, and that’s where we sit today.”
The Freedom Caucus has yet to unveil a precise target for cuts. Cody Republican Rep. Rachel Roriguez-Williams, the group’s chairwoman, did not respond to WyoFile’s request for comment, which included an inquiry for specific numbers and when the caucus planned to share that information with the public. 
Ballots, parental rights and libraries
Laramie County, the state’s most populous, relies on “express voting,” a voting machine that has voters use a touchscreen to select their candidates. The machine then prints a ballot of their selections to be tabulated. Voters can also request a pen-and-paper ballot if they desire one. 
Wyoming’s other 22 counties use pen-and-paper ballots as their default, which is what the Freedom Caucus would like to see happen in Laramie County. 
“We believe in paper ballots, wet ink, and real votes,” the press release states. 
The Joint Corporations Committee voted to sponsor such a bill in the legislative off-season. 
For its third priority, the Freedom Caucus wrote that it will seek to “give parents the power to enforce their rights in court” by creating a private right to action. 
“Parental rights mean nothing if you can’t enforce them,” the press release states. “Allowing parents to recover the damages caused by a violation of their rights is common sense and long overdue.”
The fourth priority targets public libraries across the state and seeks to “remove obscene pornographic materials from the children’s sections of all public libraries in Wyoming.”
“Children should never be exposed to sexually explicit materials, period — especially at the taxpayer’s expense.” 
In October, the Joint Judiciary Committee voted to sponsor a bill dictating where libraries shelve certain books. Opponents told lawmakers at the time that the legislation would make an unprecedented intrusion into public libraries in an attempt to silence LGBTQ authors who write for young people.
‘Judicial transparency’ 
Hours after the Wyoming Supreme Court published its long-awaited ruling last week on two abortion bans, lawmakers held a closed-door meeting and discussed shrinking the court’s bench from five to three. 
The Freedom Caucus is now seeking “judicial transparency” as its fifth priority. More specifically, the group says it intends to “codify public access to judicial opinions, orders, and oral arguments so that the people know what our judges are up to.”
In its press release, the caucus pointed to its website, where “additional priorities” are listed, including “protecting pregnancy resource centers.” 
Notably, the priorities do not include a resolution to amend the Wyoming Constitution to prohibit abortion. 
The state’s high court struck down the abortion bans on account of Article 1, Section 38 of the state’s constitution, which enshrines the right of “each competent adult … to make his or her own health care decisions.” 
Upon the ruling, Gov. Mark Gordon called on lawmakers to put the issue “before the people for a vote.”
“A constitutional amendment taken to the people of Wyoming would trump any and all judicial decisions,” Gordon wrote. 
Speaker of the House Chip Neiman, R-Hulett, told WyoFile last week he and Sen. Cheri Steinmetz, R-Torrington, were working out the language of such a resolution. 
The 2026 session begins Feb. 9.

Most committee hearings and all voting on bills occurs on one of the 45 “Legislative Days” on the General Assembly calendar (shown here).
Delaware Legislative Calendar for 2026
The past year was a bit unusual, as the legislature held two “Special Sessions” (called by the General Assembly leadership) to address issues related to the property tax reassessment process in New Castle County.  They also held an “Extraordinary Session” (called by Governor Matt Meyer) to address concerns about the impact of federal legislation on the 2027 Fiscal Year Budget.  Notably, the Federal Government re-established a process for accelerated/immediate deduction for corporate R&D expenditures and certain capital purchases.  The Delaware tax laws were previously “coupled” to federal law, but the legislature chose to “de-couple” Delaware taxes in this case, protecting an estimated $400 Million in tax revenue (added cost for businesses operating in Delaware).
In the upcoming session, there are several outstanding bills from the 2025 session that will be important to many residents of Delaware.  Among the most impactful bills will be those that seek to make changes to the Delaware State Constitution.  These have a special and grueling process to be enacted.  Each proposed constitutional amendment must receive a greater than 2/3’s vote in each chamber (House & Senate) during two consecutive General Assembly sessions.  That means that constitutional amendments proposed and voted on in this 153rd General Assembly, must also be passed again in the 154th General Assembly (either 2027 or 2028), also by a 2/3’s or greater vote.  Currently, the Democrat Party has a super-majority in the Senate (15-6), but is one vote shy of a super-majority in the House (27-14).  As such, the majority party is only 1 vote away from being able to pass a proposed constitutional amendment without a single vote from the minority party.  This is a very significant situation, as we approach the General Election in November of 2026.

Monday’s filing stems from NetChoice’s lawsuit challenging Act 900 of 2025, which sought to amend a 2023 law found to be unconstitutional. 
The earlier law and the reworked version would have required age verification to create new social media accounts. A federal judge declared the 2023 law unconstitutional and permanently blocked it in April. 
“Arkansas’ ‘cosmetic’ update does not remedy the law’s continued constitutional defects,” NetChoice Litigation Co-Director Paul Taske said in a press release. “The new law, like its predecessor, ignores the First Amendment and will meet the same fate.”
In a statement, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said he would “vigorously defend Act 900.”
Monday’s motion for a preliminary injunction, which NetChoice filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas, builds on a lawsuit the tech group filed in June challenging two 2025 laws, Acts 900 and Act 901. 
A federal judge in December granted the group’s request to temporarily block one of the laws, Act 901. That law would have allowed parent parents to sue social media platforms if exposure to content on their sites results in their child developing eating disorders, committing or attempting suicide, or becoming addicted to the platform’s feeds. The December ruling did not address Act 900.
Other states have also faced legal challenges for their social media laws, including Florida, Georgia and Ohio.

Photo by USDA/NRCSMost sites in Montana hit all-time, or near-record amounts of precipitation in December when an atmospheric river released a deluge across the state. 
That’s according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, which released its January Water Supply Outlook Report last week. 
Of the 96 SNOTEL stations in Montana, 70 recorded their highest or second-highest December precipitation on record, according to Florence Miller, USDA NRCS hydrologist.
While the precipitation helped improve drought conditions across the state, NRCS data shows a split perspective on how it could impact the state’s water supply for the rest of the year. Higher elevation snow bolstered early-season snowpack, while rain at lower elevations melted out some early snow. 
Snowpack is the primary reservoir for water that is released throughout the spring and early summer as it melts out. Low snowpacks can impact streamflows across river basins and lead to major droughts, as was seen in recent years with front-facing impacts such as the low water levels on Flathead Lake. 
The first data release for the 2026 water year shows the winter is off to a mixed start — while December brought record precipitation bolstering early season snowpack at high elevations, much of it also fell as rain at lower elevations. 
In northwest Montana, the rain led to significant flooding in Lincoln, Sanders and Flathead Counties, leading to state and federal disaster declarations. 
All river basins in the state received between 170% and 300% of the 20-year median precipitation for December, according to NRCS data.
“A parade of unseasonably warm storms throughout December meant that although most SNOTEL stations received above normal precipitation, only some of that moisture fell as snow,” the report stated, emphasizing the elevation split meant some SNOTEL sites saw several more inches of snow than normal for the month, while nearby sites a few thousand feet lower saw huge deficits. 
“Statewide, snow water equivalent (SWE) is looking deceptively positive,” Miller said.

Snow-water equivalent, rather than snow depth, is the measurement used to gauge the amount of liquid water contained within a snowpack, which will be released when the snowpack melts. The snowmelt plays a key role in agriculture, hydropower production, water storage, aquatic ecosystem health and recreation such as boating and fishing, as well as flood and drought forecasting.
Across the state, snowpack on Jan. 1 ranged from 70% of median to 120% of median, with “most major basins falling at or near normal.”
In the northwest, the Kootenai, Flathead and Upper Clark Fork basins all have snowpacks at more than 100% of median. The upper Yellowstone basin is at 120%, the Bighorn basin at 111%, the Gallatin at 107%, and the Sun-Teton-Marias at 116%. 
Lagging behind the state is the Tongue basin, which drains the state’s southeast corner into Wyoming, sitting at 71% of normal. 
Another outlier of the early season is the Lower Clark Fork basin, which despite seeing high precipitation during the last three months — including 223% of normal in December — has a snowpack below normal, at just 86% of median. At this time last year, the basin had a snowpack of 112%. 
Snowpack in most areas of the state tends to peak in late April. 
The NRCS report stated that lower elevation zones that look to have below-average snowpack could see those deficits quickly erased with a few good storm systems. 
But the near-term forecast isn’t favoring additional snowfall.
Temperatures across the state Monday and Tuesday look unseasonably warm, with high temperatures in the upper 40s across the western part of the state, and reaching into the 50s in Bozeman and in Billings, according to the National Weather Service.

Nevada is the nation’s largest gold producer, and the second largest producer of silver, after Alaska.
Over the weekend, Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced he was under investigation by the Trump administration. The investigation is ostensibly about mismanagement of renovations at the Fed building in Washington. But Trump has been hounding and verbally abusing Powell for most of the last year in what critics worry is a sign that once Powell’s term is up, Trump will effectively become the person setting interest rates in the U.S.
When central bank institutions in other countries — Argentina, Turkey, Zimbabwe, Hungary — have lost their independence and come under the control of a politician, credibility in and value of the nation’s currency has gone down, and prices have gone up. 
Politicization of central banks creates a specter of volatility that drives some investors to seek shelter from debased currency. Gold and silver are viewed as safe havens.
Gold hit $4,600 an ounce for the first time Monday, at one point reaching $4,640. Silver hit an all-time high of $86.34 an ounce.
Surging gold and silver prices come on the heels of a banner year for precious metals.
The share prices of Nevada’s primary mining corporations were also boosted  Monday. That too is a continuation of last year, when Newmont Corp.’s shares soared by more than 180%, and Barrick Mining Corp’s share price shot up more than 200%.

(Courtesy of the Department of Corrections)New Jersey lawmakers advanced legislation Thursday to expand protections for imprisoned women in New Jersey, after brutality and sex abuse scandals drove Gov. Phil Murphy to order the troubled Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women closed and replaced.
The bill, known as the Incarcerated Women’s Protection Act, would codify protections state corrections officials have adopted since sexual misconduct drove federal authorities in 2021 to declare oversight. It also builds on a 2020 law, known as the Dignity Act, that set new protections for incarcerated parents and pregnant women.
The legislation would:

Enact “gender-responsive” policies from entry through release and beyond.
Require the state Department of Corrections to mandate annual gender-specialized training for all correctional officers who supervise imprisoned women.
Establish a special victims unit to investigate allegations of sexual assault or misconduct and require investigators to get gender-informed and victim-centered training on how to best investigate such cases.
Create a division of women’s services to develop policies, programs, and services addressing treatment for physical or sexual abuse, parenting, and child reunification.
Require the department to offer parenting classes, doula services, and family reunification programs for pregnant inmates and counseling and reentry services for women scheduled for release within six months.

Legislators approved the bill on the last voting day of their two-year legislative session, with the Assembly passing it 67-6 (six Republicans voted no) and the Senate, 39-0. Murphy has until Jan. 20 to sign the bill for it to become law. A new two-year legislative session begins at noon Tuesday.
Murphy in 2021 ordered Edna Mahan’s closure after more than a dozen correctional officers were arrested and accused of brutally assaulting incarcerated women during a violent night of forced cell extractions. A state judge dismissed their criminal indictment in October, citing deficiencies in the indictment and the state’s four-year delay in preparing the case for trial.
Construction on a new 420-bed, $310 million state prison for women began in October in Chesterfield, where the prison will relocate from Clinton.

(Getty Creative)Two Wisconsin hospital systems have paused providing gender-affirming health care for minors, according to a published report, prompting state lawmakers to urge them to reconsider.
“Wisconsin values include fairness, compassion and looking out for one another,” said state Sen. Melissa Ratcliff (D-Cottage Grove) and state Reps. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee), Margaret Arney (D-Wauwatosa) and Lee Snodgrass (D-Appleton) in a joint statement Monday afternoon. 
“This decision moves us away from those values by placing additional burdens on families who are already navigating complex medical health needs. Parents should be able to make informed decisions in consultation with qualified health care providers without political interference or fear,” the lawmakers said.  
The statement was issued under the umbrella of the Legislature’s Transgender Parent and Nonbinary Advocacy Caucus.
The group responded to reporting Monday in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Children’s Wisconsin, a children’s hospital and health system in suburban Milwaukee, and UW Health, in Madison had both paused prescribing gender-affirming medication such as puberty blockers and hormones for minors.
The news story initially attributed word of the changes to anonymous sources. Representatives of both hospital systems subsequently confirmed the facilities had taken action to stop providing care, except in the area of behavioral health.
On Dec. 18, the U.S. Health and Human Services Department announced that the federal government would stop all Medicaid and Medicare payments to hospitals and clinics that provide gender-affirming care for patients under the age of 18.
“At Children’s Wisconsin, we strongly believe everyone, including LGBTQ+ kids, should be treated with the support, respect, dignity and compassion they deserve,” a Children’s spokesperson told the Journal Sentinel. “We are communicating to patients that due to escalating legal and federal regulatory risk facing systems and providers across the nation, we are currently unable to provide gender affirming pharmacologic care.” Children’s Wisconsin will continue mental health and behavioral health services, the spokesperson said.
A UW Health spokesperson told the newspaper in a statement that the system “is committed to providing high-quality, compassionate and patient-centered care to our patients and families, including LGBTQ+ patients.”
The statement acknowledged that because of federal actions, “UW Health is pausing prescribing puberty blockers and hormone therapy as part of gender-affirming care for patients under 18 years of age.”
The lawmakers’ caucus statement, which did not name the medical systems, said that halting care could harm the mental health of young people receiving that care.
“Removing access to this care increases the risk of anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts among young people who already are facing disproportionate mental health challenges,” the caucus statement said. It urged the health systems “to reconsider their decision.”
Abigail Swetz, executive director of the LGBTQ+ advocacy organization Fair Wisconsin, said in a statement that the Trump administration has been engaged in “disgusting” attacks on trans people since before taking office.
In pausing care the hospital systems made “an awful decision, and I believe it is the wrong decision — it’s a decision that is putting young patients, their families, and even their own providers in a very tough place,” Swetz said. “And at the same time, these clinics should never have been bullied by this federal administration into making any kind of decision in the first place, especially one that reduces access to this life-affirming care.”
Swetz said Fair Wisconsin was organizing public comment opposing the federal proposed rule and urged Wisconsinites to join the effort.

Masterson, who has served in the Kansas Legislature since 2005, is seeking the GOP nomination for governor in a crowded primary. (Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The 2026 session of the Kansas Legislature burst to life Monday as Republicans and Democrats staked out public policy priorities, welcomed members to fill unexpired terms of the departed and awaited the upcoming final State of the State speech by Gov. Laura Kelly.
Senate President Ty Masterson, an Andover Republican, and House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican, gaveled in the Senate and House in what could be the final legislative session for both. Masterson is competing in a crowded field for the GOP nomination for governor, while Hawkins tossed his hat into the ring in the race for state insurance commissioner.
In brief remarks with reporters, Masterson said his mind was on finding ways to control rising property taxes, embracing the One, Big Beautiful Bill Act signed by President Donald Trump and, possibly, redrawing the state’s congressional district boundaries for benefit of Republican candidates for Congress.
“A constitutional amendment to cap property tax, at least authorizing the ‘big, beautiful bill’ and parental freedom in education. Like to do a little tort reform. Obviously, get a budget passed,” Masterson said.
In terms of redistricting, the Senate president said he would “love to” advance a bill that shifted boundaries of the state’s four U.S. House districts to give GOP candidates a distinct edge over Democratic candidates. The idea would be to make it difficult for U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, D-Kansas, to win reelection.
The original plan was to convene a special session of the Legislature in November to consider a new congressional map. The required two-thirds majority in the Senate signed a petition calling a special session, but Hawkins was unable to convince two-thirds of Republican peers in the House to sign a special-session petition.
“If we get it from the House, we’re going to take it up,” said Masterson, who would appear to have the easier task of securing enough votes to thwart a veto by Kelly.

The first order of business Monday was for Kansas Supreme Court Chief Justice Eric Rosen to swear into office the Senate’s newcomers. Sen. Scott Hill, R-Abilene, and Sen. Silas Miller, D-Wichita, were drafted from the House to fill vacancies in the Senate. Hill replaced Sen. J.R. Claeys, a Salina Republican who went to work for the Trump administration. Miller took the seat left open by Sen. Mary Ware, who announced her retirement in November.
At the front of the Senate chamber, Rosen turned to Hill and began reciting the oath: “Do you, Silas Miller …”
The gaffe was noted, and Rosen affirmed: “Not a good start.” He replaced Miller’s name in the script with Hill’s, and the perfunctory ceremonies for both were completed.
House and Senate committees begin meeting Tuesday. Kelly, a Democrat in the final year of her two terms as governor, is scheduled to deliver the annual State of the State speech to a joint session of the Legislature at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday.

‘Last first day’
Hawkins, a Republican insurance executive, marked his “last first day” of the session after 14 years in the House and three years as speaker. While he’s running for insurance commissioner, all 125 seats in the House will be up for election in November. The Senate won’t do likewise until 2028.
“The first day of the session is always a happy day,” Hawkins said to an almost full chamber. “I tried for the House to be the best House there ever was, and I think, for the most part, we have done just that.”
He said he strived to promote mutual respect in the House “so that we listen, hopefully, more than we talk.”
Hawkins encouraged spirited debate on the House floor that avoided personal jabs.
“Be engaged, and put everything you have into this session. But don’t leave wishing you would have done something,” he said.
Ahead of the House’s more ordinary first-day business, Rosen swore in Rep. Abi Boatman, a Wichita-area Democrat, Air Force veteran and advocate who replaced Miller.
Boatman, who is Kansas’ second-ever transgender legislator, worked in advocacy and civic engagement for the past decade. She said her first moments in the Legislature were fast-paced as she received a warm welcome. She said the Legislature felt like “the next natural step.”
Rep. Steve Brunk, a Wichita Republican who served in the House from 2003 to 2015, was appointed to complete the unexpired term of Rep. Patrick Penn, who took a job in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. During the interim period, Brunk lobbied for a conservative policy organization opposed to abortion.
After checking with Capitol security at the visitor center to make certain the state’s conceal-carry gun law hadn’t changed in his absence, he discussed his reasons for returning to the House.
“I just felt like there was unfinished business here. I always liked the process,” he said.

Democrats’ agenda
Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes, a Lenexa Democrat running for state insurance commissioner, said one of her top priorities would be to approve a refundable child tax credit. In the past, proposals have been made to offer a $25 to $600 per child income tax credit for low- and middle-income households to help families deal with escalating costs. She said it was unlikely the GOP-led Legislature would approve the bill.
“I would love to see child tax credits passed through, but I don’t think there’s a possible way for that,” Sykes said.
She said the Legislature ought to extend the existing K-12 school finance formula — due to expire in mid-2027 — for another year. That would allow the 2027 Legislature to craft a new formula that wouldn’t be implemented until 2028, she said.
Sen. Cindy Holscher, a Democrat seeking the party’s nomination for governor along with Sen. Ethan Corson, said she would take on a defensive mindset in an attempt to disrupt GOP legislation that she would view as harmful to the state’s most vulnerable people.
“I am always focused on things that will help the people,” she said. “We’ve been pushing things like Medicaid expansion for years. I’m going to look for ways to bring things good forward and push back against the bad stuff.”
After the House adjourned for the day, House Democrats gathered with reporters at the Capitol to highlight an agenda designed to benefit working families.
House Democrats proposed raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour, allowing renters to get 15% of their rent back in a tax rebate, providing universal school meals and addressing access to and the cost of child care. They also wanted to exempt $125,000 of a home’s value from the state property tax. The current threshold is $75,000.

House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard, D-Lenexa, said Democrats were exploring ways to pay for their wish list. Legalizing recreational marijuana was on the table, he said, along with raising taxes for millionaires.
However, he said, cost of living was the No. 1 issue on Kansans’ minds. But their proposals would need support from Republicans to reach the minimum 63 votes for passage in the House.
“In the superminority, we have to go find friends, right?” Woodard said. “There’s only 37 of us, so we have to find 26 members that will work with us. The idea of coming up with our own agenda allows us to, one, tell Kansans what we stand for, but also, these are going to be floor amendments that you see on any of the bills that are introduced by Republicans.”
Rep. Dan Osman, D-Overland Park, said Kansas should be a place where growing families could afford child care, seniors could live in their homes on a fixed income, and young people could see a future instead of looking to other states.
“Families are doing everything right, working hard, budgeting correctly, planning for our future. Yet too many are still feeling squeezed,” Osman said.

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)State Sen. Gene Yaw (R-Lycoming) will lead the tri-state legislative body that advises lawmakers and Congress on government action needed to restore and protect the Chesapeake Bay.
Yaw was elected chairperson of the 21-member Chesapeake Bay Commission, which includes 15 state House and Senate lawmakers from Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia; a cabinet secretary selected by each state’s governor; and a citizen member from each state. He previously led the commission in 2020.
Yaw said in a news release that he intends to guide the commission in driving forward innovative policies that will support the revised Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement, which state and federal officials approved last month.
The Chesapeake Bay Commission, created in the 1980s through legislation in all three states, serves to identify and coordinate state legislative and policy action to reverse decades of pollution that degraded the estuary’s waters. The Susquehanna River, which collects water across a massive swath of Pennsylvania, is the bay’s largest tributary.
“With the entire partnership united behind a revised agreement and committed to success, now is the time for bold ideas that deliver healthy streams and a restored Chesapeake Bay,” Yaw said in a statement. “I’m proud that Pennsylvania is being recognized as a leader on clean water and a showcase for innovative projects that highlight local benefits. I am looking forward to scaling up our efforts over the coming year.”
Yaw replaces Maryland state Senator Sara Love (D-Montgomery). Yaw will also continue to serve as the chair of the Pennsylvania delegation, of which state Sen. Scott Martin (R-Lancaster), Rep. Kerry Benninghoff (R-Centre), Rep. Carol Hill-Evans (D-York) and Rep. Nikki Rivera (D-Lancaster) are members.
State Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Jessica Shirley and G. Warren Elliott of Chambersburg also represent Pennsylvania.
In December, the Chesapeake Bay Executive Council voted to revise the watershed agreement, accepting recommendations from a steering committee that had been meeting for more than two years. Notably, the council voted to develop formal channels for tribal nations to participate.
The revisions include data collection and analysis methods and greater accountability for clean up efforts. Other changes include more emphasis on habitat restoration and exposure of climate impacts in the region.
The council, which consists of leaders from six states within the Bay watershed, also elected Gov. Josh Shapiro to serve as its chairperson this year.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC06024-1024x683-1.jpeg,,,2026-01-12 18:58:26.533101

(Photo by Getty Images)COLUMBIA — Students erroneously awarded K-12 scholarships in 2024 spent nearly $64,000 in taxpayer money before their removal, but it appears the problem didn’t repeat in the program’s second year, according to two state education agencies.
A report given to legislators last month and provided to the SC Daily Gazette revealed how much money was spent before the agency suspended students’ accounts because they didn’t qualify for the $1,500 quarterly payments. It also represented the Department of Education’s first public confirmation on the number of students removed.
While that problem didn’t resurface in a survey released Monday, it indicated that at least some schools are raising tuition prices for participants.
The $64,000 came from the accounts of 82 of the 1,005 ineligible students removed from the program in September 2024 because they still attended public school in their local district, which disqualified them from the program. The department clawed back the remaining $1.4 million in those students’ accounts.
How the parents of those 82 students spent the money before being disqualified remains unclear. By law, the money can be spent on various education expenses, including private tuition, tutoring and books.
A second survey of parents, similar to the one that revealed the problem, makes no mention of revoked funding. Parents who completed the survey for the program’s second year gave overwhelmingly positive responses, researcher Jenny May said Monday.
Up to 1,000 ineligible SC students booted from voucher program, report finds

“Everyone was very satisfied overall with this program,” May told a panel of the Education Oversight Committee, an independent agency that’s led by a committee of legislators, educators and business leaders.
It’s possible some students were still accepted to the program when they shouldn’t have been, but none of the nearly 1,700 survey responses suggested that was the case, and the oversight agency has no reason to believe the same problem happened again, May told reporters.
Students are no longer required to leave their public school district entirely to receive the funds, though they still can’t attend their zoned public school. For the first time this year, students already enrolled in private schools were allowed to apply for the money, as long as their parents made no more than 300% of the federal poverty level.
Considering around 45% of parents last year reported feeling dissatisfied with the program, Sen. Ross Turner, a member of the oversight committee, said he was “pleasantly surprised” with this year’s results.
The program “is obviously still young and still being molded into what it could be down the road, or what it will be down the road,” said the Greenville Republican, who voted in favor of the law. “But I think right now it’s on the right path.”
Applications for the 2026-27 school year open Thursday for students attending a public school this year, families making up to 300% of the federal poverty level, and/or children of active-duty military personnel stationed in South Carolina.
Everyone else who qualifies can start applying Feb. 9. This year, the income cap is 500% of the federal poverty level, or $128,600 for a family of four.
By law, the $7,600 vouchers must be made available to at least 15,000 qualified students this school year, though legislators can increase the amount. Gov. Henry McMaster and state Superintendent Ellen Weaver are asking for enough money to accept 20,000 students — a total cost of $61.4 million.
End-of-year report
The end-of-year report noted that the department found and removed all ineligible students during the 45 days the agency had to make sure all participants met the program’s requirements. That timing lined up with public schools’ first student count, which verifies state and federal funding per pupil.
During that check, 1,229 students appeared to be enrolled both in their zoned public school district and the voucher program, named the Education Scholarship Trust Fund, according to the report. Under the law that created the inaugural program, students had to leave their home district to access the money, but some parents didn’t seem to know about or understand that requirement, the report suggests.
Department of Education staff suspended the accounts at that point and verified where students were attending school, leading to the removal of 1,005 students. The remaining 224 students were automatically reenrolled in their public schools despite transferring, so the department reinstated their funds.
Application window to open for K-12 vouchers. Here’s who applied for this school year.

“Thankfully, (education) officials detected these ‘double counting’ problems early in the initial enrollment verification process and were able to pull back unspent funds that had been previously allocated,” the report reads.
That included all but $63,670. That’s a drop in the bucket for a program that ultimately spent more than $6 million, and the agency did claw back the vast majority of the $1.5 million put in accounts for students who didn’t qualify, the report said.
“Any dollar that’s spent in a way that’s out of line with the law is concerning,” said Patrick Kelly, a lobbyist for the Palmetto State Teachers Association. “It’s notable that the department noticed that and addressed it.”
Survey results
Although the results from the November survey were overwhelmingly positive, some parents’ comments did raise concerns, May said.
For instance, some parents claimed private schools and other unspecified vendors charged parents receiving the taxpayer-funded benefit more than they charged those paying out of pocket.
“We thought our funds would go further, but when the school found out we had received the ESTF scholarship, they no longer gave us a previous discount,” one parent wrote. “We would have preferred to have the option of reimbursement so that we can choose how to spend those funds without schools setting prices based on what they know families are receiving.”
How many times this happened was unclear from the survey, and parents didn’t name any schools that hiked tuition for voucher recipients or say how much more they were paying.
Critics of the program have long warned that private schools would raise tuition to match whatever amount the state gives out.
“You could see this coming,” Kelly said.
Inflated prices will mean families can’t stretch their money as far, Kelly said. For instance, a parent enrolling their child in private school may not also be able to pay for additional expenses, such as a school uniform or tutoring, if increased tuition prices eat up all their state-funded scholarship.
“Families will be priced out of educational opportunities as vendors continue to raise prices,” Kelly said.
SC K-12 school voucher program hits 10,000-student cap, with thousands more rejected

Last year, as senators debated a revised version of the law, some proposed adding price caps. Legislators will likely need to take another look at the problem this year, now that the concerns are seeming to become reality, Turner said.
“I think those things are going to have to be ironed out,” Turner said, stopping short of any specific proposals.
A handful of teachers also reported that the school where they worked required them to apply for the program and use the money to cover tuition for their children who attended, even though the school previously allowed their children to attend for free. Those parents then couldn’t use the money for other needs, such as tutoring or textbooks.
“That might minimize choice for some families who are trying to access all of the opportunities to finance support and education opportunities for their kids,” May said.
The teachers did not say where they worked.
Confusion continues over homeschooling
For the second year, parents wrote how happy they were to use the money for homeschooling, even though that’s illegal.
“We wanted to home educate our children but we could not afford it,” one parent wrote. “This program gave us the opportunity to tailor our children’s education to their needs and gifts.”
Some parents may have conflated homeschooling with other acceptable forms of education under the program, such as virtual classes provided through a traditional school but completed at home.
“However, there’s enough ambiguity that it could appear as an inappropriate use of funds without more clarity,” May said.
In its end-of-year report, the education department defended those parents, saying they weren’t technically homeschooling.
Instead of opting for one of the state-provided homeschooling programs, which the law prohibits for those receiving vouchers, the parents agree to follow the Education Scholarship Trust Fund rules, according to the report. In that way, the state essentially acts as the homeschooling authorizer instead of a public school or homeschooling association.
The Education Oversight Committee’s staff recommended legislators add homeschooling as an option for the program to cut down on confusion.
That’s sure to stir up an ironic foe: parents who homeschool their children. Parents who signed up for one of the three homeschooling methods allowed under state law specifically requested legislators leave them out of the program out of fear of too much government involvement in their children’s education.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/studentsinclassroom-1024x686.jpeg,,,2026-01-12 18:58:26.533101

Education transformation is about building the best education system in the U.S.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  It’s not all about taxes, stupid.","This commentary is Zoie Saunders is Vermont’s secretary of education. 



Education transformation in Vermont is not just about property taxes. It is about building and sustaining the best education system in America.
At a moment when nearly every other state is diverting dollars away from public education, Vermont has chosen a different path. 
Last year, a bipartisan coalition passed Act 73—a bill that doubles down on public education as the great equalizer, the pathway out of poverty and the engine that fuels our economy.
Having the best education system in America is not just about test scores. It is about giving every student the opportunity to succeed, regardless of economic disadvantage, language status, or the town they call home.
But this requires us to ask why these opportunities remain so uneven. 
Why do some students not have access to the same course offerings as their peers in other districts? Why do some students attend districts with nearly half the per-pupil spending as others? 
Why do rural and economically disadvantaged areas struggle to offer competitive teacher salaries on par with wealthier pockets of the state? Why are there persistent achievement gaps between students from historically marginalized backgrounds and their peers?
The root cause of our inequities is a simple but hard truth: we are not organizing or operating our statewide education system well. Because of that, we are not directing resources to the places where they can make the greatest difference: supporting students and paying teachers competitively.
The good news is that we have a plan. During the 2025 legislative session, the governor, the Agency of Education and the General Assembly worked together to develop a roadmap that positions Vermont as a national leader in education.
Given the magnitude of the change proposed, Vermonters have questions, as they should. 
Will this plan save money? Will this plan actually give kids more opportunities? Will it better support teachers? Will it result in a more predictable and equitable approach to funding our education system?
Supporters say the answer is yes.
Extensive cost modeling was conducted before and throughout the legislative process, demonstrating the ability to provide an excellent education at a cost that Vermonters can afford. 
We built budgets, including sample budgets for the five districts originally proposed: Champlain Valley Region, Southwest Region, Southeast Region, Winooski Valley Region, and Northeast Region.
We adapted the plan based on educator input, and we engaged independent school finance experts. Their review, based on research, data and best practices, confirmed that the plan does what Vermonters expect.
It puts teaching and learning first, aligns with education and management best practices, directs more resources to students and staff, and strengthens Vermont’s statewide commitment to equity.
The resulting bipartisan bill, Act 73, represents one of the largest education investments in the country.
Vermont is on the cusp of something special.
A generational investment combined with generational change means we can maintain smaller elementary schools through thoughtful staffing while shifting resources to create more robust middle and high schools. 
We can expand mental health and behavioral supports, enhance electives and special programs, and create new, innovative pathways for high school students.
It all sounds good, right? Yes, and it is possible—but only if we are willing to change.
That change requires moving to larger districts in Vermont to ensure the generational investment of Act 73 reaches all students. Let’s be clear: larger districts create economies of scale that can determine whether a school can offer advanced courses, hire a reading coach, or afford a strong continuum of supports.
Ultimately, education transformation is about Vermonters coming together to acknowledge our challenges and tackle them collectively.
Right now, local communities are fending for themselves. The status quo has put local school boards and districts in a difficult position where staffing and programming cuts are being made and schools are being closed, all while property taxes continue to rise and families continue to be priced out of local communities.
We cannot ask local communities to fend for themselves. We cannot ask local communities—on their own—to boost educational outcomes while bending the cost curve of funding education. We cannot ask a fragmented structure to deliver world-class results. We have to do this together.
Change is hard, but Vermonters have shown we can do hard things by coming together.
Let’s come together to follow through on the bipartisan plan to build the best education system in America—a plan that puts students before politics, raises teacher pay, and creates opportunities and programs that rival every other state in the country. 
Our kids deserve nothing less.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-12 23:25:12+00:00,CT Mirror,"Work can again resume on Revolution Wind, judge orders in blow to Trump",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/12/work-can-again-resume-on-revolution-wind-judge-orders-in-blow-to-trump/,Judge Royce Lamberth ruled from the bench Monday that evidence provided by the federal government was not sufficient to justify halting work.,"A federal judge ruled again Monday that work may resume on the offshore Revolution Wind project, despite the Trump administration’s efforts to halt construction for the second time.
U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth said in a ruling from the bench Monday that evidence provided by the federal government — which cited the potential impacts large wind farms can have on military radar — was not sufficient to justify its decision to suddenly stop work on a project that was years in the making and had undergone extensive reviews by defense officials and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. BOEM gave its final approval to the project in 2023.
“While the Bureau may order a suspension of operations for legitimate reasons of national security… those suspensions are limited to emergency situations and demonstrated findings of particularized harm that cannot be averted short of a total stop to project activity,” Lamberth said. 
Lamberth, who was appointed to the bench by former President Ronald Reagan, further pointed out that officials said they were made aware of newly-classified information regarding wind projects in November but they didn’t act on that information until Dec. 22 — three days before Christmas.
“I’m not persuaded that any such emergency exists in this case,” he said. 
Lamberth’s ruling only applies to Revolution Wind and not the four other offshore wind projects that saw their development halted as result of the Trump administration’s stop-work order. That order included Revolution’s Wind’s sister project, Sunrise Wind.
Even with Monday’s victory, Revolution Wind’s developers are facing a time crunch to complete the nearly $6 billion wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island.
Revolution Wind was already 87% completed when work was halted — for the second time — in late December. All but seven of of the massive turbines have been mounted on top of pilings driven into the sea floor, and transmission cables have been laid to connect the project to onshore substations, according to court filings. 
But the developers also face a deadline of Feb. 22 — 41 days away — to complete work on the seven remaining turbines before a specially-designed installation vessel, the Wind Scylla, has to depart for other projects.
That work will take at least 41 days to complete, according to Revolution Wind’s attorneys. 
“Revolution Wind will determine how best it may be possible to work with the US Administration to achieve an expeditious and durable resolution,” project spokeswoman Meaghan Wims said in a statement Monday. “The Project will resume construction work as soon as possible, with safety as the top priority, and to deliver affordable, reliable power to the Northeast.”
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers released a statement responding to Monday’s decision deriding offshore projects as the “scam of the century.”
“For years, Americans have been forced to pay billions more for the least reliable source of energy,” Rogers said. “The Trump administration paused the construction of all large-scale offshore wind projects because our number one priority is to put America First and protect the national security of the American people. We look forward to ultimate victory on the issue.”
President Donald Trump is a vociferous opponent of wind energy who has repeatedly spread false and misleading claims about turbines, including that they kill whales and cause cancer in humans. In August, his administration halted work on Revolution Wind for about a month before Judge Lamberth lifted its earlier order.
In explaining that earlier decision, Lamberth chastised government officials for failing to provide any evidence to support its claims about national security concerns. The first stop-work order, he said, was “the height of arbitrary and capricious action.”
This time, he said the government provided some evidence in a classified setting to support its claims. However, he said that evidence was similar to issues that were previously investigated during permitting for Revolution Wind, and it was not enough to justify shutting down the project as it neared the end of construction.
The Department of Interior’s announcement last month that it was pausing work on on those projects along the East Coast cited both classified and unclassified reports on a type of radar interference known as “clutter” that the agency attributed to the movement of turbine blades.
A spokesperson for Interior did not respond to a subsequent request from the Connecticut Mirror to provide copies of those unclassified reports. Attorneys for both Revolution Wind and the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island said that the government also declined to provide its findings to officials with the proper security clearances, include Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee.
The Trump administration did submit some of its classified information from Department of Defense for Lamberth to review, along with a declaration from Interior Deputy Secretary Jacob Tyner raising concerns about foreign entities involved in Revolution Wind. The project’s developers, Ørsted and Skyborn Renewables, are based in Denmark and Germany, respectively.
Ultimately, Lamberth said he was not moved by the information he had seen and had reason to doubt the veracity of the government’s arguments.
For example, he cited Interior Secretary Douglas Burgum’s own appearances on television discussing the stop-work order, in which the secretary railed against the offshore wind projects for their costs and other “reasons unrelated to national security.”
Lamberth’s ruling was quickly hailed by officials in both Connecticut and Rhode Island, where Revolution Wind is due to begin providing hundreds of megawatts of power to electric customers later this year. More than 1,000 workers are employed by the project, including at its staging facility on New London’s State Pier.
“This project should have never been shut down the first time or second time by the White House,” Gov. Ned Lamont said in a statement Monday. “Federal interference has stood in the way of lower energy costs and good-paying jobs, but today’s ruling puts Revolution Wind back on track. With construction resuming and suppliers gaining certainty as we near completion, this state-backed project will help deliver a more diverse energy supply and lower utility costs for families and businesses.” 
Connecticut Attorney General William Tong and his counterpart in Rhode Island also filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration’s latest stop-work order. That case was consolidated with the lawsuit brought by Revolution Wind’s developers ahead of Monday’s hearing.
“This project is on the finish line to begin delivering clean, affordable energy to Connecticut families,” Tong said in a statement. “With yet another clear defeat, it is my hope that Donald Trump will drop his lawless and erratic attacks for good. We’re prepared to keep fighting — and winning — for as long as it takes to protect Connecticut ratepayers, workers and our environment.”
Supporters of renewable energy and other climate-conscious groups also jumped in to praise Lamberth’s decision. 
“Today’s ruling is a decisive win for energy reliability and the hundreds of thousands of families counting on Revolution Wind,” said Kat Burnham, a senior principal at  Advanced Energy United, a industry group representing renewable and distributed energy developers. 
“The court rightly saw through a politically motivated stop-work order that would have caused real harm: driving up costs, delaying power for Rhode Island and Connecticut, and putting good-paying jobs at risk. It’s good news for workers, ratepayers, and anyone who recognizes the need for a fair energy market,” Burnham added. 
Some Republicans in Connecticut had also begun to question the Trump administration’s treatment of Revolution Wind.
Last week, House Republican Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Brandford, and Senate GOP leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, sent a joint letter to Secretary Burgum requesting that the government expedite its review of the national security concerns, citing estimates that the loss of the project could cost New England electricity customers up to $500 million a year. 
“Say what you want about wind, solar, or any other renewable energy, I think these things should be visited in the prospective, not retroactively,” Candelora said. “You can’t put the genie back in the bottle.” 
Candelora said he had not received a response to his letter as on Monday.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/LAMONT-WIND-0825-DE-SONY-098-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-12 18:58:26.533101

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)In a Monday morning high school art class in West Greenwich, a security detail stood next to a table adorned with rows of metallic-tubed paints in varying states of fullness, and kept close watch over U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon as she maneuvered from student to student and asked what they were working on.
“So you’re the only guy around here?” McMahon asked senior Jacob Tefft, the only male student in the six-student class, when she arrived at his seat.
McMahon’s Monday morning appearance at Exeter-West Greenwich Regional Junior High and High School comprised the Rhode Island leg of her Returning Education to the States Tour, which began in August 2025 and, with the conclusion of Monday’s tour, has so far come to 26 states.
The tour, according to the U.S. Department of Education’s boilerplate copy, comprises a mission assigned to McMahon by President Donald Trump to “lead on one of his most momentous promises to families — returning education to the states and equipping all parents to choose an excellent education for their children.”
It is also meant to emphasize what public education funding and regulation might look like once transformed by President Donald Trump’s administration. The Education Department has framed the tour as an attempt to gather best practices from schools nationwide as it attempts to redefine what public education could look like with a shrunken, or at least changed, federal role.
While Trump has previously and loudly proclaimed his intent to cast the Education Department into oblivion, McMahon told reporters during a scrum at the end of roughly two-and-a-half-hour visit that the availability of federal funding, not the name of its source, is educators’ core concern. 
“What they want reassurance of is that there is going to continue to be oversight, there’s going to be accountability,” McMahon said. The end of her department, she argued, would not dispel longstanding federal obligations to schools.
“Before there was a Department of Education, this funding — the Title I funding — still came through,” McMahon said. “IDEA funding still came through. The laws have not changed and the accountabilities have not changed for these laws, regardless of who is having the oversight and looking at this.”
McMahon’s visit to West Greenwich was the first tour stop since her Jan. 7 trek to Iowa, where the U.S. Department of Education approved what it described as the first “Returning Education to the States” waiver — a move federal and Iowan officials suggest can be a model for how states can have more flexibility and control over federal education dollars.
The waiver allows Iowa’s education agency to consolidate four federal funding sources into a single, state-level pot and, in the Education Department’s estimate, could lead to “nearly $8 million to be redirected from bureaucratic red tape to the classroom over four years.” 
The grant approved by the Education Department is more selective than Iowa’s original proposal, which wanted to consolidate 10 programs.  
“The goal…with returning education to the states,” McMahon said Monday, “is more autonomy at the state level.”
How would these block grants help further the Trump administration’ s goal of autonomy?

McMahon told reporters that the grants, by allowing for less stringent regulations over where grant monies go, give states “more flexibility in the spending.” Her department first invited education departments nationwide to submit waivers in July 2025. 
The waivers are meant to, in the department’s words, relieve state education agencies of “burdensome statutory and regulatory provisions by using the authority outlined in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.”
Critics of the Trump administration’s block grant plan argue the intended flexibility could still lead to money being pooled toward some purposes over others, leaving some programs like multilingual education or after-school programs underfunded. Congressional Democrats have urged McMahon to reject block grant requests, saying such a funding plan would fail “the very students these provisions aim to support.”
Since Iowa’s successful waiver, however, more governors are expressing interest, McMahon claimed. “They’re lining up relatively quickly now,” she said.
Rhode Island Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green, who attended Monday’s classroom tour and the subsequent roundtable discussion with the secretary, does not consider Rhode Island among the states queuing up.
“I think that we are looking at what is best for Rhode Island,” Infante-Green told reporters, saying of the waivers, “And right now, that doesn’t seem to be the best way to go.” 
But, the commissioner added, “We will work with whoever we need to work with and to ensure that our state has what it needs and that our students get everything that they’re entitled to.”
Friendly territory
McMahon’s Rhode Island appearance was less shrouded in obscurity than the August 2025 visit of fellow cabinet member and U.S. Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez DeRemer to a Cranston fire station. Chavez DeRemer’s visit played out in an almost clandestine fashion, with the labor secretary never meeting reporters’ gazes except through the darkened glass of a garage door window.
McMahon’s team, meanwhile, let a small band of reporters tag along with the secretary and her posse of security, staff and government photographers as she toured four classrooms and spoke with students and teachers. 
Reporters were also permitted to sit in during the opening remarks of McMahon’s roundtable discussion — which included local leaders, school administrators and educators, a few students, and Infante-Green. Then the press was ushered out and brought back to the holding space in the school’s auditorium, where McMahon appeared about 45 minutes later to field questions. One reporter asked if West Greenwich was chosen because of the town’s conservative voting record, arguing that many of McMahon’s pit stops have been in conservative areas.
“I don’t think that it was because it’s particularly conservative,” she replied. “There’s a lot of CTE [career and technical education] concentration, and we are talking a great deal in this administration about workforce development and how much we need it.”
“We have really a deficit in our workforce, and we just have to rethink education, as to how we want to do it,” McMahon continued. 
West Greenwich is, in fact, a town where nearly 64% of West Greenwich voters opted for Trump in the 2024 election. Residents mostly elected Republicans to represent them in the Rhode Island General Assembly that same year and the five-seat Town Council is all Republican. (One seat on the Council is currently vacant due to former occupant Chas Calenda taking a job as the state’s interim U.S. Attorney in December.) 
McMahon’s office confirmed in a separate email that Sue Cienki, a former East Greenwich School Committee and Town Councilor, suggested the school as McMahon’s tour stop. Cienki did not immediately respond to a request for comment by press time.

Make like a banana and split
McMahon praised career and technical education in her roundtable opening remarks, but she also saw a less technical and more expressive take on Exeter and West Greenwich’s curriculum in visits to two art classes, a science class, and a gallery of student artworks.
The gallery in a separate room on the school’s first floor is where McMahon received a brief lesson in contemporary art from senior student Tefft.
One of Tefft’s canvases parodied Maurizio Cattelan’s “Comedian,” a 2019 conceptual gag of sorts that, in consisting of nothing more than a banana duct-taped to a wall, became the target of ire for the same art world pretension it sought to mock. 
“I was going to ask why there was a banana,” McMahon said.
Some of that banana’s iconoclasm, or at least refusal, might also be glimpsed in the underlying purposes of McMahon’s tour, which criticizes the very department she leads and aims to disband. Speaking to reporters, she cited a moment during her confirmation hearing. 
“I said, ‘We spent all this money. We put all these programs in place. We’ve got all of this happening,’” McMahon recounted. “We’ve continued to fail our students.”   
Infante-Green separately told reporters she still thinks the U.S. Department of Education is “necessary, and I will stand by that,” she said. 
“But I also think that my job is to work with everyone that’s going to bring resources into our state and make sure that our kids and our state shines and continues to shine,” the commissioner added.

Idaho Gov. Brad Little submits plan to balance state budget without repealing Medicaid expansion

But notably, he says his plan that calls for spending cuts to balance the state budget doesn’t propose repealing Medicaid expansion — a health insurance public assistance program approved by Idaho voters through a ballot initiative in 2018. Leading up to the 2026 session of the Idaho Legislature, some Republican state lawmakers have said they are considering repealing Medicaid expansion to avoid a budget shortfall. 
Instead, Little is calling for $45 million in cuts to Idaho Medicaid from the state’s general fund. Those cuts are split between extending 4% cuts to doctor pay rates and a list of options for cuts the governor says he is giving the Legislature. Repealing Medicaid expansion isn’t on that list, the governor’s office says. 
Little says the true cost of repealing Medicaid expansion isn’t what it may seem. 
“It’s the net net net effect of it,” the governor told reporters after his State of the State address. “It’s not the big top line. It’s the bottom line, when you take all the other areas out of it. And it was passed by 60% (of voters), a plurality in the state of Idaho.” 
But he said there’s still work to do on Medicaid’s budget. 
“It’s the right thing to do,” Little said. “It’s the fastest growing expense to state government; you have to scrutinize that.”
The governor’s list of possible Medicaid cuts was not immediately available.

 Advocates say Idaho needs to wait before more Medicaid cuts

This fiscal year and next fiscal year, Idaho is facing multimillion dollar projected budget deficits after years of state tax cuts. To avoid a shortfall, the governor last year ordered midyear budget cuts across state government, including cuts to pay rates for medical providers who treat Medicaid patients. He wants to extend those cuts permanently. 
But the state’s provider pay cuts don’t appear to be enough, with projections showing the state will save much less than it hoped for,  the governor’s office says. That has prompted the governor to propose $22 million in more Medicaid cuts.
“I think one of the toughest decisions we’ll be making this year is some of the Medicaid reductions,” the governor’s budget chief, Lori Wolff, told reporters Monday morning.

Idaho House Speaker Mike Moyle, a Republican from Star, said the governor’s proposed $45 million in Medicaid cuts likely won’t be enough.
“Somehow we’ve got to get that Medicaid expansion under control because it’s taking resources away from, in my opinion, the most important issue, that being education,” Moyle said.
Idaho House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, a Boise Democrat, said repealing Medicaid expansion would actually raise the state’s budget deficit by around $20 million. 
“This would be a staggering mistake for so many reasons if they tried to solve the budget mess that they’ve created by going there,” Rubel told reporters. 
Before Little delivered his address, advocates wearing red T-shirts that read “Medicaid unites us” gathered in the Idaho State Capitol Building and called for state officials to wait before making more Medicaid cuts. 
They said the state hasn’t even seen the full impact of Medicaid cuts from a sweeping cost cutting state law last year, and President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” But the state’s cuts to Medicaid provider pay rates are already taking a toll, advocates said.
“The disabled community did not create this budget problem, but they are being asked to pay for it,” said Trixy Wade, who said her disabled child has struggled to find a home-based speech therapist.
 What Medicaid cuts is the governor considering? 

The governor is presenting a few options of Medicaid cuts for the Legislature to consider, Wolff told reporters — including to the state’s shift to managed care, hospital reimbursements, and other programs. Because many of those services are spelled out in law, Wolff said carrying out the cuts would need more than just a budget bill.
‘It’s Groundhogs Day:’ Idaho Legislature to explore repealing Medicaid expansion — again

“The reason the governor did not choose is a lot of those actually have statutory requirements in terms of services offered. And it will require a policy bill, and we will work closely with the Legislature and the Department of Health and Welfare to decide what path we want to take,” Wolff said. 
After the governor ordered midyear budget cuts last year, Idaho Medicaid contractor Magellan cut a critical mental health service. Providers and sheriffs warn the cuts will risk public safety. Idaho health officials aren’t sure the cuts will save the state money long-term, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Asked how officials approach making more Medicaid cuts, Little said “Thread the needle is an appropriate analysis.”
The governor is also recommending more cuts for Medicaid because provider pay rate cuts are looking like they won’t save as much as officials hoped for. 
In October, Wolff estimated the cuts would save $41.6 million next fiscal year. But now the governor’s office is estimating the cuts will save just $23 million.
Wolff said Idaho’s savings are projected to come in short because the federal government took longer to approve the state’s cuts to provider pay rates, and the feds wouldn’t let the state cut pay rates across the board, prompting Idaho to exempt some services.

A Vermont judge has rejected a renewed request to release a former Rutland County man facing a murder charge stemming from a vehicle pursuit that killed a young Rutland City police officer.
David Sleigh, an attorney for Tate Rheaume, argued in recent court filings that revelations from an internal affairs investigation that criticized officers’ actions in the July 2023 deadly chase represented a substantial change in the case that warranted his client’s release. 
Rheaume has been held without bail since 2024. He is charged with aggravated murder in the death of 19-year-old Jessica Ebbighausen, a new recruit for the department who had been on the job for less than two months.

Rutland Superior Court Judge Cortland Corsones, in a five-page decision made public Monday, wrote that the information in the internal affairs report should be weighed by a jury at trial, including the question of whether the report impacts the strength of the state’s case against Rheaume. 
“The internal investigation findings do not alter the court’s findings as to the facts of the defendant’s action,” the judge wrote. “Credibility determinations raised by the internal affairs investigation, and any delayed disclosure thereof, are appropriately made by the fact-finder at trial.” 
Sleigh said Monday he was considering whether to appeal the ruling to the Vermont Supreme Court. 
Sleigh wrote in court filings that city police leadership kept quiet about the findings of the internal affairs report for months. He added that he only became aware of the internal affairs investigation conducted by a city police commander through depositions of other officers in the case and then subpoenaed it from the city police.
The report stated that Ebbighausen’s death was “preventable” if officers had followed the proper procedures. The policy violations cited in the report ranged from not having the proper authority to initiate the pursuit to failing to follow proper procedures while the chase was underway. 
Rheaume, 22, who was also injured in the crash, had initially been charged with grossly negligent operation of a motor vehicle with a resulting death and attempting to elude police leading to a fatal crash.
Several months following further police investigation, Rheaume was arraigned on the upgraded charges, including the aggravated murder count, and has been held without bail since. 
Before the internal affairs report, Rheaume — who was represented by another attorney at the time — lost an appeal to the Vermont Supreme Court in August 2024. In that appeal, he was challenging the initial order holding him without bail. 
Rheaume’s attorney at the time “claims that there was insufficient evidence from which a jury could find the requisite intent element,” the ruling stated. “We disagree.”
Sleigh, in recent filings, contended that the new information from the internal affairs report weakened the state’s case against his client, leading to his request to strike that order.
Rutland County State’s Attorney Ian Sullivan, however, argued in recent filings against Sleigh’s request for Rheaume’s release. According to Sullivan, the report’s findings do not change that it was Rheaume who was driving the truck that struck and killed Ebbighausen.
Sullivan declined comment on the judge’s latest ruling on Monday.
No trial date has been set in the case, though court filings state that the attorneys are to be “trial ready” by April.

Dec. 15, 2025. (Courtesy of Nebraska Department of Correctional Services)LINCOLN — A legislative bill introduced Monday seeks to void a Nebraska-federal deal that last fall converted a rehabilitative-focused state prison to an ICE detention facility in McCook.
Legislative Bill 963, from State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha, seeks to void any state-federal immigration agreements without legislative approval. That would include the most high-profile case in which Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen and the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services agreed to lease the state’s “Work Ethic Camp” to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
McKinney’s bill also seeks to narrow state law and say the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services can house offenders under only state laws, not any “law.” A Red Willow County District Court judge cited that section of law as a reason to not halt the Nebraska-ICE partnership.
“The executive branch does not have that autonomy and should not have signed our state up to have an ICE detention facility,” McKinney said.

Pillen has argued he’s doing his duty to help the federal government enforce immigration laws and, in a pre-session interview in mid-December, repeated “very clearly we have the authority.” He said there is “evidence every day,” including his four trips to the U.S.-Mexico border, which together highlight what he called a “safety problem.”
“We’re proud about it,” Pillen said. “We’re doing what we have the authority to do.”
Pillen called safety the government’s “highest calling.” He described Rob Jeffreys, director of Nebraska’s Corrections Department, as “one of the best directors” in the country. 
The Nebraska-ICE contract is in effect through at least September. Pillen’s office has estimated ICE’s reimbursements will annually net the state $14.25 million.
McKinney argued the state should not be giving up an institution specifically meant to prepare offenders to reenter society. The McCook prison had housed low-risk adult male inmates serving felony sentences. Some worked in surrounding communities.

The North Omaha senator said the McCook situation highlights a “lack of respect” toward the Legislature, the “crumbling” of separation of powers and “blurring of the lines.” 
State Sen. Dunixi Guereca of Omaha also introduced LB 881 last week, which would also require local law enforcement agencies, jails and the Nebraska State Patrol to receive approval from a “local governing body” before entering certain agreements to enforce immigration law.
Sheriff’s offices in Banner, Dakota, Sioux and Wheeler counties, as well as the Nebraska Corrections Department and Nebraska State Patrol, have joined what’s known as the 287(g) Program to that end. The Dakota County and Corrections Department, specifically in Lincoln County, signed agreements to allow officers to identify and process removable migrants. The other four signed agreements to enforce limited immigration authority in routine police duties.
Pillen said he remained confident he didn’t need legislation to authorize the McCook partnership. McKinney said any agreement could still be approved, just in a proper manner.
“If they wanted the authority to do so, they should have came to us in a respectful way,” McKinney said. “Shouldn’t have been, in my opinion, behind closed doors without all members of the body being notified and aware of what was going on.”

Jim Pillen will appoint a successor “as quickly as possible” for now-former University of Nebraska Regent Elizabeth O’Connor of Omaha, who resigned Friday as expected.
O’Connor announced Dec. 30 that she would resign at 11:59 p.m. last Friday. She submitted her resignation to Pillen’s office at 1:39 p.m. that day. Seven minutes later, she emailed the chair of the NU Board of Regents, Paul Kenney, and Pillen’s chief of staff, Dave Lopez, to confirm her resignation, according to records from NU and the Governor’s Office.
“While I will not remain a member of the board, I look forward to continuing to support the university and the work of the great State of Nebraska,” O’Connor said in her resignation letter.
In a one-sentence reply Monday, Pillen told O’Connor her resignation had been received. A spokesperson said the governor would seek to fill the vacancy “as quickly as possible.” State law requires an appointment within 45 days.

O’Connor, 35, is charged with one Class IIIA felony, driving drunk and causing serious bodily injury, related to a May 21 crash in east-central Omaha. That’s the same allegation outlined in an impeachment article filed last week against her. She was charged July 30.
The Nebraska Constitution bars felons from holding public office, and if O’Connor had been convicted, she would have been forced to leave office.
State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, who had introduced two resolutions to formally pursue impeaching O’Connor, filed motions Monday to withdraw them. They will be voted on Tuesday, essentially a formality. Kauth had worked with the father of the three young children injured in the crash. His mother-in-law sustained a broken back and pelvis.
“Pleased that she did it, disappointed it took so long,” Kauth said of O’Connor’s resignation.
O’Connor leaves after seven years as an elected regent. She was previously a student regent representing the University of Nebraska at Omaha. Her eastern Douglas County constituents reelected her to a second six-year term in November 2024, with 67% of the vote. 
Her tenure included four years serving alongside Pillen, who had been a regent from his hometown of Columbus for 10 years before becoming governor in 2023.

Pillen, a Republican, could appoint someone closer to his political preferences than O’Connor, a Democrat. The regents are officially nonpartisan with a previous 6-2 split, majority Republican.
Under state law, because O’Connor resigned before Feb. 1, there will be a special election this year. Pillen will appoint a successor through Jan. 7, 2027. 
Had O’Connor resigned on Feb. 1 or later, the special election wouldn’t have been until 2028. Pillen’s appointment would have stayed through Jan. 4, 2029.
O’Connor indicated to Kenney that she would spend Friday afternoon responding to constituents regarding the proposed $800 million deal for NU to buy out Clarkson Regional Health Services’ share of NU-Clarkson Nebraska Medicine partnership and related Clarkson-area properties. 
Nebraska Medicine is the hospital and clinical and medical services partner of the University of Nebraska Medical Center. The Nebraska Medicine board opposes the deal.
Regents were initially set to meet Friday to discuss Nebraska Medicine — it was unclear if O’Connor would attend or if her vote would be a deciding one — but delayed the meeting to Thursday.
Kauth said she’s glad O’Connor won’t have a say in such a major decision.

(Screenshot from video by Monica Bicking.) A U.S. Border Patrol agent kneed a man at least five times in the face while several other agents held him pinned facedown on the pavement in south Minneapolis on Friday, according to multiple witnesses who shared videos with the Reformer.
Yarrow Tkachuk-Kedziora, a Minneapolis resident, heard a horn blaring and looked out a second-floor window onto Chicago Avenue near 24th Street. They saw a black Chevrolet Suburban driven by a U.S. Border Patrol agent going the wrong way and then hit a gray Buick Encore head on.
An agent then jumped out of the Suburban, smashed in the driver’s window of the Encore and pulled the driver out of the car.
“It was almost faster than I could process,” Tkachuk-Kedziora said. “They took a baton out and smashed it in … and immediately, from what I could tell, started beating him.”
Monica Bicking was at work as a nurse at a nearby homeless shelter when she heard residents and staff yelling ICE was outside.
She ran out and started recording. Her video shows five Border Patrol agents on top of a man in the middle of Chicago Avenue.

One officer knees the man in the head at least five times as he cries out in pain. Bicking can be heard in the video yelling, “Stop kneeing him in the face! That’s his face! Stop it!”
“It was completely unnecessary and uncalled for,” Bicking said in an interview.
Then a masked agent with a vest reading “Border Patrol Federal Agent” approaches Bicking and tells her to back up or she’ll be arrested.
Three officers then pick up the man and carry him to the back of the Chevy — parked the wrong way, front-to-front with the man’s Buick.
On the video, bystanders who have come out to film the scene ask the injured man what his name is, and he replies over blaring whistles, “Juan Carlos. Juan Carlos,” as an agent tells him, “Get in the f*cking car.”
A GoFundMe set up for the man says he is a U.S. resident and was observing ICE activity when he was stopped. He was detained at the Whipple Federal Building before being transported to the hospital for medical treatment because he was having trouble breathing.
The Reformer has not verified the man’s identity, but received a copy of the car’s purchase contract for a man with the first and middle names Juan Carlos.
The Department of Homeland Security did not return emails seeking information about the incident.
The man stayed in the back of the Suburban as a Border Patrol agent moved the man’s car to the side of the road and another spoke with the driver of a black pick-up truck who had rear-ended the detained man, according to video shared by Charles Karter, another witness.
Karter’s video shows one agent holding what appears to be a can of chemical irritant, telling observers to back up.
The Trump administration has sent hundreds of immigration officers to Minnesota in the past week, following a few hundred back in December. They’ve been met with stiff resistance from anti-ICE activists, who are following federal officers and filming them while blowing whistles to warn their neighbors. The situation has intensified since last week, when federal officer Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Good in her vehicle.
Attorney General Keith Ellison filed a lawsuit on Monday on behalf of the state of Minnesota with the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul seeking an end to the unprecedented surge of federal agents and officers.
The suit argues agents have acted unlawfully since their arrival in December by arresting and using force against innocent bystanders; pointing firearms against people who pose no threat; and carrying out enforcement actions at schools, churches and hospitals.
Tkachuk-Kedziora said they’re still stunned by what they saw.
“Since seeing that I do feel like I am in an occupied zone,” Tkachuk-Kedziora said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-4.48.45 PM.png,,,2026-01-12 18:11:41.199357

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)A bill inserting further medical evaluation into cases of suspected child abuse received unanimous support in its first committee stop Monday.
The Senate Children, Families, and Elder Affairs committee approved SB 42, sponsored by Sen. Barbara Sharief.
The bill would provide more time and opportunity for medical evaluations and second opinions when medical conditions such as Rickets, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, or Vitamin D deficiency could explain away otherwise concerning signs of child abuse, before parents are arrested.
“There are cases where legitimate medical conditions, particularly rare or complex diagnoses, can be mistaken for abuse. When that happens, families may experience unnecessary trauma and children may face disruption that could’ve been avoided with the right medical expertise at the right time. This bill is about ensuring that medical complexity is met with medical knowledge while continuing to prioritize child safety,” Sharief said.
The bill, according to the Senate Democratic office, “focuses on improving medical accuracy and fairness in cases involving children with complex or rare medical conditions, while maintaining strong protection for child safety.”
In 2025, the bill passed the Senate unanimously but did not receive a vote in the House despite passing two committees. 
The House companion is HB 47.
Sharief, a Democrat from Miramar, and Rep. Robin Bartleman, a Democrat from Weston, presented the bill Monday in a news conference, too. Rep. Patt Maney, a Republican from Shalimar, is a prime cosponsor.
Bartleman said similar bills in other states have passed and that Florida is “behind the 8-ball.”
Parents may allege “pre-existing diagnosis of Rickets, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Osteogenesis Imperfecta, Vitamin D deficiency, or any other medical condition known to appear to be caused by, or know to be misdiagnosed as, abuse,” triggering examinations.
The bill does not grant a second opinion examination “as to whether the child has been sexually abused.”
Twins
Michael and Tasha Patterson from Broward County made the trip to the Capitol Monday to share their story. 
They are parents of three-year-old twins, born prematurely and delivered by emergency c-section, who were home for about seven weeks after birth before being separated from their parents. 
After being released from the neonatal intensive care unit, they returned to a doctor’s office eight-10 times in the first weeks of their lives, Tasha said. In the last visit to the emergency room, providers found injuries on one twin, resulting in child abuse allegations. And later, the remaining twin was found to have fractures “everywhere.”
Tasha said Michael’s son, a third child in the family but not biologically hers, has no injuries.
The twins continued suffering injuries after Tasha and Michael lost full custody, she said. 
Michael and Tasha have supervised visitation with the children, visiting them four a few hours per week, but she said the state is trying to have the twins adopted, she said. 
Their twins were diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos syndrome, “caused by genetic changes that affect connective tissue,” according to the Ehlers-Danlos Society, and metabolic bone disease, Tasha said, and preventative care now has her twins “flourishing.”
“It puts you in a position where it makes you feel insecure for something you didn’t do,” Tasha said. “But I also know that I’m a Christian and I believe God has a purpose for everything and I do believe we will get our children back and in the process of it we’ll be able to make changes for other families as well,” Tasha said.

,DC,2026-01-12 23:08:57+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Federal judge grants Rhode Island wind company reprieve from Trump pause,"Ariana Figueroa, Nancy Lavin",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-judge-grants-rhode-island-wind-company-reprieve-trump-pause,,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge gave a temporary greenlight Monday to a mostly constructed $5 billion Revolution Wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island, reversing a late December order from the Trump administration that halted work.Judge Royce C. Lamberth rejected the Trump administration’s national security arguments, finding they didn’t provide “a sufficient explanation” for issuing a Dec. 22 stop-work order on Revolution Wind, the planned 65-turbine project. He found the entire 704-megawatt project would be imperiled if he did not order work to resume and issued a preliminary injunction to block the administration’s pause.Lamberth was nominated by former President Ronald Reagan.The project is one of several wind energy producers that, along with state officials, filed a suit in District of Columbia federal court after the Interior Department last month issued a new stop-work order that halted several projects off the coasts of Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Virginia and New York.“We refuse to accept this Administration’s unlawful attempts to hinder progress on the Revolution Wind project, and today’s legal victory reaffirms that we are right on the law,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement after the preliminary injunction was granted. “The law takes precedent over the political whims of one man, and we will continue to fight to make sure that remains the case.”Janice M. Schneider, one of the attorneys representing Revolution Wind, said during a Monday hearing the stop-work order was costing the company $1.44 million per day for a project that is 87% complete. The administration first ordered work on the project stopped last year, but a Lambreth order in September unpaused it. The Interior Department then froze the project again in December, based on an analysis that found “the movement of massive turbine blades and the highly reflective towers create radar interference,” posing a national security risk. Peter Torstensen, an attorney for the Trump administration, said the national security issues should outweigh any monetary harms that Revolution Wind would incur. Questioning motiveSchneider noted President Donald Trump’s comment to oil executives last week, following U.S. military operations in Venezuela, that no new wind turbines would be built in the U.S. “We do think that this court should be skeptical of the government’s motive,” Schneider said of Trump’s recent comments. “It is clear the administration's goal is to not let any windmills be built.”Torstensen said the concerns from the administration stemmed from national security, and that the stop-work order was issued to provide a time to “have that discussion.”Lamberth said he didn’t understand that reasoning.“You want to stop everything in place…while you figure out what to do?” Lamberth asked Torstensen.Torstensen answered that the pause was to review the national security concerns.Project at stakeSchneider added that if a preliminary injunction was not granted Monday, then Revolution Wind would be at risk of breaching a contract with Rhode Island Energy, the state’s primary utility company.Schneider said the company has a short lease on specialty vessels needed to transport the towering seven turbines out to sea. The specific boat under contract, the Wind Scylla, is only available until Feb. 22, and needs 41 days to transport the remaining seven turbines, she said.Even after the skyscraper-sized foundations are anchored to the foundations in the seafloor, developers still need “months and months and months and months” of testing in limited capacity to meet the January 2027 deadline to supply power to Rhode Island, Schneider said.That deadline is also critical to New England residents who rely on an infusion of wind-powered electricity to boost supply and lower cost for energy, especially in winter months when fuel is limited and expensive, Sarah Rice, Rhode Island assistant attorney general, said during Monday’s hearing. “We’re talking about millions of dollars in increased electricity costs in the region,” Rice said, adding that residents would see a $31 million increase in electricity costs every 90 days the project is delayed. Rhode Island and Connecticut’s state decarbonization mandates also rely on the 704 megawatts of nameplate capacity the project will generate at full operations — enough to power 350,000 homes across both states.“It’s about people being able to turn on their heat in the winter,” Rice said.In Lamberth’s order from the bench granting the preliminary injunction, he acknowledged that tight window, and found that Revolution Wind is likely to face irreparable harm. “If Revolution Wind cannot meet certain benchmarks, the whole project could collapse,” he said.",,,,2026-01-12 18:11:41.199357

Moreno is the second woman — after outgoing Mayor LaToya Cantrell — and the first Hispanic mayor to lead the city.
Moreno was joined by former Vice President Kamala Harris, who administered the oath of office to the mayor after giving a short speech, where she described Moreno as “talented but tough.”
“She believes in fairness and in the simple yet fundamental principle that elected leaders must be accountable to the people they serve,” Harris said. “Helena, I know you will be a mayor who will lead with integrity, with courage and with the people of New Orleans always at the center of your work.”
In her inaugural address, Moreno lauded the virtues of faith, hope and love in her work to serve and lead the city.

“This is our time to build that functional city that we all deserve together,” Moreno said. “We will build a New Orleans that is safe, where we can drive down the street without busting up the car, where there is no limit to realizing a dream, and where our children have endless opportunities for success, where our seniors live not in fear or uncertainty, but in dignity and insecurity. We want a New Orleans that works for everyone.”
The seven members of the New City Council — which will be led by two Black at-large councilmembers for the first time in the city’s history — were also sworn in at the ceremony, which featured music by The Soul Rebels and Trombone Shorty, among others, and included appearances by beloved local chef Emeril Lagasse and local philanthropist and New Orleans Saints and Pelicans owner Gayle Benson, as well as a host of local, state and federal politicians, including Cantrell.
The inauguration ceremony caps off a weekend of celebrations, which included a festival at Lafayette Square and a mass at St. Louis Cathedral. The Crescent City Connection bridge and the Superdome were also adorned in blue and gold lights — Moreno’s campaign colors — over the weekend. Moreno’s transition team will lead a day of service on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, after weather concerns delayed an initial plan to do it Saturday.

Monday’s ceremony seemed designed to showcase her diverse political coalition and breadth of relationships by including prominent Republicans such as U.S. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Louisiana state Senate President Cameron Henry alongside local Democratic heavyweights such U.S. House Rep. Troy Carter and state Sen. Jimmy Harris in the ceremony.
“Let’s face it, these are complicated and troubling times; conflict and division are all around us,” Moreno said. “Some will continue to try to divide us, but we must choose to come together for our future. Today, you’ve seen local, state and federal leaders on all sides of politics come together to support the future of our exceptional city. We have more in common than divides us.”
Despite the optimism on display at Monday’s ceremony, Moreno will assume office under stormy conditions.
The city faces a projected $220 million deficit this year. To cover the deficit, Moreno, along with outgoing District A councilmember and incoming Chief Administrative Officer Joe Giarrusso, have clawed back $14.7 million in American Rescue Plan Act dollars, called for the furloughing of approximately 700 city employees and handed out pink slips to dozens of employees.
The latest round of layoffs, which included cuts to the Office of Resilience and Sustainability, caused a stir last week. Employees say they had previously been told they would still have a job in the Moreno administration by aides close to the mayor, according to recently fired employees who spoke to Verite News. A Moreno spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the firings.
Many of the other cuts came from subdepartments of the mayor’s office, including the Office of Youth and Families and the Office of Criminal Justice Coordination, which were both shuttered altogether.
Those employees were “unclassified” political appointees, meaning they are not covered by the city’s civil service system. Many such appointees enjoy higher salaries and quicker hiring processes than classified civil service workers. But unlike civil service workers, they are “at-will” employees who serve at the pleasure of the mayor and can be fired without cause or an appeals process.
On Monday morning, shortly after the inauguration concluded, the Office of Youth and Families sent out an email thanking the people of New Orleans for their support of the office as it closes.
“As our dedicated staff steps away from this work, we do so with pride in what we have built together,” the email read. “While we will no longer be here, our commitment to the wellbeing of children, youth, and families continues through the City of New Orleans Health Department, where this work will carry forward.”

Amanda Fallis, the president of the city workers’ union AFSCME Local 2349, said that the union has been in talks with Moreno and Giarrusso about furloughs and layoffs — and that union officials would meet with Moreno again tomorrow (Jan. 13) on her second day in office.
“AFSCME Local 2349 has greatly appreciated Mayor Moreno and CAO Giarrusso and their teams’ willingness to meet with us, even before officially being sworn into office,” Fallis said. “We look forward to partnering with them to follow the terms of our collective bargaining agreement regarding 45 days notice from City administration regarding any layoffs of classified employees, probationary or not.”
Despite the slew of challenges facing Moreno, she sounded a hopeful note in her inaugural address.
“We know that things are not exactly where we want them to be today, and we know that it’s not going to be easy to fix these things, but just because things are hard does not mean that they’re impossible,” she said. “We stand here on a turning point as we face challenging times, and we must be clear that failure is not an option. Not anymore. There’s just too much at stake.”

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo / New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey lawmakers approved a bill Monday that would add more than $128 million in new spending, despite criticism from Republican legislators that their Democratic colleagues sidestepped the scrutiny that normally accompanies such budget requests.
Two legislative panels passed the bill at the tail end of hourslong committee hearings Thursday, without inviting public comment. On Monday, several Assembly Republicans blasted that process as a failure of transparency and accountability.
NJ Senate confirms final 16 judges of Gov. Murphy’s tenure

The state holds five months of budget hearings and hears from hundreds of experts, advocates, and others to decide how to spend taxpayer funds every year, Assemblywoman Aura Dunn (R-Morris) said. Yet the Legislature’s Democratic majority introduced and passed this additional funding in less than a week, with no public scrutiny, Dunn noted.
“We tell residents that their voices matter. But what happened this week tells a very different story,” Dunn said.
The bill was one of several that lawmakers passed that will cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars in new spending and tax breaks, prompting objections from several GOP legislators in the Assembly. There was no debate in the Senate.
The bill includes $20 million to the FIFA World Cup host committee for promotions (first lady Tammy Murphy chairs the committee’s board of directors), $25 million for a state supercomputer, $13 million for a new jail in Camden County, and other funding for food insecurity research and capital improvements at county buildings, schools, and a hospital, among other things.
When these types of specific spending requests are added to the state budget, they are often derided as “Christmas tree” items.

Assemblyman Brian Rumpf (R-Ocean) urged his colleagues to reject the bills, saying fiscal caution was needed because of a state budget deficit, federal cuts, and other budget stressors.
“I thought Christmas was over,” Rumpf said.
Both chambers passed the bill largely along party lines, with a vote of 46-25 in the Assembly and 25-14 in the Senate. Murphy, who leaves office Jan. 20, must sign the bill for it to become law.
It was sponsored by Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) and Assemblywoman Eliana Pintor Marin (D-Essex), the lower chamber’s Democratic budget officer.
The new spending comes six months after New Jersey lawmakers approved a record-high $58.8 billion budget that included a number of cuts and controversial diversions that have spurred ongoing protests and calls for restored funding. That budget also included over $700 million for lawmakers’ pet projects that critics have condemned as pork spending, even though Murphy had warned federal cuts would require “hard decisions.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen)Bering Straits Native Corporation faces criticism from shareholders regarding the corporation’s involvement in federal contracts to aid in the detention and removal of asylum seekers, illegal immigrants and migrants.
BSNC has in the past ten years secured lucrative contracts with the federal government, specifically the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to perform service related to migrant detention and removal.
Since the second Trump administration’s aggressive policies to round up and deport migrants and asylum seekers, the Native corporation’s participation in business contracts with DHS and ICE has come under renewed scrutiny by shareholders.
BSNC shareholders Charlene Aqpik Apok, Ayyu Qassataq and Jessica Saniguq Ullrich have publicly criticized that BSNC’s business strategy runs counter to the values that are supposed to guide the corporation. They penned an op-ed published in the Anchorage Daily News and drafted a petition that was circulated online and had garnered as of early December 102 signatures from shareholders and descendants, and 20 signatures from non-shareholders. They submitted the petition and the signatures to the BSNC board of directors prior to their December board meeting. The petitioners say additional signatures are being compiled with the intent to send an updated list, likely in January.
The petition

	
The petition calls on BSNC to divest from all business contracts associated in any way with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers immediately. It states, “As BSNC shareholders and descendants, we are deeply concerned about BSNC’s complicity in inflicting harm on Indigenous peoples through ICE detention facilities.”
The petition says that these detention centers “go against ancestral values of responsibility, human dignity, and respect. This line of business is an unjust investment on many levels, including adjacency to work that co-signs ICE methods including lack of due process for detainment, incarceration and rampant mistreatment of thousands of Indigenous relatives from Central and South America.”
The petition also reports that a BSNC descendant was recently stopped by ICE agents in Anchorage, Alaska and had he not produced ID, may have otherwise been hauled away and recounts Ullrich’s witnessing the detention of a worker who had been working legally in the country.
Ullrich witnessed the ICE arrest in front of her doorsteps last fall. She recounted the situation to the Nugget in an interview, saying she had hired contractors to work on countertops. As they pulled up to her house, she heard yelling outside. She saw the contractor van and two unmarked cars with police lights. “I had a feeling that it was ICE and started to go out and video it. And saw them bring one young man back in cuffs and put him in the unmarked car, and that’s when I asked, ‘Are you an ICE agent?’ And the man responded, ‘yes.’”
The man in handcuffs was detained and later deported.
This scene occurred the day before the BSNC annual shareholder meeting in Anchorage and Ullrich became aware of BSNC’s involvement in ICE contracts.
“These government sponsored actions are reminiscent of intergenerational traumas that we are still recovering from as a broader community,” states the petition. “Our Alaska Native community knows intimately the devastation that government-sanctioned separation of families and physical/mental violence causes to people, families and communities for generations. Boarding school survivors still live amongst us – and every single Native person in and from our region has been affected in some way by this violent assimilation era. To be complicit in inflicting these harms on other Indigenous people is unconscionable.”
Ullrich addressed the plenum at the annual shareholder meeting and although there was no response to her concerns, another comment elicited the response by BSNC CEO Dan Graham, who maintained that the business is conducted with utmost care and compassion.
Ayyu Qassataq ran for a seat on the BSNC board of directors and in her campaign highlighted the not very widely known issue of BSNC’s business with ICE. “After publishing our petition with its links to relevant news stories, we received many comments on social media and within the petition itself that made it clear that many shareholders, descendants and community members were horrified to learn that our corporation was involved with ICE in this way,” she said.
In her campaign video, she made clear that she would advocate for a change in direction.
“The way our Native corporations operate should be an extension of the values we carry as Native peoples. The work they do should amplify and reflect the relational power and knowledge that is embedded within our own cultures,” said Qassataq in an interview with the Nugget. She added that there’s a lack of transparency where individual board members stand on any given issue. “There are no opportunities made for people who are running for the board to express what they where they stand on different issues. So, there’s a complete lack of transparency at pretty much every level,” she said.
The business of migrant detention and removal

	
Several Native corporations in Alaska are engaged in ICE contracts, including NANA’s Akima division and BSNC through its subsidiaries. The corporations can secure government contracts thanks to a set-aside contract initiative administered through the Small Business Administration, the so-called 8(a) contracts, to help small businesses and what the federal government describes as “socially and economically disadvantaged” communities, including Alaska Native corporations.
An analysis of the publicly available contract documents reveals that BSNC over the last decade had a revenue of approximately $587 million from these ICE and Homeland security contracts. What is not clear is how much this revenue translates into profit.
In the latest BSNC Annual Report, Board President Cindy Massie reports that “2024 was a landmark year for our financial performance. BSNC achieved gross annual revenues of nearly $799 million, up 21% from the previous year.”
The report lists a total revenue of $122.7 million made in fiscal year 2024 from their Security Services division but does not spell out the money made from ICE or Homeland Security contracts. “These services typically include providing security personnel, surveillance, and related protective measures to ensure the safety and security of government facilities and operations,” reads the report.
The only reference to DHS and ICE work is found at BSNC’s job portal, where a plethora of jobs are advertised, including ICE related work as janitors at El Paso, detention officers at El Paso and Pecos, TX and armed transportation officers for DHS and ICE in Newark, NJ and Sykesville, MD.
On the website, BSNC also states its corporate values: “Our values arise from the culture of Our People. We honor our commitments. We empower one another. We respect diversity. We lead with responsibility.”
According to the federal procurement data system, BSNC subsidiaries Paragon Professional Services LLC, Global Precisions Systems LLC and Bering Straits Professional Service have or had several contracts with ICE and DHS.
Paragon Professional Services LLC branched out from providing environmental professional services to the migrant detention business connected to ICE. Paragon has and had contracts for detention, guard and transportation at El Paso Service Processing Center and to supply frozen meals; for transportation and guard services for the Baltimore, Maryland area of responsibility; for “transportation and guard services for the Enforcement and Removal Operations, NYC Area of Responsibility to achieve the ICE mission to safely transport detained aliens,” and to provide transportation and guard services at the Newark, NJ  detention facility.
Another BSNC subsidiary, Global Precisions Systems LLC, shows in the federal data base 230 so-called task orders – contracts and modified contracts – with ICE, stretching back to 2015 including facility support services at detention centers in El Centro, California, El Paso, Texas and Baltimore, Maryland for operation and maintenance of ICE facilities, armed guards and transportation services, and food for the El Paso detention center.
Bering Straits Professional Services LLC also bid on ICE related contracts. Last year, the subsidiary protested a decision by the government to award a contract for detention management, transportation and food services to Akima Infrastructure Protection LLC, a NANA subsidiary, and at the Krome Processing Center in Miami, Florida. Akima has managed the Krome facility for a decade and has a contract for Migrant Operations Center Services at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
According to a Government Accountability Office decision, the protest that Bering Straits Professional Services lodged, was denied. Among other points, the agency found that BSPS did not understand its role the process of screening migrants’ credible fear in their asylum requests.
According to an Amnesty International report, compiled in September 2025 after visits to the Krome detention facility and the Florida state-owned facility cruelly nicknamed “Alligator Alcatraz,” detention conditions at both facilities amount to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.
“The use of prolonged solitary confinement at Krome and the use of the ‘box’ at “Alligator Alcatraz” amount to torture or other ill-treatment,” reads the report.
A 2021 news story in the El Paso Matters online newspaper detailed allegations of sexual assaults by guards, medical neglect, hunger strikes and letter writing campaigns that sought to change the dire conditions at the facility, for which the BSNC subsidiary Global Precision Systems holds ICE contracts.
According to the petition, BSNC board members toured the El Paso detention center.
BNSC response

	
Marleanna Hall, Director of External Affairs and Public Relations with BSNC responded to a list of detailed questions from the Nugget. “BSNC is a diversified corporation that operates across a broad range of industries, including construction, environmental services, professional services, logistics, and security support,” she wrote in an email response.
“Like many Alaska Native corporations, BSNC participates in federal contracting as a means of creating employment opportunities, generating revenue to support shareholder benefits, and strengthening the long-term sustainability of the corporation.
“BSNC does not comment on details of contracts that our companies perform, our communications with shareholders, customers, or internal communications.”
Asked if the leadership has responded to the shareholders petition and concerns, she wrote, “Responses to any inquiries from shareholders will be evaluated in due course to provide the best outcome for our shareholders, customers, partners, and community.”
Elsewhere, tribes divest

	
Other Native entities have made recent headlines divesting from business involvement associated with migrant detention or deportation.
According to Native News Online report, the Oneida Nation’s Business Committee, after learning of two federal contracts worth $6 million providing services to ICE, passed a resolution requiring all tribal entities to disengage from any contracts or agreements involving ICE. One contract involved the El Paso, TX detention center. The Oneida Nation said the decision was guided by the Nation’s “Good Mind Principles,” which emphasize ethical responsibility and alignment with community values.
Another tribe, the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation even went as so far as to fire their senior executives over ICE contracts. According to a December 18, 2025 report in the Kansas Reflector, the chairman of the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation Tribal Council Joseph Rupnick said the Nation and its subsidiaries have fully separated from a contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He drew parallels between immigrant detention and America’s history of forced removal of Native Americans. Some members of the tribe’s leadership were part of the company that contracted with ICE, KBP Services, and were subsequently fired for their involvement.
Back in Alaska, Jessica Saniguq Ullrich said that “Our ultimate goal and hope is that our corporation, is aligning with our ancestral values and engaging in businesses and investments that are ethical and moral according to our way of being in our way of life.”

The town hall is part of a statewide initiative called Court Connect, which is “aimed at strengthening public trust in the courts, expanding access to justice, and increasing awareness of court resources and services,” according to a news release judiciary officials issued Monday.
“This free, public event offers community members a chance to engage directly with Judiciary representatives in an informal, welcoming setting,” the release said.

The town hall comes ahead of a legislative session set to begin next week, during which the Republican-controlled Utah Legislature is expected to debate a slew of bills aimed at the judiciary, including one to expand the Utah Supreme Court. Tensions between the judiciary and lawmakers are high after a series of court rulings that have upset lawmakers, especially regarding redistricting and the Legislature’s ability to change voter-approved ballot initiatives. 
The Court Connect town halls are meant to “open doors and build stronger connections between the courts and the communities they serve,” judiciary officials said. “They offer the public an opportunity to learn more about the role of the Judiciary, how the courts operate, and how the judicial branch fits into the broader system of government.”
During the town hall, attendees can learn about the role of the courts in Utah’s justice system, ask questions and interface directly with judiciary representatives, and meet with judges and other court personnel in a less formal setting, outside the courtroom. 
Attendees can also learn how to access justice services, including self-help resources, online filing systems, and court resources that are available in their communities.

Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, underwent an outpatient operation on Friday after breaking her wrist in a fall days earlier.
The congresswoman fractured her right wrist after falling at a CVS on Sunday, Jan. 4. She got a temporary cast that night and scheduled the procedure for later that week.
Dr. Kevin O’Malley treated DeLauro, 82, at MedStar Health Medical Center at Brandywine in Brandywine, Md., on Friday morning. It was an outpatient procedure that lasted for 90 minutes, and she left the center shortly after it was done.
A spokesperson at her office said she’s expected to make a full recovery and have full mobility in her wrist.
“Congresswoman DeLauro received a routine, brief outpatient operation on her wrist on Friday morning at 9 a.m. to address a recent fracture. The operation was a success, and her wrist is expected to fully heal,” DeLauro spokesperson King Green said in a statement provided to the Connecticut Mirror on Monday.
DeLauro has continued to work since the operation. She began Monday at an event in New Haven. The U.S. House was set to hold the first votes of the week in the evening.
Wearing a cast on her right wrist, DeLauro attended a press conference about the Trump administration’s cancellation of Full-Service Community Schools grants. Schools in New Haven, Waterbury, and Hartford lost those federal funds at the end of 2025.
As the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, DeLauro is in the middle of negotiating and trying to pass the remaining full-year spending bills to fund the rest of the federal government before the Jan. 30 deadline.
Her committee released another spending package Sunday in fiscal year 2026 funding for the State Department, Treasury Department, the IRS, the federal judiciary and some other agencies.
Last summer, DeLauro went for surgery to treat spinal stenosis while Congress was on its month-long August recess. The surgery was successful, and she went to physical therapy after the procedure. She returned to Washington, D.C., after Labor Day when Congress came back into session.
The Mayo Clinic describes spinal stenosis as a condition where the spaces in the backbone are too small. It is a more common diagnosis in people who are over 50.
DeLauro is running for reelection in November’s midterm elections, seeking her 19th term to serve Connecticut’s 3rd Congressional District based in her hometown of New Haven.

(Photo via Google Earth)A West Branch nursing home that has faced allegations of sexual assault and contributing to a resident’s death has been cited for 16 regulatory violations covering a wide range of recurring problems, from staffing shortages to infection control.
The Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing has proposed, but held in suspension, more than $16,000 in state fines against Crestview Specialty Care, a 65-bed nursing home that is part of the Iowa-based chain Care Initiatives. The department typically holds state fines in suspension while the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services determines whether a federal penalty is warranted.
The violations cited by DIAL include insufficient nursing staff; failure to provide the required nursing services for residents; hazards in the building; failure to protect residents’ rights; failure to provide a safe, clean, homelike environment; inadequate quality of care; failure to treat and prevent pressure sores, and inadequate infection control.
Of the suspended state fines, $10,000 is tied to the failure to treat and prevent the pressure sores of two different residents, while $6,750 is tied to the failure to assess and follow physicians’ orders for wound treatment.
Although DIAL’s database of care-facility fines indicates the proposed state fines total $16,750, the agency’s written citation indicates an additional $8,000 in fines was proposed and held in suspension due to three residents of the home falling out of the mechanical lifts used to transport residents in and out of bed. One of the three sustained a head injury, a bone fracture at the base of the spine and a leg fracture, according to inspectors.
Seven complaints, all substantiated 
State records indicate the inspection was precipitated by seven separate complaints that required investigation. All of the complaints were substantiated in that inspectors cited the home for specific violations related to each of the complainants’ allegations.
Regarding the allegations of too few staff, which is widely considered to be the single biggest contributor to poor quality care, inspectors reported that employees of the home openly acknowledged the issue.
Inspectors reported that one certified nursing assistant told them the homes did “not have enough staff scheduled on a routine basis.” As a result, she said, employees were not able to provide residents with all of the care they needed, according to inspectors’ reports. “It has been brought to management’s attention numerous times and nothing changes,” the aide allegedly told inspectors.
A registered nurse at the home told inspectors there was “definitely a lack of staff working at the facility at any given time,” adding that she had, on numerous occasions, informed the home’s director of nursing that residents’ needs weren’t being met but had never noticed any difference in the subsequent staffing levels, according to inspectors’ reports.
During the inspection itself, inspectors reported, a licensed practical nurse told them she had been unable to complete that morning’s treatment of residents’ wounds due to the fact that no medication aide had been scheduled to dispense the residents’ prescribed medications.
Another CNA reported that during the evening shift, she was often the only aide assigned to a hall that had 25 residents, despite the fact that some of the residents could only be transferred in and out of bed with the assistance of two or more employees to guard against injuries, according to inspectors’ reports.
On some occasions, she alleged, there weren’t enough employees on duty to get residents to the dining room for supper, so all of the residents were sent trays of food to eat in their rooms.
State records indicate that during Crestview Specialty Care’s last annual inspection, in November 2024, it was cited for some of the same violations, including insufficient nursing staff, failure to treat pressure sores and failure to provide the required nursing services for residents.
That year, Crestview Specialty Care was cited by inspectors for failing to accurately assess residents’ condition and provide medical intervention when necessary. As a result, the inspectors alleged, a resident suffered worsening gastrointestinal issues — which included stomach aches and vomiting – for four days until he was transferred to a hospital emergency room, where he was intubated and three liters of bowel obstruction were suctioned from his stomach.
The hospital was unable to stabilize the resident, who died within six hours of arriving in the emergency room.
Sexual assault lawsuit focuses on staffing
Currently, the family of the late Ruth Bartow is suing Crestview and Care Initiatives in Cedar County District Court. The lawsuit alleges that Bartow was admitted to Crestview in February 2023 with severe cognitive impairments, and that three months later, at 2:50 p.m. on April 5, the staff found an unauthorized male “visitor” in her room — 54-year-old Michael Beaver of West Branch.
Beaver was laying with Bartow in her bed “without any clothes on,” the lawsuit alleges. The Crestview staff escorted Beaver out of Bartow’s room to the front lobby and notified the police. Bartow was later found in her room crying, according to the lawsuit.
Beaver wasn’t criminally charged in the case as he was already subject to a civil commitment proceeding.
State inspectors later concluded Beaver had been seen walking around in the facility as early as 10:30 a.m. that day. At 11:10 a.m., and at 1 p.m., staffers noticed Beaver pushing Bartow in her wheelchair throughout the building but failed to intervene.
The lawsuit accuses Crestview and Care Initiatives of gross negligence and recklessness in the form of inadequate staffing, false advertising, and “inappropriately allocating excessive funds to itself, thereby draining the facility of the resources necessary to maintain sufficient and appropriately trained staff to supervise residents and prevent avoidable injuries.”
The lawsuit also seeks unspecified actual damages and punitive damages for breach of contract and dependent adult abuse.
Crestview and Care Initiatives have denied any wrongdoing and attempted to have the lawsuit dismissed due to the arbitration agreement Bartow’s guardian signed at the time of her admission. That agreement stipulates that any disputes over care issues are to be settled through private arbitration rather than through courtroom litigation.
Attorneys for Bartow’s family argued the arbitration agreement was part of 50 pages of admissions documents that were electronically signed in quick succession, with the arbitration agreement signed only 40 seconds after the admission agreement.
They also claimed the arbitration agreement was barred in cases such as theirs by the 2021 federal law known as the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act. Care Initiatives argued otherwise, saying the family’s claims were “based on an alleged failure to secure the premises — not a sexual assault.”
In May, Cedar County District Court Judge Elizabeth O’Donnell rejected Care Initiatives’ argument and found that the lawsuit revolved around a claim of sexual assault that wasn’t subject to mandatory arbitration.
A trial is now scheduled for May 17, 2027.

Daricka Moore, 24, pleaded not guilty Monday to three counts of capital murder, three counts of first-degree murder and other charges in the Friday shootings, local TV stations reported. He has been held at the Clay County jail since the weekend and was denied bond. A judge also ordered a mental health evaluation.
Before the court hearing, family members identified the girl as Mikiylia Guines, who is Moore’s second cousin. He is also accused of killing three other family members. 
During a Saturday press conference, Clay County Sheriff Eddie Scott said Moore tried to sexually assault someone at the address where the girl was killed, but did not specify who. One of the court affidavits lists Mikiylia as the victim of Moore’s attempted sexual assault. The sheriff was not immediately available for comment Monday. 
The capital murder charges are for the deaths of the 7-year-old, Barry Bradley and Samuel Bradley. Barry Bradley was a pastor of Apostolic Church of The Lord Jesus in Cedarbluff, which is located near the home where the men died.
In addition to murder and attempted sexual battery charges, Moore is charged with attempted murder of a child, burglary and two counts of taking a motor vehicle.

A motive for the shootings was not immediately known. 
Lashanna Guines, the girl’s mother, told WTVA-TV she saw her child die in front of her and the girl’s siblings. She is left to wonder if she could have done more to help. 
“And that’s weighing heavy on my heart, because, you know, it may have been more, what if I did this, and what if I did that?” Guines said. “It would have been, you know, a better outcome, but I just don’t know. I tried. I tried.”
Community members have come together to support families of the shooting victims. 
The United Way of the Golden Triangle Region established a Family Assistance Fund, and there is a GoFundMe to help Guines, Mikiylia’s mother. As of Monday, over $10,000 had been raised.
“Let’s rally as a community of families to support them through the loss of her baby girl,” Rene Guines-McMillian, who organized the fundraiser, wrote on the GoFundMe page. Guines-McMillian was not immediately available for comment Monday.
Scott, the sheriff, previously said his department had not dealt with Moore or responded to calls at the locations where the six people were killed.
Over the weekend, District Attorney Scott Colom said his office will consider the death penalty.
Friday evening, Moore allegedly shot his father Glenn Moore, 67; uncle Willie Guines, 55; and his brother Quinten Moore, 33, in the head at a home on David Hill Road, according to law enforcement. It’s the same home that is listed as Moore’s home address in court records. 
Moore took a Ford F150 belonging to his brother and drove it to the second scene on Blake Road where he broke into the house and tried to sexually assault the 7-year-old, according to authorities. He shot the girl in the head and tried to kill another child, according to the sheriff. 
From there, Moore allegedly went to a home on Siloam-Griffith Road, where investigators found the truck he had taken hidden behind the house. There, they found the bodies of Barry Bradley and Samuel Bradley, who also had been shot in the head, Scott said.  
Moore was arrested at a safety checkpoint about a half a mile from the second crime scene, Scott said.
This was the largest mass shooting in Mississippi since eight people were shot and killed in and near Brookhaven in 2017. Willie Godbolt, who was sentenced to death, shot his estranged wife and several of her family members and a Lincoln County sheriff’s deputy.

This story by Carla Occaso was first published in The Bridge on Jan. 11, 2026.
After a months-long process, the Montpelier City Council announced on Jan. 11 its choice of Kelly McNicholas Kury to be the next city manager of the city. McNicholas Kury, of Pitkin County, Colorado, is due to start Feb. 17. Meanwhile, Facilities and Sustainability Director Chris Lumbra is serving as acting city manager following the departure of former Acting City Manager Kelly Murphy, who filled the shoes of longtime City Manager Bill Fraser when he left this past summer.
McNicholas Kury emerged as one of the top candidates in December after a national recruitment process led by consultant Ian Coyle. The Montpelier City Council will formally approve her employment agreement on Wednesday, Jan. 14.
According to a press release issued Jan. 11, McNicholas Kury will lead a team of about 110 employees spread across nine departments. Appointed by the city council, the city manager is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations of the city, advising the city council on public policy, and ensuring that these policies are implemented professionally.
“Kelly McNicholas Kury brings a rare combination of strategic leadership, fiscal expertise, and deep commitment to community engagement,” said Montpelier Mayor Jack McCullough. “Her experience managing complex organizations and delivering results on critical issues such as housing, infrastructure, and economic resilience makes her exceptionally well-suited to lead Montpelier into its next chapter.”
A person with many years of experience in local government and public administration, McNicholas Kury brings expertise in strategic planning, fiscal stewardship, and community engagement, including 12 years in city and county government. Known for building trust-based relationships and translating public vision into measurable outcomes, she has played a central role in strengthening transparent, resilient, and forward-looking public institutions, the press release states.
“I am honored and excited to serve as Montpelier’s next city manager at such a pivotal time,” said McNicholas Kury. “I look forward to advancing the priorities of the council, staff, and community — including affordable housing, infrastructure, and economic vitality — so that together we can strengthen Montpelier now and into the future.”
Since joining Pitkin County, Colorado, in 2013, McNicholas Kury has steadily advanced into senior leadership roles and currently serves as county commissioner and chairwoman of the Board of County Commissioners. In the role, she provided strategic oversight of a $258 million annual budget, managing 375 employees across 27 departments, while aligning fiscal decisions with long-term strategic goals and statutory responsibilities.
As a county commissioner, she helped lead transformative initiatives, including development of a $1 billion, 30-year contract for the Aspen–Pitkin County Airport, passage and implementation of a $250 million affordable housing property tax, and advancement of policies addressing housing, childcare, climate resilience, public safety, infrastructure, land use, water resources and economic resiliency.
In addition to her elected service, she serves as executive director of the Roaring Fork Community Development Corporation, overseeing a $3 million budget focused on affordable housing preservation and infrastructure, including grant acquisition and construction project management.
McNicholas Kury holds a Master of Arts in international studies from the University of Denver and a Bachelor of Arts in anthropology from Cal Poly Humboldt. She is completing her Certified Public Manager credential through the University of Colorado Denver, with accreditation expected in Spring 2026.
The Montpelier city councilors unanimously voted to choose McNicholas Kury in an executive session held Dec. 17 but waited until Jan. 11 to make the announcement pending a final employment agreement, according to discussion during the council meeting Dec. 17.
The other finalist was Kelcey Young of California. Two other finalists, then Acting City Manager Kelly Murphy, and Woodstock City Manager Eric Duffy, dropped out of the race earlier in the process.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Senate Republicans unveiled their property tax plan Monday as the 2026 session began, saying the state’s system for collecting these local taxes must be rebuilt in order to lower costs for taxpayers.
Sen. Dan Dawson, R-Council Bluffs, and Senate Majority Leader Mike Klimesh, R-Spillville, held a news conference Monday to discuss Senate Study Bill 3001, Senate Republicans’ first legislative proposal of the year on how to change Iowa’s property tax system.
This proposal also involves changes to Iowa’s “rollback” system, similar to legislation brought up in 2025, alongside other changes Dawson said present ways to address the specific problems and concerns Iowans have brought up with the state’s property tax system.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“What we provide today in the Senate is a vision,” Dawson said. “And that vision is, that when valuation on your property — home — inflation goes up more than 2%, the rates automatically come down. It’s a vision that, permanently going forward, every homestead Iowan has a 50% taxable discount on their home. It’s a vision that we want good quality roads and bridges — we heard that loud and clear from our constituents over the interim. And finally, it’s a vision that ultimately, when you pay off your home at a certain age of life, you have to be able to own your home.”
Dawson chairs the Senate Ways and Means Committee, which deals with tax legislation. Last year he and Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, his House counterpart who is now House majority leader, introduced legislation on Iowa’s property tax system. They proposed eliminating the state’s current system of calculating property taxes that limits taxation to a portion of a residential property’s value, known as “rollback,” in favor of a “revenue-restricted” system to limit levy rate growth. Though there were several versions of this proposal discussed, the measure failed to advance to a vote in either chamber.
Dawson said “what you see here is actually really continuation of last year,” with several components of the 103-page bill coming out of discussions in 2025 on how to effectively change the state’s property tax system.
As eliminating the rollback would mean property taxes are calculated based on the full value of a residential property, the bill contains measures to offset this cost. It increases Iowa’s homestead tax credit to 50% of a home’s taxable value and eliminates property taxes for older Iowa homeowners, in addition to setting limits on how much levy rates can increase each year.
Dawson said compared to the 2025 proposal, this year’s legislation will provide local governments new tools to address the expected loss of property tax revenues in their budgets. It allows city and county governments to seek voter approval to increase the local option sales tax, as well as adding an inflation index to the state’s gas tax. Additionally, Dawson said the proposal will separate taxing systems for residential property owned by a homeowner living with their family in a property versus residential real estate being rented to others.
“I mean, we’re trying to propose a new taxation viewpoint here in the state, either you own property that your family lives in, or you own property for income, and those should be two entirely different taxing type of situations, right?” Dawson said. “What we find right now is that, you know, a normal household out there could be paying the same percentage of property tax — their taxable value because of the rollback — as to what’s the big corporations do out there. And that doesn’t make sense.”
Other tax proposals are likely
Senate Republicans’ proposal is unlikely to be the only plan considered on property taxes this year. Gov. Kim Reynolds has named property taxes as her top priority for her last term leading the state executive branch, and legislative leaders spoke Monday about their commitment to working to find ways to lower these costs for Iowans.
The governor and lawmakers spent several months in 2025 holding meetings with local governments and community leaders to craft a policy. But Reynolds has said Iowans should understand reductions in property taxes will come with reductions in local government services — though she said she and other leaders are working to find areas where certain services can be streamlined or combined to more efficiently use taxpayer funds.
The governor is expected to discuss property taxes alongside her other legislative priorities in her Condition of the State address Tuesday.
In his opening remarks, House Speaker Pat Grassley said the property tax discussions from last year will help shape the measures moved forward in 2026.
“Last session, we made good progress and got great feedback from Iowans and stakeholders on this issue,” Grassley said. “But rather than rush just to say we got something done, we decided to return to the table this session. For too long, certainty for the taxing entities has taken priority over certainty for the taxpayers. It’s time to put the taxpayers first once again.”
Iowa House Democrats also introduced a plan to lower property taxes last week. Their proposal would freeze property taxes for people age 65 and older, triple the Homestead Tax Credit, limit annual property tax growth to 4% and provide state funding for public safety workers’ retirement funds.
House Minority Leader Brian Meyer said in his opening remarks the caucus proposal on property taxes was part of House Democrats’ larger agenda to make life in Iowa more affordable.
Meyer said Democrats’ plan to reduce property taxes is “paid for by cutting wasteful state spending.” He also said lawmakers must address other spending and budget issues in 2026 to avoid a deficit. In 2025, the Legislature approved a budget above the state’s expected revenue for the fiscal year, drawing at least $917 million from the state reserve funds, budget surplus and the Taxpayer Relief Fund.
Some Republicans are looking for tax relief beyond property taxes. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Tim Kraayenbrink, R-Fort Dodge, said Monday in the committee’s first meeting that he is hoping to mirror some federal tax cuts enacted last year in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. He specifically cited the federal actions eliminating income taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security.
“So … hopefully we will be following suit with (the) federal government on that, giving some of the hardworking Iowans their money back, those that had to work overtime to make things work, or those that had to waitress … in a diner or a place of food service. It’s just nice to be able to give some of that money back to the people of Iowa,” Kraayenbrink said.
While property taxes are a top priority for legislative leaders, the breadth of tax policy discussed at the Iowa Capitol may be more limited in 2026 compared to other years. As the Senate Appropriations Committee met Monday, Dawson said he intended to complete the panel’s work in just five more meetings after Monday in the interest of keeping members’ work “focused and with a purpose.”
“I’m going to try to make the commitment right now, see if I can keep it, setting aside this meeting, we’re going to lay the gauntlet down: Five meetings,” he said. “So we’re gonna see if we can get our work done in five meetings this year. They might all occur on the last week, but that’s what we’re gonna try to do.”

Officials, educators and service providers from two of the districts — New Haven and Waterbury — joined U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, at Fair Haven School Monday to call attention to the cuts and voice sharp criticism of the Trump Administration and Education Secretary Linda McMahon. The third district to lose funds, Hartford, was mentioned in remarks but did not have a speaker present.
The canceled grants were awarded under the Full-Service Community Schools program, which funds partnerships between schools and community organizations to expand resources to families. This can include providing literacy support, mental healthcare, after-school activities, food access and other wraparound services.
DeLauro led a successful push to increase FSCS funding 10-fold to $150 million when she was chair of the House Appropriations Committee during the Biden administration.
Each of the three Connecticut districts had won grants and were already running FSCS programming when they learned the Department of Education would be halting further payments. According to DeLauro’s office, New Haven and Waterbury each had $1.5 million remaining in their grants, while Hartford had $1.3 million remaining.
Nationally, a total of 19 FSCS programs saw their funding terminated on Dec. 12, with just one winning it back in an appeal to the department. The grants were expected to run through 2028.
Clifford Beers Community Care Center coordinated New Haven’s FSCS program. Its executive director, Ilaria Filippi, said the program directly served 310 children and 41 families at Fair Haven School and the Family Academy of Multilingual Exploration over 18 months — an effort she said brought together more than 20 organizations. According to state data, over 75% of New Haven Public Schools students qualify for free or reduced lunch — a common metric for assessing student need — compared to roughly 45% statewide.
In a letter to the New Haven program last month, Education Assistant Secretary Kirsten Baesler wrote that the applicant had “proposed project activities that conflict with the Department’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, and excellence in education. Specifically, ‘To advance racial equity and in reflection of the clients served, they will approach this project from the perspective of systemic racism and consistently ask themselves if they are missing data from hard-to-reach families or those at the highest tier of trauma.’” 
The letter also highlighted a passage on professional development that referenced “trauma-informed care, anti-racist practices, equity practices, community organizing, project management, systems thinking, and self-care.”
Filippi was critical of the administration’s reasoning. “This program did not end because it failed. It did not end because outcomes were poor. It did not end because it was ineffective,” Filippi said. “At no point did the department claim that the program wasn’t working. Because it was working.”
Filippi confirmed that the majority of the services offered through the New Haven program have ended.
“With seven working days’ notice, just before winter break, we were forced to dismantle a fully operational program mid-year. The disruption fractured relationships, interrupted care and removed critical support from students, families and educators,” Filippi said.
Rep. DeLauro described the grant cancellations as “a deliberate attempt to sabotage the education of our children.”
“There is not a doubt that this will raise the cost of living for families, many of whom are already living paycheck to paycheck,” DeLauro said.
The U.S. Department of Education did not respond to a request for comment.
New Haven Public Schools superintendent Madeline Negrón said the district is looking into whether it can redirect recently-awarded state funds for after-school programs to continuing the FSCS after-school program.
Althea Brooks, executive director of the Waterbury BTS Community Partnership, said services for students and families in Waterbury will continue for now thanks to other funding sources.
“We are also pursuing opportunities at the state level with the governor’s fund that he, with wisdom, put aside for these attacks,” Brooks said. She added that Waterbury’s board of education has also allocated money to the program.
Hartford Public Schools did not respond to a request for comment on how the loss of funding will affect its programming.
New Haven Federation of Teachers president Leslie Blatteau criticized “billionaire” U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon for treating public schools “as if they belong to her.”
“The data shows that for every dollar spent on community schools, there is a $7 return on investment,” Blatteau said. “At a time when students and working families need more support — at a time when we want to continue to make improvements to student achievement, student attendance and mental health — we learned that the programs designed to provide that support are illegally terminated at the eleventh hour.”
Blatteau also called on Gov. Ned Lamont to release $4 million dollars from the state’s surplus to make up the lost federal funding. 
Rob Blanchard, spokesperson for Gov. Ned Lamont, said the state is “reviewing whether or not the cut to this federal education program meets the statutory guidelines for tapping into the recently created Emergency State Response Reserve.”
The American Federation of Teachers, a union representing public school teachers across the country, has sued the Trump administration to challenge the cancellations. The attorneys general of Maryland, North Carolina and the District of Columbia have also filed a separate suit. 
A spokesperson for the Connecticut Attorney General expressed hope that any relief from those lawsuits would also be provided to grantees in Connecticut but declined to comment on this state’s legal strategy.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026_0112_SR_FSCSEducation_134-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-12 17:59:12.838403

Photo courtesy of the candidate Former Macon-Bibb commissioner Seth Clark on Monday became the latest Democrat to enter the race for lieutenant governor.
In an interview, Clark positioned himself as an alternative to the “career state Capitol folks (who) could learn a thing or two from local government,” saying that he is entering the race as a voice for middle Georgia in the state Democratic party. He said he believes having a candidate with geographical diversity will help Democrats in Georgia prevail in November.
“The Georgia Democratic coalition is much bigger than the 10 square miles of Atlanta, Georgia … and the divide between these two Georgias you hear all the time is better served by a Democratic coalition that looks like and is geographically from the state that produced it,” Clark said.
Clark, who stepped down from the commission in early January, said he is entering the race for lieutenant governor now because policies at both the state and federal levels are hurting families financially. As he waited for someone to enter the lieutenant governor’s race who he felt “could step up and speak to the needs” of Georgians, Clark said, he realized that he wanted to run.
“What matters is that these offices have people in them every day that wake up with the interests of their neighbors at heart, and the lieutenant governor’s office does not have that right now, and that office could use the refreshing results that we have seen in local government,” Clark said.
State Sen. Josh McLaurin, a Sandy Springs Democrat who is serving his fourth term in the Georgia Legislature, was the first Democrat to announce in May.
McLaurin welcomed the “late-entering” candidate in a press release Monday, saying that he looks forward to contrasting their records. 
“When we need to get hard things done in a partisan arena, Democrats in the state legislature turn to me to deliver,” McLaurin said. “This is not a moment when Democratic voters can or should settle for anything less than a proven fighter.” 
Those interested in being on the ballot this fall have until March to decide whether to run. The primary will be held in May, and the winner will go on to face the Republican nominee.

(Photo by Meghan O'Brien/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — The South Dakota coalition that successfully pushed for a state ban on eminent domain for carbon capture pipelines last winter will propose broader limits on eminent domain and more protections for landowners this legislative session.
Sen. Mark Lapka, R-Leola, announced the efforts. One would send a proposed state constitutional amendment to voters in November that would further restrict eminent domain.
“Codified law is too easily amendable over time,” Lapka said. “It’s the constitutionally protected rights that hold firm forever.”
The amendment would “eliminate eminent domain for private gain,” Lapka said, while allowing for public works projects such as public highways, water lines and other infrastructure.
South Dakota governor signs eminent domain ban on carbon pipelines

Eminent domain is a legal process for gaining access to privately owned land when a deal can’t be reached with landowners. It’s often used for public infrastructure projects. It became controversial in South Dakota when Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions attempted to use it for a five-state pipeline that would capture carbon dioxide from ethanol plants and transport it to an underground sequestration site in North Dakota. The project would benefit from federal tax credits incentivizing the prevention of heat-trapping emissions into the atmosphere.
Landowner opposition to the Summit project in South Dakota culminated in the Legislature’s passage of a law last year banning carbon pipelines from using eminent domain. Summit is still pursuing the project and has permits in other states, but has been denied permits twice by South Dakota’s Public Utilities Commission.
Lapka announced his new proposals at a property rights rally Monday in the state Capitol rotunda, attended by dozens of South Dakota farmers, ranchers and lawmakers.
Along with the constitutional amendment, Lapka announced what he’s calling the “Bossly Bill,” named for Jared Bossly, of rural Aberdeen, who is suing Summit Carbon Solutions for allegedly trespassing on his land while it was asserting its right to use eminent domain.
Lapka said the bill will mirror language in a decision by the South Dakota Supreme Court in 2024. The decision said Summit had not proven it was a common carrier. That meant the company could not use eminent domain to access landowners’ property.
Lapka’s bill would “clean up” the language that exists in state law, he said, and protect against “invasive tactics.”
There was a bill introduced last legislative session that would have empowered citizens to sue for allegedly deceptive practices, fraud, harassment, intimidation or misrepresentation during the acquisition of land access agreements by carbon pipeline land agents. The bill narrowly failed in the Senate after passing the House.
The text of the bills announced by Lapka had not been released as of Monday afternoon. The 2026 session of the South Dakota Legislature begins Tuesday and continues through March.

He said “something is being done right” because he can look out at the landscape and see birds and animals that he wasn’t able to see 20 years ago. 
Water quality has been noted as a key priority heading into the session from lawmakers and environmental groups, especially following a wet summer where nitrate concentrations in Iowa rivers reached near record highs. 
The levels were so high in the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers that Central Iowa Water Works had to issue its first ever lawn watering ban in the region to manage demand and keep finished drinking water levels below the federal limits. Levels in the rivers have remained high through the winter, however, and the utility had to turn on its nitrate removal system, according to reporting from KCCI, in January to remain compliant. 
Sen. Art Staed of Cedar Rapids, ranking Democrat on the committee, said it was “long past time” to act on water quality issues that impact Iowan’s health. Staed pointed to the high nitrate concentrations in Iowa rivers and noted that Iowa is also one of two states with a rising cancer rate. Some studies and public health professionals indicate a potential link between nitrate concentrations and certain cancers. 
“Our water crisis has reached a breaking point,” Staed said. “…Protecting clean water must be a shared priority and meaningful solutions require cooperation across party lines – I hope that begins here.” 
Sweeney highlighted a number of programs like the federal Environmental Quality Incentives Program, or EQIP, and the state’s Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy, that she has been part of or used on her farm to make improvements. 
“I believe that we need to make sure that we build upon what we have established; keep the conversations open for more improvement in our water quality,” Sweeney said.

With lawmakers planning major changes to the state’s education finance system this year, here’s what you need to know.

Vermont’s education funding system is notoriously complicated and totally unique.
Following years of rising property taxes — and a watershed 2024 election animated, in part, by a debate over how the state pays for its schools — lawmakers entered the 2025 legislative session poised to consider major changes. 
And while the Legislature began to transform how public school is paid for in 2025, the debate is slated to continue in 2026. 
To understand where we’re going, it’s important to understand where we’ve been. Here’s how the system has worked in recent years.
Vermont pays for education on a statewide basis, meaning property taxes from across the state are pooled and then redistributed. As a result of the state’s complex funding system, budget decisions in individual communities impact tax rates across the state.
School district budgets are built by local school boards in consultation with district officials and voted on at the local level, often on Town Meeting Day in March. What voters approve is what the state will fund, and property tax rates are set at a per-$100 of property value rate to pay for it. 
Roughly two-thirds of the entire state’s education budget is paid for with property taxes. The remainder is covered through the sales tax and portions of other taxes — such as rooms, meals, purchase and use — as well as state lottery proceeds and federal and state Medicaid money. 
Every year, the Legislature passes the “yield bill,” which helps set homestead, non-homestead, and income-sensitized property tax rates in order to fund the voter-approved budgets in each school district. 
Homestead property refers to primary residences. Non-homestead property includes everything else, from second homes and apartments to businesses and camps. The annual non-homestead tax rate is uniform statewide. Homestead property tax rates, however, are impacted by local school spending decisions. 
A resident’s homestead property tax rates go up and down based on how the school district’s per-pupil spending compares to a state average. Per-pupil spending is a technical term that, in short, refers to the amount of money spent by a school district divided by the number of students in the district. 
But not every student is counted equally. Like other states, Vermont uses student weights to adjust for those who are more expensive to teach, including English learners and economically disadvantaged students. Those students are weighted as more than one student in the calculation. 
A majority of homestead property tax payers receive some discount based on their income. These taxpayers are sometimes referred to as “income-sensitized,” and Vermont uses a property tax credit system to support income-sensitized taxpayers. 
Yet another layer of complexity is added when the so-called common level of appraisal, set annually for each town by the state Department of Taxes, is added to the equation. 
Historically, the common level of appraisal, expressed as a percentage, reflects the difference between a town’s appraised property values and what the department considers to be fair market value. For example, if the property in a town is found to be appraised on average at 85% of market value, the common level of appraisal would be 85%.
To come up with a property owner’s education property tax rate, the base rate — set by the Legislature only for non-homestead property, adjusted by school district per-pupil spending for homestead property — is divided by a town’s common level of appraisal. This can lead to towns within the same school district having very different property tax rates.
Since July 2025, the common level of appraisal has worked slightly differently, though the formula is not any less complex. The percentage reflects the difference between a town’s appraised property values and the statewide average appraised value as both compare to fair market value. For example, if statewide property values are at 95% of fair market value, the new appraisal level of the town above would be 85% divided by 95%, or 89%.
Much of how Vermont pays for education could change because of the passage in 2025 of Act 73. The new law envisions a major departure from Vermont’s current system by shifting budget decisions away from school districts and their communities and to the state via a foundation formula.
Used by most states in the country, a foundation formula would provide each school district with a set amount of money based on the number of students enrolled, with additional weights to account for the increased costs of educating certain students, such as English learners and students with disabilities.
School districts’ governing boards could still set their budgets and choose how to spend that money but would have to operate within the confines of the set amount the formula allocates.
Districts would be able to choose to spend more than what the formula provides by raising funds from local property taxpayers with voter approval. But that spending, called supplemental spending, would be capped at 10% of a district’s budget. That cap would be ratcheted down every year until the cap hits 5%.
However, the new formula is dependent on lawmakers first agreeing to a new map of consolidated school districts this legislative session. The formula would then be phased in over a five-year period and would not go into effect until 2028.

The city’s motion to dismiss argues that the state statute cited applies only to boards of civil authority and claims the Board for Registration of Voters is not one.

A civil lawsuit claims Burlington is flouting state law by avoiding appointing more Republicans to a board responsible for maintaining the voter registration list and ensuring fair elections. The city has filed a motion to dismiss.
Filed Nov. 25 in Vermont Superior Court by two residents, the lawsuit alleges the city “has refused to permit Republicans their statutory-required, minimum representation” on the Board for Registration of Voters.
The city filed a motion to dismiss on Jan. 3, claiming that the state law governing civil authority boards does not apply to this board.
The Vermont statute pertaining to elections ensures fair representation by mandating that boards of civil authority contain at least three members of each major political party. The city charter does not mandate a minimum but sets a maximum of six members of the same political party for its board of registration of voters.
The 12-member board in Burlington currently comprises five Democrats, four Progressives, two Independents and one Republican.
When prior inadequate Republican representation on the board was pointed out by the chairman of the Vermont Republican Party in 2021, the City Council followed the city attorney’s advice and appointed two Republicans to the board, the lawsuit notes.
Communications shared in the lawsuit indicate that city officials and Article 16 of the city charter discussed the issue pertaining to the Board of Civil Authority, as it was called at the time. 
Justin St. James, then assistant city attorney, advised the City Council president “to fill both the vacant position and a new, temporary 13th position with Republican applicants,” whose terms would end June 30, 2022, at which point the board would revert to 12 members.
“I am seeking both to inform you of the issue and the likelihood of litigation if we do not comply, as well as to see conceptually how you feel,” St. James wrote in an Aug. 20, 2021 email.
Max Tracy, former council president, thanked him for the explanation and wrote he was “in support of appointing the two additional Republicans to ensure that we are in compliance.”
When a similar situation occurred last year and appellants William Oetjen and Jeffrey Comstock brought the matter to the council, they got a different response, said Brady Toensing, one of the lawyers representing the two Republican residents.
Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak and the City Council were asked to fix the balance of membership on the board “meant to ensure not only fair and properly functioning elections, but also public confidence in the legitimacy of Vermont elections,” but did not comply, Toensing wrote in an email. 
Documents filed in court indicate that Oetjen, the chair of the Burlington Republican Party, submitted his and Comstock’s application in his Sept. 10 request for appointment to the board; three other Republican residents also joined the request.
The lawsuit states that the City Council met in executive session on Nov. 3 and decided not to appoint any additional members to the board and informed the applicants accordingly. 
The plaintiffs said they are qualified and allege the city “has wrongfully refused” to appoint them to the Board for Registration of Voters.
The city’s elected leaders “have chosen to violate their oaths of office by flouting this election integrity law and forced concerned citizens into costly litigation to make them obey the law,” Toensing said.
The city’s recent motion to dismiss argues that the state statute cited applies only to boards of civil authority and claims that the Board for Registration of Voters is not one.
To conclude that it is “would illogically result in a requirement that any of several City boards, commissions, committees, or councils would be required to expand its membership if it did not include at least three representatives from each major political party,” city attorney Jessica Brown wrote in an email.
The city board had three Republican members in March 2024; one resigned in April 2024 and a second left in June 2025. No Republican residents applied to fill those vacancies during the open application process, according to Brown.
The lawsuit states that in August 2025, one of the two Republican members on the board
resigned and was replaced with a Democrat, and that “no effort was made to recruit a Republican to fill this seat.”
While Burlington claims it does not have a civil authority board, the city’s own description states that the Board for Registration of Voters is responsible for ensuring accurate voter lists and responding to voter registration issues on Election Day. 
“Therefore, the Board for Registration of Voters, which performs the same relevant functions as the Board of Civil Authority, must abide by the law that requires a minimum number of major political party members,” the lawsuit states.
In its motion to dismiss, the city agrees the Board for Registration of Voters is responsible for the maintenance of the voter list, which in a typical municipality is a function of the Board of Civil Authority, but states the two boards are “quite different.”
“Burlington is unique among Vermont municipalities in that no single official or body functions as its board of civil authority for all purposes,” the motion states.
“It has a unique structure, role, and composition. Its membership is chosen in an entirely different manner from a town board of civil authority. And it is subject to its own rule to ensure diverse party representation,” Assistant City Attorney Erik Ramakrishnan wrote in the motion to dismiss.
Brown further clarified that ward officers have managed the polls on election day in Burlington at least since the adoption of the current 1949 City Charter. General election planning decisions have since been the responsibility of the City Council and mayor.
Toensing claims this is “a silly argument to try to mask the city’s misconduct.”
“Section 43 of the municipal charter establishes a Board of Civil Authority, but then delegates all election-related duties of that board to what it calls the Board for Registration of Voters,” he said. “If it walks, looks, and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck.”
“Vermont voters would be justified in asking why the Secretary of State, whose office’s primary mission is to promote public trust in elections, has chosen to remain silent instead of defending this election integrity law,” he added.
The city conferred with the Secretary of State’s Office before litigation was filed, said Brown, and received no further comments or questions.
A spokesperson from the Secretary of State’s Office said the “complicated wrinkle” is that Burlington has its own charter and the dispute would have to be resolved in court.
“The short answer is, we don’t have enforcement authority or run local elections,” said Sean Sheehan, director of elections.

Solar and batteries keep getting cheaper, while the cost to supply and deliver gas is only rising.","WINTER IS HERE, and if it is anything like the past few, families across Massachusetts will open painfully high energy bills. Cold weather rate hikes arrive on top of electricity costs that are already among the highest in the nation. In the past five years, the Commonwealth’s residential power prices have risen by more than 30 percent, and they are only expected to increase.  
As Beacon Hill looks to tackle this problem, state leaders should pass an energy affordability package that delivers long-term relief by limiting our dependence on costly fossil gas. To protect ratepayers, we need to double down on transitioning to stable, affordable, and locally generated clean energy, like solar.  
Why are our state’s electricity bills so high? Massachusetts over-relies on imported gas to generate power. The price of gas is not just expensive (and getting more so), but volatile, making our rates vulnerable to spikes from extreme weather, international conflict, and market dynamics. If ratepayers continue to foot the bill for new gas infrastructure, we will be locking ourselves into a worsening affordability crisis and lose control of our energy future for decades. 
Breaking this cycle requires unleashing local solar and storage so we can generate affordable electricity right here in Massachusetts. Solar and batteries keep getting cheaper, while the cost to supply and deliver gas is only rising. Distributed energy resources can come online rapidly, provide direct bill savings to families and businesses, and benefit all ratepayers by reducing the need for expensive peak power purchases and costly new grid infrastructure.  
Repeatedly, we’ve seen how local solar saves everyone money on their electric bills. During the heatwave this past June, distributed solar saved consumers at least $8.2 million in a single day and prevented what would have been record-breaking stress on our grid. From 2014 to 2019, small-scale solar generated over $1 billion in savings for New England customers. These savings were enjoyed not only by people with systems on their rooftops, but by all ratepayers. 
Massachusetts has historically been a leader on solar, but the pace of deployment has lagged in recent years. Although we have tens of gigawatts of untapped potential, our state ranks 26th nationally for new installations, and growth in key segments like community solar has slowed sharply since 2021. Federal rollbacks of tax credits for clean energy will further hamper our progress unless state policymakers act.  
First, our representatives should fix the overly burdensome local government and utility approval processes that add months of delay and thousands of dollars to even the simplest solar and battery projects.  
Ask any contractor what drives up the cost of home solar installations and they’ll tell you the same thing: time and complexity. In communities across the Commonwealth, cookie-cutter residential projects that should be installed quickly and easily are hindered by antiquated and bespoke bureaucratic requirements like paper forms and in-person appointments, long wait times, and multiple inspections. This maze of barriers and delays drives up the sticker price of home solar by at least $1/watt, and leads many families to give up on going solar during the approval process.  
Convoluted and outdated permitting, inspection, and interconnection do not enhance safety or quality, and streamlining them would deliver real benefits for consumers. For example, by adopting “smart permitting,” where the code compliance checks for home solar and batteries are done instantly and online, Massachusetts could reduce the cost of the standard system by $2,400 by 2030 and deliver nearly 120,000 additional installs  by 2040.   
Smart permitting technology was developed by the Department of Energy and National Renewable Energy Laboratory in partnership with leading building safety organizations and has an impeccable track record. More than 300 communities around the country have adopted it, representing roughly a third of the national solar market.  
Second, policymakers should scale virtual power plants–networks that deliver power back to the grid by aggregating it from rooftop solar panels, home batteries, and other distributed energy devices. 
States across the country are embracing VPPs to manage demand and reduce costs without building pricey new infrastructure. Massachusetts’s own ConnectedSolutions, which has delivered over $8 million in annual net benefits for households, is a good start and should be expanded upon to help more families save.  
Third, state leaders should change how our utilities get paid to better align with consumer interests.  Current regulatory structures provide financial incentives for utilities to prioritize expensive capital investments –like constructing new power lines and substations–to meet our energy needs. These costs are directly passed down to ratepayers.  
While we will certainly need to continue to make smart infrastructure improvements, we also need to redesign this incentive structure and instead pay utilities for their performance on cutting costs, increasing system efficiency, and delivering cheap, clean power. We know that this works. For instance, in Illinois, a performance based regulatory scheme has translated into a more than 70 percent improvement in reliability, nearly 21.7 million avoided customer outages, and over $3.8 billion in avoided outage costs.  
Massachusetts families deserve a power system that relies less on ever-more expensive gas, prioritizes efficiency, and clears the pathway to bring more cost-effective renewable energy online. By fixing the approval process for solar and batteries, scaling virtual power plants, and better aligning utility incentives with the public interest, lawmakers can deliver real, durable affordability.

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-12 21:58:53+00:00,Mississippi Today,Jackson plastic surgeon Dr. Adair Blackledge surrenders medical license,Gwen Dilworth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/12/plastic-surgeon-surrenders-license/,The facade of the building that housed Blackledge Face Center is pictured on Jan. 11.,"Dr. Adair Blackledge, a physician who practiced facial plastic surgery in the Jackson area for 22 years and was the subject of a five-month Mississippi Today investigation in September, surrendered his state medical license Dec. 31, according to an order accepting the surrender published by the Mississippi Board of Medical Licensure. 
Blackledge was under investigation by the Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure — the state agency that licenses and regulates physicians — for allegations of professional incompetency, unprofessional conduct and dishonorable or unethical behavior likely to deceive, defraud or harm the public, the order says. Board minutes show that the board approved an investigative subpoena for the case in March. 
Blackledge, of office-based facial plastic surgery practice Blackledge Face Center, denied wrongdoing and surrendered his license to retire from medicine and resolve the board’s investigation, the order writes. The signage for Blackledge Face Center had been removed from the building’s facade as of Sunday.
Blackledge did not respond to Mississippi Today’s request for comment by publication time Monday. Board of Medical Licensure spokesperson Cara Shirley declined to answer questions about the surrender, writing in an email that “the Board does not comment on matters related to Board business.” 
Mississippi Today’s reporting showed that Blackledge performed facelifts about three times more quickly than what other plastic surgeons considered average. He also employed some practices other doctors said were uncommon, such as instructing patients to remove their staples themselves after surgery and performing post-operative visits at hotel rooms for patients who traveled to Mississippi for surgery. 
Blackledge said in July he used a sleeping pill and a sedative, anti-anxiety medication to sedate most patients before surgery, a drug combination other doctors told Mississippi Today could make it difficult for patients to breathe during surgery. Blackledge also said he was trained using the regimen and has never had an adverse event related to anesthesia administration.
He also said there is no way to compare the amount of time a facelift takes to another because each one involves different techniques and areas of the face.
Mississippi Today’s investigation also showed Blackledge was not board certified in any specialty medical field, a credential that is not required to practice plastic surgery in Mississippi. Some experts, however, say certification improves patient safety by demonstrating that a doctor has trained extensively in a field and is capable of performing certain procedures.

Patients interviewed by Mississippi Today last year described a range of complications, including nasal indentations and infections, prominent scarring, a cheek implant that burst through the skin and wounds that reopened and required medical attention. They recounted quick procedures, results that didn’t last and repeated revisions, or procedures to correct or improve past surgeries.
It is uncommon for a physician to surrender a medical license, and it is not typical for a doctor to surrender a license upon retirement, said Dr. Randy Easterling, a Vicksburg physician who previously served on the Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure for 12 years. Easterling said he does not have knowledge of Blackledge’s case and cannot speak on behalf of the medical board. He also could not speak specifically about Blackledge’s license.
“Usually a surrender of license — generally speaking — is when there’s so much evidence against the physician that you don’t want to have a hearing,” he said. “Because if you go to a hearing, there will be stuff to come out that maybe you don’t want the public to know.” 
If an investigation is concluded without the initiation of disciplinary action, all records of the investigation and proceedings remain confidential, according to Mississippi Board of Medical Licensure policy. 
Blackedge’s surrender of his medical license will be reported to the Health Resources and Services Administration’s National Practitioner Data Bank, a registry used to collect and share disciplinary information about medical providers across state lines. 
“Generally speaking, you would have difficulty getting a license in any other state,” Easterling said. 
However, physicians whose licenses have been surrendered in Mississippi can reapply for licensure, beginning the process as if they have never held one before, according to Mississippi Board of Medical Licensure policy.

Blackledge’s former patients have greeted news of his departure from the field with mixed reactions. Vicky Pitts of Laurel underwent a necklift with Blackledge in 2020, followed by a series of revisions and touch-up surgeries that occurred for more than two years after she said the initial surgery failed. Pitts said the subsequent procedures resulted in complications. 
She said Friday she feels relieved that other patients may be spared similar experiences, but does not believe the outcome will bring her closure.
“It still does not heal some of the people he has really hurt in the long run, with the stress, the depression, the embarrassment,” she said. “… When I look in the mirror, I just want to cry.”
Scores of people who say they were patients of Blackledge have shared stories and photographs of their surgery experiences in a members-only Facebook group created by patients in 2023. 
Blackledge told Mississippi Today in emails from July to September that the complaints made by patients about his practice represented a small portion of his patient population and said he believes his complication rate is far below the national average. He said the complaints were the result of a “social media barrage” in which he, his family and his staff members were attacked and threatened by patients. 
“The past year has been an extremely frustrating one for me, and I really feel like I am being painted in a false light by patients who had apparently unreasonable expectations of the results that could be achieved,” he said to Mississippi Today in July.
Blackledge told Mississippi Today for months last year that he could not locate a transfer agreement he said he had with St. Dominic Hospital in Jackson. The agreement is a state requirement for surgeons who sedate patients in their offices, and is widely considered a critical patient safety measure for office-based surgery. 
Blackledge provided a written transfer agreement with St. Dominic to Mississippi Today the day before it published its article, signed that day, after Mississippi Today inquired about it for the third time in three months.

(Photo by Glen Stubbe/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he plans to sue the Trump administration after it pledged to freeze federal funding for food stamps awarded to Minnesota and the city of Minneapolis, citing the years-long fraud scandals that have plagued public programs.
Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins, in a letter posted to social media and addressed to Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey last week, said the agency was suspending payment of about $129 million in funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Rollins said the widespread fraud in social services programs means that the feds need to take stringent action.
The fraud “necessitates federal action to protect taxpayer dollars until adequate safeguards can be established.” 
The Minnesota Officer of U.S. Attorney, which has been investigating fraud cases since 2021, has leveled charges related to Medicaid fraud and theft from a pandemic-era program intended to feed hungry children, but nothing related to food stamps, the USDA’s main anti-hunger program now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. 
Rollins said Minnesota and Minneapolis will need to provide “payment justifications” within the next 30 days for USDA payments, which include SNAP benefits, also referred to as food stamps. 
“I will not allow you to take from Minnesotans in need,” Ellison said in an X post responding to Rollins’ letter. “I’ll see you in court.”
Around 440,000 Minnesotans rely on SNAP; 152,000 are children, 72,000 are seniors and 52,000 are adults with disabilities. Nearly half of recipients live outside of the Twin Cities.
The Department of Children, Youth and Families, which oversees SNAP benefits, said it’s working with local partners to determine the impact of the funding freeze. The city of Minneapolis echoed the state’s comments.
“We’re communicating with state partners to understand the impacts of such a blanket cut to funding meant for residents most in need,” said Brian Feintech, a spokesperson for Minneapolis. “What’s abundantly clear is that Minneapolis is the latest target of the Trump administration — willing to harm Americans in service to its perceived political gain.”
Zach Rodvold, director of public affairs for Second Harvest Heartland, said there are few details about the funding freeze, so it’s unclear how Minnesota food shelves will be affected because Rollins’ letter provided no specifics. The next batch of SNAP benefits are scheduled to be paid out on Feb. 4. 
Minnesota and other Democratic-led states have refused to provide data about SNAP recipients to the federal government, including recipient immigration status. Twenty-two states have sued over the request for information, which was made in February. 
Rollins cited the state’s unwillingness to share its “SNAP rolls” as a reason to freeze the funds, in addition to the high profile fraud cases in Minnesota such as the Feeding Our Future scandal and fraud in the Housing Stabilization Services program.
The USDA funding freeze is unrelated to a Friday order from a federal judge that blocked the Trump administration from freezing $10 billion in funding for child care and social services in five Democratic-led states.  
The SNAP funding freeze is only the latest in a barrage of retaliatory measures the Trump administration is taking against Minnesota as the widespread fraud scandal has captured the president’s attention. 
The Department of Homeland Security has conducted on-site visits to child care centers suspected of fraudulent billing. The Trump administration is also investigating Minnesota’s Head Start program; small business annual grant payments; public housing assistance programs; and Minnesota’s Unemployment Insurance program.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/13-SNAP-1125-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-12 16:58:52.035395

(White House video screengrab)Two titans of Alaska’s oil industry both told President Donald Trump on Friday that they intend to expand into post-Maduro Venezuela.
The public comments, Alaska-based oil industry players said, raise questions about how new drilling opportunities in the South American country could create competition for investment in Alaska’s petroleum-based economy.
Texas-based Hilcorp operates Alaska’s largest oil deposit, Prudhoe Bay, where it’s ramped up investment in recent years after buying its stake in the field from oil giant BP. It also produces the vast majority of natural gas that urban Alaskans use for heat.
Hilcorp’s chairman, Jeff Hildebrand, participated in the White House meeting, which Trump convened with oil executives to discuss opportunities in Venezuela. He told the president that “Hilcorp is fully committed and ready to go, to rebuild the infrastructure in Venezuela.”
“You’ll go there? You’ll be going?” Trump asked.
“Yes,” Hildebrand said.
“Good, that’s good. You’ll be very happy,” Trump said.
The meeting took place less than a week after a U.S. military operation, at Trump’s direction, deposed Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s socialist leader, and brought him to New York to face drug and corruption charges. Trump said immediately after the operation that U.S. oil firms would move into the country and revitalize its flagging petroleum industry.
Another executive whose company has made some of Alaska’s largest new oil discoveries in recent years, and which continues to drill in search of new prospects, also said at Friday’s meeting that his business is “ready to go to Venezuela.”
“It is prime real estate,” said Bill Armstrong, whose firm discovered Alaska’s Pikka field, which an international company is now spending $3 billion to develop.
Armstrong said his business already controls 8 million acres adjacent to Venezuela and is “heavily invested” in the area.

The comments from Armstrong and Hildebrand were notably enthusiastic compared to those of executives of larger, publicly traded oil companies like ExxonMobil. The chief executive of that firm — which also owns a share of Prudhoe Bay — called Venezuela currently “uninvestable” at the White House meeting.
“We’ve had our assets seized there twice,” the executive, Darren Woods, said. “So, you can imagine, to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes from what we’ve historically seen.”
An Alaska-based Hilcorp spokesman, Matt Shuckerow, declined to comment on Hildebrand’s remarks.
Armstrong, in a text message, suggested that a reporter enquire with his oil business’s Alaska-based lobbyist, Ashley Reed.
Reed, in a phone interview Saturday, acknowledged that there are still numerous obstacles to investment in Venezuela’s oil industry — including the country’s political climate and security. But he also said that Alaskans shouldn’t discount the risk that the South American country could be new competition for oil companies’ investment dollars.
“If Hildebrand takes his money down there, and Bill, we don’t have much left, except ConocoPhillips,” Reed said.
In his own correspondence with Armstrong this week, Reed added, the oil executive said some of the arguments against investing in Venezuela could also be made about Alaska.
“Enormous, resource-rich areas. Erratic fiscal policy. Government seemingly unwilling to initiate meaningful reforms,” Reed said. “How is that different from Maduro’s policies — where he wants it, and he just takes it?”

(Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images)A Connecticut-based company announced plans to build a $6 billion data center just outside Little Rock’s city limits Monday, the latest in a string of such projects locating in Arkansas. 
AVAIO Digital Partners said in a news release that the data center complex, to be built off Interstate 530 in Pulaski County, will host the “compute, networking, data storage technologies and power infrastructure that underpin cloud computing and artificial intelligence applications.” 
AVAIO is a data center operator and developer that works with “AI, HPC and hyperscaler data center clients,” according to the release.
The $6 billion is an initial investment that includes infrastructure costs. The AVAIO Digital Leo project will initially use 150 megawatts of power a year — but that power consumption could reach upwards of 1 gigawatt in the future, equivalent to roughly 750,000 homes. Construction is expected to start this year, with the facility set to come online in 2027.
Google announced its own $4 billion data center project investment in West Memphis in October which is already under construction. Like Google, the AVAIO project plans to obtain power from Entergy. Three other projects are also in the works in Little Rock, Conway and Clarksville.
The data centers necessary to power the world’s increasing use of AI products, such as ChatGPT, have faced increasing scrutiny due to their massive energy requirements at a time when power bills are rising nationwide. Energy bills nationally have increased nearly 30% between 2021 and the end of 2025.The data center announcements come on the heels of Act 373 of 2025, which proponents say will cut down on permitting timelines for new power generation. Critics of the law have said it reduces oversight and allows utility companies to recoup costs from customers on utility projects that haven’t been built yet.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — An investigation of Epic Charter School’s finances determined inexplicably poor budget management, misguided enrollment projections, a lack of transparency and too few questions asked all contributed to a fiscal crisis last school year.
The Statewide Charter School Board heard the investigation results on Monday after calling for the probe in July. The board ordered the forensic audit after Epic carried out two rounds of mass layoffs and other major cuts to avoid insolvency during the 2025 fiscal year.
Investigators from the accounting firm Carr, Riggs & Ingram LLC said they found no evidence of embezzlement.
Rather, the audit found Epic administrators placed too much faith in a flawed enrollment projection model and overestimated their 2024-25 school year student count. A public school’s enrollment is typically the top factor that determines its annual funding.

Epic then hired far too many employees and aggressively added facilities that its revenues couldn’t support, said Ben Kincaid, a financial forensics expert from Carr, Riggs & Ingram.
Epic’s former superintendent, Bart Banfield, didn’t carry out a cost-benefit analysis of the extra expenses, and the school’s governing board didn’t ask enough questions, Kincaid said when presenting the investigation’s findings to the statewide board on Monday. 
Instead, he said too much independent control of the budgeting process rested with Jeanise Wynn, Epic’s former assistant superintendent of finance. Investigators were unable to explain some of Wynn’s budget projections, particularly her expectation of a $60.4 million carryover balance from Fiscal Year 2024 into Fiscal Year 2025.
“So, we have the CFO winging it, and then a superintendent who really wasn’t as engaged as he should have been,” statewide board Chairperson Brian Shellem said during the meeting.
Investigators interviewed Wynn and learned she kept a private budget that Epic’s school board and several fellow administrators had not seen, according to Kincaid’s report. Investigators were unable to schedule an interview with Banfield, Kincaid said.
Both Banfield and Wynn resigned last year. Oklahoma Voice was unable to reach either for comment.
Epic recently hired a new superintendent, Shaun Ross, from Oklahoma City Public Schools, and revamped its financial department.
“I don’t know a lot of the answers to these questions that came up,” Ross told the statewide board. “What I can assure you, on behalf of the board of Epic, on behalf of the staff of Epic, on behalf of myself, we are going to make corrective actions.”

With 28,500 students, Epic is the state’s largest virtual charter school and the third-largest public school district in Oklahoma.
The school eliminated 144 jobs and implemented pay cuts in October 2024 after enrollment came in 4,000 students below administrators’ projections. Those cuts weren’t enough to account for all the new employees hired for the 2024-25 school year, Kincaid said.
Epic then laid off another 357 administrators and teachers in June, slashed several programs and closed multiple in-person learning centers to avoid a budget shortfall. It also had to take out a $30 million line of credit to ensure it could cover its financial obligations over the summer when public schools receive no state funding.
The most urgent issues still facing Epic, the audit found, are a lack of budget oversight and documentation to explain budget changes. The school also should have an internal auditor on staff, investigators found.
“Our team will be actively involved in ensuring Epic fully addresses all findings and the risks that still exist,” said Rebecca Wilkinson, executive director of the Statewide Charter School Board.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma Department of Public Safety requested over $25 million to train highway patrol troopers.
Commissioner Tim Tipton told House lawmakers during budget hearings Monday that the funding to hold more academy classes is necessary to in order to train and hire the number of troopers needed to adequately patrol the state amid retirements and other attrition. 
“I’m here asking for what I need,” he said. “This isn’t me asking for anything extra. This is me asking simply what we need to be able to do our job that I think you all and the citizens expect us to do.”
The $25.8 million would cover the first year salary, equipment and training for new cadets, Tipton said. DPS would plan to use this money to fund two future academy classes with 72 cadets each with hopes of graduating at least 50 troopers from each class, an agency spokesperson said.  
DPS would need between 1,200 and 1,300 troopers to ensure 24/7 coverage for all of Oklahoma’s counties, Tipton said. The Oklahoma Highway Patrol currently employs over 760 troopers, according to the DPS presentation.
It’s a “perpetual problem” for troopers to be overworked, he said, which can be a mental health and wellness issue, as well as a safety concern. 
“You’re working without a partner,” Tipton said. “You may be covering two or three or four counties by yourself, your own call, your entire life. There is no free time when you get your days off. … We’ve done everything that we can to think outside the box.”
The funding would “restore operational balance” and allow for 24/7 shift coverage, reduce reliance on excessive overtime, and improve officer availability in rural and high-need areas, according to the DPS presentation.
Tipton had previously attempted to pull Highway Patrol troopers off interstates in the Oklahoma City and Tulsa metropolitan areas, but that plan was stymied after an opinion from Attorney General Gentner Drummond found this to be illegal. 
“I tried to make efficiencies this past year to be able to accomplish the mission and quit harming my troopers that are out working the road,” Tipton said. “I got hammered for that, and I understand everybody’s got their own opinion about that. I’ve got to worry about the well being of the troopers and for the citizens that are most vulnerable, and we tried to make adjustments for that.” 
Every state agency submits a budget request to the Oklahoma Legislature ahead of session, but lawmakers have the final say on what is funded.

SOUTH ROYALTON — Hundreds of protesters gathered across the Upper Valley on Saturday to mourn the death of a woman who was fatally shot last week by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis, MN.
An event in South Royalton that drew more than 100 people was organized by the Building A Local Economy Resistance Hub, an activist initiative founded at the village’s community resource center following the second election of President Donald Trump. “It’s really important that people know we’re doing this because people can feel so isolated,” especially in Vermont, BALE leader Fran Miller said at the rally.
Similar events were planned in other Upper Valley communities including Lebanon, Norwich, White River Junction and Woodstock.
The events were among over 1,000 “ICE Out for Good” vigils and protests that were scheduled to take place across the country over the weekend, according to Indivisible, a grassroots coalition with chapters across the country that helped organize the movement. Protesters gathered to grieve the death of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, who was fatally shot by an ICE agent while she was behind the wheel of her vehicle last Wednesday.

In the wake of the shooting, Trump administration officials have described Good as a domestic terrorist who attempted to ram federal agents with her Honda Pilot, while members of her family, friends and neighbors have said they are mourning her loss and remembering her as gentle, kind and openhearted, the Associated Press reported.
For those who oppose ICE’s presence in their communities, Good’s death has only increased their opposition and fear.
During the White River Junction protest on Saturday afternoon, Katherine Paul, a member of the community activist group Upper Valley Visibility Brigade, stood near Hartford Town Hall holding a sign that read “Who is next?” in black letters.
Good’s killing sent the message that death at the hands of ICE “really could happen to anyone for any reason,” Paul said. “I think we have to fight hard to let everyone know that what ICE is doing is unacceptable and dangerous.”
Even though it was under tragic circumstances, Paul said it felt good to rally together with others. “It feels like we’re out here to show that we’re not going to be scared into compliance.”
The South Royalton event began at about 11 a.m. on Saturday when dozens of people began to congregate on the green at the corner of South Windsor and Chelsea streets. A few minutes later, a couple people at the front of the crowd began to beat a drum and a plastic bucket while others held up signs that read “Stop ICE Terror Now” and “ICE Masks Off.” 
Miller, the BALE organizer, soon stepped forward to address the crowd. “We want to honor all of the people that ICE has murdered,” she said.
Elena Greenlee, BALE’s executive director, read the names of the 39 people who have died in ICE custody or at the hands of an ICE agent between 2025 and 2026. The list was compiled by the Transgender Law Center, a national civil rights organization.

“Say their names,” the crowd chanted after Greenlee read each name, and after the final name, grew quiet in a collective moment of silence. “May their memories be a blessing,” Greenlee said. 
Sophie Martin, a 28-year-old who lives on her grandfather’s South Royalton farm, noted in an interview at the event that “the most recent murder by ICE struck a chord with the community that the rest of them haven’t, and I think that’s because (Good) was a white woman.”
In spite of those racial undertones, Martin, who came to the rally with her mother and grandfather, Bob Slattery, still wanted to show up and take action. “It’s a time of great unease,” said Slattery, who recalled protesting the Vietnam War when he was around Martin’s age. “Injustice doesn’t just go away by itself,” he said. “If you want to do something, you’ve got to stand up.” 
He and Martin walked together in a procession down Chelsea Street and across the bridge to Route 14 where people waved signs at passing cars. 
Shortly before 12 p.m., people began to walk back up the hill to the village green before dispersing. An hour later, over a 100 people lined the intersection of Maple and Bridge streets in White River Junction as part of a vigil organized by Upper Valley Coalition, a community activist group founded last February. 
At the same time, about a 10-minute drive away, over 300 people gathered for another “ICE Out for Good” event in Lebanon’s Colburn Park organized by the Upper Valley Coalition and the New Hampshire chapter of the activist group, Upper Valley Indivisible.

Patterson/Valley News
On Maple Street, members of Upper Valley Visibility Brigade handed out pink ribbons, luminaries and white roses to participants in remembrance of Good. Nan Carroll, of Norwich, waved a sign that read “Renee good. ICE bad.”
Carroll, 70, has attended other protests in the Upper Valley, such as the “No Kings” protests that have been organized in opposition to the Trump administration. “I come to these because over time we’ll make a difference,” she said. When she was in high school in Ohio, her mother took her to protests against the Vietnam War. “Eventually, they made a difference in changing people’s minds,” she said.

Expect at least a few sports metaphors in Gov. Dan McKee’s 2026 State of the State address, scheduled for 7 p.m. at the Rhode Island State House. The annual event sets the tone for the policy and funding debates that will play out over the rest of the six-month legislative session. 
For McKee, this year is all about affordability, with an emphasis on proposals that “put money back in Rhode Islanders’ pockets,” Laura Hart, a spokesperson for McKee, said in an email Monday. 
Keep an ear out for tax relief and measures to lower energy bills and health insurance costs, per Hart. A lineup of not-yet-announced special guests will help give human examples of the necessity of McKee’s priorities. 
But the broad brush outline won’t delve into the weeds; despite signaling the likelihood of a new tax on top earners in a Boston Globe interview, for example, McKee’s speech is not expected to mention a millionaire’s tax by name or in description, Hart said.
Those details will come Thursday, when the governor unveils a proposed fiscal 2027 budget. Also awaiting clarification: how McKee plans to make up the funding loss from a proposed end to income taxes on Social Security benefits, keep the beleaguered Rhode Island Public Transit Authority afloat, and make good on promises to address rising winter electric bills.
Until then, it’s McKee’s moment to take a lap. His speech in the House of Representatives chamber will highlight state investments in the economy, housing, life sciences and marine defense, Hart said. 
Like last year, protestors are scheduled to gather a floor below McKee for a “People’s State of the State” rally. And this time, there will be almost-full public access, except for a small area near the stairway to the chambers where McKee will deliver his speech. That plan came from an agreement in a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island after access issues during McKee’s 2025 State of the State.
Demonstrators arriving at the State House for a scheduled event before the Jan. 14, 2025, speech were unexpectedly blocked from accessing the State House rotunda, which had been reserved by the administration even though it was not where McKee’s speech was taking place. 
Another source of 2025 criticism: the administration’s decision not to let TV camera crews into the chamber where McKee delivered his speech. The seemingly unprecedented media restriction of 2025 has been reversed. This year, there is a collective arrangement among TV networks for WPRI-TV 12 to record and supply live video to all, Hart said. The event will also be televised and livestreamed on Capitol TV.
While it appears McKee has fought off another round of access issues this year, he’s still facing scrutiny, including from his 2026 Democratic gubernatorial primary opponent, Helena Buonanno Foulkes. Even when praising McKee’s vague announcement to restore funding for RIPTA, which is facing a projected $14 million deficit in fiscal 2027, Foulkes took a jab. 
“Last budget, Governor McKee made the choice to cut RIPTA’s funding — a decision that led to routes being eliminated and unreliable service for Rhode Islanders who rely on public transportation in their daily lives,” Foulkes said in a Jan. 9 statement. “Now, as he faces dismal approval ratings and election season, the Governor is claiming to ‘restore’ the very cuts he made only months ago. I’m relieved that the Governor has finally recognized the value of investing in public transportation and is doing the right thing by reversing a bad policy decision.”
Foulkes, meanwhile, has been promoting her own 2026 priority agenda, including accountability in the Washington Bridge crisis, returning Providence and Central Falls Public Schools to local control, and ending “pay-to-play politics.” On Monday, she offered more detail on the final of those points, calling for a state policy change that prevents lobbyists from donating to state general officers and lawmakers during the legislative session. 
McKee’s office did not immediately return requests for comment on Foulkes’ statements Monday.
House Minority Leader Mike Chippendale , a Foster Republican, will deliver a response on behalf of Rhode Island Republicans immediately following McKee’s address. His response will also be televised and livestreamed on Capitol TV.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20250114_Salerno_RICurrent_StateOfTheStateAddress-0014-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-12 16:11:44.352884

(Photo: Getty Images/Jon Tetzlaff)Budget airline Avelo is closing two of its three operating bases in North Carolina, decreasing service for customers in the state.
The airline is streamlining its fleet, shuttering three bases nationwide and consolidating its network around four remaining bases, the company announced last Tuesday. 
Raleigh-Durham International Airport (RDU), the second busiest in the state, and Wilmington International Airport (ILM) will no longer serve as operating bases for Avelo. 
“Those two airports are larger airports with lots of capacity on competing routes,” Avelo Airlines communications manager Courtney Goff told NC Newsline.
The closures come as Avelo also announced it’s ending its controversial deportation flights January 27 and closing its base at Mesa International Airport in Arizona. 
The airline began a charter program for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration Customs and Enforcement agency in May 2025, NC Newsline previously reported.
“The program provided short-term benefits, but ultimately did not deliver enough consistent and predictable revenue to overcome its operational complexity and costs,” Goff said.
But Goff denied that the closures of other bases were connected to controversy over the airline’s work with ICE, saying the airline did not see a decline in customers. Avelo flew a record 2.6 million customers on scheduled commercial service in 2025, 11% higher than in 2024.
Avelo is known for serving smaller, regional airports that often don’t have direct flights from other carriers. It functions on a point-to-point network, as opposed to the hub-and-spoke model, which connects passengers through larger airports — more common for full-service, legacy airlines.
The airline will continue service from RDU to New Haven, Conn. (HVN) and Rochester, N.Y. (ROC), according to the Jan. 6 announcement, which are both also served by low-cost competitor Breeze Airways. Avelo nixed the routes connecting RDU to Grand Rapids, Mich. (GRR) and Wilmington, Del. (ILG); it was the only carrier offering these flights. 
A spokesperson for RDU said the airport continues to house a wide range of airlines and destinations from which travelers may choose. 
At ILM, Avelo still has flights to New Haven; Nashville, Tenn. (BNA); Tampa, Fla. (TPA); and Baltimore, Md. (BWI). 
“These routes have the most demand and limited capacity and they currently work well within our network,” Goff said. “There are also opportunities to add seasonal service to ILM and RDU as scheduling and demand permits.”
Concord-Padgett Regional Airport (USA) near Charlotte continues as a base, seeing an increase in service on some of its routes.
The Charlotte-area base employs more than 75 crewmembers for Avelo, according to Goff. The airline’s operations at the airport began in May 2024, and Avelo has served more than 230,000 customers on over 2,000 flights at Concord-Padgett Regional Airport since then. 
Changes have begun rolling out and will be completed in the spring, Goff said. 
Brett Snyder, president of airline industry blog Cranky Flier, said this change marks a division in North Carolina.

Mark Kelly sues Hegseth over penalties for 'illegal orders' video,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/arizona-us-sen-mark-kelly-sues-hegseth-over-penalties-illegal-orders-video,,"WASHINGTON — Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly sued Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and the department on Monday for trying to demote Kelly’s retirement rank and pay after he appeared in a video where he and other lawmakers told service members they didn’t need to follow illegal orders. Kelly’s suit, filed in the federal district court for the District of Columbia, says attempts by the Trump administration to punish him violate the First Amendment, the separation of powers, due process protections and the Speech and Debate clause of the Constitution.“Pete Hegseth is coming after what I earned through my twenty-five years of military service, in violation of my rights as an American, as a retired veteran, and as a United States Senator whose job is to hold him—and this or any administration—accountable,” Kelly wrote in a statement. “His unconstitutional crusade against me sends a chilling message to every retired member of the military: if you speak out and say something that the President or Secretary of Defense doesn’t like, you will be censured, threatened with demotion, or even prosecuted.”Kelly appeared in the video alongside Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, Colorado Rep. Jason Crow, Pennsylvania Reps. Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan and New Hampshire Rep. Maggie Goodlander — all of whom are former members of the military or intelligence agencies, though none of the others are still subject to the military's legal system.President Donald Trump was irate after seeing the video, posting on social media that he believed it represented “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”DOD investigationThe Defense Department announced in late November that it was looking into “serious allegations of misconduct” against Kelly, a retired Navy captain, for participating in the video. Kelly said during a press conference on Capitol Hill in December the Defense Department investigation into him, along with one by the FBI into all of the lawmakers in the video, marked “a dangerous moment for the United States of America when the president and his loyalists use every lever of power to silence United States senators for speaking up.”Hegseth, who originally threatened to court-martial Kelly, said in early January the Defense Department would instead downgrade his retirement rank and pay. “Captain Kelly has been provided notice of the basis for this action and has thirty days to submit a response,” Hegseth wrote in a social media post. “The retirement grade determination process directed by Secretary Hegseth will be completed within forty five days.”Kelly said at the time he would challenge Hegseth’s course of action. First Amendment citedThe 46-page lawsuit marks the next step in the months-long saga, with Kelly asking a federal judge to declare the effort to demote him “unlawful and unconstitutional.”“The First Amendment forbids the government and its officials from punishing disfavored expression or retaliating against protected speech,” the lawsuit states. “That prohibition applies with particular force to legislators speaking on matters of public policy. As the Supreme Court held 60 years ago, the Constitution ‘requires that legislators be given the widest latitude to express their views on issues of policy,’ and the government may not recharacterize protected speech as supposed incitement in order to punish it.”The lawsuit alleges that the Pentagon’s actions against Kelly “also trample on protections the Constitution singles out as essential to legislative independence.” “It appears that never in our nation’s history has the Executive Branch imposed military sanctions on a Member of Congress for engaging in disfavored political speech,” the lawsuit states. ”Allowing that unprecedented step here would invert the constitutional structure by subordinating the Legislative Branch to executive discipline and chilling congressional oversight of the armed forces.”Kelly’s legal team asked the judge to grant “emergency relief” in their favor by Friday, Jan. 16.The case was assigned to Senior Judge Richard J. Leon, who was nominated to the bench by President George W. Bush.",,,,2026-01-12 15:58:20.015431

(Photo Illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Iowa produced 4.6 billion gallons of ethanol in 2025 — a figure consistent with the past two years and one that Iowa Renewable Fuels Association says could be higher if Iowa had access to carbon sequestration technologies. 
The call for carbon capture and sequestration comes from the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association at the start of Iowa’s 2026 legislative session, where debate around property rights and carbon sequestration pipelines are set to be top priority. 
A proposed carbon sequestration pipeline from Summit Carbon Solutions would connect to Iowa ethanol plants and transport their sequestered carbon dioxide to an underground storage site. This would allow ethanol plants to participate in the ultra-low carbon ethanol industry to produce things like sustainable aviation fuel and marine fuel, but the project has been contested in legal and legislative settings by landowners who feel the pipeline is not a public use worthy of the power of eminent domain. 
Under eminent domain, unwilling landowners can be forced to accept easements on their property at a price set by a county commission for projects considered in the public interest.

Nationally, the U.S. produced 16.4 billion gallons of ethanol in 2025, according to the national Renewable Fuels Association. IRFA pointed out in a news release that while national ethanol production has increased annually over the past five years, Iowa production has remained “stagnant” at 4.6 billion gallons annually since 2023. 
While Iowa remains the top ethanol producing state in the country, in 2025 the Hawkeye State produced 28% of the nation’s ethanol supply, which is less than the share it produced in 2023 and 2024 when Iowa accounted for roughly 30% of the national share, according to the association. 
Figures from the U.S. Department of Agriculture show that increased ethanol production in the country has been driven primarily by a rise in ethanol exports. In March 2025, fuel ethanol demand for the month was equivalent to about 465 million bushels of corn, which was a 60-million bushel increase in monthly demand from 10 years prior.
Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw said Iowa is “behind in the race” as other states work to take advantage of incentives and market benefits of ultra-low carbon ethanol.
“Investment dollars flow to areas with a perceived competitive advantage,” Shaw said in a news release. “The states attracting significant investment have one thing in common – the ability to sequester carbon either locally or via pipeline infrastructure.” 
In addition to expanded markets, low carbon ethanol fuel producers and CO2 transportation pipelines are eligible for federal tax credits known as 45Z and 45Q. 
According to the association, if all 4.6 billion gallons of Iowa ethanol utilized carbon sequestration technology, it could bring $3 billion to the state via 45Z tax credits. 
Iowa ethanol advocates have also said the start of a carbon sequestration pipeline in Nebraska would cause Iowa to lose its “crown” as the top ethanol producing state, because business would shift to the more lucrative, ultra low-carbon ethanol producing facilities. 
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Iowa continues to have a significant lead over other states in ethanol production capacity with nearly double the number of plants in Nebraska.
“There is no reason why Iowa plants won’t grow in the near future if we maintain their access to the tools and technologies to compete,” Shaw said. 
Lawmakers passed a bill last year that restricted carbon sequestration pipelines’ abilities to utilize eminent domain in the state, but the bill was vetoed by Gov. Kim Reynolds.
Landowners opposing the pipeline project plan to lobby, beginning Tuesday, for similar legislation this year to limit the project’s ability to take land for its construction against landowner wishes.
The Summit pipeline has also been affected by a ban on eminent domain for CO2 pipelines through South Dakota. Recent filings from the company indicate it may change paths, pending state approval, to avoid crossing through South Dakota. 
Shaw said emerging ethanol markets are “demanding” ultra-low carbon ethanol. 
“Iowa needs carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) and conservation-smart agriculture practices to be attractive,” Shaw said. “IRFA will continue to support legislation that enhances landowner rights, streamlines the permitting process, and maintains a viable path forward for CCS. Our future depends on it.”

Ron DeSantis announced Monday that the state’s insurer of last resort has half a million fewer policyholders and will slash rates for its remaining users.
Policyholders with Citizens Property Insurance Corp., the state-backed program providing insurance to high-risk Floridians, will see their rates reduced in the spring by 8.7% statewide. South Florida counties like Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm-Beach will see the largest decrease in rates, averaging roughly 13.4%.
Moreover, the number of policies held by Citizens dropped to its lowest level in 14 years: from 1.3 million in 2023 to 400,000. This is considered a good sign for Florida’s insurance market because, generally, the larger Citizens is, the worse the market is doing.
“So, you’ve never really seen, I don’t think, rate reductions — certainly with Citizens — at this level anytime in modern memory that anyone can talk about,” DeSantis said during a press conference in Davie Monday morning. “And so today, we are happy to announce historic reductions.  … The vast, vast majority of Citizens policyholders will receive a significant reduction.”
Citizens Insurance has faced its share of controversy, particularly after it expanded following major hurricanes after 2018 as private companies fled the market. Premiums have since skyrocketed, leaving Citizens the sole option for many.
And in 2023, a new state law allowed Citizens to steer claim disputes to the Division of Administrative Hearings instead of going into state trial courts, Politico reported. Citizens had a staggering win rate of 90% of challenged claims through this hearing process, compared to winning just 55% of the time when claims would be battled out in circuit court, ProPublica reported.
By county, here are the four that will see the largest rate reductions:

Broward: 27,000 homeowners will see an average reduction of 14.1%.
Miami-Dade: 42,000 homeowners will see an average reduction of nearly 14%.
Palm Beach: 26,000 homeowners will see an average reduction of 11.9%.

For those who had hoped the New Year might usher in a period of renewed calm in American policy and politics, this first week has been yet another profound disappointment. Topping the list of worrisome developments was President Donald Trump’s decision to use U.S. military personnel to arrest the president of Venezuela Niclas Maduro and his wife.
Trump’s action to decapitate the leadership of a sovereign nation and quote “run” the oil rich country going forward has prompted protests and deep concern across the nation and the world about violations of international law and the U.S. Constitution. And one of the many American elected officials to voice such concerns has been North Carolina Fourth District Congresswoman Valerie Foushee. As Newsline learned in a recent extended interview, Foushee is strongly opposed to putting armed forces personnel in jeopardy in service of another nation-building exercise that she views as unlawful.
We examined several other subjects, including the the failure of Foushee’s GOP colleagues in Congress to renew federal subsidies for Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act, the un-American actions of ICE and border patrol agents, the anniversary of the January 6, 2021 insurrection and President Trump’s pardon of numerous perpetrators.

Little kicked off the 2026 legislative session by delivering the annual State of the State address at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise and submitting budget recommendations to the Idaho Legislature. 
During the approximately 30-minute address, Little also called for conforming with the federal tax changes championed by President Donald Trump. 
“Our plan uses a responsible mix of one-time and ongoing spending reductions to keep the budget structurally sound,” Little said during the speech. “Across state government, executive agencies will tighten their belts. We’re renegotiating contracts to save money. We’re reprioritizing initiatives. We’re finding operational efficiencies, and we will make disciplined use of cash balances and interest earnings. All of this serves to limit the impact on Idahoans as we right-size government.”

 Governor: Idaho is well positioned to ‘weather the revenue challenges ahead’

Heading into the 2026 legislative session, Idaho has faced revenue and budget shortfalls following five years worth of tax cuts approved by the Idaho Legislature that reduced state revenue by a cumulative total of $4 billion, according to the nonprofit Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy.
The most recent state budget reports issued prior to the new legislative session projected Idaho would end the current fiscal year 2026 with a budget deficit of $40.3 million. For next year, fiscal year 2027, state officials said Idaho could need to come up with an additional $600 million to $1 billion for the state budget. 
To avoid a budget deficit, Little recommended a series of cuts, funding shifts, freezes and reversions.

“A combination of factors has shifted us from years of record budget surpluses – driven by rapid population growth, business expansion, and one-time federal funds – to a period ahead that demands restraint,” Little said during Monday’s speech. “Thankfully, the way we have governed in recent years has positioned Idaho to weather the revenue challenges ahead.”
 Little recommended several spending cuts and transfers, including:

Removing $275 million in funding from the Idaho Transportation Department’s strategic initiatives fund, including $110 million for local highway districts;
Making the 3% budget cuts Little ordered last summer permanent, reducing spending by an estimated $120 million annually; 
Reducing funding for Medicaid expenses by $45 million by making the 4% reduction in Medicaid provider rates ongoing and reducing services by an additional $22 million.
Removing $30 million in funding for empowering parents grants, a program the Idaho Legislature ended last year;
Saving an estimated $20 million in personnel costs by taking back funding for more than 100 state positions that have been vacant for more than six months;
Pulling back $10 million in funding for local drinking water and wastewater projects through the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality;
Saving $9.5 million by declining to fund the enrollment workload adjustment for Idaho colleges and universities in fiscal year 2027.

 Idaho governor recommends leaving Medicaid expansion in place

Little did not recommend dipping into the state’s main savings account, the Budget Stabilization Fund, to balance the budget. 
“Taken together, these actions position us to achieve a balanced budget in the coming years and maintain confidence in Idaho’s economic future,” Little said during the speech. 
In addition to the cuts, Little also recommended declining to provide raises for state employees in fiscal year 2027 and did not recommend any new money for the Idaho Department of Lands to fight wildfires on state lands. 
“Folks, some of these budget decisions are tough, but we will emerge stronger in the long run because of them,” Little said. “This is what financial responsibility looks like – planning ahead and living within our means.”
‘It’s Groundhogs Day:’ Idaho Legislature to explore repealing Medicaid expansion — again

As Little delivered the speech, hundreds of Idahoans wearing red T-shirts that read “Medicaid unites us” filled the rotunda and the hallways at the Idaho State Capitol to voice support for preserving Medicaid. 
More than 60% of Idaho voters approved Medicaid expansion at the polls during the 2018 general election. As of December, Medicaid expansion provided health insurance to about 85,000 Idahoans who did not qualify for traditional Medicaid. Medicaid is one of the largest programs in the budget, but the federal government pays for 90% of the benefits while the state pays the remaining 10%.
In December, the Idaho Legislature’s DOGE Committee recommended repealing Medicaid expansion and House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, said repealing Medicaid expansion is on the table this year. 
But Little did not recommend repealing Medicaid expansion. Instead, he presented Idaho legislators with options for trimming Medicaid funding without repealing Medicaid expansion. 
“Of course, the health and wellbeing of our people is the key to achieve lasting success,” Little said, referencing the name of his budget plan, Enduring Idaho . “That’s why our Enduring Idaho plan safeguards access to healthcare, particularly in rural communities. We know the affordability and accessibility of healthcare tops the list of concerns for Idahoans right now.”
Little’s budget officials said the 2027 state budget Little proposed Monday is driven largely by so-called maintenance of operations budgets that are merely intended to keep the lights on at state agencies. Overall, Little’s budget officials said the fiscal year 2027 budget reduces state spending by 0.5% compared to the current state budget.

(Photo by Lori Kersey/West Virginia Watch) The minority party of the West Virginia House of Delegates hope to prioritize affordability and lowering the cost of living during the 2026 legislative session, which starts this week. 
The House Democrats held a news conference Monday to announce their “kitchen table” agenda for this year. The plan comes after they held a series of events across the state designed to hear about the issues facing state residents. 
“One of the biggest things was cost of living,” Minority Leader Sean Hornbucker, D-Cabell, said. “It was cost of living, and it was about everyone not being able to afford the power bill.”
The Democrats’ four focus areas are utility bills, health care, child care and housing, they said during the press conference. 
Democrats make up only nine of the 100 members of the House of Delegates. 
Last month, House Republicans announced their agenda for the year would focus on economic development and job creation. To address workforce development, GOP lawmakers said they’ll support another pay raise for the state’s teachers and school service personnel. 
Hornbuckle said the delegates hope to work with Republicans on bills that would address affordability. 
“We’ve never cared about credit,” Hornbuckle said. “So much so that a lot of my colleagues up here, we’ve served for 10, 8, 6-plus years. We have been talking about these things for the past decade. And I would tell you, if you’re talking about bipartisanship, we are super excited that the other side is listening to us now. And we’re going to hopefully do these things together.”
Hornbuckle said the party hopes to “aggressively attack” the cost of utility bills, introducing “several bills” to address the issue. 
Specifically, the Democrats say they will back legislation including bills to: 

Freeze utility rates until mid-2027 to allow lawmakers time to implement good policies for utility bills
Reform the West Virginia Public Service Commission, which is charged with approving or disapproving utility rate increases. 
Embrace an “all of the above” energy strategy so that the state is not dependent on one fuel to generate electricity 
Regulate “junk fees” on utility bills
Implement tax credits to cover interest for first-time homebuyers

The 60-day legislation session begins Wednesday.

We are independent and innovative. We act with integrity. And we approach our lives and our work with unwavering grit. 
Idaho Gov. Brad Little submits plan to balance state budget without repealing Medicaid expansion

Idaho is evolving. However, through the change we must commit ourselves to preserving our state as the place where opportunity thrives. We must dedicate ourselves to carrying forward the values that define us, making sure they endure for generations to come. 
We have some very special guests with us today – Idaho’s past three Governors and First Ladies: Idaho’s 32nd Governor, Governor Butch Otter and First Lady Lori; Idaho’s 31st Governor,  U.S. Senator Jim Risch and First Lady Vicki; and Idaho’s 30th Governor, Governor Dirk  Kempthorne and First Lady Patricia. 
These great Governors established the foundation for the success Idaho enjoys today. They brought a passionate, principled, and purposeful approach to leadership. Their decisions prioritized the long-term well-being of our state, which remains central to Idaho’s prosperity. 
This year, America turns 250 years old, a milestone that invites celebration, reflection, and hope. We also mark the 25th anniversary of 9/11. We remember the patriotism, unity, and sense of community that emerged from that tragedy. In the year ahead, we will build on that spirit by creating new opportunities for communities across Idaho to serve God and one another, and to show our love for our neighbors.
For two and a half centuries, the United States of America has been defined by the idea that freedom and opportunity belong to all. As we look to the future of our great country, this same idea will unite us as it always has. On this 250th commemoration of our country’s birth, let’s recognize and thank the generations who built this nation and those who defend it today – our active military members and veterans. 
As we kick off 2026, we reflect on all that has occurred over the past year – and it was an action packed year! The American people put Donald Trump back in the White House to send shock waves through a system that needed shaking up. 
Over the past year, President Trump has reshaped the federal government with a renewed focus on strength and accountability. America’s border is finally secure, and President Trump has put forward a pro-America agenda. 
Last year, in the Oval Office, I spoke with President Trump about how Idaho exemplifies his vision of America. We’re tough on crime. We protect the unborn. We eliminated CRT and DEI, and we led the nation in preventing men from competing in women’s sports. 
We also talked about how Idaho advances his Talent Strategy for America through Idaho LAUNCH. Together, we are putting the American worker first. Innovative workforce training programs power a modern economy, reinforce America’s competitive dominance over China, and help Idaho workers earn more and afford more.  
LAUNCH remains one of my top priorities for one simple reason – it’s working. 
More Idaho kids are choosing to stay in Idaho after high school than ever before. Post secondary enrollment is declining across the nation, but not in Idaho. Idaho is bucking the trend. Now in year two, LAUNCH is preparing young Idahoans to step directly into the most in demand jobs in our state, including skilled mechanics, healthcare workers, teachers and others. 
I am grateful for the Trump team’s support of LAUNCH. I was honored to host Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer last year to celebrate it. The Idaho Legislature and I will continue to partner together to help President Trump deliver on his promise to fight for the Idaho worker. 
For Idaho, the change from the last administration to having a Republican in the White House now is night and day. Under Biden, Idaho was kept in the dark. Now, we have a real partner at the federal level. 
Nowhere is this more obvious than in safety. Ask any law enforcement officer on the ground and they’ll tell you – under the last administration, immigration enforcement wasn’t just slowed down. It was put on ice. 
That changed one year ago. 
The American people delivered a mandate – enforce the law and keep our people safe.
And Idaho was ready to step up. 
Through Operation No Return, the Idaho State Police are removing dangerous illegal alien criminals from our neighborhoods. We’re talking about child rapists, stalkers, violent offenders, kidnappers, and drug traffickers. Idaho is among the safest states in the nation because of our Idaho State Police, and we sincerely thank them. 
Our partnership with the Trump administration is delivering real results in other areas as well. 
Last year, I was proud to host U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary RFK, Jr. We are showcasing Idaho’s leadership in the Make America Healthy Again movement, from restricting cell phone use in schools to eliminating candy and soda in the food stamp program. 
We’re also partnering with the Trump team to deliver results in energy dominance. The Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls has been at the forefront of nuclear energy research and innovation for decades. Today, under President Trump, America is experiencing a nuclear energy resurgence. We recently hosted Energy Secretary Chris Wright to celebrate the INL’s role in strengthening America’s competitiveness, boosting energy security, and protecting critical systems from cyber threats. In addition, the INL plays a critical role in supporting the U.S. Navy’s mission to safeguard global commerce, reinforce our national defense, and maintain America’s dominance over China. 
We’re also delivering results for rural communities through expanded federal  partnerships such as Shared Stewardship and Good Neighbor Authority. These flagship agreements better protect Idaho communities from wildfire, revitalize rural Idaho, and improve forest health through increased logging and active management. 
We’re also delivering a better quality of life for our people through joint efforts to expand access to outdoor recreation because Idahoans cherish and protect our public lands. 
And we’re creating jobs through faster and more efficient permitting for a variety of  projects, from mining to energy production. 
We’re also partnering with President Trump to deliver results for Idahoans by championing common-sense values, including education freedom and standing up for women’s sports. In fact, tomorrow Idaho goes before the U.S. Supreme Court to defend our first-in-the nation law to protect women’s sports. Idaho will continue to lead, and the rest of the country will continue to follow us, because common sense still matters. 
Of course, no look back at the past year would be complete without acknowledging a new addition to the American vocabulary – DOGE.
The term may be new but the principle behind it is something Idaho has long embraced – that elected leaders should always seek to reduce the government’s regulatory footprint in the lives of citizens and maximize government efficiency. 
During my time as Governor, together we made Idaho the least regulated state in the nation. We cut or streamlined 95 percent of rules and regulations. 
Last year, this body took the next step by passing the Code Cleanup Act, turning our attention – and our scissors – to state statutes. The agencies in my administration got to work, dedicating countless hours to scrub Idaho Code and deliver our Red Tape Rollback report to the Idaho Legislature last fall. The report follows through on a key component of my executive order, The Idaho Act. Our report recommends repealing 145,000 words from state law. The report provides a roadmap to remove outdated, duplicative, and unnecessary laws. 
I value the strong collaboration between our two branches as we streamline operations and pursue cost-saving reforms across state agencies. Through my executive order, The Idaho Act, and our work with the Legislature, we’re driving changes that improve performance because that’s what Idahoans expect. 
I want to thank the members of the Idaho Legislature for sharing my zeal for cutting red tape. You codified a practice I established through executive order in 2020 – Zero-Based Regulation – forcing a routine review of rule chapters annually. 
What was the outcome? 
Savings of more than one million dollars and state government that is more transparent, easier to navigate, and less burdensome for citizens and businesses. Looking ahead, we will remain laser-focused on cutting red tape and driving even bolder reforms that fuel economic growth and smarter government. We will do it with the same sharp, disciplined approach that has  proven to work in the past. 
That spirit of limited, efficient government is woven into our ethos here in Idaho, and it is one of the enduring values that will help us navigate the budget pressures before us. 
A balanced budget isn’t just required by the Idaho Constitution – it is the right thing to do. Today, I am delivering my recommendations for Fiscal Years 2026 and 2027. It is called the ENDURING IDAHO plan. 
The plan is named with purpose. “Enduring” captures a vision of Idaho that is resilient, strong, and built for the long term. Thanks to years of smart governing, our success is not temporary. It will stand the test of time if we continue to make smart decisions. 
A combination of factors has shifted us from years of record budget surpluses – driven by rapid population growth, business expansion, and one-time federal funds – to a period ahead that demands restraint.
Thankfully, the way we have governed in recent years has positioned Idaho to weather the revenue challenges ahead. Together, we used one-time federal funds responsibly – one one time needs, not ongoing programs that would expand long-term obligations. We invested in  critical infrastructure – roads, water, sewer systems, broadband, and state parks, while eliminating years of deferred maintenance in state buildings. We paid down debt, and Idaho now boasts the lowest per-capita debt in the nation. We strengthened our reserves to record levels, earning the coveted AAA credit rating only a handful of states achieve. 
Taken together, these actions position us to achieve a balanced budget in the coming years and maintain confidence in Idaho’s economic future. 
Our ENDURING IDAHO plan makes way for Idaho to conform to the Trump tax cuts achieved through the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” 
Idaho already ranks third in the nation for our tax friendliness, but the cost of living remains high. At a time when everything costs more, the Trump tax cuts will provide real relief. They will put more money back in the pockets of Idaho’s seniors and working families so they can afford the basics and breathe a little easier. The Trump tax cuts will help Idaho compete for jobs and investment, and they will preserve the core principles I have long advocated for in Idaho’s tax system – simple, fair, predictable, and competitive. 
As we strive to make life more affordable for Idahoans, my plan ensures the resources are in place to deliver those tax cuts to Idahoans. 
Families and businesses across the country are grappling with rising costs, particularly in health care, and states everywhere are feeling the same strain. In Idaho, a fast-growing population adds to that pressure. 
However, Idaho’s approach to balancing the budget stands in stark contrast to our  neighbor – the State of Washington. Washington just broke the record for the biggest tax increase in their history! It is no surprise that Washington business owners who love faith, family, freedom, and keeping more of what they earn are ditching the Evergreen State and coming to Idaho. 
Unlike Washington, Idaho won’t raise taxes to balance the state budget. In Idaho, we will right-size spending to match the people’s means. 
Last year, our revenue forecast decreased by close to 14 percent in a few months. That change was driven by several factors – a different approach in the Legislature to revenue forecasting, historic tax cuts, softer sales tax collections as consumer spending adjusted, and ongoing uncertainty around interest rates and the national economy. 
Responsible leadership means acting early, not waiting for challenges to grow. That’s why we took deliberate steps to right-size spending and identify efficiencies across all agencies. 
But we were clear on one thing: K-12 public schools were not subject to cuts.
I sincerely thank our state agency directors and their teams for their dedication to helping  balance the state’s budget. These are truly top-notch professionals and proud Idahoans committed to doing what’s best for our state. We deeply appreciate our agency directors and state employees. 
Looking ahead, our ENDURING IDAHO plan balances the budget without cutting into public schools, and we are going to do it while preserving the things that matter most to our  long-term wellbeing as a state. 
Here’s how. 
Our plan uses a responsible mix of one-time and ongoing spending reductions to keep the  budget structurally sound. Across state government, executive agencies will tighten their belts. We’re renegotiating contracts to save money. We’re reprioritizing initiatives. We’re finding operational efficiencies, and we will make disciplined use of cash balances and interest earnings. All of this serves to limit the impact on Idahoans as we right-size government. 
Just as importantly, we will protect Idaho’s financial foundation. We will keep money in the bank so we can keep our AAA credit rating. We won’t deficit spend, and we won’t add new debt like Congress does. 
Our plan also right-sizes funding for online schools, enhancing accountability and ensuring long-term sustainability for this important school choice option for thousands of Idaho families. 
Folks, some of these budget decisions are tough but we will emerge stronger in the long run because of them.  
This is what fiscal responsibility looks like – planning ahead and living within our means. 
Our ENDURING IDAHO plan was carefully designed with strategy and foresight to protect what matters most – the things that will keep Idaho strong today, tomorrow, and decades to come. 
And that starts with our public schools. 
Together, we’ve increased state support for public schools by 70 percent since I first took  office. We significantly raised teacher pay and invested seven times more in literacy programs, driving better reading scores. We made historic investments in school facilities that also served as property tax relief, and we added more discretionary funding so schools can stay flexible and responsive to local needs. 
I appreciate Superintendent Debbie Critchfield for her strong partnership in supporting education. She also deserves credit for advancing new solutions for special education students in our public schools.
Education will always be my top priority. Our ENDURING IDAHO plan keeps public schools whole and ensures classroom funding is protected. Idaho’s public schools are the heart and soul of our communities – and our children are our future – which is why, even in a year of reduced revenues, schools remain our top priority. 
A strong economy for Idaho – now and into the future – requires an adaptable workforce, which is more important than ever in a world where jobs seem to be changing at lightning speed. Our ENDURING IDAHO plan preserves Idaho LAUNCH so that we can support President Trump’s goal to expand the working class – the people who drive our economy. 
The strength of Idaho’s future also relies on the vitality of our rural communities and  agriculture sector. That’s why our plan maintains the water infrastructure investments we fought for last year. The ENDURING IDAHO plan delivers for our farmers and ranchers – the people  who feed and fuel Idaho. 
Of course, the health and wellbeing of our people is the key to achieve lasting success. That’s why our ENDURING IDAHO plan safeguards access to healthcare, particularly in rural communities. We know the affordability and accessibility of healthcare tops the list of concerns  for Idahoans right now. Over the next five years, thanks to the leadership and vision of Idaho’s congressional delegation and President Trump, Idaho will invest nearly one billion federal dollars to improve the accessibility and affordability of rural health care. 
This investment includes more than $150 million to strengthen the health care workforce pipeline serving our rural communities. Also, through my ENDURING IDAHO plan, we will build on the progress we’ve already made to address our physician shortage, committing another  $1 million to support graduate medical education. 
This plan tackles one of the most important aspects in the lives of the Idahoans we serve because a healthy Idaho is a thriving Idaho. 
My friends, the state of our state is strong. We do face challenges, but we have laid a solid foundation for enduring, long-term prosperity. 
That foundation was built not by today’s leaders alone but through the work of those who came before us. 
Governor Otter guided Idaho through the most severe economic downturn in a century, reinforcing the proper role of government and drawing a clear line between what is nice and what is necessary. 
Governor Risch delivered record property tax relief when homeowners badly needed it. 
Governor Kempthorne made lasting, foundational improvements to Idaho’s transportation system.
And the proof is clear – Idaho’s fundamentals remain among the strongest in the nation. Your dollar stretches farther here than anywhere else. Our unemployment rate is among the lowest in the nation. We lead in personal income growth, and our economic activity continues to outpace most states, reflecting a diverse and resilient economy. Jobs are growing, and Idaho’s healthy business climate remains a magnet for employers, talent, and investment. 
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again – if you’re going to bet on any state, bet on Idaho. 
As we approach the 250th birthday of our great nation, we honor our past as we look boldly to the future. We will roll up our sleeves and get to work for the people of Idaho, guided by our enduring values – grit, faith, family, and freedom.  
Thank you, and may God bless Idaho and the United States of America.

(Photo courtesy of Lizzy Hayes)In downtown Portland, as hundreds of Mainers gathered for an anti-ICE protest Saturday, others were there to gather signatures for a petition to repeal recreational marijuana in Maine. 
Though, they didn’t present it as such. It’s about the testing of cannabis, one petitioner said. 
Misrepresentation of this citizen initiative by signature gatherers has been documented across the state over the last few days. On Monday, state legislators asked the overseer of elections, Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, what could be done about it. 
“Petitioners have a First Amendment right to say whatever they want to say,” Bellows said during a meeting of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee.
Sen. Craig Hickman (D-Kennebec), committee co-chair, chimed in, “You have a right to lie under the First Amendment.”
Maine has a citizen-initiated referendum process that allows average people to propose statutes or constitutional amendments to be put on the ballot if they gather enough signatures. Bellows doesn’t have the authority to take any enforcement action over the truth of what is being said about such petitions, only about the validity of what’s in the text, underscoring the legal limits to combatting misinformation. 
“We really encourage citizens to think about what you’re signing, why you’re signing it, and what it means, and to take the time to read the legislation,” Bellows said. 
Citizen’s initiative wants to roll back recreational cannabis use in Maine

In 2016, Maine voters legalized the recreational use of cannabis. The proposed ballot referendum would do away with the commercial cultivation, sale, purchase and manufacture of cannabis starting in 2028, while still allowing personal use and possession of up to 2.5 ounces. It would also create new testing and tracking requirements on medical cannabis, which the industry has resisted in recent years.
It is not uncommon for someone to sign a petition thinking it is about something else.
In 2024, for example, a person collecting signatures to try to get an independent candidate on the presidential ballot in Maine instead told people who ended up signing the petition that it was an effort to stop politicians from being able to trade stocks. The signees only later found out the true contents of what they’d signed when a law firm representing others who fell victim to the deceptive practices contacted them. 
This issue is also not unique to Maine. 
Nearby Massachusetts has a similar referendum effort underway to recriminalize cannabis in that state, and witnesses there have also accused signature-gatherers of misleading people, such as saying the effort was for affordable housing, reducing impaired driving or protecting youth from being jailed for cannabis.
The Massachusetts Secretary of State and Attorney General Office’s issued a joint advisory urging voters to read petitions carefully before signing and to contact local officials if they believe they were deceived.
Maine’s Department of the Secretary of State relies on the signature validation process to identify potential violations.
For example, the petition paperwork available to signees must include a copy of the actual statutory changes that would be made to the law should the referendum pass. 
Petitions also can’t be left unattended at a location, such as a campaign placing one by the door of an event and encouraging people to sign it on their way out. Only one person can circulate a given petition and that person has to personally witness each signature, taking an oath before a notary to as much. 
Expressing frustration with a few bad actors spoiling the referendum process for others, Assistant Senate Majority Leader Jill Duson (D-Cumberland) suggested creating a process to file complaints, though limited department resources and time would present challenges for that to work in practice. 
Absent enforcement authority, Bellows said she would tell the petition organizers that her department has received a significant number of complaints over the last several days about the activities of their circulators.  
Ultimately, as Hickman put it, when it comes to regulating this type of malfeasance: “It’s a gentleman’s agreement. It’s an honor system. People have to act as if they’re going to respect the letter of the law. There are bad actors and there are outlaws and there are people that are just going to do what they’re going to do, and there’s nothing any of us can do about it.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/6345180400742836777_720.jpg,,,2026-01-12 15:58:20.015431

Jan. 12, 2025 | ScreenshotThe University of Michigan Board of Regents unanimously voted to formally approve Kent Syverud as the school’s next president, with his term set to start on July 1. 
Syverud had served as the chancellor and president of Syracuse University for over a decade, but announced in August that he would be stepping down from his role at the end of the 2025-26 academic year. 
“I do believe Michigan has been, is now and must remain, the best public research university anywhere,” Syverud said just after the vote. “That has been my experience of Michigan.”
Mark Bernstein, the chair of the Board of Regents, highlighted Syverud’s experience as a former Michigan Law School professor and holder of two graduate degrees from the university, as well as his personal ties to Ann Arbor — having met his wife while at Michigan and marrying her on campus. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“He is a true Michigan success story, and his leadership will enable many more stories of growth, discovery, transformation and impact at Michigan,” Bernstein said. 
Regent Denise Ilitch agreed in her statement at the meeting, applauding Syverud’s “deep roots of Michigan.” 
“I was so impressed by his love of the university, which is second to none. He has the highest integrity, is extremely experienced, very well respected by all walks of life,” Ilitch added. “He really does define a Michigan man.”
Syverud will assume the position from interim President Domenico Grasso, who has held the position since former university President Santa Ono left Michigan in May 2025 to pursue a position leading the University of Florida. 
Ono was unanimously elected to that position later that month, but the Florida Board of Governors, which oversees the state’s public universities, voted down his nomination, citing his prior support of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at Michigan. 
Amid turmoil over protests and DEI fight, Santa Ono to depart University of Michigan presidency 

“Like many, I supported what I believed to be the original intent of DEI — ensuring equal opportunity and fairness for every student. That’s something on which most everyone agrees,” Ono wrote in a May 2025 op-ed explaining his decision to pursue the position in Florida. “But over time, I saw how DEI became something else—more about ideology, division and bureaucracy, not student success.”
Syverud referenced the attacks on the University of Michigan and higher education more broadly from the Trump administration in his remarks during the meeting.  
“These are not normal times. Our regents have had to step up in so many more demanding ways in recent years to keep this school going forward,” Syverud said, adding that he hopes the university will lead by “modeling each day in small ways and in big ones, the values and the ideas and the innovation and the civil engagement that this world so badly needs.”
Bernstein said that “American higher education faces more challenges now than at any point since World War Two,” similarly citing Trump’s attacks, which include federal investigations into certain university scholarships, and the school’s decision to end many DEI initiatives after executive orders from the Trump administration. 
“Given our position in the nation and in our state, it is imperative for us to have a leader who is prepared to meet these challenges, we need a leader with integrity and character and conviction,” he added. “We need a leader with experience who will provide stability and vision. We need a leader who understands our university, who knows this university firsthand, who knows what Michigan means to our students, to our faculty, to our state, to our society.”
Syverud’s election also comes as Michigan’s athletics department is under investigation for a series of scandals within the university’s athletics programs, most recently the firing of head football coach Sherrone Moore, who is accused of having an inappropriate relationship with a staffer and for lying during the investigation into that affair. Former assistant football coach Matthew Weiss is also facing felony charges related to a computer hacking scheme that allegedly targeted student athletes.

As we commence the New Year, few if any subjects raise greater concerns for the wellbeing of Americans than the ongoing global environmental crisis. From climate change to the growing and widespread prevalence of toxic chemicals, to the Trump administration’s ongoing war against environmental protection regulations, this past year has been another deeply worrisome one for the health of our planet.
And while it will clearly be difficult to effect the public policy turnaround that’s so urgently needed anytime very soon, one predicate that will be absolutely necessary is a continuing flow of accurate information and on this front, North Carolina is fortunate to have one of the nation’s best and most knowledgeable environmental reporters – Lisa Sorg of Inside Climate News.

Stephen Spencer Pittman, 19, of Madison, is facing federal charges for using fire to maliciously damage or destroy a building involved in interstate commerce, according to a probable cause affidavit in the U.S. Southern District of Mississippi.
The Beth Israel Congregation synagogue also houses the offices of the Institute for Southern Jewish Life, which provides school programs and traveling rabbinical services to Jewish congregations across the South. 
The predawn fire Saturday reduced the historic synagogue’s library and administrative offices to charred ruins and left smoke damage throughout the building, the same one the Ku Klux Klan bombed in 1967 for its rabbi’s support of civil rights.

In a striking parallel, Pittman is alleged to have set fire to the same part of the octagonal building that burned in the 1967 attack – a wing facing a parking lot exit on Old Canton Road. 
Pittman was scheduled to make an initial court appearance Monday afternoon. Federal investigators quickly identified Pittman as a person of interest, according to the affidavit, which includes text messages he allegedly sent to his father in the course of setting the fire. 
The father pleaded for his son to return home, the affidavit says, but Pittman “replied back by saying he was due for a homerun and ‘I did my research.’” 
Pittman is alleged to have confessed to his father, who later contacted the FBI and provided GPS data showing Pittman was at the synagogue early Saturday morning. 
The son “laughed as he told his father what he did and said he finally got them,” says the affidavit from Nicholas Amiano, an FBI agent in the Jackson division. 
Amiano said Pittman purchased gasoline from Mac’s Gas in Ridgeland, where he also removed the license plate from his truck. Then he drove to the synagogue, used an ax to break through one of the windows, went inside, poured gasoline and lit it on fire with a torch lighter. 
Once at Beth Israel, Pittman also texted his father a photo of the back of the synagogue writing “there’s a furnace in the back,” “Btw my plate is off,” “Hoodie is on” and “and they have the best cameras.” 
Investigators recovered a burnt cell phone believed to be Pittman’s and a hand torch found at the synagogue by a member of the congregation, the affidavit says.  
Security camera video obtained by Mississippi Today shows a hooded person splashing liquid inside the lobby of the synagogue, spraying his legs in the process. A screengrab of the security footage is included in the FBI affidavit.

Mayor John Horhn said Monday the suspect drove himself to a hospital after he was burned in the course of setting the fire. He added there is a possibility the suspect will be charged with a hate crime. The affidavit states that Pittman sustained burns on his ankles, hands and face. 
“We thought that Mississippi was beyond that sort of thing,” Horhn said on Mississippi Today’s podcast. 
By Monday, news of the arson had drawn an outpouring of local support for Beth Israel. The mayor, multiple city council members, religious institutions and elected officials condemned the attack, which has also caught the attention of top officials at the U.S. Department of Justice. 
In a statement to Mississippi Today, Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, a Republican who has long lived near the synagogue, condemned the attack.
“The burning of Beth Israel Synagogue was an act of religious hatred against a place meant to offer prayerful peace and comfort,” Hosemann said. “This was not only an attack on a house of worship, but also an offense against the religious freedom protected by our Constitution. Such acts threaten all of us, regardless of faith. The perpetrator should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” 
News of the attack also reverberated internationally over the weekend. Harmeet Dhillon, the Justice Department’s assistant attorney general for civil rights, wrote on the social media site X that she was “personally involved and my team is in touch with the US Attorney’s office locally.”
Other officials who publicly condemned the attack include the Democratic leaders in Congress, Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, and New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani.
Pittman was a multi-year honor roll student and varsity baseball player at St. Joseph Catholic School in Madison, according to previous local news reports. 
After graduating from St. Joseph in 2024, Pittman played baseball at Coahoma Community College. 
“I am blessed to announce I will be commuting to Coahoma Community College to play baseball,” Pittman posted on X in 2023. “Thank you God and everyone who has helped me along the way! Go tigers!”
Pittman posted regularly on his X account, often about baseball and Christianity. Many posts pair videos of him practicing his swing in a batting cage with a captioned Bible verse. 
His most recent post, on Jan. 6, links to a webpage called One Purpose, which describes itself as a faith-based community for men focused on “​​Scripture-backed fitness. Brotherhood accountability. Life-expectancy maxxing.”
He was an outfielder and played in at least 10 games for Coahoma Community College, according to the Mississippi Association of Community Colleges Conference. 
Before law enforcement officials revealed Pittman’s name Monday, Pittman’s name and photograph no longer appeared on the Coahoma Community College’s online roster. The community college did not immediately respond to a phone call requesting comment on Monday.
A gathering of religious leaders across Jackson planned for later this week has shifted its focus to uplifting Beth Israel in the wake of the attack. The citywide prayer service will be held at 6 p.m. Thursday at Thalia Mara Hall, according to a city press release.

Free.,Democrats clash with Noem over new limits on oversight visits to immigration facilities,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/democrats-clash-noem-over-new-limits-oversight-visits-immigration-facilities,,"WASHINGTON — A dozen Democratic members of Congress Monday asked a federal judge for an emergency hearing, arguing the Department of Homeland Security violated a court order when Minnesota lawmakers were denied access to conduct oversight into facilities that hold immigrants.The oversight visits to Minneapolis ICE facilities followed the deadly shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross. Federal immigration officers have intensified immigration enforcement in the Twin Cities following the shooting, leading to massive protests there and across the country. “On Saturday, January 9—three days after U.S. citizen Renee Good was shot dead by an ICE agent in Minneapolis—three members of Congress from the Minnesota delegation, with this Court’s order in hand, attempted to conduct an oversight visit of an ICE facility near Minneapolis,” according to Monday’s filing in the District Court for the District of Columbia. Democratic U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar, Angie Craig and Kelly Morrison of Minnesota said they were denied entry to the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building shortly after arriving for their visit on Saturday morning.Lawmakers said in the filing the Minnesotans were denied access due to a new policy from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The new Noem policy, similar to one temporarily blocked by U.S. Judge Jia Cobb last month, requires seven days notice for lawmakers to conduct oversight visits.“The duplicate notice policy is a transparent attempt by DHS to again subvert Congress’s will … and this Court’s stay of DHS’s oversight visit policy,” according to the new filing by lawyers representing the 12 Democrats.DHS cites reconciliation billNoem in filings argued the funds for immigration enforcement are not subject to a 2019 appropriations law, referred to as Section 527, that allows for unannounced oversight visits at facilities that hold immigrants.She said that because the facilities are funded through the “One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act” passed and signed into law last year, the department does not need to comply with Section 527.The OBBBA, passed through a congressional process called reconciliation, is allowed to adjust federal spending even though it is not an appropriations law.“This policy is consistent with and effectuates the clear intent of Congress to not subject OBBBA funding to Section 527’s limitations,” according to the Noem memo.  Congress is currently working on the next funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security. The lawmakers in their filing argue “members of Congress must be able to conduct oversight at ICE detention facilities, without notice, to obtain urgent and essential information for ongoing funding negotiations.”“Members of Congress are actively negotiating over the funding of DHS and ICE, including consideration of the scope of and limitations on DHS’s funding for the next fiscal year,” according to the filing.The Democrats who sued include Joe Neguse of Colorado, Adriano Espaillat of New York, Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Robert Garcia of California, J. Luis Correa of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Veronica Escobar of Texas, Dan Goldman of New York, Jimmy Gomez of California, Raul Ruiz of California, Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and Norma Torres of California.Neguse, the lead plaintiff in the case, said in a statement that the “law is crystal clear.”“Instead of complying with the law, DHS is abrogating the court’s order by re-imposing the same unlawful policy,” he said. “Their actions are outrageous and subverting the law, which is why we are going back to court to challenge it — immediately.”",,,,2026-01-12 14:58:38.233623

(Photo by Perry Bennett/West Virginia Legislative Photography)Del. Mike DeVault, R-Marion, resigned from the West Virginia House of Delegates Monday, meaning two seats in the legislative body will remain vacant as the 2026 legislative session is set to start on Wednesday.
DeVault sent his resignation letter to House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, R-Clay, on Monday morning. He said the decision to leave the body was “not made lightly” and came after “careful consideration” of his “personal and professional circumstances.” The resignation was effective as of 8 a.m. Monday.
“Serving the constituents of District 74 has been a profound honor, and I am grateful for the trust my community has placed in me over the years,” DeVault wrote in the letter. “I appreciate the support and camaraderie of my colleagues and the staff during my tenure. I will always cherish the experiences and the collaborative efforts we’ve shared to serve our state.”
DeVault previously served as vice chair of the House Economic Development Committee and sat on the body’s Energy and Manufacturing subcommittee, the Energy and Public Works committee, the Committee on Government Organization and the subcommittee for Local Governments.
DeVault was first elected to the House in 2022. He won reelection for his seat in 2024. During his three sessions in the House, he sponsored 128 pieces of legislation, four of which he served as lead sponsor on. Eight of the bills DeVault signed on to — two in 2023, five in 2024 and one in 2025 — became law.
His resignation follows that from former Del. Brandon Steele, R-Raleigh, in December. Steele, an attorney by trade, cited that his resignation was necessary due to “professional opportunities” arising that would “interfere” with his work in the House.
Last week, longtime Sen. Donna Boley, R-Pleasants, resigned from the State Senate, leaving one vacancy in that body as session is set to start this week. Boley was the longest continuously serving state senator in West Virginia history, having held the office for more than 40 years. Boley, 90 years old, said her resignation came as she needed to focus more on her family and her health.

The grant will support the continued development of the Michigan Consortium for Higher Education in Prison, and will help bring humanities-centered education modules to incarcerated individuals across the state.
“A college education is a significant means by which these students experience personal transformation, develop the human skills necessary for success in the workplace and the community, and change the narrative of their lives in ways that permit them to flourish as people, citizens and neighbors,” the consortium’s Steering Committee Chair Richard Ray said in a statement.
Ray added that Mellon’s partnership in the organization’s work will allow it to continue to build on efforts to sustain and expand the higher education-in-prison ecosystem in Michigan, “which is a huge win for the citizens of our state,” he said.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The organization will use the grant to hire its first-ever executive director, enhancing coordination and advocacy capabilities, and to establish a competitive subgrant program from member institutions — as well as supporting the humanities-based curriculum effort and community building initiatives.
As a statewide consortium, the organization is made up of 14 colleges and universities providing higher education in 17 Michigan correctional facilities. It serves 1,300 incarcerated students and advocates for policies to expand higher education. The goal is to not only offer expanded education access, but to do so while affording incarcerated students restored dignity, personal agency and economic opportunity.
Michigan College Access Network will help administer the grant.
“As we work toward Michigan’s Sixty by 30 attainment goal, it’s crucial to include populations that are too often overlooked in the college conversation, including Michigan’s incarcerated people,” Ryan Fewins-Bliss, MCAN executive director, said in a statement. “This generous support from the Mellon Foundation will strengthen college-in-prison programs across the state, offering more incarcerated individuals the chance to reenter society with valuable skills that lead to good, stable jobs and strengthen their communities.”
Shawn England is the consortium’s affinity group project manager. He earned a bachelor’s degree from Calvin University while incarcerated. England said he has seen the benefits of humanities-based education in prison learning environments.
“This sort of education is essential to cultivating the kind of reflective, empathetic citizens our communities need,” England said in a statement. “Studying literature, history, philosophy and the arts helped me grapple with ethical questions, understand diverse human experiences, and imagine new possibilities for my life. This is an investment in people’s capacity to grow, connect and contribute meaningfully to society. Now that I have left prison and am working in the outreach community, I have seen how fully my education in the humanities prepared me to be a productive citizen, and, more importantly, a good human being.”

The Mill Workspace Marks a Decade of Growth With Wilmington Renovations and Seaford Expansion
WILMINGTON, DE – As The Mill approaches its ten year anniversary this April, the coworking community is entering a year defined by growth, reflection, and expansion. From renovations to its original Wilmington space to plans for a brand new downstate location, the year ahead marks an important milestone for the locally founded workspace.
A Return to the Fourth Floor
Renovations to The Mill’s fourth floor at Market West in downtown Wilmington are nearing completion, bringing members back to the very space where the coworking community first opened in 2016. Over the coming weeks, members will begin moving into offices as the refreshed flagship floor reopens.
Updates to the space include new light fixtures, flooring, and furniture, all designed to support today’s work styles while preserving the collaborative feel that has long been central to The Mill experience. The reopening of the fourth floor also creates new opportunities for entrepreneurs, remote professionals, and growing teams interested in joining the Wilmington location. Offices are currently available, and tours are being offered for those looking to secure space in the historic Market West building.
Expanding Downstate With The Mill Seaford
Later this year, The Mill will extend its footprint beyond northern Delaware with the opening of The Mill Seaford at the Nylon Capital Center. The new location represents the organization’s first downstate expansion and introduces its coworking model to a new market.
The Mill Seaford will include 18 private offices in a range of sizes and 28 dedicated open air desks. Members will also have access to phone booths, conference rooms, and a large community space featuring double height ceilings designed to support both focused work and community gatherings.
As with existing locations, The Mill Seaford will offer essential amenities including WiFi, printing, a mail room, and pantry access, creating a seamless workday experience. Those looking to establish a downstate docking station can reserve a desk or office now and receive 50 percent off the first six months.
Looking Ahead
As The Mill prepares to celebrate a decade of growth, its focus remains on evolving alongside the people and businesses that make up its community. By reinvesting in its original Wilmington location while opening a new chapter in Seaford, The Mill continues to create flexible, connected workspaces that support how and where people choose to work.
From longtime members returning to the fourth floor at Market West to professionals preparing to join the Seaford location later this year, the expansion reflects a shared commitment to collaboration, accessibility, and community driven growth.

The Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation is also looking into the incident, which occurred Friday night at the Maverick Lounge. 
The post Lander police chief expects arrest ‘in the next couple of days’ for bar fight death appeared first on WyoFile .","Authorities have not made an arrest in connection to a Friday night bar fight in Lander that resulted in a death, Lander Police Chief Kelly Waugh told WyoFile on Monday morning. 
However, the department is now investigating several persons of interest, and Waugh expects an arrest will be made “in the next couple of days,” he said. 
Officers responded to a report of the fight at about 11:15 p.m. Friday, according to the Lander Police Department’s press release. Waugh told WyoFile the incident occurred at the Maverick Lounge on Lander’s Main Street. 
Medics were called, but one person subsequently “succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced deceased,” the press release says. 
The department withheld the name of the victim “pending notification of next kin.” Waugh declined to confirm or deny the victim’s name Monday. 
The police press release did not offer details about the bar fight, nor did it mention what sparked the altercation. The statement did say detectives were still gathering information, including reviewing surveillance footage and talking to witnesses.
The Lander Police Department requested assistance from the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation in the ongoing investigation of the altercation. Waugh told WyoFile that the division is providing more resources and “boots on the ground.” 
When asked about the division’s involvement, Ryan Cox, the division’s commander, told WyoFile that it’s “common for smaller agencies to ask for assistance of experienced personnel to supplement their limited personnel resources.”
As of Monday morning, there were four individuals from the division and two from the Lander Police Department involved in the investigation. 
Waugh said the department will make another public announcement when there is an arrest.

(Getty Images)A bill to shield Hoosier parents from child welfare investigations solely for allowing their children age-appropriate independence cleared the House Judiciary Committee on Monday with bipartisan support.
House Bill 1035 advanced to the full House on a 12–1 vote after more than an hour of testimony and discussion.
Only Rep. Ryan Dvorak, D-South Bend, voted against the bill, citing concerns that its new “recklessness” standard could raise the threshold too high for state intervention in child welfare cases.
Another Democrat on the committee, Rep. Victoria Garcia Wilburn of Fishers, is a co-author and voted in favor.
The bill follows other proposals in recent years to broaden parents’ rights and prevent “unjust” Department of Child Services inquiries and investigations. Senate Enrolled Act 143, for example, was passed during the 2025 session and requires courts to give deference to parental rights in disputes with government regulators.
Authored by Rep. Jake Teshka, R-North Liberty, the latest measure pending before state lawmakers seeks to clarify that parents should not face DCS inquiries, court involvement or criminal consequences simply for allowing children to walk, bike, play outside or spend short periods alone — unless that decision is reckless and endangers the child’s health or safety.
“What this bill is, is a clarification bill,” Teshka told lawmakers. “It draws a clear legal boundary between ordinary childhood independence and actual neglect.”
Current law is ‘too vague’
Under current Indiana law, a child can be alleged to be a child in need of services, or CHINS, based on a lack of supervision, even when the activity is common and age-appropriate. 
Teshka said his bill seeks to change that standard.

The measure defines “independent activity” to include walking or traveling on foot or by bicycle, playing outdoors, remaining at home, or staying in a stationary vehicle without direct supervision. 
It additionally specifies that a child is not a CHINS “solely because the child engages in an independent activity,” unless a parent or guardian acted “so reckless as to endanger the health or safety of the child,” taking into account the child’s “maturity, condition and ability.”
The legislation also creates an affirmative defense in criminal neglect cases, allowing a parent to argue they “reasonably believed that an independent activity was not dangerous,” placing the burden on prosecutors to disprove that belief beyond a reasonable doubt.
Teshka said the goal is to give families clarity before they ever come into contact with the system.
“Parents should be able to look at the law and know where the line is,” he said. “This bill makes that line clear.”
He further argued that “vague” standards invite unnecessary government involvement in families’ lives.
“Under current law, a child can be alleged to be neglected based solely on a lack of supervision, even in cases where the child is age appropriate, the activity is ordinary and no reasonable assumption of danger exists,” Teshka added. “That vague standard invites over-reporting, subjective judgment calls, and in some cases even weaponizes complaints.”
While DCS often dismisses such cases, Teshka said families still endure intrusive investigations.
“In my opinion, that amounts to a process failure, even if the outcome is technically correct,” he said. “The standard should be danger, not disapproval.”
Preventing unnecessary, ‘long-term consequences’ for families
Hannah Tarr, a Columbus mother of six, told lawmakers her family has twice been subjected to DCS assessments in the past six months — both of which were ultimately unsubstantiated — based solely on allegations that she and her husband allow their children appropriate independence.
Children in her blended family range in age from 16 to just two weeks old. Tarr described how her older children have long helped care for younger siblings, but with “safety plans,” clear rules and support from neighbors.
Tarr said her four school-age children — ages 11, 10, 8 and 7 — ride their bikes to school and the park and stay home together for short periods.
“My oldest daughter was helping care for her younger siblings at the age of nine, something families have done for generations,” she said. “Our family thrived. … (Our kids) are capable because we’ve raised them to be capable.”










Giving children appropriate freedom is not neglect.


– Hannah Tarr, a Columbus mother of six


Tarr, who has volunteered as a court-appointed special advocate, or CASA, in Jennings County for nine years, said she has seen firsthand what true abuse and neglect look like, “but I also know what it looks like when ordinary parenting is misclassified and not screened out.”
“We have unintentionally replaced childhood with constant supervision, constant screens and constant intervention. We often call it gentle parenting, but it has slowly become fear-based parenting,” Tarr said. “Children are not learning how to assess risks. They’re not learning how to solve problems. They’re not learning confidence, resilience and dependence. Instead, they’re growing up anxious, dependent and afraid to try because their childhood is restricted.”
“Giving children appropriate freedom is not neglect,” she continued. “It is a necessity for their development.”
DeOnyae-Dior Valentina, executive director of the nonprofit Strength Over Struggle, drew on her experience as a former foster youth, telling lawmakers that “investigations, removal or court oversight — even when no harm has occurred — create instability, trauma and long-term consequences for children and families.”
“Under current law, families can be investigated or charged for allowing a child to walk to a store, play outside, stay home alone, or sit in a parked car — often without meaningful reconsideration of the child’s maturity ability or the actual level of risk involved,” Valentina continued. “Too often, families are pulled into the system not because a child is unsafe, but because of subjective judgments about parenting, poverty or cultural differences.”
She emphasized that the bill does not eliminate state intervention when children are actually in danger.
“Reckless endangerment remains illegal, and serious neglect remains criminal,” Valentina said. “What HB 1035 does is reduce unnecessary family separation and system involvement that does not improve outcomes for our children.”
Zach Stock with the Indiana Public Defender Council also voiced support, arguing that the bill would help courts and investigators distinguish between true neglect and reasonable parenting.
“This is allowing kids to do age-appropriate things without constant adult supervision,” Stock said. “That’s parenting. This law is not going to put any kids in danger.”
Questions about ‘recklessness’ language
Still, Dvorak worried whether the bill would raise the bar too high for intervention.
“My question hinges on the reckless issue,” Dvorak said during the hearing. “Is inserting this language about recklessness creating a new standard that is higher than the current standard to determine whether a child is in need of services?”

Stock responded that the measure would guide decision-making rather than eliminate it, helping DCS investigators screen out low-risk cases earlier.
Dvorak also questioned whether, under the bill, investigators would still intervene early enough in borderline cases.
Supporters countered that concern, however, by emphasizing that Teshka’s proposal preserves state authority when a child’s safety is truly at risk.
Garcia Wilburn separately cited a personal experience that shaped her support.
Shortly after moving to a new neighborhood in Noblesville, she said, a neighbor threatened to call DCS because her children — then 12, 7 and 4 — were riding bikes unsupervised.
“That really shook me to the core,” Garcia Wilburn said. “I really think that this bill strikes a really good balance.”
She added that overzealous investigations divert resources away from more serious cases.
“More people are burdened than we know with overzealous investigations,” Garcia Wilburn said, “and we could be using that workforce toward very egregious circumstances.”

(Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer)Although high and rising rents often are associated with big coastal states such as New York or California, new data shows that states once considered more affordable are seeing major rent hikes.
A new analysis from Premier Timber Frame Builders – based on data from Zillow’s Observed Rent Index, which tracks prices for both apartment units and single-family rental homes nationwide — shows that average monthly rents are climbing in the Midwest and portions of the South.
West Virginia saw the largest increase in average rent from 2024 to 2025, a 6% jump  over the past year, followed by Minnesota, Missouri and Illinois, all of which saw rent increased above 5%. Other states rounding out the top 10 include Mississippi, Kansas, Indiana, Wisconsin, Rhode Island and Connecticut.
In many Midwestern and Southern states, a flock of residents moving from coastal areas see more affordable housing opportunities, and with that, cities are grappling with rising population growth amid a finite supply of housing. The U.S. Census saw more apartments being completed in 2024 than any year since 1974, but there’s since been a slowdown in building starts.

The New Jersey Senate confirmed 16 judges Monday, a move that will bring the state’s judicial vacancies to the lowest level since Gov. Phil Murphy’s first year in office.
Vacancies on the Superior Court bench will fall to 11 after the jurists confirmed Monday are sworn into office. Murphy, a Democrat, leaves Trenton on Jan. 20 after two terms as governor.
Sen. Brian Stack (D-Hudson), the chamber’s judiciary chairman, said he’s happy with where the state is on judges now.
Governor’s order OKs jury service for people with criminal convictions

“We just need to keep this going and keep it up. As the appointments are coming up and as seats become vacant, we are committed to filling them as soon as we can. The Senate president has made that very clear,” Stack said. “As many meetings as it takes to get that done, we will.”
Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) was the Senate Judiciary Committee’s chair for more than a decade before becoming the chamber’s top-ranked official in 2022.
Court vacancies ballooned early in Murphy’s tenure, when he frequently butted heads with Democratic legislative leadership, and they surged again when the pandemic drew lawmakers’ focus away from court staffing.
The dearth of new judges pushed Chief Justice Stuart Rabner to issue a dire warning to lawmakers in May 2022, when 75 of the state’s 433 Superior Court seats were empty.
In some counties, Rabner ordered pauses to civil and divorce trials so the courts could move criminal, family, and domestic violence cases that require speedy resolutions. Those trials have since resumed.
Top court officials have said the judiciary can operate sustainably with as many as 30 vacancies.
Monday’s votes confirmed all but two of the pending Superior Court nominations made by Murphy. The Senate did not advance the nominations of Wyckoff chief municipal prosecutor Joseph Maurice and Cranford Planning Board member Molly Hurley Kellett.
Murphy nominations that are still pending will expire when new legislators are sworn in on Tuesday.
The Senate confirmed only one of Murphy’s nominees to the Superior Court in 2018, ballooning vacancies from the nine left at the end of Gov. Chris Christie’s tenure. Stack said he does not anticipate similar standstills when Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill takes office next week.
“Obviously, it’s not always easy to get through the interview process, but I think we’ll move these along pretty quickly now going forward,” he said. “That seems to be the commitment of Governor Sherrill.”

Dunleavy signed a bill recognizing tribes. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Former U.S. House Rep. Mary Peltola, a Democrat, has announced her candidacy for the U.S. Senate, challenging Republican incumbent Dan Sullivan.
Republicans control the U.S. Senate by a 53-47 margin. If Peltola were to defeat Sullivan, it would contribute to Democrats’ efforts to retake the chamber. 
While Alaska voted for President Donald Trump by a 13-point margin, indicating that Sullivan is favored, public opinion polling has shown Peltola is viewed positively by many Alaskans and is likely a competitive candidate.
Peltola served as Alaska’s at-large U.S. Representative from 2022 to 2024, was the first woman to represent Alaska in the U.S. House and was the first Alaska Native representative elected to Congress. She narrowly lost her bid for reelection in 2024 to Republican Nick Begich III.
In a video announcing her run for Senate, Peltola highlighted her roots: growing up on the Kuskokwim River and fishing every summer with her family, a subsistence tradition she continued raising her seven children. 
“Life is difficult here, and we know we have to take care of each other. DC people were shocked that I prioritized going back to Alaska in July to help put up fish for our family. But Alaskans understand,” she said in the video. 
“Growing up, Alaska was a place of abundance. Now we have scarcity,” she said. “The salmon, large game and migratory boards that used to fill our freezers are harder to find. So we buy more groceries with crushing prices.”
Peltola says she will focus on putting Alaska above Washington’s political self-dealing, bringing down grocery costs, protecting fisheries, lowering energy prices and building new housing. She repeated her agenda for Alaska: “fish, family and freedom.”
“Our future also depends on fixing the rigged system in DC that’s shutting down Alaska, while politicians feather their own nest,” she said.
Peltola pointed to Alaska’s past representatives to Congress, U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens and U.S. Rep. Don Young, as examples of leaders who prioritized Alaskans over politics. “It’s about time Alaskans teach the rest of the country what Alaska first, and really, what American first looks like,” she said.
Peltola has served in various tribal, advocacy and elected leadership positions. She served in the Alaska House of Representatives from 1999 to 2009, as the director of the Kuskokwim River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission from 2017 to 2022 and as a tribal judge for the Orutsararmiut Native Council Tribal Court based in Bethel from 2020 to 2021. 
The deadline to enter the race is June 1. In addition to Sullivan, three lesser-known candidates have also filed with the Alaska Division of Elections: Republican Fred Grauberger of Chugiak, undeclared candidate Sidney Hill of Palmer and Richard Grayson of Arizona. Another Democrat, Ann Diener, has also registered with the Federal Elections Commission but not with the Division of Elections.

A conservative group is demanding that Democratic leadership hold hearings on two Let’s Go Washington initiatives likely set to go before voters in November. 
IL26-001 would repeal changes made last year to a 2024 Let’s Go Washington initiative enshrining certain rights for parents of public school students. 
IL26-638 looks to block transgender girls from competing in girls’ sports.
Speaking to reporters Friday, both Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, and House Speaker Laurie Jinkins, D-Tacoma, said they don’t plan hearings on the measures, which are deeply unpopular among Democrats.
“I’m certain that we will not be passing either of those initiatives,” Pedersen said. “They’ll be up to the voters to decide.”
In a letter sent Monday, the Citizen Action Defense Fund argued that declining to hold legislative hearings on the initiatives is unconstitutional. The state constitution says initiatives “shall take precedence over all other measures in the legislature except appropriation bills and shall be either enacted or rejected without change or amendment by the legislature before the end of such regular session.”
If the initiatives don’t get hearings, “I am authorized to inform you that we will consider the available options to ensure compliance with the constitution,” reads the letter from Jackson Maynard, the defense fund’s executive director.
Both initiatives appear to have enough signatures to go before the Legislature, but the secretary of state’s office hasn’t certified them yet. 
The Citizen Action Defense Fund has also filed a lawsuit looking to block the parental rights rewrite that lawmakers passed last year. The case is pending in Thurston County Superior Court. 
House Bill 1296, which made last year’s revisions, was one of the most controversial bills passed in the 2025 legislative session. Democrats said the rewrite was necessary to clarify the earlier initiative backed by Let’s Go Washington.

When is the first cut-off?


By: Jerry Cornfield -  10:44 am





All legislation must clear several hurdles before it can reach the governor’s desk. And there are deadlines for each one.
One of the first arrives Feb. 4. That is when bills that will not cost the state money must be voted out of a policy committee. Three weeks isn’t much time. That’s why you’ll see votes taking place in committees this week.
Here is a draft of key cut-off dates. This will become official with legislative action today.
Two are most critical. Feb. 17 is the “house of origin” cut-off. That means bills must be passed out of the chamber where they originate and sent to the other chamber for consideration. Exceptions here are the budgets.

March 6 is the “opposite house” cutoff. This is the last day to consider legislation passed by the other chamber, except for budgets, bills necessary to implement budgets, matters that affect state revenue, and initiatives to the legislature.









No time to waste


By: Jerry Cornfield -  10:37 am





Sixty days will go fast. As soon as Monday’s pomp ends, the legislating begins. Ten committees – six in the House and four in the Senate – will hold meetings this afternoon.
One of the most notable will be the House Appropriations Committee at 4 p.m., where the public will be getting its first chance to weigh in on Gov. Bob Ferguson’s budget proposal. Lots of interest in this one. 
Interest is high. As of Sunday evening, 98 people have signed in to testify, and about 600 registered their opposition but didn’t want to speak. 
If you miss out on the budget discussion Monday, you will get another chance Tuesday when the Senate Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing on the governor’s proposal in its 4 p.m. meeting. And the House budget committee plans a second public hearing Wednesday.

(Photo courtesy of Uthmeier's office)A Florida jury found guilty “the man at the top of the pyramid” of the “Sex, Money, Murder” gang in Florida, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd and Attorney General James Uthmeier announced Monday.
The gang, a focus of statewide investigations, was led by Hernando Thompson, 36, the officials said. He was convicted by a jury after a trial in Polk County last week on five charges including racketeering, conspiracy to commit racketeering, and three counts of directing criminal gang activities.
“Make no mistake about it, for those who continue to say that drugs are low-level and nonviolent — if they speak those words, they are out of their mind, because drugs are anything other than low-level and nonviolent because it leads to shooting, it leads to putting guns to three-months-olds heads, it leads to robbery and murder,” Judd said during a news conference Monday. 
In 2022, then-Attorney General Ashley Moody announced that she and Judd dismantled the gang, arresting 13 leaders. Those arrests involved “a complex scheme to deal drugs in state prisons” and confiscation of more than $1.5 million in drugs. The 2022 investigation found gang members “sprayed the drugs onto pages of the bible, Koran, and greetings cards and then mailed them to gang members in the prisons.”
Polk County issued a warrant for Thompson’s arrest after that investigation. He turned himself in and was the last outstanding suspect from the 2022 case, according to Uthmeier’s office. 
Thompson’s sentencing — possibly five life sentences — is scheduled to take place next month. 
“We want to send a message: If you engage in this type of violence, if you run drugs and guns and violent behavior into communities, you are going to pay the price,” Uthmeier said.

According to Judd, the investigation included wiretapping Thompson, six search warrants, and seizure of $1.5 million in drugs, 18 firearms, and ballistic armor.
“If you are a gang member, a sex predator, drug trafficker, and you happen to be listening to this press conference: Unless you want to spend the rest of your life in a cage, I strongly encourage you to listen to the attorney general and the sheriff and relocate your operations from Florida,” statewide prosecutor Brady McVay said. 
“We’ve dismantled a lot of it,” Uthmeier said of the gang, but there are leads still being investigated, he said. 
Thompson was arrested in 2024 by Polk County for racketeering, conspiracy to commit racketeering, and three counts planning and directing criminal gang activities but bonded out.
“Judges have way too much discretion,” Uthmeier said. 
Thompson had 14 previous felonies, 10 previous misdemeanors and two stints in state prison in 2011-2013 and 2014-2015, Uthmeier’s office said.
His first arrest dates to 2003 in Orlando and later arrests included charges of aggravated assault, possession of marijuana, reckless driving, resisting arrest, carrying a prohibited weapon, battery domestic violence, sale of cocaine, and possession of cocaine.

Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Friday announced her pick to lead a new statewide independent child welfare watchdog office: Dawn Walters, an attorney who heads the Office of Advocacy at the New Mexico’s Children, Youth and Families Department.
Lujan Grisham made her selection in a letter to the state attorney general, ending the monthslong process to find a leader for the Office of the Child Advocate, established during the 2025 legislative session via House Bill 5.
Amid changes at CYFD, applications open for New Mexico’s new child advocate position

Walters will require state Senate approval of her appointment, before taking on a term through December 2031.
In an email to Source NM, Walters declined an interview saying she will not make further comments “until the Senate confirmation process is complete.”
The law requires the child advocate to be a lawyer, licensed social worker or psychologist with at least five years of experience in child welfare or juvenile justice. The duties of the office include responding and investigating complaints on behalf of children in state custody or families interacting with the state’s Child Youth and Families Department. The office is administratively attached to the New Mexico Department of Justice.
Proponents hailed the new office as a measure of oversight for the beleaguered CYFD and protection for children in state custody. The troubled agency has faced increased criticism for rising costs of settlements for child death and maltreatment while in state custody, as well as legal probes into injuries from private security guards and suicides of foster children.
State Rep. Michelle Paulene Abeyta (D-To’hajilee), HB5’s legislative sponsor and chair of the search committee, told Source NM Monday in a phone call Monday that Walters’ appointment is the result of a smooth search process by the committee to meet the deadlines in the law.
The seven-member bipartisan search committee narrowed applicants from about 20 to three between November and December, recommending three finalists for the governor’s final selection.
“Now we’re at a position where the committee intends to lend its full support to Dawn Walters’ confirmation with the Senate,” Abeyta said.
Abeyta commended Walters’ vision for expanding the office beyond the state’s urban areas.
“In the interview, she described wanting to make sure that children from all over the state, no matter their geographical location, had access to this office and the ability to be heard,” Abeyta said.
Abeyta said the next step is to ensure the office is fully funded in the 2026 legislative session.
“It’s going to be important that we have adequate funding and resources for Ms. Walters to run this office,” she said. “We plan to advocate for the funding that she needs to do the job, to build her team, to get working on day one.”
Walters, according to her LinkedIn profile, received her law degree from the University of Pittsburgh in 2015, and worked as a staff attorney for children in Pennsylvania for seven years. She’s worked at CYFD for nearly three years. She’s directed the Office of Advocacy for a little over a year, which helps youth and foster families with concerns about rights violations “obtain information, facilitate communication,” or further investigations at the agency.
CYFD Communications Director Jake Thompson, in a statement Monday to Source NM, said the agency “wishes” Walters well in her new role.
“Dawn Walters has spent her career advocating for vulnerable children — as an attorney in Pittsburgh and within state government. She understands both the system and the families it serves,” Thompson said.

Dan McKeon's attorney Perry Pirsch in the Nebraska Capitol on Jan. 12, 2026. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Legislature’s Executive Board unanimously advanced a resolution to expel State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst after hearing from his attorney and an outside investigator.
The board voted 9-0 Monday to advance Legislative Resolution 282 to floor debate following a nearly two-hour public hearing. The Legislature’s expulsion debate will take place Tuesday. Expelling a sitting senator requires 33 votes.

 How the expulsion process works
To expel a member of the Nebraska Legislature, first a senator must introduce a legislative resolution presenting the motion. That resolution is then referred to a committee for a public hearing.
Per the Legislature’s rules, there must be seven days between the notice of a public hearing and the date of the legislative hearing (In McKeon’s case, the Legislature is considering suspending this rule). It’s up to the committee to determine whether the public hearing will include only invited testimony, or open it up to public comment.
Following the hearing, the committee must vote to advance the resolution to floor debate. If the resolution advances, it can be scheduled for floor debate the next day.
An expulsion motion requires just one round of floor debate and needs 33 votes to remove a sitting senator. If successful, the motion would take effect immediately and the legislative seat would become vacant until the governor appoints a replacement.


McKeon faces expulsion following allegations he inappropriately touched a legislative staffer — allegations he denies. McKeon’s response to the allegation, as well as additional allegations against the senator that have surfaced since then, contributed to the Exec Board’s resolution, said State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, the board’s chair.
The Exec Board allowed only invited testimony at Monday’s hearing, including McKeon’s attorney Perry Pirsch and outside counsel Tara Paulson, who conducted the Legislature’s internal investigation, which was separate from a related Nebraska State Patrol criminal probe.
Pirsch argued that expulsion is too extreme a measure to take against McKeon considering the circumstances of the allegations. He described the decision to expel a sitting senator as one with “historic consequence,” as the Legislature has never done so, and said doing so now would set a precedent.
“Expulsion is not simply discipline,” Pirsch said. “It is the Legislature setting aside an election and removing the representative chosen by the voters of Legislative District 41.”
Pirsch has repeatedly described McKeon’s exchange with the staffer as the senator sharing “an ill-advised pun” and giving her a pat on the back. Paulson noted that when McKeon was first confronted about the encounter the day after the incident, McKeon denied touching her, but he later admitted to the contact under questioning.
The staffer reported that McKeon made a joke about going to Hawaii to “get laid” and smacked her rear end after delivering the joke, according to Paulson’s report. This incident led to McKeon being cited for misdemeanor public indecency by the Nebraska State Patrol in October.
Prosecutors have since charged him with misdemeanor disturbing the peace. McKeon pleaded not guilty. His next court date is Jan. 26.
Though Pirsch said McKeon can’t exactly remember what comment he made to the staffer, he argued McKeon is “a joker” who regularly uses humor in his rhetoric and said humor is “protected speech.” Paulson later clarified that while there are scenarios where a joke from a lawmaker may be protected, this case is not one of them.
In Paulson’s report on her investigation, she concluded that McKeon’s actions did not constitute actionable sexual harassment under state or federal law. However, she said it may violate the Legislature’s own workplace harassment policy, which includes “sexually oriented jokes” in its definition of sexual harassment.
“Actionable is not tantamount to acceptable,” Paulson said.
Pirsch argued that the Legislature hasn’t followed a fair process to judge McKeon’s actions, particularly when it comes to additional accusations that have come forward but remain confidential. LR 282 claims that McKeon has made multiple other inappropriate jokes after taking office last year, including jokes about people’s race.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Pirsch said McKeon has not received any additional information about those allegations beyond what’s been released to the public, so he cannot meaningfully rebut them.
“If we are going to take the extraordinary step of expulsion, we should be certain the accused senator has been told in full what the case is, has had a fair chance to respond and the public can see the basis for the decision,” Pirsch said.
Pirsch came under fire from State Sen. John Fredrickson of Omaha after he shared identifying information about the staffer making the allegation during his testimony. At multiple points, Pirsch named an office he said the staffer works for, and her position, which Fredrickson said was “highly concerning.”
The Examiner is aware of the alleged victim’s name but is not publishing it because it is the policy of States Newsroom and the Examiner not to identify people who say they have been abused unless they wish to talk publicly.
“Today’s hearing was just more of the same from Senator McKeon,” the staffer’s attorney, Kathleen Neary, said by email. “He refuses to accept responsibility, he blames everyone else for his bad conduct and continues to change his story.”
Neary described McKeon’s allegation that he was denied due process “ridiculous.” She said the senator and his lawyer “walked out of today’s hearing when the evidence against him was being presented.”
“Due process requires the accused to stay and participate in the process, not walk out,” Neary said.

(Stephen Ausmus/Animal Research Services, USDA)TOPEKA — Kansas is suffering from the worst outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the country, with nearly 414,000 birds affected, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
HPAI, an umbrella term for avian influenza that includes highly contagious strains such as H5 and H7, is considered a low public health risk, although it can pass to humans through birds and dairy products from infected cattle, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“H5 bird flu is widespread in wild birds worldwide and is causing outbreaks in poultry and U.S. dairy cows with sporadic human cases in U.S. dairy and poultry workers,” according to CDC. 
As of Friday, there are four affected commercial flocks and six affected backyard flocks reported in Kansas, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Avian influenza kills almost 100% of the birds it infects.
The bulk of the infected birds, about 380,000, in Kansas were reported to be in a commercial operation in Pottawatomie County, USDA reports said.
In a map highlighting outbreaks across the nation, Kansas is the only state showing the most severe reports during the past 30 days. It is followed by Indiana, with about 87,000 birds affected, including two commercial flocks and five backyard flocks. 
Kansas has not had a reported instance of avian bird flu in a human, according to CDC records. Since 2024, there have been 74 reported bird flu cases in humans and two deaths.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Civility and a step back from heated political rhetoric were prominent themes Monday in the opening-day speeches of some Iowa legislative leaders as they launched the 2026 session.
Among issues lawmakers have said they intend to address this year, eminent domain with regard to liquid carbon pipelines also was a focus in leaders’ opening-day remarks, amid calls for unity.
Leaders also memorialized two Iowa National Guard members killed in Syria and two senators who died in the past year – Rocky DeWitt and Claire Celsi – as well as thanking former Senate Majority Leader Jack Whitver, R-Ankeny, for his service. Whitver stepped down from the leadership position last year and will retire from the Senate at the end of this year as he continues treatment for a brain tumor.
Senate President Amy Sinclair, R-Allerton, cited shootings of two Minnesota Democratic lawmakers and their spouses last year, as well as the shooting death of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk.
“I watched in horror this past year as two of our neighboring colleagues were targeted and shot in their own homes. Melissa Hortman and her husband did not deserve to die. John Hoffman and his wife did not deserve to be critically injured for serving the citizens of Minnesota,” Sinclair said. “My heart grieved when a young man was callously murdered for speaking the truth. Charlie Kirk’s life was more valuable and his call to civil discourse more powerful than the bullet that took him from us in a time where our nation and our state, even our neighborhoods, have become divided along party lines, left and right, right and wrong, good and evil.
“I encourage each of us to tone down our rhetoric and to get to work on what Iowans are telling us they really want,” she said.
Sinclair said she’s seen a breakdown of civility in political discourse.
“Today, people of all political flavors have taken name calling to new extremes. When people disagree, it has become disagreeable. The debate no longer stops with policy descriptions. It spiraled into slurs aimed at dehumanizing the opposition. Calling people fascists, scum, deplorables, bigots, and a host of things I cannot and will not repeat on the Senate floor cannot be embraced as a status quo here. I call on all of us to do better and to set a positive example of what civility looks like in our political discourse,” she said.
Senate Minority Leader Janice Weiner, D-Iowa City, also cited the recent shooting death of Renee Good by an Immigration Customs and Enforcement agent in Minneapolis.
“As Americans, we continue, as President Sinclair noted, to face political violence that has shaken us to our core. We do not live in a bubble here under the golden dome. In just the past few days, a woman was shot to death in Minnesota and a synagogue was torched in Mississippi, the same one that was firebombed nearly 60 years ago by the KKK,” Weiner said.
“We Iowans, we take care of our neighbors, we are tolerant, and we stand up for the rights that are our rights too, because we all know that love thy neighbor, comes with no exceptions. So let us resolve to carry out the people’s business with civility and empathy,” she said.
House speaker cites focus on crime
House Speaker Pat Grassley said this session, Iowa House Republicans aim to make the state safer through a “tough on crime agenda.” He said there are growing reports of violent crimes in neighboring Midwest states and cities, House GOP lawmakers are focused on passing measures that target people repeatedly convicted of violent crimes, who he said “become a true risk to our children and our loved ones” when released.
“For those of you who say, ‘well, this really isn’t a problem here, a big problem here in Iowa,’ I say that even one instance is too many,” Grassley said. He pointed to the case of Henry Dinkins, a Davenport man convicted in 2023 for the kidnapping and murder of a 10-year-old girl who had several prior convictions, including multiple felonies.
“We propose that in this state, if you can’t get on the right track after two strikes, then on the third strike, you are out,” Grassley said. “Dangerous criminals that insist on repeatedly breaking our laws will not be allowed back onto the streets. This legislative session, career criminals will get the message: they are not welcome here in Iowa.”
New lawmakers sworn in
Senate Majority Leader Mike Klimesh, R-Spillville, paid tribute to his predecessor in his first speech in the leadership role.  “I have no doubt he will go down in our state’s history. Is one of the greatest Republican leaders Iowa has ever seen,” he said of Whitver, citing major GOP legislative actions such as income tax cuts and restrictions on unemployment benefits and programs for low-income Iowans.

Senate leaders also memorialized DeWitt and Celsi before swearing in their successors – Sen. Catelin Drey, D-Sioux City; and Sen. Renee Hardman, D-West Des Moines, the first Black woman to serve in the Iowa Senate. In the Iowa House, Rep. Wendy Larson, R-Odebolt, was sworn in following her 2025 special election victory in House District 7.
Iowa House Republicans say eminent domain debate will come soon
Though Republican leaders at the GOP party’s annual legislative breakfast spoke about the importance of “unity” in speeches before gaveling in, House GOP leaders said they intend to quickly move on legislation that may not be popular with Senate Republican leaders — restricting the use of eminent domain in carbon capture pipeline projects.
Under eminent domain, unwilling landowners can be forced to accept easements on their property for projects deemed in the public interest, at a price set by a county commission.
House Majority Leader Bobby Kaufmann said in his first session leading the Republican House caucus, he said “not a whole lot is going to change” compared to how the caucus operated in previous years, and that his “personality is going to be the same.” He said legislatively, his priorities should be “no surprise.”
“We’re going to have an eminent domain debate, and we’re going to have it early,” Kaufmann said. “And anybody that thinks that debate is not going to be centered around eminent domain, well, you’re wrong.”
Kaufmann’s comments come following Klimesh’s comments in December that he also plans to introduce legislation related to carbon capture pipeline projects early in the year. Klimesh said he plans to introduce legislation in the first week of session to address some Iowans’ concerns with the use of eminent domain in carbon capture pipeline projects — most prominently, the Summit Carbon Solutions project.
Klimesh’s proposal would widen the corridor approved by the Iowa Utilities Commission in these projects, allowing utility companies and constructors in projects to find “willing landowners” to enter land easement agreements, which would allow projects to proceed without invoking the use of eminent domain.
In his opening remarks, the Senate majority leader said he plans to release several proposals in 2026 to provide a “solution that respects landowners, farmers, and continues to put our state on a path of success” on the issue of eminent domain in pipeline projects.
“Most critically, our proposals will expand the noticed corridor, dramatically expanding the ability of private investment and private property owners to voluntarily exchange easements and payments,” Klimesh said. “I believe this change will all but eliminate the need for eminent domain for hazardous liquid pipelines. Proof of this concept exists in other states and other projects. Recently, a liquid jet fuel pipeline was built from Kansas to Denver International Airport, a distance over 230 miles, and it did not use eminent domain once. We can repeat that success here.”
This proposal was one of the components of an amendment introduced by Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, in the 2025 debate on a pipeline-related measure in the Iowa Senate. That amendment was not adopted, and the Senate sent a bill containing multiple proposals related to pipelines to the governor. Gov. Kim Reynolds vetoed the measure in June.
Kaufmann’s comments indicate the Iowa House may take up a measure similar to legislation passed by the chamber in previous years that bans the use of eminent domain in projects for pipelines transporting liquified carbon dioxide. This language was also introduced as an amendment to the bill that passed the Iowa Senate, but the amendment was called out of order and discarded.
Grassley also stated in his opening remarks the issue of eminent domain is “not going away” in 2026, and reiterated that a House proposal on the issue will specifically focus on eminent domain.
“We have tried multiple approaches in our efforts to protect landowners,” Grassley said. “This year, you can expect our approach to be narrowly tailored. If last year’s bill had too many components to it, then let’s return to the crux of the issue and focus on the topic of eminent domain.”

Jay Collins and Gov. Ron DeSantis in Hillsborough County on Aug. 13, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix).Florida Lt. Gov. Jay Collins announced his long-awaited bid for governor Monday, hours after Gov. Ron DeSantis wavered on whether he’ll get involved in the Republican race to succeed him.
Collins, a 49-year-old former Green Beret and state senator, told FOX News that his commitment to DeSantis’ agenda and willingness to partner with President Donald Trump would mark his tenure as Florida governor. His statement came just hours after DeSantis ducked a question about whether he plans to endorse Collins.
“I’m running for governor to keep Florida strong and to build on the legacy of leadership that has made our state the model for the nation,” he said. “As governor, I will be a strong partner to President Trump in fighting for secure borders, a strong economy, and an America First agenda that puts families and freedom first.”
Collins becomes the latest Republican to enter the gubernatorial primary, joining Trump-endorsed U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, former House Speaker Paul Renner, and investor James Fishback.
Although the timing was unanticipated, the choice to run is not a surprise. Collins has been heavily hinting at his plan to run for six months — since DeSantis first elevated him to the lieutenant governor post in August. By picking Collins, speculation that DeSantis would support him as a hand-picked successor in a 2026 bid ran rampant.
At the time, DeSantis did nothing to quell those rumors.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Instead, he bashed Donalds and criticized Renner while hailing Collins as the “Chuck Norris of Florida politics.” He brought the Tampa Republican to the majority of his press conferences in late summer and early fall, posted campaign-like videos of Collins’ accomplishments, and even dispatched the lieutenant governor to California to extradite an undocumented immigrant accused of vehicular manslaughter.
But that relationship appears to have thinned in the months since Collins took over the second-in-command role.
“Jay’s a good guy, he’s served this country admirably as a Green Beret, he has had a great conservative record in the Florida Senate,” DeSantis told onlookers at an unrelated press conference in Davie Monday morning.
“I don’t know when he’s going to announce or not announce. My role — obviously I’m focused on the State of the State [address] and some other things. If I get involved in the primary you’ll know it, it’ll be at a time and place of my choosing, and so we’ll see,” he added.
NBC first reported in mid-December that two of DeSantis’ aides have been quietly in contact with Fishback, an acute critic of both Collins and Donalds. Both aides have denied the report.
In early December, DeSantis told the Floridian Press that he doesn’t “get involved in a lot of primaries,” and stressed that “we’ll see” whether he chooses to wade into the race. At the time, he emphasized the importance of having a strong record and being aligned with him on policies, but didn’t offer the same glowing praise he’d previously offered of Collins on those counts.
Collins was the only top Florida official missing at a recent press conference at the “Deportation Depot” immigrant detention center in Baker County.
Collins, meanwhile, has stuck by all of the governor’s policies, regularly lauding him on social media and in interviews with the press.

With the holiday season coming to an end, the girls high school basketball season is hitting its stride with plenty of games being played all around the state.  Here’s a few takeaways and updates from last week’s action in high school girls basketball. 
 
Caravel’s win streak increases to three games following undefeated week
The Buccaneers completed an undefeated week with victories over Tower Hill and Early College School to increase their winning streak to three games. The Buccaneers scored over 100 points combined in their two wins this week while allowing a combined 47 points on defense. Senior Brycelyn Stryckning led the Caravel offense with ten points against Tower Hill and 20 versus ECS eclipsing 100 total points this season. Caravel will play three games this week starting with a home game against A.I. duPont and then a pair of road games against St. Elizabeth and St. Anthony’s High School in New York. 
Padua wins three straight 
The Panda’s earned their first wins since the beginning of the season defeating St. Mark’s, Ursuline and Wilmington Friends last week. Padua held the Spartans under 20 points in its victory Tuesday and on Thursday four different Panda players scored in double figures to earn the season sweep against Ursuline. Junior Kai Dwirantwi scored 17 points against Friends helping the Pandas to a victory Saturday afternoon, completing the undefeated week. Padua is currently 4-6 following a tough early season schedule in which they faced Smyrna, Ursuline and St. Elizabeth as well as four Pennsylvania schools — three of which were on the road. Padua only plays one time this week taking on Howard at home. 
Hodgson bolsters winning streak with a pair of wins 
The Silver Eagles won a pair of close games against Polytech and Newark Charter last week increasing their winning streak to five games. Hodgson took the court for the first time in the new year, Tuesday against Polytech. Leading into the final frame, the Silver Eagles withstood a 16-point fourth quarter from the Panthers offense to earn their first victory of 2026. Hodgson scored 33 points in the second half of its six point victory over the Patriots on Thursday continuing a winning streak that started exactly a month ago. Senior Hope Smith led the Silver Eagles in scoring both games with a combined 33 points over the week. 
DMA begins new year with an undefeated week
The Seahawks took the court for the first time since December 19, and earned a pair of victories against Appoquinimink and Red Lion. DMA and Appo played a close game last Tuesday, but a strong fourth quarter performance by the Seahawks — 16 points on offense and only four points allowed on defense — resulted in a one point victory for DMA. The win broke a streak of two losses DMA endured before breaking for the holidays. DMA scored 56 in its win over Red Lion bringing its season record to 5-2.

The regular season is starting to pick up following the holidays with basketball games scheduled almost every day. Here’s some takeaways and updates from last week’s action in Delaware high school boys basketball.
 
Cape Henlopen increases its winning streak to five games with undefeated week
The Vikings continued their strong start to the season with three wins this past week. The first was a close battle against Howard that ended in a four-point overtime victory for Cape Henlopen at home. Trailing by 13 points going into the fourth quarter, the Vikings scored 20 points in the fourth quarter and another 20 in overtime to come away victorious. Cape Henlopen was on the road the rest of the week picking up wins against Caesar Rodney and Laurel High School. Junior Jameson Tingle scored 64 points in total across the three games and the Vikings record now stands at 8-1.
Appoquinimink starts four game home stand with a pair of wins
The Jaguars made their return to the court this week after not playing since December 22. The Jaguars endured their first loss of the season in that game — a four point loss to Elkton High School — but coming out of the break the team bounced right back. Appoquinimink played two games last week defeating Delaware Military Academy on Tuesday and William Penn on Thursday, breaking up the Colonials five game winning streak. The Jaguars defense played well allowing a combined 58 points across the two games and only one player to score in double figures. Appoquinimink will complete its four game home stand with games against Odyssey Charter and St. Georges this week before going on the road to face Concord on Saturday. 
Tatnall stays undefeated against in-state competition
The Hornets went 3-0 this past week earning wins against Concord, Sanford and St. Andrew’s. The Hornets scored over 50 points and held their opponent under 50 in each matchup winning each game by double figures. Sophomore Mason Collins finished the week with 42 points and a pair of double-doubles grabbing over 20 rebounds against Concord and ten against Sanford. Tatnall is 6-4 this season, but all four losses have come against out-of-state competition. 
Archmere continues its undefeated start to the season
The Auks won both of their matchups this week earning their fifth and sixth wins of the season. Archmere scored 62 points in its win against Caesar Rodney behind a trio of double digit scoring performances from seniors John Orsini, Noah Blessington and freshman Khaleef Wilson Jr. The Auks defense was on full display in their Friday night victory over John Dickinson High School holding the Rams to 13 points. Archmere will try and continue its undefeated streak taking on the Charter School of Wilmington and Brandywine High School this week.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Gemini_Generated_Image_kr8773kr8773kr87.png,,,2026-01-12 13:59:13.603839

The board alleges that Kelsey Louise Swanson of Altoona was on the staff of the Iowa Department of Corrections’ Newton Correctional Facility when the incident occurred, although the board has not disclosed any information as to when that was.
Swanson, the board alleges, “failed to further assess, intervene, contact a medical provider, or carry out existing orders after assessing a patient with an oxygen saturation level of 77% on room air.”
Typically, people with oxygen saturation levels below 85% are considered to be in severe hypoxemia and in need of urgent medical care.
According to the board, the Newton facility had a policy regarding vital signs that required nurses to assess lung sounds and contact a medical provider if an inmate’s oxygen saturation levels dropped below 93%. The board alleges Swanson was aware of that policy.
The available board records give no indication as to whether the patient survived.
The board charged Swanson with professional incompetence, failing to assess or report the status of a patient, and committing an act that might adversely affect a patient’s welfare.
To settle the matter, Swanson agreed to a six-month suspension of her nursing license, with the understanding that the license will be placed on probationary status for two years after it is reinstated.
Newton medical staff accused of negligence
Three other members of the Newton Correctional Facility are currently accused in a lawsuit of negligence related to the September 2024 death of 23-year-old inmate Malga Yanga.
The lawsuit alleges that for day, the Newton medical staff failed to adequately treat Yanga, who was suffering from severe stomach pain and vomiting blood. At one point, the lawsuit claims, Yanga “vomited such a large amount of blood, it was all over his hands and the floor of his cell and multiple inmates had to clean it up.”
In the early hours, of Sept. 4, 2024, a cellmate of Yanga’s allegedly banged on the door and yelled for help, stating that Yanga was unresponsive, having seizures and was jerking and twitching. The staff allegedly refused the cellmate’s request for medical intervention, stating that Yanga had already been seen by medical personnel and “we’re not taking him again.”
Hours later, Yanga’s cellmate allegedly found him unresponsive and yelled for assistance. The staff allegedly initiated CPR, but pronounced Yanga dead within the hour. Court records indicate an autopsy showed he died from complications of peritonitis.
The lawsuit alleges negligence by licensed practical nurse Eric Rankin, and by registered nurses Penny Daniels and David Arterburn, each of whom has denied any wrongdoing. A trial scheduling conference in the case is set for Jan. 20, 2026.
In 2006, Rankin was sanctioned by the board after he was accused of forcibly administering drugs to a patient by ordering an aide to hold down the patient while he pinched the patient’s nose and forced the individual to swallow a dose of Ativan, an antianxiety drug.
In 2019, Rankin was sanctioned again by the board. In that case, Rankin was alleged to have given a patient the wrong dose of medication at the wrong time, resulting in low blood sugar that required medical intervention and monitoring.



Other Iowa nurses recently sanctioned by the Board of Nursing include:
Erica Marie Jennings Midkiff of Jefferson, who was recently charged with violating the confidentiality or privacy rights of a patient and with engaging in behavior that is contradictory to professional decorum.
The board alleges Midkiff, an Iowa-licensed registered nurse, was working at an unspecified Guthrie County medical facility in June 2025 when she posted on social media an image of a patient’s medication profile, displaying the patient’s name and medical-record number, alongside text that stated “dose ordered as a date with no frequency.”
The board has not elaborated on the nature of the post or Midkiff’s intent in publicly sharing the information, but has asserted the information was shared publicly without the patient’s knowledge.
To settle the matter, the board has placed Midkiff’s license on probation for one year, during which her work will be subject to monitoring. Midkiff has also agreed to complete 30 hours of training on patient privacy rights.
In 2021, the board charged Midkiff with misappropriating medications from the long-term care facility where she worked. No warning or citation was issued in that case, and the matter was resolved with an agreement that Midkiff would complete 40 hours of educational training on ethics.
— Ashley Marie Frame of Clinton, who was recently charged with performing nursing services beyond her authorized scope of practice. The board alleges that sometime between 2021 and 2025, while Frame was employed at an unspecified medical facility in the Clinton area, she ordered prescription drugs for herself and for family members.
The board alleges Frame admitted prescribing the medications, which she was not authorized to do, and admitted inappropriately accessing her employer’s electronic medical record and prescribing system.
In addition, the board alleges, Frame also placed orders for other medications, usually refills, without consulting with a doctor and without the patient being seen. To settle the matter, the board has agreed to issue Frame a warning, and Frame has agreed to complete 30 hours of educational training on ethics.
Frame was first licensed by the state to practice nursing in 2010. In 2011, the board accused Frame, then known as Ashley Marie Parker, of fraud in procuring a license, alleging she had accurately reported convictions on three unspecified criminal charges, but had failed to report a 2004 conviction for criminal mischief. The matter was settled in 2011 when the board issued Frame a warning.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NEW-BON-1024x599.jpg,,,2026-01-12 13:13:52.776813

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-12 17:47:35+00:00,CT Mirror,Lamont reaches first wage deal with CT union since April,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/12/lamont-union-raise-deal/,The four-year agreement with Local 511 of Connecticut Employees Union Independent endorses 2.5% raises through 2028 and calls for step hikes.,"After struggling for nearly a year to negotiate new contracts with state government’s unionized workforce, Gov. Ned Lamont reached his first tentative deal last week, endorsing 2.5% cost-of-living raises annually through 2028 for a 4,000-member maintenance unit.
The four-year agreement with Local 511 of Connecticut Employees Union Independent, which now goes to the General Assembly, also calls for a step hike this fiscal year and in the next two for members not at the top experience level. A step hike typically adds another 2 percentage points to the raise’s value.
The contract would be reopened prior to the fourth fiscal year of the agreement, 2028-29, to resolve wages for that budget cycle.
“Our state employees work hard to provide vital services throughout Connecticut,” Lamont spokesman Rob Blanchard said Monday. “From working around the clock to keep our roads clear during storms to ensuring a safe daily commute and even maintaining our state buildings, we count on them and appreciate their service and dedication. We’re pleased to have reached a tentative agreement with CEUI and appreciate their collaboration throughout the negotiating process and believe the equitable wage adjustments in this agreement reflect that appreciation.”
Leadership of Local 511 notified members of the deal Saturday.
“Many of our units have struggled with recruitment and retention issues due to short staffing and insufficient wages, and this tentative agreement is a step in the right direction,” said Carl Chisem, president of Local 511. “Our union members have been the backbone of Connecticut’s public service sector. Their commitment to excellence and resilience in the face of challenges has ensured the continued delivery of essential services to our communities.”
Other details of the tentative agreement, including any changes in work conditions, were not available early Monday.
But Chisem said the agreement “reflects our ongoing commitment to address the concerns of our workforce and improve recruitment and retention issues that many state agencies face every day.”
Though the governor and unionized state troopers agreed last April to a raise similar to that just offered maintenance staff, more than 30 other bargaining units across most of state government still are awaiting new contracts and pay hikes, despite pledges from Lamont that all workers would receive good raises.
The fiscally moderate governor has been pressing unions to roll back some of the flexible work-from-home rules established during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021.
Unions counter that remote work options improve efficiency for many jobs and are help state government recruit new employees — a task that became harder after union concession deals in 2009, 2011 and 2017 weakened fringe benefits.
Most unions across state government have been working since July 1 under expired contracts. And having pay hikes delayed because of the remote work issue and other work conditions has been a growing source of frustration for labor.
Three bargaining units, representing probation officers, marshals and other Judicial Branch staff, broke off talks with Lamont about compensation in early July. An arbitrator last month awarded those units a 2.5% cost-of-living raise and a step increase this fiscal year. Those unions and management continue to negotiate working conditions.
Unions representing rank-and-file correction officers, their supervisors and various education professionals also declared wage negotiations to be at an impasse last September. No arbitration awards from these unions have been announced yet.
Tensions between Lamont and unions also have worsened because of staffing levels and mandatory overtime.
The Executive Branch workforce shrank by about 10% between 2011 and 2018 under Lamont’s predecessor, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy. Labor leaders say many agencies have remained understaffed since Lamont took office in 2019, forcing staff in some key departments, including Correction and Children & Families, to work excessive overtime.
Unions also argue these conditions are unnecessary given that state government over the same period has used aggressive budget caps to drain resources from most programs and create unprecedented budget surpluses.
Lamont and the General Assembly have used those unspent dollars, which have averaged more than $1.8 billion since 2017 or 8% to 9% of the General Fund, to build reserves and whittle down Connecticut’s considerable pension debt. Those unfunded obligations, according to Lamont’s budget office, still top $33 billion, leaving Connecticut one of the most indebted states in the nation.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC03422-e1541205352185.jpg,,,2026-01-12 12:58:48.480376

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Civil rights groups hosted a vigil on Sunday in Montgomery to commemorate the life of Renee Nicole Good, who was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis last week.
More than 100 people attended the gathering near the Freedom Fountain in downtown to hear about Good’s life as a poet, spouse and mother of three children. Organizers also read out loud one of the poems that Good authored.
“I do not like what ICE is doing or what the administration is doing,” said Traci Benefield, an Auburn resident who attended the vigil.  “It is not a left or right thing; it is a human decency thing. They are killing people.”
She added that, “I feel like if something doesn’t change, we are seeing the downfall of America.”
Good’s shooting sparked protests around the country.
ICE agents were conducting immigration raids in Minneapolis as part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts. Prior to the raid, residents gathered on the scene and blew whistles to alert the community of their presence.
Good and her spouse were in their car on Wednesday when Jonathan Ross, an ICE agent walked toward her and tried to grab the car door as Good appeared to make an attempt to leave. Ross fired three shots into the driver side windshield, eventually killing Good.
“It was all on video, multiple videos from multiple angles,” said Rachel Turner, one of the lead organizers of the event, of the incident that led to Good’s death. “There were also multiple eyewitnesses who came forward and vigorously rejected the government’s claims about what actually had taken place.”
Those who attended the event spoke out against the administration’s efforts to dispatch hundreds of additional immigration agents to Minneapolis.
“It is time for us to take a stand,” said DaQuon Allen, a Montgomery resident who attended the event. “We can’t just sit down and let what is going on in America just happen. We need to let the people know that this is not right.”
He added that, “The people who have been in our country for years and deported by ICE, they deserve to be here. Nobody deserves to be treated as an outcast.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7754-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-12 12:58:48.480376

Tiny lights flickered in the darkness. “This is not a rally centered on chants or speeches,” an organizer from the immigrant rights group Voces de la Frontera told the crowd. Instead, it was a moment to acknowledge our collective shock and grief, to support each other as we face the sickening and disorienting shift in the world around us, and to try to hold onto a protective sense of community.

It was a needed respite from watching the video, obtained by the Minnesota Reformer, of the shooting of Good in broad daylight as she sat at the wheel of her minivan on a Midwestern residential street, apparently trying to move away from the agent who shot her. The horror of that scene was compounded by the propaganda from the Trump administration that followed, immediately blaming Good for her own death and calling her a “domestic terrorist,” while claiming that the real victim was the ICE agent who, after he shot her, walked away unhurt. 
Stoking political division and hate, justifying murder, treating people’s real lives like a video game — our poisonous political atmosphere is overwhelming. We need to put down the screens and restore our sense of human connection if we are going to overcome it.
Dane County Judge and Pastor Everett Mitchell, speaking at the vigil, quoted Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s eulogy for the three little girls killed in the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama. Their deaths, King said, “have something to say to every minister of the gospel who has remained silent behind the safe security of stained-glass windows. They have something to say to every politician who has fed his constituents with the stale bread of hatred and the spoiled meat of racism,” as well as to those who “stood on the sidelines in a mighty struggle for justice.”
“Madison,” Mitchell said, “we can no longer stand on the sideline and feel like we are protected. We must substitute courage for caution.”
Here in Wisconsin, the Minneapolis shooting hits close to home. Minnesota is our near neighbor. My daughter, who lives in the Twin Cities, was driving past the area of the ICE surge when Good was shot. She texted us about the unfolding chaos in real time, as ICE vehicles sped past her — putting our whole family on edge. 










We can no longer stand on the sideline and feel like we are protected. We must substitute courage for caution.


– Dane County Judge and Pastor Everett Mitchell


Maybe we have had the false sense, as Mitchell said, that we were protected. 
The “Midwest nice” culture of Minnesota and Wisconsin — whether that describes taciturn conflict avoidance or genuine warmth — doesn’t fit with political violence. 
It’s impossible to see ourselves in Trump’s heated rhetoric about the “Radical Left Movement of Violence and Hate.” Nicole Good, whose last words were, “I’m not mad at you,” certainly doesn’t fit that profile. 
The killing of a U.S. citizen by federal agents, justified after the fact by the president, vice president, and secretary of Homeland Security, is a turning point for all of us. As investigative reporter Ken Klipperstein points out, Trump’s national security order targeting so-called leftwing domestic terrorist groups, and Attorney General Pam Bondi’s tag-along directive, “Ending Political Violence Against ICE” broadly justify the targeting of Americans who protest Trump’s immigration crackdown or attempt to help their immigrant neighbors who are being terrorized.
In a video filmed by the agent who shot Renee Good, released by a right-wing news outlet that tried to spin it as exonerating him, you can hear a man’s voice, immediately after the shooting, cursing Good, calling her a “f-ing bitch.” 
A Customs and Border Patrol Agent who shot Chicago resident Marimar Martinez five times and bragged about it in text messages, also allegedly used the word “bitch” as he rammed into her car, according to Martinez’s attorney. The Justice Department initially claimed Martinez, who survived. was the aggressor, saying she used her car to try to harm the agents — the same dubious claim made against Good — but then dropped all charges after Martinez challenged the government’s evidence.
Turning hyped-up, poorly trained agents onto the streets to pursue civilians is, contrary to Trump administration propaganda, making America much less safe. And pouring fuel on the fire with hateful rhetoric about “the radical Left” and the need to round up immigrant “criminals” —  a majority of whom have committed no crimes — is exacerbating this disaster.
The Trace puts the number of ICE shootings at 16, four of them fatal, since the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown began — including Silverio Villegas González, a father from Mexico who worked as a cook, killed just after he dropped off his children at school, while reportedly trying to flee from ICE officers during the Midway Blitz in Chicago. At the vigil Friday night, Mitchell connected those killings to racist violence from the Civil Rights era to the 2020 murder of George Floyd. “And now carved into the same, sorrowful stone is the name of Renee Nicole Good,” Mitchell said.
People are struggling to figure out what to make of our frightening new reality. At the Madison vigil, one activist declared that the escalating ICE crackdown “is not because they are inevitably powerful. It is because we are powerful.” But the escalation, which is targeting people who are decidedly not powerful, is coming directly out of the more than $170 billion allocated to immigration enforcement in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — more than the yearly budget for all local and state law enforcement agencies in the U.S. combined, according to the Brennan Center. The Trump administration is using this newly empowered militarized police force to target civilians the administration characterizes as enemies.

Most of the people I know are aghast at this scary turn of events. But one Wisconsinite I spoke with waved away the shooting, saying, “Minneapolis has a lot of problems.” There’s that false sense of being protected Mitchell called out. It’s really just denial — a powerful wish to believe that bad things only happen to other people, that violence is far away and somehow the fault of people who are different from us and who bring it on themselves.
But this touches all of us. And it won’t go away unless we get to the root of the problem — the unAmerican national security directives, the insane ICE budget, the lack of accountability — what Vice President JD Vance, astoundingly, asserted was “total immunity” for the rogue, masked agents targeting people in a political crackdown that has nothing to do with keeping us safe.
We have to see this for what it is. We need members of Congress to demand a rollback of the massive funding for Trump’s unaccountable police force. We need leaders who will state clearly, as Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey have done, that political violence against civilians waged by the Trump administration is immoral, illegal and has to stop. 
Most of all, we need each other. This is too heavy for one person to carry. We need to connect, to combine all of our efforts and to build a massive popular movement to take care of each other and reject the hateful forces that are trying to tear us apart.

Jared Golden in the November 2026 election, running for the seat previously held by his brother, John Baldacci. (Official legislative photo)After three terms in the Maine Legislature, Joe Baldacci is making a run for Congress. 
Baldacci, a Democrat, plans to formally announce his run for the open seat in Maine’s 2nd Congressional District Monday afternoon at Orono Brewing Company. The race is open after Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, who has held the seat for the last eight years, announced in November that he would not seek re-election. 
State Auditor Matt Dunlap, a Democrat, announced his bid to challenge Golden before he dropped out, but the national party told Maine Morning Star in December that they were still searching for the right candidate. 
Baldacci will face Dunlap and former congressional staffer Jordan Wood in a June primary. So far, there are two Republicans vying for the seat, former Gov. Paul LePage and East Machias veteran James Clark.
Jim Deyermond, chairman of the Maine Republican Party, said in a statement on Facebook that he’s confident voters will elect LePage based on polling data and the “enthusiasm” he said the party has seen in Maine’s 2nd Congressional District.
A poll from early December, commissioned by Baldacci, showed that likely voters were split between Baldacci and LePage (43% and 44%, respectively), if the election were held at that time. However, the results were well within the poll’s 5% margin of error. Of those polled, 13% said they were undecided in that matchup.
Baldacci has represented District 9, which covers Bangor and Hermon in Penobscot County, in the Maine Senate for three terms. He currently serves as Senate chair of two committees: Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, as well as State and Local Government. 
Before his time in the state Legislature, Baldacci spent 12 years on the Bangor City Council, including a stint as mayor. He has also spent more than 30 years as an attorney. He has advocated for expanded rail transportation, as well as other legislation focused on economic development.
His brother, John Baldacci, represented Maine’s 2nd District from 1995 to 2003 before serving as governor of Maine from 2003 to 2011.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/90-3.jpeg,,,2026-01-12 12:58:48.480376

This story was originally published by Public News Service.
Detroit teachers are pushing for the release of immigrant students from Michigan – many of them minors – who are being held by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Some were sent to out-of-state detention facilities. Nationwide, ICE has taken more than 65,000 people into custody, and at least 600 children have been placed in federal detention this year.
Kristen Schoettle, an English as a Second Language teacher at Western International High School in Detroit, said the effect on students has been immediate and traumatic.
“I have many students who are afraid to go to school,” Schoettle explained. “For them, I’ve really just been sending them work through Teams. I hear of students whose parents have been detained almost every day.”
Schoettle noted at least four students from her school are in ICE custody; some were sent to a family detention center in Texas. ICE officials maintain they are carrying out federal immigration law, and that detention decisions are based on legal status and court processes, not school enrollment.
Schoettle added what is most painful for her is seeing teenagers who have followed the rules treated like criminals and separated from their communities.
“They’re good kids. They’ve done nothing wrong,” Schoettle emphasized. “Honestly, if this was 10 years earlier, they would have had access to DACA and had more protections. So, it’s just, for me, it’s the cruelty.”
She and other advocates have said the kids detained at their school highlight growing concerns about how immigration enforcement is affecting children, school attendance and family stability across the region. ICE has said individuals in custody are given access to legal proceedings.

The announcement follows a Friday endorsement from Trump. 
The post Wyoming schools leader Megan Degenfelder launches bid for governor appeared first on WyoFile .","Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder announced Monday she will run for Wyoming governor in 2026. Her announcement follows a Friday afternoon endorsement from President Donald Trump. 
“I am humbled and inspired to have the support and encouragement of President Trump,” Degenfelder said in a press release. “Coastal elites and liberal activists are coming for our oil, gas and coal jobs. Radical extremists seek to redefine genders, threatening our young women. And the political establishment cares more about undermining President Trump than serving the people who elected them. Not in Wyoming. Not when I’m Governor.”
Trump, in a Friday post on Truth Social, said Degenfelder would champion Wyoming values.
“Many of my strongest supporters and friends in Wyoming have been calling me and telling me how great ‘MAGA’ Megan Degenfelder is,” Trump wrote.
Trump remains popular in Wyoming, having won the state by the largest margin in the nation in 2024.
Degenfelder is not the first to announce a run for governor. Former Speaker of the House, Republican State Sen. Eric Barlow, announced his own bid in August. Brent Bien, former gubernatorial candidate, and political newcomer Joseph Kibler also made previous announcements. 
Degenfelder is the latest in a string of Wyoming politicians seeking higher office. Last month, Rep. Harriet Hageman announced she would run for the Senate seat being vacated by Cynthia Lummis. Then, Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray announced he would run for the congressional seat opening up due to Hageman’s departure.
Born and raised in Casper, Degenfelder attended the University of Wyoming, where she earned bachelor’s degrees in economics and political science. She then earned a master’s degree in economics from the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.
She and her husband, Bryan Dugas, live in Laramie. 
Before voters elected her as superintendent in 2022, Degenfelder spent about a decade working in the coal, oil and gas industries. She also previously worked for U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis when she was in the House and served under former Superintendent Jillian Balow as chief policy officer. 
When Balow resigned in January 2022 to take a job out of state, Degenfelder threw her name in the hat of nominees to fill the post. However, the Wyoming Republican Party picked three other nominees instead, including Brian Schroeder, whom Degenfelder challenged in 2022. While Trump endorsed Schroeder, Degenfelder was ultimately victorious in the Republican primary.
As superintendent, Degenfelder promptly gathered stakeholders of differing political views and geographical locations to help craft a document to guide districts in shaping policies for providing or restricting books. More recently, she announced a new statewide language and literacy initiative. 
Degenfelder also supported legislation to authorize charter schools and a voucher program to make public funds available for private tuition. 
She’s made efforts to align with the Trump administration, including her support for the dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education and opposition to the Biden administration’s summer school lunch program.

(Courtesy of the office of Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger)Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger on Monday announced the appointment of Carrie Chenery as Virginia’s next secretary of commerce and trade, tapping a longtime economic development strategist to help lead the state’s efforts to grow jobs and attract new investment.
Spanberger said Chenery’s background across government, regional development and the private sector aligns closely with her administration’s economic priorities.
“The number-one job of the governor of Virginia is to grow the commonwealth’s economy and create good-paying jobs in every community,” Spanberger said in a statement. 
“Maintaining a stable and predictable business environment is essential to attracting new investment and fostering the kinds of opportunities that allow Virginians to earn a good living, support their families, and have confidence in a secure retirement.”
Spanberger added that throughout her career, Chenery has brought together private industry, workforce partners and local governments to pursue those goals, calling her understanding of economic development a strong fit for the administration’s mission to make Virginia the top state in the nation for business.
Chenery, a native Virginian, said she was honored to serve in what she described as a historic administration and said she shares Spanberger’s vision for the state’s economic future.
“I share in the governor-elect’s clear vision to position Virginia as the nation’s best place to do business through a defining opportunity to lead affordability, housing, and energy progress,” Chenery said. 
“My statewide work in economic, community, and business development has given me a deep appreciation for the importance of realizing potential, building capacity, engaging diverse stakeholders, and delivering practical results.”
Chenery added that she looks forward to leading the commerce and trade secretariat with a collaborative and business-friendly approach that supports Spanberger, regional partners and communities across the state.
Chenery brings roughly two decades of experience in economic development, public policy, government relations and strategic communications. 
In 2018, she founded Valley Pike Partners, a firm that helps companies expand across Virginia through public affairs, business development and community engagement strategies.
Before that, she served as executive director of the Shenandoah Valley Partnership, a regional economic development and marketing organization. 
During her tenure, the region announced new and expanding business projects representing more than $460 million in capital investment and 1,900 new jobs. The partnership also unified seven counties and five cities under a shared economic development vision and built coalitions among more than 160 private-sector investors.
Earlier in her career, Chenery served as Virginia’s assistant secretary of agriculture and forestry, overseeing economic development efforts tied to the state’s agriculture and forestry industries. 
During that time, the Governor’s Agriculture and Forestry Industries Development Fund contributed to more than $46 million in new private capital investment and the creation of over 400 jobs.
She has also worked as manager of legislation and policy at the Virginia Economic Development Partnership and as a director of government affairs at the law firm Williams Mullen.
Chenery is a graduate of Virginia Tech, where she earned a bachelor’s degree in environmental policy and planning and agricultural and applied economics. 
She is also a graduate of the Sorensen Institute for Political Leadership at the University of Virginia and previously served on the boards of the Virginia Economic Development Partnership Authority and the Virginia Tech Board of Visitors.
Chenery has been recognized as one of North America’s Top 50 Economic Developers by Consultant Connect and as an outstanding alumna by Virginia Tech’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.

Javner, a Republican, was serving her fourth term representing District 29, which covers Millinocket and northern Penobscot County. She was 58.

“Her fellow lawmakers saw her take on cancer with strength and resolve,” Fecteau wrote. “She showed up and gave her all to representing the residents of District 29.”

Northwestern Counseling & Support Services’ (NCSS) Parent Child Center provides critical concrete supports to families with young children facing food insecurity, housing instability, and unmet basic needs. Through state and federal funding and strong community partnerships, Parent Child Centers and Vermont Care Partners (VCP) network agencies help prevent[...]","It is increasingly common for staff at the Parent Child Center of NCSS to receive daily requests from families seeking support to meet their basic needs. Many are facing impossible choices between buying groceries, diapers, or paying their heating bill. Inquiries regarding these necessities have steadily increased across the community, and both Parent Child Centers and VCP network agencies are providing the resources to meet these needs.
The Role of Parent Child Centers in Supporting Vermont’s Most Vulnerable Families
NCSS provides support to families from the prenatal period through age six, one of Vermont’s most vulnerable populations, as it holds the unique position as a Parent Child Center embedded within a designated mental health agency. Parent Child Centers are part of a statewide coordinated network written into Vermont statute to provide home and community-based services to families with young children through eight core services. One of those services is providing access to concrete supports, defined in statute as “community services and resources to address the immediate needs of the family or contribute to the long-term well-being of the family, or both.”
Parent Child Centers operate from the belief that families should receive support before a crisis occurs, from trusted people within their own communities. NCSS is well known locally, and its ability to support families from pregnancy through adulthood is a critical component of that trust. Establishing trust and building relationships with families early is foundational to this work. When families are supported early and able to thrive, the communities in which they live are stronger, healthier, and more resilient.

Currently, Parent Child Centers receive federal Community Based Child Abuse Prevention (CBCAP) funds through a Parent Child Center Integrated Grant, which is intended to prevent child maltreatment and improve outcomes for children and families. At NCSS, these funds, alongside annual grant funding from the United Way, are allocated based on community needs. Funds are most often used to prevent evictions and utility shutoffs, purchase warm clothing for children during the winter months, assist with transportation for children with complex medical needs, and in general, reduce the risk of families falling into severe economic hardship. This combination of funding allows NCSS to provide a multifaceted approach to supporting a wide range of families, regardless of income or insurance status.
Community Partnerships and Concrete Supports in Action
NCSS does not work alone to address community needs. Just last month, NCSS’s Parent Child Center and Emergency Services programs partnered with Northwestern Medical Center after identifying families arriving at the emergency department in need of food and basic supplies. Addressing the needs is a core function of NCSS’s Early Childhood Resource Team, which routinely responds to requests for concrete supports. Parent Child Center Supervisor Lindsay Hunn highlighted the urgency of the situation, noting, “Families with young children were showing up at the emergency room with nothing. Working with trusted community partners, such as libraries, hospitals and pediatric offices, is how we meet families where they are, and we felt compelled to respond with the same approach in this situation.”

The need for this support is clear. One in six children in Vermont access SNAP benefits, and in Franklin and Grand Isle counties alone, more than 3,700 households rely on 3Squares. Even with state and federal resources in place, demand for food assistance and other basic needs continues to grow. 
In FY25, NCSS’s Parent Child Center provided more than 250 families with supports, such as diapers, grocery and gas cards, infant formula, and perinatal supplies. These families, and hundreds more, are embedded within a broader system of care, including evidence-based home visits and on-site support at pediatric practices, OBGYN offices, and other local family hubs. Most families requesting financial support receive ongoing case management designed to build family resilience, promote critical social emotional development, bridge connections to community resources, and create a sustainable path to success for every family.
Helping families apply for and remain enrolled in benefits is a critical role of Parent Child Centers and are preparing to expand. Staff are trained to assist in multiple application processes, including Medicaid enrollment, childcare financial assistance and referral support, housing applications, and more. 
In the spring of 2025, in collaboration with Attune2Food, who are a team of nutritionists, the Parent Child Center applied for and received a $20,000 grant to address food insecurity and nutrition equity for children with medical and feeding challenges. The project provided medically tailored meals and snacks to pediatric patients with food allergies, gastrointestinal conditions, and complex feeding needs. 
“Parent Child Centers are well known for their ability to respond creatively to the specific needs of their communities, and our services are more essential now than ever.” says Margaret Walsh, Parent Child Center Program Manager at NCSS.
Why Sustainable Investment in Concrete Supports Matters
While these efforts reflect the dedication of staff, community partners and our strong network of agencies that support families across Vermont, piecing together short-term grants and limited resources is not a sustainable solution. Concrete supports are essential for families. They reduce economic stress, address immediate needs, and prevent situations from escalating. Hunger and lack of access to basic needs are not the result of poor choices or moral failure. They are driven by systemic barriers such as lack of transportation, housing instability, limited access to childcare, rising health care costs, and generational trauma. 
“Parents who lack reliable access to food or warm clothing for their children cannot focus on their mental or physical health, nor are children able to fully engage and thrive across environments. Prevention is the key to maximizing long term positive outcomes for families” says Walsh, and NCSS is working to ensure those benefits are actualized.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)As the state Legislature is set to tackle some potentially contentious issues in the 2026 legislative session, Iowa Republican leaders emphasized “unity” as they gathered for the GOP legislative breakfast Monday before gaveling in.
There have been multiple leadership changes leading into the session that could shift dynamics in the Legislature. Iowa Senate Majority Leader Mike Klimesh and House Majority Leader Bobby Kaufmann are both serving their first session in their new positions. This year will also mark the final session with Gov. Kim Reynolds at the helm, as she will not run for another term as governor.
As Reynolds addressed the crowd, she emphasized the Republican Party was a family, comparing various lawmakers and leaders to characters you might meet at a reunion. As she approached her final session, the governor said Republicans’ accomplishments during her time in office came to be “because we came together.”

“Now we’re back, and we’re ready for what’s next: property tax relief, smaller government, smarter government, stronger and healthier communities, and a whole lot of work that really matters for Iowa families,” Reynolds said.
Reynolds will announce her agenda and budget proposals in her Condition of the State message at 6 p.m. Tuesday.
Despite several leadership changes, several issues brought up in previous legislative sessions are expected to dominate at least early conversations at the Capitol. The use of eminent domain in carbon capture pipeline projects as well as lowering property taxes are both expected to be top issues lawmakers hope to address this year, issues that divided lawmakers and the governor in 2025.
The Iowa Senate sent a measure related to pipelines to the governor that was vetoed, while a property tax measure lead by Kaufmann, then House Ways and Means Committee chair, and Sen. Dan Dawson who heads the Senate Ways and Means Committee, went through multiple iterations but did not make it to a floor vote.

Property taxes, eminent domain debate to return in 2026 Iowa legislative session

The issue of eminent domain has particularly caused friction between members of the Republican Party, showcased most prominently in the Iowa Senate when a group of GOP senators said they would not advance the state budget and allow session to end until a bill related to pipelines was voted on. While Klimesh has said he plans to introduce legislation early in session related to pipeline projects, but it is unclear if this measure will advance through either chamber.
House Speaker Pat Grassley said Iowans should know that although GOP lawmakers will not agree on every single issue, the trifecta remains “unified” on most issues.
“I think the Democrats think that they have an opportunity here, because I think they see how (Republicans) do not all agree on every issue,” Grassley said. “Well, quite frankly, we shouldn’t agree on every single issue. That’s — we are not the Democrat Party, who are told how, what you’re going to do, and if you don’t, you’re ostracized. But as a group, we’ve worked so well together to move this state forward and stay unified.”
Property taxes and eminent domain will not be the only issues lawmakers address in the coming months — statewide elected officials have introduced several measures they hope the Legislature will consider, and other issues like DOGE task force recommendations are expected to come up in legislation this year.
The session will also be held ahead of the 2026 primaries and general election season. Iowa will have multiple high-profile positions with open seats on the ballot, including in the races for governor and U.S. Senate. Republicans at the breakfast repeatedly called for Republicans to rally against state Auditor Rob Sand, who is running as a Democratic candidate for governor, saying that his election would reverse the work done by the GOP trifecta in the past decade.
Kaufmann said Sand has presented himself as a “moderate,” but is the “most partisan auditor” in Iowa history.
“There’s nothing moderate about him,” Kaufmann said. “He will be beholden to the rabid left. … It is imperative, and it is critical, and it is important that we are all in the same family, fighting on the same team, to ensure that what we’ve been so blessed with, with the trifecta here in Iowa, we continue to maintain.”

Legislative recap,Geoff Pender,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/12/teacher-pay-school-choice-legislative-recap-mississippi/,"The House and Senate wasted no time as the 2026 legislative session kicked off in setting up a main battle: school choice, teacher pay and the future of Mississippi's public education.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Republican House and Senate leaders promptly fired the first rounds in a public education policy battle as the 2026 legislative session opened last week, then retreated behind their ramparts.
The Senate passed bills to provide a $2,000 teacher pay raise and only a mild nod to “school choice” — allowing students to more easily transfer between public schools — vowing to stand against more sweeping school-choice measures.
The House dropped such sweeping measures in a 553-page omnibus education bill, including a proposal to allow parents to use millions of tax dollars to pay for private schools, homeschooling or other alternatives to public education. The House has not yet proposed any across-the-board teacher raise.
Legislating is the art of compromise. Will the two sides find middle ground over the next three months of the session?
It’s likely the House’s fall-back position would be to negotiate on a teacher raise, in hopes the Senate would allow more expansive school choice — perhaps for tax credits for private schooling if not direct vouchers. Senate leaders already say they want to negotiate for a larger, more like $5,000, teacher raise. But so far they’ve left no daylight around their opposition to spending tax dollars on private schooling. And House Speaker Jason White has vowed not to use teacher pay as leverage for school choice.
Whatever bargaining or horse-trading is in the offing this year, public school educators and administrators will be closely watching, and perhaps drawn into, the political debate.

Quote of the Week

“I’m very troubled about what we have done. I’m very troubled about what we are doing. I’m very troubled about what we may do in the future.” — Sen. Hob Bryan, voicing his concern over a proposal to pump $1 billion in cash reserves into the state retirement system, without setting up a permanent revenue stream.

In Brief
State revenue up so far for FY’26
The state Legislative Budget Office report for December, the halfway point of fiscal 2026, shows state revenue collections are up $179 million, or 5% compared to the prior year-to-date.
As lawmakers begin their legislative session and prepare to set a more than $7 billion budget for the coming fiscal year, legislative leaders said last week that the state has about $1.5 billion in cash reserves. – Geoff Pender

Black Caucus, faith leaders promote ‘just and equitable’ policies
Members of the Legislative Black Caucus joined faith leaders on Thursday to outline their legislative agenda for the 2026 session, which includes prioritizing public funds for K-12 public education, reforming the criminal justice system, and increasing Mississippi’s workforce participation rate. 
The Rev. Reginald Buckley, pastor of Cade Chapel Missionary Baptist Church in Jackson, encouraged legislators to pass laws that care “for those who are the most vulnerable among us.” 
The caucus is also pushing lawmakers to prioritize policies that strengthen the social safety net, adequately fund historically Black colleges and expand access to affordable health care. – Taylor Vance

Lawmaker targets abortion pills — and speech
Mississippi played a central role in ending constitutional protections for abortion nationwide after the state prevailed in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision that allowed states to ban abortions.
A Mississippi House bill formed the basis for that lawsuit. Even though the state has a near total-abortion ban in effect, some lawmakers are still focused on the issue.
Rep. William Tracy Arnold, a Republican from Booneville, has filed a bill that would introduce harsher penalties on the manufacturing, marketing, mailing and delivery of medications that facilitate abortion. These drugs are already effectively illegal in Mississippi, but this bill would go a step further, criminalizing not just the distribution of these drugs, but even giving “information orally” about them. – Michael Goldberg

Bills would increase minimum wage, unemployment benefits
Among 12 bills referred to the House Workforce Development Committee so far, three would impact a large number of Mississippians.
Rep. Robert Johnson, the House Democratic leader from Natchez, has again proposed a bill creating a state minimum wage starting at $10 an hour. Mississippi is one of only half-a-dozen states without its own minimum wage. The state follows the federal minimum wage, which is $7.25 an hour and has not changed since 2009.
Reps. John Hines, a Democrat from Greenville, and Donnie Bell, a Republican from Fulton and chairman of the Workforce Development Committee, each introduced bills to change weekly unemployment benefits. Bell is proposing to raise the weekly maximum from $235 to $250. Hines is proposing raising the minimum from $30 to $250 with higher earners having higher weekly minimum benefits.. – Katherine Lin 

Safeguards proposed as welfare scandal trial begins
The trial for Ted “Teddy” DiBiase Jr., the first and perhaps the only criminal case to be brought to jurors in the Mississippi welfare scandal that’s unfolded over the last six years, began last week.
In the Legislature, some lawmakers are still attempting to introduce new safeguards on Mississippi’s welfare spending.
Rep. Robert Johnson filed a bill this session that would direct the Legislature’s watchdog committee to conduct a review of subcontracts and subgrants of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families funds awarded by the state’s Department of Human Services at least once every two years. TANF money was at the center of Mississippi’s sprawling welfare scandal. – Michael Goldberg

Senate votes unanimously to pump $1 billion into PERS
The full Senate on Wednesday unanimously passed a measure to funnel $1 billion of cash reserves into the state’s public pension system over the next decade. The proposal now heads to the House for consideration. 
The measure would put half-a-billion dollars of the state’s current surplus into Mississippi’s government pension system, then earmark $50 million a year over the next decade into the underfunded system. 
Sen. Daniel Sparks, a Republican from Belmont who authored the legislation, said giving the Public Employees’ Retirement System a large cash infusion is a necessary next step after the Legislature last year overhauled it. – Taylor Vance
By the Numbers
$132 million
Estimated annual cost of a pay raise approved by the Senate last week for public school teachers and assistants, and university and community college professors.
$87.5 million
The cost to provide private school vouchers for 12,500 students, in the House’s “school choice” proposal unveiled last week.

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A bipartisan panel of legislative leaders voted to rewrite policy and allow lawmakers to mail taxpayer-funded newsletters after the session is over during an election year.
In a practice known as “franking,” the Legislative Coordinating Council’s policy allows representatives to spend up to $6,000 per calendar year and senators up to $18,000 per year on printing and postage for their newsletters. The mail may be delivered to every household within the lawmaker’s district.
A longstanding rule prohibited lawmakers from using their franking privilege after the session concludes during a year in which their chamber is up for election. House members face reelection every two years, while senators are on the ballot every four years.
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican, requested a change in the policy that would set a May 31 deadline for sending newsletters. That could provide a window of up to two months between the end of the session – if lawmakers can finish their work as intended by late March – and the cutoff for sending newsletters.
The franking deadline is meant to prevent incumbents from gaining an upper hand with their state-funded mailings in advance of the August primary or November general election. In non-election years, there is no calendar restriction on when newsletters may be mailed. The filing deadline for candidates in this year’s election cycle is June 1.
In the past, the five Republicans and two Democrats who make up the Legislative Coordinating Council have voted to suspend the rule. During Thursday’s meeting, the council voted to make Hawkins’ request permanent.
“This came about just because every election year we have to do this and start having some folks say, ‘Why are we doing this every election year? Why don’t we just change the policy to make it work right?’ ” Hawkins said. “And so this is that work being done to make our policy correct, and not to have to come back every election year and redo this or make an exception to this policy.”
The seven members of the LCC approved the change without objection.
Several of them are seeking election to statewide office and could benefit from the change. Hawkins and Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes, D-Lenexa, are running for insurance commissioner.

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)It’s expensive to extend fiber-optic cable to the remaining locations in South Dakota that don’t have high-speed internet, so the state is leaning into providers offering service from satellites in space.
The state’s ConnectSD initiative, which began in 2019, had helped bring broadband access to 91% of South Dakota by 2024. A state report noted the remaining 9% would be costly, given the price of bringing miles of fiber to remote areas with few customers. 
The broadband initiative has cost $300 million so far, with funding from federal, state and private sources. Gov. Larry Rhoden announced recently that the state will soon receive another $72 million in federal funding for the effort.
$300 million statewide high-speed internet initiative enters final stretch

A little more than a third of the new funding will go toward  “Low Earth Orbit Satellite” technologies, like SpaceX’s Starlink, to reach 2,705 of the 7,060 locations in the state targeted for the funds. Most of the other targeted connections will come by way of fiber-optic cable, and 177 will come via signals beamed from cellular towers.
The satellite funding will not be used to pay for individual subscriptions, said a spokesperson for the Governor’s Office of Economic Development. 
“Instead, the award reserves network capacity with the provider so service is available in those locations,” said Bri Vande Pol. “The provider is reimbursed on a per-location basis only when a customer subscribes to the service.”
Vande Pol said the federal funding requires providers to make high-speed internet available to each eligible location for at least 10 years. She said the provider receives 25% of the award upon confirming service is available, and the remaining payments for the reserved network capacity are made quarterly over the 10-year period.
The new federal money comes from the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment program, authorized by the 2021 Infrastructure and Jobs Act, passed during the Biden administration.  
“Under the Trump administration’s changes to that program, states are encouraged to use a technology-neutral approach and connect locations in the most efficient way possible,” Vande Pol said. 
“In some of South Dakota’s most remote areas, Low Earth Orbit satellite service is a strong, reliable solution that meets performance standards while allowing us to maximize the reach of available BEAD funding,” she added.

As of June 2025, South Dakota’s ConnectSD program had used $84.4 million in state general funds, $88.5 million in federal funds and $129.6 million in private investment from broadband providers to connect about 31,000 locations. The state and federal money has mostly been spent on grants to service providers, to help them expand their networks.
Rhoden’s latest proposed budget asks lawmakers to authorize $87 million in federal funding to be spent on broadband in the coming fiscal year. 
Rhoden spokeswoman Josie Harms said the $72 million figure announced in a press release represents “the amount that will actually be awarded to the subrecipients.”
“The $87 million amount is the total spending authority, which includes the project costs as well as administrative costs and marketing costs,” she wrote in an email to South Dakota Searchlight.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_7297-scaled-e1685998021856-1024x704.jpg,,,2026-01-12 11:00:16.830031

(Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Legislature’s Republican supermajority convenes Monday for the final session with Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly amid uncertainty about potential redrawing of the state’s congressional map to disenfranchise voters who repeatedly sent U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids to Congress.
Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, and House Speaker Dan Hawkins, D-Wichita, tried to pull off the mid-decade gerrymandering feat in November, but too many House Republicans refused to authorize a special session of the Legislature. Masterson and Hawkins were willing to go along with the gambit requested by President Donald Trump to help Republicans preserve a majority in the U.S. House. Both of these top legislative leaders say redistricting remained high on their priority list.


Davids, initially elected to the U.S. House in 2018, offered a personal assessment on that possibility: “Kansans have been crystal clear. They don’t want politicians stacking the deck to cling to power. I hope all lawmakers in Topeka are listening.”
Masterson likely could corral enough GOP votes to pass a redistricting bill in the Senate and override a veto by Kelly. Hawkins, who punished GOP colleagues who declined to endorse a special session on redistricting, says he hadn’t secured the votes to complete an override of Kelly. He would need to find 84 Republican votes in the 125-member House because Democrats have expressed no interest in helping with redistricting.
“I learned a long time ago that when you get thrown by the bull, you dust yourself off and you climb back on,” Hawkins said. “Now, we prepare for Jan. 12. When it gets here, House Republicans will be ready to ride.”

Flood of speeches
The House and Senate are scheduled to convene at 2 p.m. Monday for what would typically be a 90-calendar-day session ending in April. Legislators may find sufficient urgency to finish most of their work by the end of March, given the desire for full-time campaigning by those seeking statewide office.
Masterson is seeking the GOP nomination for governor, while Hawkins is running for insurance commissioner. Among Democrats in the Legislature, Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes is also a candidate for insurance commissioner. Sen. Ethan Corson and Sen. Cindy Holscher, both of Johnson County, are campaigning for governor.
Kansas Supreme Court Chief Justice Eric Rosen is scheduled to deliver the annual State of the Judiciary speech to a joint session of the Legislature at 1:30 p.m. Tuesday. It will be his first after being sworn in last week as chief justice.
At 6:30 p.m. Tuesday in the same House chamber, Kelly is to deliver her eighth and final State of the State speech to the Legislature. It will be broadcast on public television and be available by livestream on YouTube.
The governor is expected to emphasize her legislative priorities and report on the status of Kansas. Her formal budget recommendations are scheduled to be presented Wednesday to the House and Senate budget committees. The Legislature has been working on its own spending blueprint.
Hawkins, who is expected to offer the Republican rebuttal to the governor’s State of the State speech Tuesday night, said he was interested in the Legislature limiting the ability of local units of government to jack up property appraisals and increase property taxes. He also has expressed interesting in dealing with ongoing concerrns with universities, including “discriminatory” diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the curriculum.

Cellphones, lawsuit caps
Before adjourning, the 125 House members and 40 senators as well as the governor have a constitutional responsibility to approve a state budget for the fiscal year starting July 1.
The list of topics routinely debated each year touch on education, health care, elections, transportation, child care, immigration, economic development, abortion, water, foster care, public safety and the courts.
Before the gavel fell, two-thirds of the Kansas Senate endorsed a bipartisan bill that would require public and private schools statewide to establish policies restricting use of cellphones in school. The measure would mandate disciplinary action for violators.
“Phone-free schools give students space to think, build authentic human relationships and protect student mental health from constant digital pressure,” said Sen. Chase Blasi, a Republican from Andale.
Valentina Blanchard, an analyst with Kansas Health Institute, said a Kansas task force studied the student cellphone issue in 2024, but legislators seemed content at that time to allow individuals school districts decide whether to create policies.
“This is a pretty hot topic right now,” she said. “Thirty-one states plus D.C. have passed some sort of statewide policy related to what that needs to look like.”
Dan Murray, director of the National Federation of Independent Businesses in Kansas, said the Legislature ought to restore a financial ceiling on non-economic damages in personal injury lawsuits. In 2019, the Kansas Supreme Court ruled caps in Kansas violated a person’s right to a jury trial and were unconstitutional.
“When a small business owner is hit with a frivolous lawsuit, they often have to divert time and resources away from running their business,” Murray said. “Capping non-economic damages would go a long way in providing commonsense guardrails within our judicial system.”
Rep. Pat Proctor, a Leavenworth Republican running for secretary of state, asked constituents in an online survey what they wanted done in the 2026 session. He checked interest in moving all elections to even years, requiring political campaigns to disclose when relying on artificial intelligence in campaign advertisements, and placing a ban on city and school district spending to influence the political process.
“I’m preparing a battle plan for my final year as chairman of the House Elections Committee,” he said.
Democratic Rep. John Carmichael said he was disappointed there were no public forums in the Wichita area for voters to share views on policy issues ahead of the annual session.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)A Democratic state lawmaker from Juneau has proposed a ban on face masks and disguises for on-duty police officers, who could be charged with a misdemeanor for each violation.
House Bill 250, from Rep. Sara Hannan, D-Juneau, was one of 26 bills published Friday by the Alaska Legislature during the Legislature’s informal preseason.
Among the other proposals: mandating that homeschool programs increase the number of students taking standardized tests, eliminating the state’s Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission, banning the sale of over-the-counter weight-loss products to children and requiring school districts to come up with a policy that states what they do if someone uses AI to impersonate a district official.
Lawmakers will convene Jan. 20 for their 2026 regular session, and they can introduce pieces of legislation in advance, effectively allowing the public a sneak peek before they are formally introduced on the first day of the session.
A second round of bills will be published next Friday, Jan. 16. 
The odds of any particular bill becoming law are long. 
In the 33rd Alaska Legislature, which covered 2023-2024, legislators and the governor introduced 665 bills, prefiled and not. Only 89 became law, a conversion rate of just over 13%.
While they might not immediately become law, prefiled bills can raise ideas that become law in subsequent years. In 2022, for example, legislators updated the state’s alcohol laws after almost 10 years of prior attempts, including some that were prefiled.
When it comes to the mask ban, Hannan’s bill arrives just days after a masked federal officer shot and killed a Minnesota woman on camera, sparking national outrage. 
Hannan said her bill isn’t a direct response to that. She has been hearing about the issue from constituents “for going on a year,” she said.
“Many of our law enforcement encounters with people, is an attempt to de-escalate and understand a situation, and so much of communication is nonverbal,” she said. “It’s body language, it’s facial visualizations, and I think it’s a huge disservice for it to become standard practice in standard enforcement activities to be masking faces of law enforcement officers.”
The mask ban would not apply to medical masks, transparent face shields or for undercover officers.
Violating the ban would be a Class B misdemeanor. 
HB 250 and the rest of the prefiled bills will formally be referred to committees for discussion once the Legislature convenes.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Federal immigration authorities intensified a weekslong operation in the Twin Cities over the weekend following the Wednesday killing of Renee Nicole Good by ICE agent Jonathan Ross.
Residents pushed back, led by a growing network of rapid responders hounding U.S. ICE and Border Patrol vehicles and agents across the metro area.
Thousands marched peacefully in Minneapolis Saturday to remember Good and protest the Trump administration’s expanding immigration crackdown. Many marchers stopped to pay their respects as the procession moved from Powderhorn Park past the intersection where the fatal shooting occurred.
Saturday’s protest, the largest since Good’s killing, was more subdued than a Friday evening gathering outside downtown Minneapolis hotels where ICE agents were said to be staying.
Protesters blew whistles, banged drums and shouted taunts outside the hotels for hours before some tried to force their way into the Canopy by Hilton at 700 Third Street South, causing about $6,000 in damage, the Star Tribune reported. City and state police ordered protesters to disperse around midnight and arrested about 30 people without incident, officials said Saturday.
Near Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, a smaller group braved chilly winds to maintain a near-permanent presence outside an ICE operations hub and detention center.
U.S. Reps.  Ilhan Omar, Angie Craig and Kelly Morrison said they were denied entry to the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building shortly after arriving for what they called an oversight visit on Saturday morning.
Later in the day, Politico reported that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — who oversees ICE and said this weekend she’d ordered hundreds more agents to join at least 2,000 already in the Twin Cities — signed an order on Thursday requiring a week’s notice for Congressional visits to immigrant detention centers.
Multiple people released from Whipple told independent journalists that they’d been verbally or physically abused in or en route to detention there. Two said agents used demeaning language to describe Good and suggested she’d deserved her fate.

The Reformer has not independently verified the Whipple detainees’ claims. In a separate video posted on Sunday by a Minneapolis Reddit user, an ICE agent tells a driver to “[g]o home to your children…have you not learned from what just happened?”
Sunday saw more reports of federal law enforcement activity in St. Paul. One bystander video purported to show agents going “door to door” on Thomas Avenue near Victoria Street, possibly making good on Vice President JD Vance’s promise earlier this week of house-by-house immigration operations. Armed personnel questioned shoppers at a nearby Target. And a crowd heckled agents as they appeared to pull a man out of his car at a gas station on Snelling Avenue.

A multi-agency operation that at times felt like an outright occupation had many Twin Cities residents — not just hardened activists — calling for ICE to withdraw and deeper reform of federal immigration policy.
On Sunday, outgoing U.S. Sen. Tina Smith told CNN that she was listening, but stopped short of promising to lead the “abolish ICE” movement in Washington.
“It is hard for me to imagine how I could vote to support a budget bill for the Department of Homeland Security, given how the Department of Homeland Security is functioning right now in my community,” she said. “I want to see work done that would bring some serious reforms to ICE.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MG_2597-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-12 09:12:09.480705

HOST: Jennifer Smith
GUEST: Lynn Mayor Jared Nicholson; Jennie Williamson, the state director of The Education Trust in Massachusetts; Clark Ziegler, executive director of the Massachusetts Housing Partnership







AS BEACON HILL gears up for the second leg of its two-year legislative cycle, lawmakers are staring down a series of overlapping crises in housing, health care, education, and the state’s financial health generally. Outside and under the Golden Dome, municipalities and advocates have no shortage of suggestions. 
This week on The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon reporter Jennifer Smith hosts a start-of-year roundtable with Lynn Mayor Jared Nicholson; Jennie Williamson, the state director of the research and advocacy organization The Education Trust in Massachusetts; and Clark Ziegler, the outgoing executive director of the Massachusetts Housing Partnership, who is retiring after four decades at the helm of the quasi-public organization.  
All three noted that Beacon Hill seems to recognize the need for action — be it ramping up housing production or addressing the literacy crisis among young people — but “much more work needs to be done” Ziegler said. 
For Zeigler, the past few years included some promising housing swings like the MBTA Communities law and the housing bond bill that legalized accessory dwelling units in single-family zoning areas. At the same time, “the housing trends are really discouraging,” he said, noting that production last year was at a 12-year-low, “so there’s enormous unmet need to promote housing development and to remove barriers to new housing.” 
He points to potential housing legislation in the Senate, which includes recommendations from a Healey task force focused on unlocking housing production – like removing large lot size requirements or parking minimums – as a promising move this term. 
Williamson said the state needs to face that a quality education for most students in Massachusetts is closely tied to where they live and their families’ incomes, with some of the nation’s widest education gaps. 
“I think the broader issue we’re facing here in Massachusetts is that we’re patting ourselves on the back for being number one in education,” she said, “but when you look beyond the state averages, there is a much more complicated and, frankly, troubling story that emerges. And that’s that we’re really only number one for some.” 
Despite investments in K-12 education and a focus on supporting high need students, she said, the outcomes “aren’t improving at the pace we need.” On addressing the state literacy crisis, she said, efforts like providing funds to districts to transition them to so-called “evidence-based reading curriculums,” and a House bill that would require all districts to use those curriculums, are meaningful. 
Even with a supportive gubernatorial administration and local delegation, Nicholson noted, cities are struggling to adequately fund their education systems. 
“One of the big issues that remains to be tackled is municipal revenue and the limitations that municipalities experience trying to provide the services that our residents rely on,” he said, referring to the Proposition 2 1/2 limit on raising municipal taxes over time and “really intense cost pressures” in areas outside of municipal control like pension obligations and health insurance for city employees. 
“There are a lot of good ideas at play — bold ideas at play,” Ziegler said. “We just need to see them through, and that’s where crunch time in a Legislature really matters.”

States have had mixed success in luring jobs and investments with tax abatements, upfront cash and other goodies.  And at least 75% of the time, companies would have made the same location decisions had incentives not been offered, according to research by Tim Bartik, senior economist at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo.
But rapid technological change, political shifts, market upheavals and outright hostility to major development projects have made putting taxpayer dollars into massive brick-and-mortar factories and data centers an increasingly risky endeavor.
In 2021, Ford announced an $11.4 billion investment—the largest in its history—to build an electric vehicle assembly plant and battery plant in Tennessee and two battery plants in Kentucky in a joint venture with SK Innovation. The complexes were expected to employ 11,000 workers.
But faced with sluggish demand for EVs and a new administration in Washington hostile to clean energy, Ford ditched that strategy in December.
Its Blue Oval City complex in Tennessee is being renamed the Tennessee Truck Center and will build a line of gas-powered pickups there. Ford also dissolved its joint venture with SK Innovation, which will own the Tennessee battery plant.
The automaker is taking sole ownership of the Kentucky battery plants and will use them to produce energy storage systems for rapidly multiply artificial intelligence data centers, utility companies and other large-scale customers.

About 1,500 workers are being laid off from the plants and can reapply for their jobs, angering those workers and some state officials. Kentucky gave Ford a $250 million loan plus the land the plants were built on.
Tennessee handed Ford $1 billion in incentives for the truck and battery plants that were expected to employ nearly 6,000 workers. It’s unclear whether Ford will meet that employment goal.
Prior to announcing its $19.5 billion hit on its EV business, Ford had already cut anticipated employment at its Marshall battery plant from 2,500 jobs to 1,700 positions. Its December announcement said the plant will convert from producing EV batteries to nonautomotive energy storage units.
Stunned by Ford’s 2021 announcement of investments in Tennessee and Kentucky, Michigan quickly enacted the Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve Fund to attract similar projects to the state.
Ford and General Motors Co. were the biggest recipients of funding from the $2 billion SOAR pot for new EV vehicle assembly and battery plants. Those plants have either been sold to their joint venture partners or converted to build gas-powered vehicles.
GM sold its SOAR-supported Lansing battery plant to joint venture partner LG Energy Solution. It abandoned plans to convert its Orion Township assembly plant to EV production. And it recently laid off 1,100 workers at its Factory Zero EV plant in Hamtramck.
On Friday, GM said it would take a $6 billion hit to earnings on its EV business.
Consumer demand for EVs that has fallen far short of expectations is the major reason that automakers are slashing their EV investment. But a radical shift in support for EVs from the
Biden to Trump administrations is a significant factor.
President Joe Biden gave automakers, state governments and consumers billions of dollars in EV incentives in an effort to address climate change and help Detroit catch up to China, which dominates the EV business.

Even Ford CEO Jim Farley has warned that highly advanced Chinese cars “could put us all out of business.”
But President Donald Trump has wiped out much of that assistance, including the elimination of $7,500 consumer tax credits for EV purchases. He claims climate change is “a hoax” and has disparaged Biden’s clean energy agenda as the “green new scam.”
Michigan economic developers also are contending with a backlash by residents against major new-technology projects supported by tax dollars.
Battery maker Gotion pulled the plug on its proposed giant battery plant in Mecosta County last fall following years of controversy about its Chinese parent company and resident concerns about its environmental impact and size of the plant.  Michigan is attempting to claw back $23.7 million in SOAR funding spent on the plant.
There also is heated, widespread opposition by residents to about a dozen proposed hyperscale data centers. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has thrown her support behind a particularly controversial one in Saline Township, saying its construction is a matter of national security and economic competitiveness.
Other elected officials are growing weary of greasing such huge projects that don’t pay off with taxpayer dollars. Lawmakers killed SOAR last year and did not replace it with a new deal-closing fund.
The Upjohn Institute’s Bartik said he thinks the Trump administration’s attack on EVs and other clean energy technologies will be “a blip in history” and that it still makes sense for the state to support the inevitable long-term growth of fossil fuel alternatives. But he acknowledges it’s difficult for such projects to pay off in the current climate.
“In the short run” the market and Trump’s actions “impede investment,” Bartik told me. “The only thing the state can do is strike deals with strong clawback provisions or incentivize projects that can be repurposed for other uses” should they fail.

Days after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a U.S. citizen in Minneapolis, Californians across the state took to the streets to voice their opposition against federal immigration enforcement tactics and President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign.
Over the weekend thousands of demonstrators gathered in Sacramento, San Francisco and the Bay Area, the Central Valley and Southern California including Los Angeles and San Diego in remembrance of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three who was killed during an ICE operation. 
Protests remained largely peaceful, though one demonstration Friday night in Santa Ana led to U.S. Department of Homeland Security officers firing what appeared to be less lethal munitions into a crowd of protesters, according to ABC 7. One officer was reported dragging a protester who was bloodied by the clash, but local police did not report any arrests from that event.
The shooting also came into focus on Saturday during a gubernatorial candidate forum in L.A., reports the Los Angeles Times. During the union-backed event, which included a panel of eight Democrats, U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell said “Ms. Good should be alive today.” 
The Trump administration has maintained that the officer who shot Good feared for his life. The California Republican Party circulated a video of First Assistant U.S. Attorney and former Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli defending ICE’s actions, arguing that “officers are fully justified in using any force they need to protect their lives.”
Good’s killing follows the death of Keith Porter, another American, who was shot and killed on Dec. 31 by an off-duty ICE officer in the L.A. neighborhood of Northridge. 
In response to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, some Democratic state legislators have recently introduced bills to curb ICE activity, including proposals that would limit arrests in courthouses and enable Californians to sue for damages from federal agents — though questions about the measures’ legality and enforcement capabilities remain.

Newsom’s last budget show


Gov. Newsom speaks at the state Capitol in Sacramento on Jan. 8, 2026. Photo by Miguel Gutierrez Jr., CalMatters




Let the bargaining begin. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom’s $349 billion state spending plan is on the table, reports CalMatters’ Yue Stella Yu.
Now all he has to do is get lawmakers on board with proposals that many of them won’t especially like, including consolidating more power of education under his office at the expense of the elected state superintendent; clipping funding for homelessness; and holding the line on health care spending at a time when the Trump administration is overhauling how it pays for Medicaid.
It could work — as long as the AI boom that’s padding state tax revenue keeps going. 
The governor’s budget projects $9 billion more in revenue than anticipated and a “modest” $2.9 billion shortfall for the 2026-27 fiscal year. His proposal also calls for spending almost $30 billion more compared to this year.
The budget plan would fully fund the state’s transitional kindergarten program, provide an additional $715 million combined to its two public university systems and increase special education funding by more than $500 million. 
Funding for other state initiatives, however, would be significantly gutted: Newsom proposed halving a $1 billion infusion for cities and counties’ homelessness services, and cutting $15 billion from the state’s spending that goes toward combatting the effects of climate change.

AI adversaries team up on ballot initiative

A nonprofit organization that advocates for children’s safety online and the artificial intelligence powerhouse OpenAI are teaming up to place a measure on the November ballot that would help protect kids in California from companion chatbots, writes CalMatters’ Khari Johnson.
Common Sense Media and OpenAI, which created ChatGPT, filed a ballot proposal Thursday to mandate various safeguards against chatbots. These include:

Requiring chatbot developers to apply protective settings for people with a predicted age of 17 and younger.
Banning child-targeted advertising and the sale of kids’ data without parental consent.
Preventing AI systems from promoting social isolation or simulating romantic relationships with kids.

The measure reflects a compromise between the two entities, after each planned their own separate and competing ballot initiatives that would have taken different paths toward regulating chatbots. Those proposals had stipulations that the one that got the most “yes” votes would win. 
OpenAI’s measure largely reflected existing law, while the one from Common Sense included proposed regulations that were ultimately dropped in the new ballot initiative, such as a ban on minors from using chatbots capable of engaging in sexually explicit talk.

Fire victims are left with delays, gaslighting and denials.","Guest Commentary written by

Richard Rieber
Richard Rieber is an aerospace engineer and Altadena resident whose home was damaged in the fire.


I am an aerospace engineer by trade, but for the last year my second full-time job has been fighting my insurance company. I am one of thousands of Eaton Fire survivors caught in a second disaster — not in the canyons, but in the fine print. 
After the tragic Eaton and Palisades fires, survivors looked to their insurers to help rebuild. We’d paid premiums for decades exactly for this moment. Yet we’ve been met with obstruction, delay and bureaucracy. 
Navigating this quagmire multiplies the trauma of those grieving the loss of their homes, belongings and community.
The California Unfair Insurance Practices Act was created in 1959 to protect consumers from such tactics. Unfortunately, every fire survivor has a story about their insurer violating it — rotating adjusters, ignoring emails and disregarding legally mandated deadlines. 
Yet, to date, there has not been a single public enforcement action related to these fires. California’s laws are a regulatory mirage: they offer the illusion of protection but vanish the moment a homeowner tries to invoke them.
The most insidious insurer violation is “toxic gaslighting.” Thousands of residents downwind of the fires are battling to abate smoke and soot damage, yet insurers frequently deny those claims, arguing that smoke doesn’t constitute fire damage. 
The soot that blanketed our communities contains carcinogens, including lead, asbestos and heavy metals. Yet insurers rarely pay for the industrial hygienist testing required to confirm the presence of such substances. Instead, insurers pressure homeowners to believe a simple vacuum and wipe-down will suffice. That leaves behind toxic particulates, putting residents at risk. Some victims have paid thousands out-of-pocket for their own testing, only to have their results ignored.
Under the current status quo, the Department of Insurance complaint process is a black hole. There is a near-zero response rate to homeowners who submit complaints. 
Only if the department receives an overwhelming number of complaints about a single insurer will it consider an investigation. Then, like with a class-action lawsuit, the state’s “market conduct examination” is a lengthy process that concludes well after a rebuild has finished, failing to offer timely recourse to the individual homeowner. 
For a survivor, time is a weapon. Most policies include “additional living expense” coverage that would pay for rent while a home is repaired, but in a post-disaster market where rents have skyrocketed, this fund is quickly consumed. 
We are not seeing the full consequences yet, but the outcome already is clear: families will soon face the choice of homelessness or accepting an unsafe settlement. 
Every ignored phone call helps drain the additional living expense funds. As the money runs out, people’s resolve weakens and unfair settlements become increasingly attractive. Delay has become a profitable business strategy.
And asking individual homeowners to face down the Goliath of insurance corporations while the state regulator idly collects statistics is untenable. 
Back in 1988, a California Supreme Court ruling stripped away consumers’ right to sue for violations of California’s unfair insurance practices law. By decreeing that only the Insurance Commissioner, not the victim, has the power to punish these violations, the court effectively removed any immediate consequence for insurer malfeasance.
Now California needs a radical shift to change this economic equation. We must restore the accountability lost in 1988 by creating a streamlined, administrative path for justice. 
We should allow the insurance department to validate complaints and pass them to administrative law judges, who can adjudicate individual violations in real-time. The judges would have the authority to decide a fair claim amount and levy a significant fine — paid directly to the insured, not the state.
This creates an immediate financial consequence for non-compliance and ensures that insurers’ bad-faith practices are no longer profitable.
Furthermore, any company-caused delay should trigger a “delay tax,” in the form of additional living expense payments, over and above the policy limit. If the insurer drags its feet, it — not the survivor — must foot the bill for people’s extended displacement. 
The insurance department’s complaint system also must be rebuilt, so it can provide real-time feedback and receive surge funding during disasters. To prevent insurers from hiding behind a lack of evidence, the Insurance Commissioner should establish an “ash zone” perimeter within which smoke damage is presumed and testing is mandatory. 
Finally, the state should launch a “Know Your Rights” campaign after every disaster, so insurers can’t exploit a survivor’s ignorance of the law.
Insurance companies are entitled to due process, but fire survivors are entitled to the good faith they earned by paying decades of premiums. Until the cost of non-compliance outweighs insurers’ savings from malfeasance and delay, California’s homeowners will continue to be victimized twice — once by a disaster and then by insurers.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010825_Eaton-Fire_TS_CM_04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-12 08:57:32.811558

Steven Bradford
Steven Bradford, a former state legislator from Gardena, is running for Insurance Commissioner


With the first anniversary of the devastating Southern California wildfires approaching, CalMatters asked candidates for the 2026 state Insurance Commissioner race to share thoughts on what the state can do to help victims and stabilize insurers. This is the fourth response. Read the other candidate responses here, here and here.
Growing up in Gardena, we would sit around the dinner table and my father would share stories about  the importance of life insurance. You see, my father, Booker, sold life insurance. I understood from an early age, watching and listening to him, the value of insurance for life, household and automobile. 
I can remember Sundays after church being with my father and watching him help folks understand the importance of purchasing appropriate insurance and of not missing a premium payment to keep the policy in force. 
It is this consumer-based background that I’ll bring to the office of the Insurance Commissioner — a lifelong appreciation of the importance of insurance.
How can California keep home insurers and coverage in the state?
I am reminded of Al Gore’s book, “An Inconvenient Truth.” He emphasized that while we have policies that can address climate change, the political will to change lags. Gore also was correct when he described the science as an “inconvenient truth.”  We cannot have it both ways — either climate change is real and we must deal with it responsibly, or not. 
I am not going to sugarcoat this — insurance rates are an issue in play because reality is in play. I promise that any rate impacts will be based on science, reality and the long-term best interests of Californians.  California can incentivize home insurers to increase market capacity by continuing to implement a sustainable insurance strategy. 
We can be faster and more efficient when reviewing rate filings by increasing the rate review team, eliminating non-productive administrative hurdles not mandated by Proposition 103 and concentrating on eliminating the uncertainty and friction inherent in the current regulation-based rate and form application process.
We must create a fast path, or a flex band, for rate increases or decreases below a certain  threshold (for example, 5%).  And it is only common sense that we deregulate commercial rates because commercial policyholders are sophisticated purchasers with sophisticated brokers and risk managers and other tools at their disposal. 
How can California prevent insurers from price gouging?
To create the best options for consumers, we must have a vibrant insurance market with competition.  As Commissioner, I will ensure that consumers have options – this means a competitive market with multiple insurers competing for business. 
As Insurance Commissioner I will ensure that insurers are not taking advantage of consumers but receive the rate review process necessary to keep their capital in California. I will modernize and adequately staff the department’s rate regulation bureau to examine insurers that attempt to charge excessive rates.
I plan to enhance consumer education. 
Despite all the disruptions in recent years, prices in California are about even with the national average and much lower than in East Coast natural disaster zones. When considering the high cost of homes and rebuilding, one can plausibly argue that California property insurance rates are currently appropriate compared to other disaster-risk places in our country.
How should California stabilize the FAIR Plan? 
The current over-reliance on the FAIR Plan is not sustainable. We must begin a process to  depopulate the number of policies in the FAIR Plan. I believe this will best be done by a fully  functional, competitive insurance market. 
I support the implementation of Assembly Bill 226, which will allow for the issuance of bonds to finance the costs of claims, to increase the liquidity and claims-paying capacity of the FAIR Plan, to refund bonds previously issued for that purpose and reduce the reliance on expensive reinsurance.
We did this 25 years ago when faced with a workers’ compensation meltdown. Assemblymember Lisa Calderon’s bill can do it again with respect to the property insurance crisis we now face. 
I want to evaluate including the FAIR Plan in the California Insurance Guarantee Association, as a means to more efficiently spread risk among all of the parties that are benefitted by — and burdened by — the realities of the California market. 
In summary, reinvigorating our insurance market will not occur overnight, because the problems and issues did not materialize overnight. It will take time and the will power to make difficult decisions. I have that ability and am willing to make those difficult choices. 
But let’s keep in mind, California insurance consumers still pay less than East Coastal hurricane  zone rate payers. The California insurance market has not collapsed the way it has in Florida, where  major insurers — not just the low-market-share companies — have abandoned the state. 
All we have to do is look at the Florida insurance market to learn what not to do. 
We have an opportunity to fix our market here. We just must be honest, smart and  reasonable.

TRANSITION PORTAL

Commissioned by The Nevada Department of Transportation 
November 17, 2017 
A symbolic rite of passage to honor humanity’s transition to a sustainable and harmonious technological future. 
Below the text, a QR code is etched into the stainless steel. When scanned with a smart phone, the code navigates to an error page. 
Beyond this relatively small arch, in a high desert valley rapidly filling with massive data centers, lies the northern terminus of the Greenlink West transmission line at Comstock Meadows Substation. 
When the Berkshire Hathaway Energy subsidiary NV Energy officially announced the 525 kV transmission line project known as Greenlink, it explicitly described the project as vital and necessary to fulfill the State of Nevada’s mandate to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels. In its July 2021 Plan of Development, NV Energy stated: 
“Development of the Greenlink West Transmission Project facilitates access to renewable energy zones and is necessary to accommodate decommissioning of conventional fossil fuel generation resources.” 
In 2021, NV Energy estimated the combined cost for construction of the Greenlink North and Greenlink West transmission projects would be $2.5 billion. By the time the project was granted federal approval in September 2024, that number had ballooned to $4.2 billion, and the company was already appealing to the state’s Public Utilities Commission to approve increases in the base rate for electricity. Nevada’s monopoly electric utility company sought to pass a portion of the cost of construction on to its customers, and in return, Nevadans were promised a secure, redundant, reliable, and lower carbon-footprint electric grid. 
In September 2025, the PUC approved a rate hike of $4 per month in Southern Nevada specifically to recoup Greenlink West construction costs, in addition to a state-wide peak usage rate that will increase electricity bills by over $25 for most customers. This rate hike fits into a broader trend of increasing economic stress on a growing proportion of Americans, with difficulty affording electric bills reported as particularly acute. 
In spite of its optimistic name, the Greenlink transmission project has been criticized by environmental groups, who argue that in addition to damage to Nevada wild lands from construction of the transmission line itself, this infrastructure will accelerate rapid development of industrial solar installations on wild public lands adjacent to the line. 
In May 2025, Friends of Nevada Wilderness and Basin and Range Watch jointly filed a lawsuit against the Bureau of Land Management and other federal agencies to halt the construction of Greenlink West on the grounds that they violated federal environmental law during the review process. These watchdog organizations see Greenlink West as the initial hairline fracture running through some of the last remaining unbroken wild land in the lower 48 states, opening up the Nevada outback as a sacrifice zone in the name of decarbonization. 
This intention is explicit: NV Energy has pitched the project from the start as a conduit for bringing electricity generated from massive new solar fields in remote areas of the desert to the centers of demand around Reno and Las Vegas. 
But where and to whom will this brave new voltage actually flow? 
The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported in September 2025 that NV Energy acknowledged a suite of tech companies will be allowed to access electricity transmitted via Greenlink lines. The combined Greenlink North and West will be able to transmit up to 5,000 MW. NV Energy has promised Switch, Novva, and others up to 4,000 MW for a complex of massive AI data centers in the greater Reno area. 
This recent wave of high-tech development in northern Nevada is concentrated at the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, along the Truckee River between Sparks and Fernley, where Switch opened a 130 MW data center next door to the Tesla Gigafactory in 2017. Since then, Google, Tract, EdgeCore, Novva, Vantage, PowerHouse, Apple, Blockchains, and Microsoft also acquired land in the area and began building data centers. Tucked in behind Google’s data center complex at the south end of Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center is NV Energy’s Comstock Meadows Substation, currently undergoing an expansion to become the northernmost node of Greenlink. 
In order to keep up with the spike in electricity demand caused by these new data centers, Mark IV Capital has announced plans to construct a 1,800 MW natural gas generating station in nearby Fernley, with intent to transfer the plant to NV Energy. This, too, fits a broader trend of big tech rushing to build fossil fuel-powered generating stations to power data centers.
Incidentally, the southern terminus of the Greenlink West transmission line is at the Apex Generating Station northeast of Las Vegas, which will enable NV Energy to bring power produced there from natural gas all the way to northern Nevada. 
Contrary to the purpose stated in NV Energy’s Plan of Development, Greenlink will not result in decommissioning of fossil fuel power generation. Instead, Nevada can expect an increase in power generated from fossil fuels due to the sharp spike in demand caused by these data centers, in spite of a concurrent increase in renewable energy. 
Communities across the Southwest have started to take stock of the effects of the current boom in artificial intelligence, especially the tremendous amounts of electricity and water consumed by data centers. In Arizona, Tucson’s city council unanimously rejected a proposed Amazon Web Services data center in August 2025, and Page residents filed a referendum to stop a data center on the banks of the Colorado River in December. 
As it becomes apparent that the electricity demand of new data centers in northern Nevada will eclipse the transmission capacity of the new Greenlink lines before the project is completed, Nevadans have now joined the ranks of ordinary working people across the country subsidizing Big Tech’s AI infrastructure buildout through their local electric utility. Will Greenlink ever fulfill its promise to bring clean energy to Nevada homes and businesses? Is the state any closer to its decarbonization goals?",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Comstock-Overview-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-12 08:12:08.857031

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utahns may soon no longer be able to sue third parties for being responsible for damaging their marriages. That’s if the state Legislature votes to abolish the right to file civil claims for what courts define as “alienation of affection.”  
Woods Cross Republican Sen. Todd Weiler is sponsoring a bill this year that, if passed, would specify in the state code that come May 6, “there is no right of action for alienation of affections.” 
Turning the bill into law would place Utah in line with the majority of states that have prohibited it as a cause of action for lawsuits, Weiler said. It would also do away with a “patently offensive concept.” 
“This legal claim stems from this medieval concept that a wife is the chattel of her husband, and if somebody else is getting favors or taking advantage, that they owe some type of money to the husband because they’ve used his property,” Weiler said in an interview Friday. 
Utah radio personalities and even the Utah Division of Wildlife have been part of these types of lawsuits, according to a 2004 report from the Deseret News. A former member of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, for example, sued church leaders for $10 million arguing they influenced his divorce after convincing his ex-wife she couldn’t achieve salvation if she remained married to him. That lawsuit was dismissed.

Last year a North Carolina case made national headlines when a TikTok influencer was ordered to pay $1.75 million after a jury found her liable for having an affair with her manager, according to CNN.
Weiler said that case didn’t influence his decision to run the bill. But, other cases of “vengeful” litigation and threats have, especially since the cause of action has been used to up the ante and make divorce settlements harder, he said.
“It also, I think, disrespects the free will of parties who have decided to move on to a different relationship,” Weiler said. “And so, because it’s mostly just weaponized these days, and that’s why it’s been, I think, banned in other states, we’re just just taking that off the table.”
Weiler is also sponsoring a bill that would strike Utah from the short list of states that allow common-law marriages, or marriages that are legally recognized between two people without a marriage license or a solemnized wedding.
If the Legislature votes to approve his proposal, “a marriage that is not properly solemnized (will become) invalid unless a court or administrative order legally recognized the marriage before May 6, 2026.”
This is more of a cleanup bill, Weiler said, and wouldn’t have an impact on how couples choose to have their wedding officiated.
Utah has been moving away from common-law marriage for a while, Weiler said. The state currently allows the “recognition of an unsolemnized marriage.” So, couples who have lived together longer than they have been married can sometimes claim the marriage started with their cohabitation.
“It just complicates, and I think, bogs down litigation. And the uncertainty of it all makes it harder to settle a case,” Weiler said. “And we don’t want to make cases hard to settle, because then, if every case goes to trial, then we have more backlog, and we have to build more courthouses and hire more judges.”

The Alabama Legislature begins its 2026 legislative session on Tuesday, with many lawmakers expecting to focus on the budgets and eschew larger issues. (Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)If legislators’ main goal for the 2026 Alabama legislative session could be summarized in five words, they would be “let’s get this over with.”
With elections looming — and lawmakers forbidden from fundraising while the Legislature is in session — Senate Pro Tempore Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, said in an interview Wednesday that his priority for the session, beginning on Tuesday, is to pass the state’s budgets, the legislature’s only constitutional obligation, and get back to the districts to campaign.
“I think people are gravitating towards willing to go back home and get ready to start politicking back in our district. If we’re able to get in and get out, I think that’s a positive for all of our members in both houses of the Legislature,” Gudger said.

It’s a traditional approach to election year sessions, and most lawmakers are expecting not to address large issues lacking immediate urgency.
“I am not sure we are going to have a big push on much of anything this year,” said Senate Finance and Taxation General Fund Chair Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, in an interview on Monday. “As far as criminal justice is concerned, I have not heard anything of significance coming that way.”
But that doesn’t mean there will be no major issues awaiting lawmakers. Legislators will have to address requested increases in the state’s two public employee health insurance programs.
That could affect two other education programs. Legislators will be tempted to extend pay raises to teachers this year, but whether the money will be there is uncertain.
There will likely be a push to expand the CHOOSE Act, a voucher-like program that gives $7,000 to students for non-public education expenses, including private school tuition. But there may also be some balking at the price tag.
Legislators will also consider proposals to expand capital punishment in the state, one of which may be at odds with a U.S. Supreme Court case.




A fast session start

When the Legislature is in session, lawmakers typically hold legislative sessions on Tuesdays and Thursdays, with Wednesdays serving as committee days. Senate President Pro Tem Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, said he expects each chamber to be in session Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday for the first two weeks, possibly the third. Attempts to reach House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, were not successful before publication.
Under the Constitution, the Legislature’s regular session can last for up to 30 days of a 105-day calendar period.
“We want to make sure that we do it correctly the first time, instead of being in such a rush that we were trying to go through the 30 days,” Gudger said.


Lawmakers have their own individuals concerns and priorities, above all passing local bills for their particular districts. Sen. Tim Melson, R-Florence, the chair of the Senate Health Committee, wants to see some local economic development bills pass.
Melson also said that he wants the Legislature to focus on “tackling tough issues,” not high school sports, referencing ongoing litigation between the Legislature and the Alabama High School Athletic Association due to eligibility issues caused by the CHOOSE Act.
“There’s a lot of things that we need to get done and get out,” he said. “I know that the high school athletic association’s made a lot of news right now, and we’re getting down to where we legislate high school sports. We’re looking for something to attack. We need to go ahead and attack rural health care and things like that.”
Gudger also said he wanted to get local bills passed, especially those that did not pass in 2025 due to miscommunication between the chambers.
“Any local bills and any bills that affect campaigns coming up that affect their own district, we want to make sure we prioritize those this year, to make sure that we get those guys the help that they need back home,” Gudger said.
House Minority Leader Anthony Daniels, D-Huntsville, said in a recent interview that affordable healthcare is at the top of his list.
“In light of a lot of the conversations at the federal level, affordability will be among the top priorities as a result of the cuts that we’ve experienced at the federal level,” he said.
But few people are expecting large issues to dominate. Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, the chair of the House Ways and Means Education Committee, believes this year’s session will move quickly so legislators can begin campaigning.
“A lot of these legislators certainly want to be out in their districts. Of the ones who are running for re-election will be out in their districts. And so there’ll be an effort to be as efficient as possible,” he said.
Education

Donnie Chesteen, R-Geneva, the chair of the Senate Education Policy Committee, in the Alabama Senate on May 7, 2025 at the Alabama Statehouse in Montgomery, Alabama. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)
Several education issues will be waiting for lawmakers.
Pay raises: Teacher pay raises have been a topic of discussion for members of the Ways and Means Education Committee. Education employees did not get pay raises last year. The Legislature instead opted to increase funding for health insurance to prevent increased costs for those working in public education.
“I think that there is a possibility that we’ll have a teacher pay raise. I think I’ve been hearing about that from some of the budget chairman and so that’s encouraging,” said Rep. Terri Collins, R-Decatur, the chair of the House Education Policy Committee.
CHOOSE Act: The CHOOSE Act will be a point of discussion, and not just over funding.  The athletic eligibility of CHOOSE Act recipients, the focal point of the lawsuit brought by Gov. Kay Ivey and House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, against the AHSAA, could also emerge.
Albritton said legislators have discussed expanding funding for the program.
“We have discussed that, because it seems to be very popular, but the conditions come in: what can we afford, and what benefit does it do, and what harm does it do? We don’t know those yet,” Albritton said in a recent interview.
But other legislators have concerns with expanding CHOOSE Act funding. The program currently caps eligibility for the program at 300% of the federal poverty level, but those limits will come off on Jan. 1, 2027, potentially leading to a massive increase in the cost of the program.
“My concern is the thought of, after two years, being a universal school choice, I think we have to keep a cap on it, because you look at other states that don’t have a cap, and some of the situations they find themselves in right now where they can’t afford to fund it. So I just think that we need to be very careful going forward,” said Sen. Donnie Chesteen, R-Geneva, the chair of the Senate Education Policy Committee.
Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, the chair of the Senate Finance and Taxation Education Committee, said CHOOSE Act funds should be reserved for families whose household income is 300% below the federal poverty level before eligibility is expanded regardless of income.
“The primary commitment is to focus on those at that household income level, to make sure that we’re able to fulfill the demand that might be coming from that group of people. And then, of course, we had special ed, military carve out,” Orr said. “Then the people that are prioritized after that, we just have to see.”
AHSAA: Last year, Ivey and Ledbetter sued the AHSAA over treating CHOOSE Act recipients as transfers who had to sit one year out. A judge presiding over the case has ordered mediations for the parties in November.
Chesteen, a former high school football coach, suggested splitting the two schooling types into two different leagues for sports as well.
“I think that that would help in what a lot of public school coaches feel is the competitive imbalance right now between the private schools and public schools. And I think that if you look at the championships, especially your lower classification, that would validate that point,” Chesteen said.
According to the Montgomery Advertiser, the AHSAA is considering a postseason change like Chesteen’s proposal.
Law enforcement scholarships: One bill that Collins wants to see pass this year is HB 98 sponsored by Rep. Allen Treadaway, R-Morris. The bill would allow the spouse or child of a law enforcement officer who is killed or left disabled while on duty to receive financial assistance to pay for college tuition. Money for the bill would be budgeted through the Education Trust Fund.
The bill unanimously passed in the House during the 2025 session and got approval from the Senate Judiciary Committee, but failed to get a full vote from the Senate.
Rep. Rex Reynolds, R-Huntsville, said in a recent interview he also wants to see the bill pass.
“It just didn’t come on the calendar in the Senate, and I think that that’s an important bill for retention of our police officers in Alabama,” he said.

Other: Rep. Terri Collins, R-Decatur, the chair of the House Education Policy Committee also wants to change the school grading system this year.
“I’m looking at modifying that so it’s a better means of accountability, and it actually incentivizes us to improve even greater than we have been,”
This year, Daniels said he wants to focus on increasing science scores for fourth grade students.
“Where I live, we’re focused on science,” Daniels said. “I think that we must not take our eyes off of the K through career, and not excluding, but including higher education, so that we’re preparing a pipeline for high paying jobs in other fields. But science is an incredible part of that infrastructure,” he said.
Orr’s top priority after the budgets is passing an outcomes-based funding model for higher education, similar to the RAISE Act for K-12 schools.
“Junior colleges are already doing this, but this will be a slight tweak to what they’re doing, but with our 14 institutions plus Tuskegee to work with them to improve our outputs,” Orr said.

Health care

Lawmakers will have few decisions to make on health care policy, but lots on health care coverage. Recent federal policy changes have added pressure to the state’s budgets. Both state health insurance plans, the Public Educator Employee’s Health Insurance Plan (PEEHIP) and the State Employee Insurance Board (SEIB), plan to request more money from the state to alleviate rising health costs. 
PEEHIP’s request will impact the ETF, while SEIB’s request will impact the General Fund budget. PEEHIP plans to request a $380 million increase for fiscal year 2027. Orr said in an interview Wednesday that he hopes the PEEHIP board will meet the Legislature halfway to meet the funding need.
“That’s going to be a challenge. Now if the PEEHIP board will meet us halfway on that increase, and they take half of the $380 (million) and we take half, I think we can have a decent budget year,” Orr said.
Garrett, chair of the House Ways and Means Education Committee, said in an interview that the PEEHIP request “is pretty large.”
“We’re going to be having to consider that,” he said. “So we’re eager to see what the governor puts in her budget,” Garrett said.
Reynolds said one of his priorities this year is to ensure a “conservative general fund budget” that includes funding for what he calls “critical” services in the state such as mental health, the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency and the Bureau of Pardons and Paroles.
He also wants to add an Opioid Supplemental Appropriation into the general fund budget.
“I’m working with the commission and the off time to come up with the recommended appropriation and we do that with the opioid settlement dollars that continue to come into Alabama,” he said.
Hospitals and rural health: Although some federal policy changes have created some tension for the state’s budgets, one program could help the state’s rural hospitals. Alabama was awarded $203.4 million by the Centers of Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) through the Rural Health Transformation Program, part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) passed in July.
The five-year $50 billion grant program aims to soften the impacts of upcoming Medicaid budget cuts if used strategically, but could partially offset just over a third (37%) of the estimated federal Medicaid spending cuts in rural areas, which are projected to be $137 billion over ten years. The program is administered by the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs (ADECA).

Reynolds, chair of the House General Fund Way and Means Committee, said he is focused on the outcomes of the program. He is also on the state’s advisory board for the program.
“We will appropriate the money, the first $100 million, to ADECA once that application process is approved, and then the second 100 million per year has some strings tied to it, and we’ll work through those to see what percentage of that money will also be available for Alabama,” Reynolds said in an interview before Alabama was awarded $203.4 million.
According to the University of North Carolina’s Sheps Center, nine rural hospitals have closed in Alabama since 2009. Only 30% of the state’s rural hospitals have labor and delivery units, leaving many expectant parents to drive long distances for care.

Many of Alabama’s existing hospitals are struggling. The state’s hospitals have long pushed for Medicaid expansion, saying it would provide needed funding to keep doors open.
While Alabama Republican House leaders have signaled openness to a public-private hybrid approach to expansion, the Senate has been hostile, and removed a provision from a 2024 gambling bill that could have provided money for the program.
House and Senate Republicans said in interviews that Medicaid expansion is off the table for 2026.
“I think expansion is kind of off the table completely. We’re just trying to make ends meet,” Allbritton said.
Daniels said although he believes there are Republican legislators who support Medicaid expansion, he doesn’t think it will happen this year.
“Do I feel that there are a lot of folks that are in support of expansion on the other side? I do, but I don’t think that they would see that as an issue that they were willing to down the sword for in this election,” Daniels said.
Criminal justice
The state has its share of criminal justice issues. Alabama’s prison crisis continues to rage. And while most cities in the state saw declines in homicides last year, Alabama continues to have some of the highest rates of death from firearms in the nation.
Some lawmakers interviewed said they were waiting to gauge the impact of federal legislation, such as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBA), which allocated about $170 billion for the decade for immigration and border enforcement. The legislation also provides grants to state and local law enforcement.
But others, as they have for years, said they will wait to see how the $1.3 billion Gov. Kay Ivey Correctional Complex, a 4,000-bed men’s prison in Elmore County expected to open later this year, will affect the prisons. Lawmakers may also move to start work on a second men’s prison in Escambia County.
The Legislature in 2021 approved a $1.3 billion package intended to cover the cost of both facilities, but the price tag on the Elmore facility soared and took up most of the funding.
Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, walks across the floor of the Alabama Senate on April 10, 2025 at the Alabama Statehouse in Montgomery, Alabama. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)
“The state has issued a request for qualification for the general manager who will have oversight,” Albritton said regarding the construction project for the Escambia facility. “That is going to change from the one from Elmore, we are going to get a new one for Escambia.”
Albritton said that request was issued in November and the contract is set to be awarded soon. The appointment of the manager then sets the stage for the requests for proposals for other parts of the construction project, which Albritton expects to break ground in the spring.
In February, the Legislature approved a bill that allows the state to borrow an additional $500 million for the site in Escambia. In an interview that same month, Albritton told members of the media that about 60% of the cost of building the Escambia facility has been secured.
Albritton does not expect any additional legislation that deals with prison construction, as most of the policies and financing were finalized with legislation that was approved in prior years.
“Other than that, we are in pretty good shape,” Albritton said on Tuesday. “We had excess funds that had not been earlier appropriated through the years that we have taken and pushed into that fund. It is taking other available monies.”
Despite the prison crisis, lawmakers have also prefiled bills that would impose stiffer penalties or expand the use of the death penalty. HB 41, sponsored by Rep. Matt Simpson, R-Daphne, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, would extend capital punishment to those convicted of sexually assaulting children. The U.S. Supreme Court declared a similar Louisiana law unconstitutional in 2008, citing in part the trauma that prosecuting death penalty cases can impose on children.
Simpson filed a similar bill during the 2025 session, saying that people who commit such crimes are “the worst of the worst.”

Simpson has filed another bill, HB 20,  to allow prosecutors to pursue the death penalty for endangering the public while someone is committing murder.
HB 11, sponsored by Rep. Phillip Pettus, R-Killeen, would lower the maximum age for youthful offender status for those charged with murder or capital murder from 19 to 16. He filed nearly identical legislation in 2025 but failed to get the measure approved before the session ended.
Another bill, SB 31, sponsored by Sen. Matt Woods, R-Jasper, increases the penalty for making a terrorist threat in the first degree from a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $6,000 fine, to a Class B felony, punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a $30,000 fine.
HB 7 also enhances the penalty for making a terrorist threat in the second degree, going from a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail and a $6,000 fine, to a Class D felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine of $7,500.
Another group of lawmakers introduced bills to implement reforms to the criminal legal system.
Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, has filed legislation to try and limit capital punishment. HB 76 attempts to amend the constitution to prohibit the death penalty entirely, while HB 70 expands the prohibition for judicial overrides for the death penalty by making it retroactive from 2017 when the Legislature banned the practice.
England said he believed there would be discussion about oversight over the Alabama Department of Corrections, citing ‘The Alabama Solution,’ an HBO documentary that used video taken by inmates to show violence and decrepit conditions in the state’s correctional facilities. “I think there will be some discussion about increasing transparency and accountability within the Alabama Department of Corrections,” England said in an interview on Monday.

England also filed HB 71, which would prohibit medical examiners from harvesting the organs of the deceased without  permission from family members. He filed a similar bill during the 2025 session but failed to get it enacted by the Legislature.
Lawsuits are currently working their way through the state court system pertaining to that issue.
England has also introduced a bill, HB 86, that would require the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles to consider rehabilitation efforts made by parole applicants when considering parole.  Another bill, HB 54, sponsored by Rep. Rolanda Hollis, D-Birmingham, would allow pregnant people who have been sentenced to prison to be on probation for several weeks after giving birth before returning to prison.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AL_House_106-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-12 08:12:08.857031

ATTOM, a real estate data analyst, found the median price of single-family homes and condos was less affordable in 586 of 594 counties with enough data to be included in the analysis. 
In Clark County, where the annual typical wage was $66,105, a buyer in the last quarter of 2025 would have had to spend 42% of their pay on home expenses, compared with a historical average of 31.7%. 
Clark County was the 223rd most affordable county of the 594 analyzed in the report, while Washoe County was 220th. 
A homebuyer in Washoe County, which had an annual average wage of $70,954, would have had to spend 48.4% of that on home expenses in the last quarter, compared with a historical average of 38.9%. 
ATTOM determined affordability by measuring annualized weekly wage data against the income needed to pay expenses for a median-priced home, (including mortgage, taxes, insurance, and association dues) assuming a 20% down payment and 28% debt-to-income ratio. 
 
﻿
 
In 43% of the counties analyzed in the report, median home prices grew at a greater rate than wages. In Nevada, however, wages grew faster than home prices. In the last quarter of the year annualized wages grew by 4.4%, while home prices increased by .7%. 
Purchasing a home last year was least affordable in Kings County, NY, where a buyer would have to spend 103.1% of wages on housing expenses, followed by Marin County, CA (97.3%); Santa Cruz County, CA (94.4%); Orange County, CA (90.3%); and Monterey County, CA (90.3%).
The national median price of a home in the second and third quarter was a record high $365,000. A buyer would have had to earn $86,374 to purchase a median-priced home and keep expenses below the standard recommended threshold of 28% of annual income, the report says. 
“Over the past five years, home price growth has nearly doubled wage growth, meaning home buying power in 2026 will depend not only on whether prices level off or decline, but also on mortgage rates and broader economic conditions,” Rob Barber, CEO of ATTOM, said in a news release. 
In the last five years, the median sales price of a home has increased by 54%, while wages are up 29%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, through the second quarter of last year. 
In 74% of the counties analyzed, home expenses exceeded the standard threshold of no more than 28% of the average resident’s pay, making homeownership unaffordable. Those counties include large metropolitan areas such as Los Angeles, where home ownership eats up 67.5% of typical wages; Maricopa County, AZ (38.1%); San Diego (67.4%); Orange County (90.3%); and Miami-Dade County, FL (43.6% of wages).
In about 30% of the 594 counties analyzed, home purchase expenses in the fourth quarter exceeded 43% of the typical resident’s wages, which is considered seriously unaffordable.
The report assigns an affordability scale to each county. Those with scores under 100 are less affordable than historic averages. 
That landed Clark County a 75 on the affordability scale for the quarter and an even more unaffordable 60 for the entire year. 
Last year, the median price of homes in Clark County, according to the report, was $437,500 in the first quarter, topped out at $449,900 in the second quarter of 2025, and fell to $443,500 in the fourth quarter, ending the year up 1% from the last.  
Washoe scored 80 on the affordability scale for the last quarter and 63 for the year.  
In Washoe County, the median price was $539,000 in the first quarter, jumped to $555,000 in the second quarter, and ended the year at $553,209 – down 2% from 2024.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/housing-vista-ronda-aerial-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-12 08:12:08.857031

Both have set records in their pursuit of public financing under the revised Citizens’ Election Program, which will provide qualifying major party candidates about $3.2 million for a primary and $15.4 million to the eventual nominee.
Stewart, whose application was approved last week after about 11 months of fundraising, qualified earlier than other participants in the history of the voluntary program; Fazio was the quickest to reach the threshold, raising $272,069 in less than five months.
“The continued record-breaking momentum behind our campaign is deeply gratifying and energizing,” Fazio said in a statement.
Stewart, 38, the former mayor of New Britain, and Fazio, 35, a state senator from Greenwich, are vying to become the youngest nominee for governor since John G. Rowland won the GOP nomination at age 33 in 1990.
Gov. Ned Lamont, 71, a Democrat seeking a third term, is self-funding his campaign, as he did in 2018 and 2022. Each time, his Republican opponent was Bob Stefanowski, also a self-funder.
Lamont spent $25.7 million on the 2022 race; Stefanowski spent $14.5 million. The public financing grants that year were $1.6 million for a primary and $7.7 million for the general election.
Revisions made after the 2022 election gave Stewart and Fazio a strong incentive to qualify in the first month of the election year: For the first time, a qualifying major-party candidate can get an early convention grant, essentially a partial advance from the $3.2 million primary award.
After a review of Stewart’s qualifying contributions, the State Elections Enforcement Commission voted unanimously last week to award her an $806,875 convention grant.
In previous cycles, no grant was available until a candidate had qualified for a primary, which cannot occur prior to the parties’ nominating conventions in May.
Reaching the $250,000 threshold will not result in Fazio immediately getting his convention grant. His finances will be reviewed for compliance with the rules.
Each qualifying contribution for a gubernatorial campaign must be at least $5 and no more than $250. Ninety percent of the contributions must come from in-state donors, and none can come from state contractors. The commission checks to ensure there is an individual donor for each contribution.
Campaign finance reports for the quarter ending Dec. 31 are due Monday. State Rep. Josh Elliott, D-Hamden, who is making a long-shot run opposing Lamont for the nomination, has struggled in his fundraising.
Betsy McCaughey, a Newsmax host and former lieutenant governor of New York, has told Republicans she is likely to run for the GOP nomination.
Entering the race with 49 days left in the previous quarter, Fazio raised $157,233 by Sept. 30. He reported raising another $114,300 in the final reporting period of the year.
Fazio said the fast fundraising was a measure of support.
“Connecticut voters are ready for positive change,” he said. “They are ready for leadership that will finally cut our sky-high electric rates and taxes, support our law enforcement, defend local control, and create opportunity for every family. Our campaign is based on that substantive change, and that’s exactly the reason for our momentum.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ryan-Fazio-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-12 08:12:08.857031

How do we get lawmakers who don’t harm us?
Look at what this Legislature has done since the 2022 elections.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
It approved a law criminalizing some forms of ballot assistance. The justifications were the same debunked nonsense about election security and fraud spewing all over the country. (Don’t even ask about the fate of bills to make voting easier.)
Lawmakers told Black Alabamians that their long history — full of struggle, pain and accomplishment — was a “divisive concept.” They didn’t say that outright, of course. They just passed a vaguely worded law warning teachers not to “compel” students to “adhere” to a concept that might lead them to accept guilt for something their ancestors had done.
Thus allowing the most brittle white Alabamians to put educators’ jobs in jeopardy. For the high crime of teaching accurate history.
Another effect of that law: Our major universities now silence the voices of nonwhite, nonheterosexual people and try to push them out of public life. Because the Legislature has made it clear that the rights of free speech and assembly only apply to whites, and only conditionally to white women.
Lawmakers steered $180 million of our taxes to the poor suffering families with children enrolled expensive private academies. Alabama public schools, already starved for revenue, can’t afford to lose that. None of us can afford what could be a budget-busting program in the coming years, if lawmakers allow it to run without income restraints.
And there’s everything legislators haven’t done.
The closest lawmakers came to addressing our ongoing rural health crisis was vague Medicaid expansion language in a 2024 House gambling bill. That got erased by the Senate before the whole package collapsed. Now they’re trying voluntary donations to rural hospitals, a policy that is not serious and will not be effective.
We have so many firearm deaths that we exceed New York State, a place with four times our population. Legislators did pass a state ban on Glock switches last year, but as long as they keep treating deadly weapons as sacred objects, all of us will remain in peril.
Republican lawmakers shrugged at the soaring costs of a $1 billion+ correctional facility in Elmore County. Their indifference extends to the prospect of borrowing hundreds of millions of dollars more for a facility in Escambia.
Don’t expect the arc of the Legislature to bend in 2026. As is usually the case in an election year, lawmakers want to finish as quickly as possible and get on with campaigning and fundraising.
And yet over the last four years, we got glimpses of a different Legislature.
The Education Trust Fund budget, about $8.2 billion in fiscal year 2023, is $9.9 billion today. The General Fund, which pays for most non-education programs in the state, grew from $2.7 billion three years ago to $3.7 billion today.
Caveats apply, particularly for the General Fund, where most of that increase reflects rising costs in Medicaid and Corrections. But bold as it seems, I’m going to say paying for public services is a good thing.
Legislators also ameliorated some parts of Alabama’s egregiously unfair, won’t-someone-spare-the-wealthy tax system. They cut the onerous state grocery levy from 4% to 2%. Local grocery taxes remain. So does the pathetic fact that the state taxes food while letting timber barons pay pittances in property tax. But reducing the burden is better than nothing.
The Legislature also took some tentative moves to address the fruits of that unfair tax system by allocating some public school money based on need, a necessary help for poor and rural students, among others.
Positive steps.
But we don’t elect positive people to the Legislature. We elect men and women who project anger and promise revenge on some group that never wronged us in the first place.
There is no idealism in Alabama politics. State politicians care about power and holding it. They keep lashing out at minorities and spending taxpayer dollars on wealthy children. And voters, to this point, have not punished them for it.
So Alabama lawmakers prioritize cruelty, division and running a government that works against most people who live here.
Is there any hope for change? Maybe if voters have more choices in November. We’ll know exactly how many in a few weeks, when candidate qualifying ends in the 140 legislative races on the ballot this year.
2026 could just end up as another leg of the endless race for the angriest member of the Republican base. But if we get options, voters should ask two questions about their candidates.
Are they running to solve problems? Or to give us targets?
More simply: Do they want to do something for us? Or to us?
If the latter, we’ll get another four years of Montgomery treating us like children. As helpless beings who need to be disciplined, punished and excluded from their own governance.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-12 12:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Metro-North ticket changes: What CT residents should know,Gabby DeBenedictis,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/12/ct-metro-north-january-ticket-changes/,Travelers on Metro-North's New Haven Line are adjusting to changes in buying and using train tickets. Here's what to know.,"Connecticut commuters and visitors to New York City on Metro-North’s New Haven Line are getting accustomed to changes in buying and using train tickets.
The changes, which were implemented during the first week of the year, affect both travel to Grand Central Terminal on Metro-North and travel within the city on the subway.
Here’s a look at what’s been changed.
One-way ticket expiration
One-way tickets, which could previously be activated and used for weeks after their purchase, will now expire at 4 a.m. the day after they were bought. For example, a rider who bought a one-way ticket on Sunday could use it until 4 a.m. Monday.
Day Pass
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is getting rid of round-trip tickets for Metro-North rides. Day-trippers into the city will instead buy a day pass, which will be valid for unlimited rides until 4 a.m. the next morning. For example, if a rider bought a day pass on Saturday, they can use it to travel anytime before 4 a.m. Sunday.
On weekdays, day passes cost 10% less than two one-way peak tickets. A weekday day pass to Grand Central would cost $46.75 from New Haven and $30.50 from Stamford, for example.
During weekends, day passes cost the same as two one-way off-peak tickets, which is $38.50 from New Haven to Grand Central and $25 from Stamford to Grand Central.
Metro-North ticket costs vary based on the date and time of a trip and its start and end locations, which are grouped into travel zones.
Pre-boarding ticket purchase and activation
Historically, passengers who bought a ticket while riding a Metro-North train rather than in advance have had to pay a $6 surcharge. But among the new ticket policies is a $2 increase to that surcharge, meaning it will now be $8.
Additionally, passengers who do not activate a ticket purchased in the TrainTime app before boarding their train will also be subject to an $8 charge. 
Mobile ticketing technology can tell conductors when a passenger’s ticket was activated. And if they’re subject to the surcharge, they can choose whether to pay it in the moment or defer it to their next purchase, said Michael Cortez, a spokesperson with the MTA.
“Pay-as-you-go”
Metro-North discontinued its 10-trip ticket option, and its replacement is a “pay-as-you-go” system.
After taking 10 peak or off-peak rides in a 14-day period, mobile app customers would get a free 11th one-way trip during those same 14 days. 
Riders who have earned a free ticket can use it for either a peak or off-peak trip, regardless of which ticket type(s) they purchased for their 10 trips, Cortez said — but the ticket has to be used within the same travel zones where it was earned.
Subway changes
The price of a ride on the New York City subway has risen from $2.90 to $3. 
Additionally, as of Jan. 1 riders can no longer buy a MetroCard. The city is migrating to OMNY, a tap-and-go payment system at the turnstiles, for subway payments. 
Riders can pay with a credit/debit card, their phone, or via a reloadable OMNY card, which can be purchased at subway stations. Existing MetroCards can still be used — the MTA will announce a cutoff date for accepting MetroCards later this year — but they can no longer be reloaded with funds.
MetroCard holders can transfer their card’s value to an OMNY card at a Customer Service Center.
Family trips
Metro-North has expanded eligibility for its Family Fare, which allows up to four children to ride for $1 when accompanied by a fare-paying adult.
Previously, the family fare applied to children ages 5-11 and excluded travel on trains that arrived in New York City from 6-10 a.m. on weekdays (the morning peak hours).
But as of this month, the MTR increased the eligible child age to 17 and expanded it to apply at all times of day and on all trains.
Fare increase?
There was no Metro-North fare increase in Connecticut that took effect at the beginning of this year.
However, on July 1, Metro-North prices will rise by 5%, along with prices on the CTrail Hartford Line and Shore Line East trains.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Metro-North-new-tix-machine-1024x805.jpg,,,2026-01-12 07:58:11.721940

Bonamo,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2026/01/12/governor-order-juries-criminal-convictions/,New Jersey bars people with criminal convictions from serving on juries. Gov. Phil Murphy says that is unjust.,"Gov. Phil Murphy issuing an executive order at New Hope Baptist Church in East Orange on Jan. 11, 2025, that allows people with criminal convictions to serve on juries. (Photo courtesy of the New Jersey Governor’s Office)EAST ORANGE — Gov. Phil Murphy signed an executive order Sunday that restores jury service rights to New Jerseyans with felony convictions, using his clemency powers just days before he leaves office to advance a policy initiative he said will allow juries to be “more representative of the communities they serve.”
“About 350,000 New Jerseyans, which is about 4% of our state’s population, have been denied the opportunity to perform one of the most fundamental civic duties,” Murphy said at New Hope Baptist Church in East Orange. “Today, we widen the circle of justice and acknowledge that a system cannot call itself fair if it excludes the people who have taken responsibility for their actions, rebuilt their lives, and earned their freedom.”
Moments after he signed the order, Murphy handed the pen he used to Dameon Stackhouse, who spent more than a decade in prison for robbery and is now a fellow at the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice in Newark.
“This is a pivotal moment for all of us who have faced the stigma of conviction, affirming that our contributions matter and that we are an integral part of the democratic process,” Stackhouse said. “Serving on a jury is not only a responsibility; it is a chance to participate actively in shaping the future.”

State law bars people with criminal convictions from serving on juries. The Legislature has considered legislation that would have eased the ban, but the bill never advanced in this session. It passed the Assembly in January 2024 but did not move in the Senate.
Murphy, a Democrat, has been on something of a clemency spree in his final days in office, after spending most of his two terms as governor issuing no pardons. Since December 2024, he has pardoned or commuted sentences for more than 300 people. Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D) becomes the new governor on Jan. 20.

Amol Sinha, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, applauded the move.
“People with criminal convictions who have served their sentences are as capable of serving as jurors as anyone else,” said Sinha, whose organization launched an initiative in 2024 to push for a more expansive use of the governor’s clemency powers. “Today’s executive order will help repair some of the harms caused by excluding returning citizens from this vital civic duty.”
The order allows people with convictions to serve on juries after they have completed their entire sentence, including probation and parole, if their conviction came before Jan. 10, 2026.
Sen. Michael Testa (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)
Critics of Murphy’s order believe he went beyond the reasonable bounds of his clemency powers. State Sen. Michael Testa (R-Cumberland) said Murphy with this order used those powers to bypass the Legislature, and has no legal authority to rewrite jury eligibility standards.
“Clemency exists to lessen punishment imposed on an individual. The exclusion of convicted criminals from jury service is not a punishment at all – it is a policy judgment designed to protect the integrity, impartiality, and public credibility of the judicial system,” Testa said. “Any impact on offenders is incidental to that goal, not punitive in nature, and therefore well outside the constitutional scope of the Governor’s clemency power.”
Murphy’s order notes that the governor has the power to issue a partial pardon or to restore one or more specific rights, such as the right to serve on a jury, for people who have been convicted of crimes. The order says it “shall not be considered a full pardon or remission of guilt.”
In an interview after he signed the executive order, Murphy said his clemency initiatives are “not only well within the law, but the right thing to do.”
“We have a society where if you commit a crime, you accept responsibility, you serve your time, you have every right to serve on a jury,” Murphy said. “It’s not a life sentence. It’s just not.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-12 12:15:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Here’s what’s really happening with child care fraud in MN,Chabeli Carrazana | The 19th,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/12/heres-whats-really-happening-with-child-care-fraud-in-mn/,Evidence is nowhere near the epidemic levels a viral YouTube video would suggest — but it hasn’t stopped a crackdown on child care funding.,"This story was originally reported by Chabeli Carrazana of The 19th.  Meet Chabeli and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
A viral video posted just after Christmas spurred an avalanche of news coverage, changes from the Trump administration, and congressional hearings that appeared to indicate that a massive trove of child care fraud was just uncovered in Minnesota. 
Much of it has been misleading. 
The video by right-wing YouTuber Nick Shirley posted on December 26 purports to show that various Minneapolis day cares run by Somali Americans are not providing services to children despite receiving public funding. Although the video has already been debunked by investigators, the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have seized on it. Vice President JD Vance said Shirley “has done far more useful journalism than any of the winners of the 2024 [Pulitzer Prizes].”
The fallout has been massive. In the past week, the Trump administration has frozen child care payments to five Democratic-run states and ramped up reporting requirements for all states receiving child care funds to cover services for the lowest-income kids. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, has suspended his reelection campaign over it. 
But the real story behind child care fraud in Minnesota is far less nefarious. 
Here’s what we actually know about child care fraud in Minnesota and elsewhere, and how day cares and families may be impacted by the new changes.
What does Nick Shirley uncover in his video? 
Nothing conclusive. The video shows Shirley visiting day cares run by Somali Americans, sometimes under the false pretense of trying to enroll a child. In a couple of instances, workers do open the door but seem immediately suspicious when it’s clear Shirley is recording them and refuse to let him in or give him more information. 
Because some of the sites appear closed and Shirley doesn’t see any children, he declares this as proof of fraud at these facilities. 
Most child care centers are locked and have obscured doors or windows for children’s safety. Children are also kept in classrooms and would not likely be visible from a reception area. One of the day cares in the video told several news outlets that it did not grant Shirley entrance because he showed up with a handful of masked men, which raised suspicions that the men were agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. At least one of the centers was closed at the time Shirley arrived because it opens later in the day to serve the children of second-shift workers.
Is there a history of child care fraud in the state? 
Yes, but it’s not as widespread as Shirley claims.
The federal government sends money to states to subsidize the cost of care for very low-income children, and some states put additional funds into that system. In Minnesota, it’s known as the Child Care Assistance Program, or CCAP. Centers that accept children on subsidies will bill the state for the cost of caring for those kids. 
In 2019, a state investigation found that there was probably several million dollars in child care fraud taking place within that system, where centers were billing for children they were not providing services for. Investigators believed the level of child care fraud in the state was more than the $5 million to $6 million prosecutors had been able to prove until that point.
By 2019, state prosecutors had charged at least a dozen Minnesotans and centers with defrauding the state’s child care program in the prior five years. 
After the 2019 report was issued, the state tightened oversight, including creating the Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) to take over child care licensing, oversight and auditing. Last year, Minnesota passed a law to criminalize kickbacks for child care program enrollment referrals. 
A 2025 report by the federal Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General found that issues with overpayments continue in the state. The OIG sampled 1,155 child care centers and found that 11 percent of the payments made to those centers in 2023 had errors. 
But that doesn’t necessarily mean there was fraud. Improper payments is an umbrella term that could include fraud. 
For example, “an improper payment is a child was present for 40 hours and somehow the state paid only for 30 hours. Fraud is when you’re charging for kids that were never enrolled,” explained Danielle Ewen, a national child care expert.
An 11 percent rate puts Minnesota above the permissible 10 percent threshold established by the federal government, Ewen said. On average nationwide, the rate is 4 percent.
So while child care fraud is something Minnesota has been working to reduce in recent years, “these are not new issues, but they are being repackaged and they are being promoted in ways to make it seem like there is an epidemic,” said Elliot Haspel, a national child care expert, on a call with reporters this week.
According to a 2020 report by the United States Government Accountability Office, only seven states since 2013 have had errors in more than 10 percent of their child care fund payments. That also does not mean there is necessarily fraud, but rather errors in overbilling.
The federal Office of Child Care did not respond to questions about The 19th about which states are above the threshold. 
What did state investigators find when they investigated the day cares in the videos? 
State investigators conducted unannounced visits at the day cares in the viral video over the past six months as part of the typical licensing and auditing process, according to Tikki Brown, the commissioner of the Minnesota DCYF. An analysis of publicly available inspection records by The 19th found that most of the centers had unannounced inspections as recently as October, November or December. 
After the video was posted, investigators from the state Office of Inspector General conducted compliance visits to nine of the 10 centers in the video (one of the centers in the video has been closed for several years and has not received funds in that time). They found normal operations and children at all but one, which had not yet opened for the day. Further investigations are being conducted into four of the nine facilities, but the state has not said what exactly it’s investigating. 
Most of the centers in the video did have numerous state licensing violations against them regarding cleanliness, staff supervision and some recordkeeping around immunizations and allergies. But none of the violations against the centers were regarding fraud, according to state enforcement records.
Quality Learning Center, the center most prominently featured in the video because one of its signs misspelled learning, closed this week. Another center in the video, Mako Childcare Center, has been closed since 2022, Minnesota DCYF said.
There is evidence of one of the day cares in the video having a connection to prior fraud investigations. Fowsiya Hassan, the CEO of Minnesota Best Childcare Center, previously owned another day care called Sunshine Child Care Center that was raided in 2022 as part of an overbilling fraud investigation. No charges were brought.
Hassan sued the state last year over the raid, which led to the closure of Sunshine, claiming “licensing and fraud investigations in Minnesota have long been disproportionately targeted against Somalis.” 
How can I check if my child’s day care has been inspected and audited? 
Every state is federally mandated to publicly report the results of inspections at licensed child care centers (including the dates of the inspections), and day cares are required to undergo at least one unannounced inspection a year. In Minnesota, that information can be found at the state’s Licensing Information Lookup tool.

Why was the Somali community targeted? 
David Hoch, the lobbyist and former right-wing candidate for Minnesota attorney general who serves as the main source in Shirley’s video, received information on the centers from Republican staffers in Minnesota. 
Hoch has had a particular focus on the Somali community and fraud for some time. In a now-deleted Instagram account, Hoch posted almost exclusively about the Somali community, according to reporting in The Intercept.
“EVERY Somali in MN is engaged in fraud. ALL of them,” Hoch posted.  “Even the Blacks have had enough of the demon Muslims,” he said in November.
Over the years, whistleblowers alleged that the fraud money in Minnesota’s child care system was being used to fund the Somali terrorist organization al-Shabab. The 2019 Office of the Legislative Auditor investigation found those claims to be unsubstantiated. 
The Somali community has been a particular target of President Donald Trump, who has claimed that “much of the Minnesota Fraud, up to 90%, is caused by people that came into our Country, illegally, from Somalia.” 
The president last month called Somali immigrants “garbage” who he doesn’t want in the country.
Minnesota has the largest Somali population in the United States, and child care has historically been an industry that employs large numbers of immigrants. About 1 in 5 child care workers are immigrant women. 
Since Shirley’s video, there have been numerous reports of people harassing Somali-run day cares and businesses either through in-person visits demanding to see children, or through threatening phone calls. At least one center was broken into. 
Day cares in Minnesota have reported concerns for children and staff safety, particularly as ICE activity in the state has ramped up.
Dawn Uribe, the owner of four Spanish-immersion preschools in Minnesota, said she “really can’t overstate how afraid” her all-immigrant staff is since the video was posted even though all have work authorization and most are citizens or permanent residents. 
“We are really preparing for the next couple of weeks for people to be calling off [work] and not coming,” Uribe said. 
What is the child care funding freeze and who is impacted by it? 
After the video was released, the Trump administration announced a funding freeze to five Democratic-run states: Minnesota, California, Colorado, New York and Illinois. The freeze would stop federal child care funds from flowing to states to cover care for low-income children. It was also pausing $7.3 billion in funding for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which supports low-income families, in those five states. 
The five states impacted sued the administration over the freeze arguing that withholding the funds from low-income and vulnerable families would cause “immediate and devastating impacts.” On Friday, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to release the funds while the case is pending. 
Officials had previously said funds would be released “only when states prove they are being spent legitimately.” 
In Minnesota, state officials had until Friday to provide additional documentation, including Social Security numbers for all of the estimated 23,000 children who receive child care funds in the state, to the federal Department of Health and Human Services. 
The state has informed providers that it has “several months” of reserves to cover care for those children should federal funds be frozen, so child care centers and families have not been impacted directly. 
It’s unclear what evidence the Trump administration had to justify freezing funds to California, Colorado, New York and Illinois. In a letter to Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, Alex Adams, the assistant secretary for the Administration for Children and Families, said the Trump administration was “concerned by the potential for extensive and systemic fraud in Illinois” and added that it has reason to believe the state is “illicitly providing illegal aliens with CCDF benefits intended for American citizens and lawful permanent residents.”
Nationally, every state will also now have to submit additional documentation to access child care dollars, a process that could slow payments to centers and increase the risk of day cares cutting staff or limiting operations. 
Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, declined to comment on any of the questions from The 19th.
“For too long, Democrat-led states and Governors have been complicit in allowing massive amounts of fraud to occur under their watch,” he said in a statement. “Under the Trump Administration, we are ensuring that federal taxpayer dollars are being used for legitimate purposes.”
Are there other impacts from the freeze?
National child care experts said there is a lot of confusion around exactly what data the federal government is requiring states to submit, and whether it’s even data states have on hand to provide. 
For providers and families, there is a lot of uncertainty on what happens next and whether a freeze could still occur. 
Freezing child care funding can lead day cares to cut staff, close classrooms or close entirely because many don’t have reserves to continue operations. During the government shutdown at the end of 2025, for example, numerous Head Start child care programs that rely on federal funding closed in at least 13 states.
Kylie Cooper, a director of a child care center in the Twin Cities, said that the families who face the most uncertainty are those with the fewest resources if their child care options fall through. 
“These are the families who absolutely need [it],” she said. “They likely don’t have PTO or benefits in place with their employers if they have to take a day off work for child care. There’s not a support system.” 
About 95 percent of the families who receive assistance in her program are headed by single mothers. 
“If that freeze were to go into effect there are a whole lot of centers that run on a very thin margin and most of their kids are CCAP,” Cooper said. “They would last less than a month before they’re closing their doors.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25365739813169-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-12 11:58:46.140907

A bill set for final approval by the Legislature on Monday would bar social media companies from promoting certain content that could cause children to develop eating disorders, including diet product ads.
Bill sponsor Assemblywoman Andrea Katz (D-Burlington), a mom of three teenagers, said she has witnessed the impact social media has had on body-image issues.
“We have to have those safeguards in place, especially for our kids. Our social media companies make a whole lot of money off of all of our information, and so it seems to me the least they can do is protect our kids,” she said.

Social media companies that violate the bill would face penalties of up to $250,000 per violation. The bill would require companies to audit themselves regularly or hire third parties to review their algorithms, designs, and features to ensure none contribute to young users developing an eating disorder. Companies wouldn’t be held accountable for photos and content uploaded by users who aren’t paid or promoted by the platform.
Darian Eletto is the chief clinical officer of behavioral health at Bergen New Bridge Medical Center in Paramus. Eletto agreed that social media platforms need restrictions to avoid exploiting children and furthering disordered eating, negative body image, or unhealthy eating behaviors.
Young people don’t always know how to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy content online, Eletto said.
“We’re seeing that shift towards that thin, thin body image being very in vogue again, which is very harmful for many of our kids and our teenagers,” she said. “We see that teenagers and adolescents are learning about these behaviors online, and no one is really talking about, ‘Hey, this is not a healthy relationship with food. This is not realistic.’”
A study from the National Institute of Health found that the constant use of social media platforms can promote addictive behavior, including disordered eating patterns. Other research has found that social media users typically report a higher dissatisfaction with their appearance.
A Harvard study found that roughly 9% of New Jerseyans, or more than 784,000 people, will have an eating disorder in their lifetime, and found that women are twice as likely to struggle with an eating disorder.
The state Senate is scheduled to vote on the bill Monday. The legislation passed out of the Assembly in December 46-24, largely along party lines.
The Senate will also consider a measure that would require the state Department of Health to study disordered eating.
“Kids today are not just exposed to unhealthy and often unrealistic body standards, they’re immersed in them nearly every day,” said bill sponsor Sen. Kristin Corrado (R-Passaic). “As students form their sense of self, constant comparisons to unrealistic expectations quietly distort how many see their own bodies, laying the groundwork for unhealthy habits.”

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Washington state lawmakers begin a 60-day session today, in which a fiscal reckoning, flood recovery, and their own reelections loom large.
They departed Olympia last spring, fingers crossed that a colossus of budget problems had been defeated with a one-two punch of spending cuts and new taxes. It was not. 
Adding to the difficulties: massive changes foisted upon states in the federal law dubbed “beautiful” by its Republican sponsors and “ugly” by its Democrat detractors.
Then came the havoc of December’s heavy rains and flooding. The financial toll for residents and public infrastructure is still being tallied. But it won’t be cheap. And it’s not clear yet that the Trump administration will step in with federal aid.
Meanwhile, Gov. Bob Ferguson came out last month in full support of an income tax on individuals earning over $1 million a year, setting up a major debate on tax policy.
Two controversial citizen initiatives are pending, but are dead on arrival in the Legislature and will likely go to voters in the fall.
Plus, policy debates are percolating on topics ranging from pennies to policing to pensions.
And it’s an election year. All 98 House seats and roughly half of the 49 Senate seats will be on ballots. Those sitting in them now know their votes in the next two months could determine if they will be back in 2027.
Here are four questions for which we don’t know the answers, yet.
How will they balance the budget?
When Ferguson arrived in office a year ago, he pegged the multi-year shortfall in the state operating budget at $12 billion, a figure he later upped to $16 billion. The first-term Democratic governor and the Democratic-run Legislature responded with spending cuts throughout state government and imposing billions of dollars in new and higher business taxes.

A year later, Ferguson says the state is facing another gap, this one at least $2.3 billion, between what Washington expects to collect in tax receipts and the amount needed to cover the state’s expenses through mid-2027. That doesn’t include the tab for the December floods.
Crafting a solution will be a challenge. Cutting deeper could undermine public services. But Republicans and others say if Democrats keep piling on taxes, it could drive people out of business or out of the state. 
Ferguson has proposed very precise cuts as a fix this time around. 
He also wants to move large sums of cash out of accounts where it’s not needed immediately. This includes using $569 million of Climate Commitment Act revenue to cover the expense of the Working Families Tax Credit for low- and middle-income households, and a proposal to siphon $1 billion from the state’s rainy day reserve fund. 
Some Democrats are skeptical of using that much of the climate money on the tax credits, rather than spending it to reduce air pollution. Republicans balk at the rainy day fund drawdown.
Legislative budget writers will put out their blueprints in late February.
Will progressives get their income tax?
Ferguson delivered arguably the session’s biggest news before the opening day gavel.
It came last month with his call for taxing the income of those earning more than a million dollars a year. This is the same governor whose preaching of austerity at his inauguration 12 months ago drew glares from Democratic legislators.
Those turned to scowls when he publicly and privately rejected Democratic proposals for a so-called “wealth tax,” a statewide payroll tax on large employers and a higher cap on annual property tax collections by local governments.

With his embrace of an income tax, progressives’ frowns may be easing. But Ferguson attached strings to his support. That makes some of them wary of whether he’ll sign what is sent to him — presuming something is passed.
To survive, the tax will need to be designed to withstand an inevitable court challenge. Lawmakers are also looking at how to possibly funnel money from the tax to the Working Families Tax Credit or to underwrite various other forms of targeted tax relief. Deciding how to use the revenue could further complicate the debate. 
There are election-year realities, too. While the governor is not on the ballot this year, most of the Democrats who would need to vote for the tax will be.
Will Heywood’s initiatives factor in?
Let’s Go Washington, the political committee led by hedge fund manager Brian Heywood, has become a perennial thorn in the side of majority Democrats in Olympia. The group is back this year with a new set of initiatives.
One would roll back changes Democrats made last year to the group’s 2024 parental bill of rights initiative. The other would bar transgender athletes from competing in girls’ sports.

These are initiatives to the Legislature, meaning they go to lawmakers for consideration before possibly ending up on the ballot. Top Democrats made clear Friday that the initiatives will not get a hearing in the House or Senate this session, all but guaranteeing that they’ll go to voters to decide in November. 
While the initiatives may be blocked legislatively, they could still pop up in the form of protests at the Capitol, or with Republicans finding ways to hammer on the wedge, culture war issues involved with an eye toward Election Day.
How will Ferguson fare?
Ferguson got off to a rocky start during his first session as governor, with staff drama and many Democrats miffed as he made a show of reaching out to Republicans and as he reined in progressive tax proposals.
This session is a moment when Ferguson will either succeed or fail in showing he’s a force that can drive the conversation and the priorities in Olympia.

Backing the income tax on high earners should build some goodwill among members on his party’s left flank, but it’ll also put him front and center in a Republican narrative that Washington Democrats are out of control on spending and have an endless appetite for taxes.
During last year’s session, Ferguson could readily fall back on the assertion that he inherited a budget blueprint — and budget troubles — from his predecessor, Jay Inslee. That kind of deflection will become increasingly difficult moving forward, as what’s happening now is squarely on his watch.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1688-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-12 07:12:15.904943

Garlin Gilchrist, the state's first Black lieutenant governor, announced his campaign for governor on March 11, 2025. | Kyle DavidsonLt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist’s bid to replace Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has come to an end, but he’s setting his sights, instead, on becoming the Democratic Party’s nominee for secretary of state.
Gilchrist announced that he was bowing out of the gubernatorial hunt in a video released Monday morning, which also served as his launching pad to seek the office that oversees the state’s elections and some of its key administrative operations.
It was rumored for weeks that Gilchrist would end up dropping out of the gubernatorial race. He faced an uphill battle as the No. 2 name in that race, with Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson in pole position both in terms of Democratic enthusiasm and money raised.



Democratic sources told Michigan Advance last week that a change of pace was coming soon for Gilchrist. As those rumors swirled, Bridge Detroit reported on Sunday that Gilchrist was making calls to Democratic officials about his change of candidacy. 
On Monday morning, he made his intentions to seek the secretary of state position known. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“At heart, I’m a public servant, an entrepreneur, a dad, a husband, and an engineer who spent a lot of my life making government actually work for people,” Gilchrist said in a campaign video. “I’m not done with that, not by a long shot. You’ve told your stories about the high cost of everything and the threats to our democracy. You sounded the alarm about this president who acts like a king. And you know Michigan has been ground zero in the battle for free and fair elections before, and it will be again. This tangled web of corruption and control is meant to crush our power to participate. We have to fix this. If we don’t, we can’t fix anything else.”
Gilchrist said those issues compelled him to join the secretary of state race. He thanked those who supported him in his bid for governor, a race that has now become a two-person contest between Benson and Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson.
“The time for me to serve in that role may come, but now is not that time,” Gilchrist said of his gubernatorial race before turning to the secretary race. “As Secretary of State, I will shine a light on dark money and put the public first. I will modernize licensing and registration by providing smart, 21st-century service. I’ll protect your privacy and never allow your identity, voter registration information, or license plate data to be mined by big tech companies or surveilled by the Trump administration. And I will hold accountable companies that rip you off when you get your car fixed.”
Gilchrist went on to say that the problem with politics, as he sees it, is that “it’s rigged toward the people with the most wealth.”
“They want us to give up, and check out. But we won’t,” Gilchrist said. “Our right to vote gives each of us an equal voice in our future. We can’t let anyone take that right away.”
Repositioning to the secretary of state race has its pros and cons.
On one hand, Gilchrist won’t have to collect nominating petition signatures to appear on the ballot or go through the primary process to seek the Democratic Party nomination. Those candidates are, however, selected at the party’s convention following the August primary. That means a potentially easier path to the nomination, but only if Gilchrist is playing to win and has support from the state’s big-name unions, like United Auto Workers, which largely decide the Democratic nominations later in the summer.
Gilchrist’s campaign believes that it can galvanize that support.
But the race is already crowded and the lieutenant governor faces a deeper slate of competition than he did against Benson and Swanson. The party’s use of an earlier endorsement convention in the spring to rally support around the most likely candidate to win — based on enthusiasm but also organizing strength for general election fight — also means that Gilchrist has to get moving.
Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum, Deputy Secretary of State Aghogho Edevbie, former state Sen. Adam Hollier and former Michigan State Lottery Commissioner Suzanna Shkreli are also seeking the nomination. Hollier and Shkreli only recently entered the race, but Byrum and Edevbie have been in the hunt since mid-2025.
Shkreli started trying to stake out deeper ground in the race on Sunday by exoling how she’s gained momentum fast after being in the race only a month, and by also taking a jab at Gilchrist as he enters the fray.
“This office and protecting our vote is too important to be a consolation prize, and I am the best candidate to hold this seat come November,” Shkreli said in a statement. “With my experience as a prosecutor and in the Governor’s administration, I bring the grit and toughness to stand up to extremists and protect the votes and voices of Michiganders no matter what comes our way.”

(Photo by Monroe Bush for Indiana Capital Chronicle)A newly formed lobbying group backed by Indiana’s major business organizations is pressing lawmakers to pass a civil justice bill that would cap non-economic damages, restrict public nuisance lawsuits and shield businesses from certain liability claims.
Democrats have already criticized the bill as solving problems Indiana does not have while limiting the rights of injured Hoosiers.
The Indiana Alliance for Legal Reform, announced late last month, is endorsing House Bill 1417, filed last week by Rep. Matt Lehman, R-Berne.
Lehman said he authored the bill after identifying what he views as weaknesses in Indiana’s civil justice system that expose businesses and property owners to liability even when they’re not negligent.

“It’s just trying to find the areas of our judicial system that I think are in some cases being abused, and trying to put some parameters on,” Lehman told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “We don’t want to call into question the courts. At the same time, we’ve got to restrict some of the people that are getting dragged into the courts that have no negligence.”
The bill bundles several proposals aligned with the alliance’s goal of curbing what the group describes as frivolous lawsuits and excessive jury awards against Hoosier businesses.
The alliance counts the Indiana Chamber of Commerce, Indiana Manufacturers Association, National Federation of Independent Business, Indiana Motor Truck Association and Indiana Bankers Association among its supporters, said executive director Stephen Wolff. Former Senate President Pro Tem David Long has been retained to assist with government and media outreach.
Wolff said the group formed amid growing concern among business leaders about national litigation trends and a desire for what he has described as “common-sense reform” of Indiana’s civil code that would balance the system while preserving the state’s business climate.
“The Alliance’s goal is to ensure that Indiana has a legal environment that is fair to business and provides the predictability they need to invest in Indiana,” Wolff said. “The business associations and companies that comprise the Alliance recognize that the goal will be accomplished over multiple years and are committed to seeing it through. HB 1417 moves us one step closer to that goal.”
But Rep. Ed DeLaney, D-Indianapolis, a longtime attorney, said the proposal reflects a misunderstanding of Indiana’s legal system.
“I practiced in Indiana, where we have generally fairly cautious juries,” DeLaney said. “We have higher courts which would turn back any excessive awards. So, I don’t think we have the problem that other states may have.”
Limits on civil cases
House Bill 1417 was referred to the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday but has yet to get a hearing date.
The proposal would cap non-economic damages — such as pain and suffering — at $1 million in all civil cases. Judges and juries would still calculate non-economic damages without regard to the cap, but courts would be required to reduce awards exceeding $1 million and allocate the capped damages proportionally among defendants based on fault.
Current Indiana law does not impose a general cap on compensatory damages in civil cases against private businesses.
Limits do exist for punitive damages, however — capped at three times compensatory damages or $50,000, whichever is greater — as well as in medical malpractice cases and lawsuits against government entities.
The bill would also substantially narrow public nuisance claims. 
Language in the measure defines a public nuisance as an “ongoing and unlawful condition” that interferes with an “established public right” and is expressly prohibited by state or federal law. Activities permitted by law, ordinance or court order could not be considered public nuisances.










We don't want Indiana to become a magnet for litigation but rather want to provide Hoosier businesses and those looking to locate in Indiana with the kind of stable environment they need.


– Stephen Wolff, executive director of the Indiana Alliance for Legal Reform


Government entities would be limited to seeking court orders to stop or fix an unlawful condition and would be barred from recovering monetary damages or costs tied to potential future harm. Private individuals could still seek compensation, but only under more limited circumstances.
Another provision would prohibit lawsuits against property owners, business owners or third-party business operators for criminal acts committed by someone else on their property or premises. The bill would also bar claims brought by individuals who committed the criminal act themselves.
The bill would additionally prohibit transportation network company riders — such as users of ride-hailing services like Uber or Lyft — from bringing claims against the company, or TNC, for injuries caused by a driver or occurring during a ride.
A legislative fiscal analysis estimates the changes could reduce court caseloads and lower state and local expenditures tied to civil litigation, while also decreasing court fee revenue if fewer cases were filed.
Indiana has enacted several business-friendly tort reforms in recent years, including new transparency requirements for third-party litigation funding and limits on how lenders can interact with attorneys and medical providers. 
State lawmakers tightened the rules last year with House Bill 1160, also authored by Lehman, which bars lawsuit lenders from paying referral fees to lawyers or medical providers, forbids steering plaintiffs to specific providers and requires disclosure of third-party litigation financing, while also restricting some foreign investment in Indiana lawsuits.
Need ‘more to sue a business’
Wolff said the alliance is focused on limiting what it views as expansions of liability that go beyond illegal conduct and expose businesses to unpredictable and substantial legal risks.
“When we are talking about frivolous cases, we are talking about things like public nuisance actions, which are traditionally brought to resolve conditions that are illegal by ordinance, and adversely impact the public or create a condition that undermines public health and safety,” Wolff said. “Lately, these cases have been extended to legal activities.”
He cited lawsuits targeting manufacturers over products that criminals find easy to misuse.
Court actions against automakers such as Hyundai and Kia have become a frequent example cited by tort reform advocates.
Cities, including Indianapolis, joined a federal lawsuit alleging the companies should be held liable for vehicle thefts because certain models lacked industry-standard anti-theft technology, even though the vehicles complied with existing federal safety and manufacturing requirements at the time they were sold. The lawsuit was eventually settled last fall.
Story continues below.
HB1417.01.INTR
 
Other reforms lobbied for by the alliance are aimed at lawsuits involving criminal activity on private property.
“Other frivolous lawsuits involve cases brought by criminals injured during the conduct of illegal behavior that sue the owner of the premises where the criminal’s illegal activity took place,” Wolff said. “That’s untenable, and there needs to be language added requiring more to sue a business in such a situation.”
On damages, Wolff emphasized the alliance is not targeting compensation for medical bills or lost wages.
“We are not talking about set costs, such as medical bills or lost wages, which are compensatory,” he said. “We are talking about undefined damages.”
The alliance also says it wants to ensure Indiana does not become a haven for litigation. Wolff pointed to a high-profile “nuclear verdict” involving Indiana-based Wabash Trailer Manufacturing Co., though that case was decided by a Missouri jury.
“It shows what can happen with an imbalanced and unpredictable legal system,” Wolff said. “We don’t want Indiana to become a magnet for litigation but rather want to provide Hoosier businesses and those looking to locate in Indiana with the kind of stable environment they need.”
Pushback from Democrats
DeLaney said he believes the bill addresses problems Indiana does not have — while undermining the core principles of tort law. He was particularly critical of the non-economic damages cap.

“You can completely destroy my life, put me on a pump for the rest of my life, make it so I’m a quadriplegic and I can only get my medical bills paid,” he said. “I can’t get non-economic damages. I can’t for the pain, the suffering, the misery imposed upon me and my family.”
He also questioned the provision shielding transportation network companies from liability.
“If the Uber company is aware that the driver that they’ve contracted with has got all kinds of problems, has a criminal record and so forth, and then injures me, they’re not liable,” DeLaney said. “I cannot think that that’s in the public interest.”
DeLaney added that Indiana courts already have tools to address lawsuits involving crimes on private property and to limit excessive verdicts.
“We already have both common law and statutory law in this state that covers these issues,” he said. “This is what I call a lobbyist bill.”
Still, DeLaney said he doubts the bill will advance far in a short legislative session.
“I don’t think this should go anywhere,” he said. “This cannot be a high priority for anybody.”

(Getty Images)AJ spent most of 6th grade skipping class. Triggered by even small tasks, like being asked to write guided notes during instruction, AJ entered my 7th grade social studies class academically behind and discouraged. Reading at an early-elementary level, I needed to earn his trust and give him tools to succeed.
With help from AJ’s incredible one-on-one paraprofessional, we focused on small wins. I learned AJ’s favorite candy was Starburst and my usual mints wouldn’t cut it. I broke lessons into manageable parts and we numbered and highlighted readings so he could connect with new social studies content, including unfamiliar topics far beyond the limits of the city he’d never left. Together, we built his confidence, celebrated progress, and made learning accessible. By midyear, AJ was staying in class, raising his hand, and earning passing grades.
His success meant everything to me. The year before — my first as a middle school teacher after six years teaching high school — I nearly quit the profession, convinced I wasn’t cut out for the classroom. My lessons fell flat, my students weren’t learning, and I felt like I was failing them. I had been used to struggling alone, but after raising the challenges to my team, I received real support from my colleagues, instructional coaches, and administrators. They taught me how to embed evidence-based reading strategies, filling gaps for students like AJ who needed fluency and vocabulary instruction.
Because of their support and collaboration, my students grew, and I grew with them, becoming both a social studies and literacy teacher. AJ’s progress shows what teachers can do when they’re supported, mentored, and given time to collaborate.










Teacher leaders when nurtured, compensated, and trusted don’t just improve classrooms. They change entire schools.


In 2024, only 32% of my school’s students passed the English portion of the ILEARN assessment and 48% were below proficiency. This past Spring, 42% passed and only 39% scored below proficiency. These improvements occurred because of our principal’s emphasis on collaboration, planning, and data-driven professional development through our work with the National Institute for Excellence in Teaching, and a shared commitment to student and teacher growth as part of our new Instructional Leadership Team (ILT).
Because of this support structure, I now lead teams, collaborate across the district, and even participate in a teaching fellowship. My colleagues mentor peers, lead professional learning, and analyze data. These opportunities help keep teachers in the classroom and build a pipeline of support for incoming teachers, yet almost none of this comes with additional compensation.
Like many teacher leaders, I’ve taken on more because it’s good for students. But teaching in 2025 is harder than ever and doing more with less isn’t sustainable for retaining excellent educators or supporting teachers who are still learning the job.
‘Harder to keep teachers’: Indiana fiscal policy panel weighs salary gaps, educator shortage

Earlier this year, Indiana updated the Teacher Appreciation Grant (TAG) to now allow districts to use these specific state-provided funds to compensate teachers for leadership roles, not just performance. This shift could enable districts to pay mentors, instructional coaches, and team leaders for the critical work they already do.
This is a game-changer: it paves the way for districts to create career pathways that keep experts in the classroom at a time when many teachers are questioning staying in the career altogether. As districts start to share plans, teachers should continue to inform the process and advocate for a clear, transparent, and well-defined plan for how dollars can support collaboration in their district. Teachers should view this as a crucial opportunity to advocate for systems that truly value the expertise and leadership that make schools successful.
Traditional salary schedules reward longevity, not necessarily impact. If we want better outcomes for students like AJ, districts must invest in the teachers who make that happen. TAG funds create a pathway to do so—and teachers should be at the table shaping those decisions. Research shows that teachers stay when they feel supported and part of a community. Leveraging state funding to create compensated leadership roles strengthens both. When new teachers have mentors and accomplished teachers are recognized with meaningful, well-defined roles and pay, schools become places where everyone grows.
AJ is now in high school, and I couldn’t be prouder of him. The tools I gained through coaching and collaboration are the same ones I now share with colleagues, who use them with their own struggling readers. Intentional support made me a better teacher for AJ and so many others. It also made me a teacher leader. And teacher leaders when nurtured, compensated, and trusted don’t just improve classrooms. They change entire schools.

(Photo courtesy of U.S. Bureau of Land Management)When the director of a state agency asks the governor to investigate the citizen commission that oversees him, the public should pause. When that request follows years of documented leadership failures, ignored audits, and preventable deaths, the concern should deepen.
That is where Washington now finds itself with the Department of Fish and Wildlife.
In August, Director Kelly Susewind asked Gov. Bob Ferguson to initiate an investigation into members of the Washington Fish and Wildlife Commission, citing concerns raised through emails and text messages obtained by a national advocacy organization representing hunting interests. That investigation — now expected to stretch into 2026 — has cast a long shadow over the commission’s work, chilling its ability to function as an independent oversight body.
What has not received comparable scrutiny is the leadership record that preceded it.
The public record is clear. In January 2018, the Legislature commissioned the Matrix Consulting Group to conduct an organizational assessment of the Department of Fish and Wildlife. Its findings were stark: deep structural dysfunction, a toxic workplace culture, weak accountability, and leadership failures that put employees and the agency’s mission at risk. That report was delivered just months before Kelly Susewind was appointed director.
Three years later, in September 2021, the Washington state auditor released its own independent performance audit, “Assessing the Workplace Culture at the Department of Fish and Wildlife.” Based on extensive interviews and surveys of staff, the auditor confirmed what the Matrix report had already identified: widespread bullying, fear of retaliation, breakdowns in communication, and a profound lack of confidence in executive leadership’s willingness to correct course.
The auditor’s conclusion was explicit: real change would require sustained commitment from leadership. Without it, trust would continue to erode.
That commitment never materialized.
Two years after the auditor’s report was released, Dr. Erin Peterson, a 31-year-old fisheries biologist and mother, drowned while conducting solo fieldwork for the department on the Wind River. She lacked adequate safety training and basic protective equipment. Four months later, Mary Valentine, a veteran scientific technician at the agency, drowned under strikingly similar circumstances while working alone at a fish trap on the Duckabush River.
Washington’s Department of Labor and Industries later cited the Department of Fish and Wildlife for willful serious safety violations — the most severe category available — meaning management knew the risks and failed to act. More than $230,000 in penalties followed. These were not freak accidents. They were foreseeable outcomes of a leadership culture that failed to respond to repeated warnings.
Yet in the wake of these tragedies, there was no meaningful public reckoning. No demand for accountability from agency leadership. No executive pause to ask why independent audits had gone unheeded. No clear acknowledgment that the system itself had failed the people working within it.
Instead, public attention has shifted toward scrutinizing the commission.
Recent reporting shows that the investigation has already grown from an original $40,000 contract to at least $64,000, with the potential for additional cost if it continues into 2026. These are public dollars — spent not to address documented executive leadership failures, but to examine the conduct of the citizen body charged with oversight.
The origin of the complaints that precipitated this investigation also matters. They stem largely from a national hunting advocacy organization based in Ohio that has aggressively targeted Washington Fish and Wildlife Commissioners since 2022, following the commission’s decision to halt spring black bear hunting — a decision widely supported by Washington residents.
Whether one agrees with that policy outcome or not, it is troubling that an out-of-state pressure campaign has helped drive an expensive inquiry, while repeated in-state warnings about leadership failures and employee safety went unaddressed.
This inversion of accountability should concern anyone who cares about effective governance.
The Fish and Wildlife Commission exists to provide independent oversight — to represent the public trust, not to shield executive management from scrutiny. When a director initiates an investigation into his own oversight body while his leadership record remains largely unexamined, the integrity of that system is put at risk.
This is not about emails. It is not about personalities. And it is not about politics.
It is about whether Washington is willing to confront documented leadership failure — or continue to protect it.
Accountability must follow the evidence. In this case, the evidence points to years of ignored audits, uncorrected safety hazards, and a workplace culture whose consequences were fatal.
Oversight should not be punished. Whistle-blowers should not be sidelined. And preventable deaths should never be met with silence.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/coho-salmon.jpeg,,,2026-01-12 07:12:15.904943

Voters will choose between Democratic nominee Judith Taylor, the chair of the Tuscaloosa Democratic Party, and Republican nominee Norman Crow, a Tuscaloosa City Councilman.
The seat in House District 63 opened after Rep. Cynthia Almond, R-Tuscaloosa, resigned to become the president of the Alabama Public Service Commission.

The district in recent elections has been solidly Republican. Almond got 66% of the vote in 2022. Former Rep. Bill Poole, R-Tuscaloosa, who represented the district before becoming state finance director in 2021, got 63% of the vote in 2010 and faced no opposition in 2014 or 2018.
Taylor said in an interview on Thursday that she’s running to make change in her district.
“There are so many needs that we need to address, and the Alabama representatives that are in Montgomery are going to have to stand up for the people in their areas, in their districts, and so many of them have been so quiet, and it’s concerning,” she said.
Taylor said wants to prioritize improving public education which could reduce crime rate across the state.
“If you look into the results of better education for young people and better job opportunities for new graduates out of high school,” she said. “How does that affect the crime rate? I think it would lower the crime rate if people had a better opportunity, and I’d much rather build more schools and spend more money financing schooling than prisons,” Taylor said.
Another one of her priorities is affordable health care.
“I think affordable health care is something America should be able to solve, and I think that the least expensive way to do it is as a group, and then our hospitals wouldn’t be closing,” Taylor said.
Since 2009, nine rural hospitals have closed in Alabama. The most recent closure happened last year.
Messages seeking comment from Crow were left on Friday. 
In an interview with the Reflector in June, with the Reflector, Crow cited education as a priority. 
“Continuing to work to improve education in the state of Alabama is so important to prepare our students, but also adults, for the jobs of tomorrow,” he said.
He also said in the interview that running for the seat is a “huge opportunity” for him to serve his community on a state level furthering his passion for public service.
Taylor said voters should choose her because she will try to solve the problems of her constituents.
“I don’t think you can solve financial problems without solving social problems. I think those two things have to go hand in hand,” she said.
Crow in June said his political experience makes him the best candidate to vote for.
“I really know the district, and I feel like I’m in a good position to understand constituents and help with what the priorities of District 63 are,” he said.
Through Jan. 2, Crow had raised $134,778 for the race and spent $26,784. Taylor had raised about $14,410 and spent $5,477.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Copy-of-Copy-of-Untitled-Design-1024x576.png,,,2026-01-12 07:12:15.904943

Women denied miscarriage treatment have been investigated or charged for how they disposed of fetal remains. Hundreds have been charged for using illegal, legal, and prescribed  substances while pregnant, even when their babies were born healthy or their miscarriages or stillbirths were likely caused by other conditions, like infections. Women have been charged for self-managing their abortions, even where laws ostensibly exempt them from prosecution.   
Thankfully, we haven’t seen this in Missouri. So far.
A report released last year by Pregnancy Justice that catalogs these cases in the period from the Dobbs decision in June 2022 to June 2024 doesn’t include any in Missouri. Pregnancy Justice’s Dana Sussman cautioned me that this doesn’t mean it didn’t happen, and noted that we do have a pre-Dobbs history of arrests of pregnant and postpartum women, including ten cases in their 2023 report covering January 2006 to June 2022.
It’s good news that we haven’t seen the kinds of post-Dobbs cases that other states have. Unfortunately, I expect that is largely because our succession of anti-abortion attorneys general, and local prosecutors who share their goals, have been deterred by the Reproductive Freedom Initiative being on the ballot in 2024, and subsequently becoming law.
I suspect prosecutors didn’t want to raise the salience of what it meant for abortion to be a crime in Missouri before we voted on the initiative to enshrine reproductive freedom in our constitution (I’ll call that “Original Amendment 3”). Now that Missouri’s constitution protects individuals from prosecution for the alleged or actual outcomes of their pregnancies, prosecutors should see such cases as destined to fail.
Still, many of the cases Pregnancy Justice has documented involve situations where the law didn’t justify the charges, but prosecutors brought them anyway. Missouri’s anti-abortion prosecutors, however, can’t risk the bad publicity that could come from going after a woman blamed for her miscarriage or alleged to have self-managed her abortion because it could jeopardize our Republican legislators’ effort to repeal Original Amendment 3 via their New Amendment 3, which will recriminalize abortion unless voters vote it down this year.
The protection we have from criminalization under our hard won current law is vital to the health and liberty of Missourians, but it has been dismissed by anti-abortion leaders who refuse to acknowledge the documented harm to patients that Missouri’s criminal ban caused. Even a handful of abortion rights advocates who opposed the strategy of re-establishing abortion access via the ballot have ignored the importance of these new protections. 
As numerous articles have documented, broad access to abortion has not been restored in the year since the passage of Original Amendment 3. Many of these articles frame this as a surprise and a disappointment. 
It may be disappointing, but it is by no means a surprise. Advocates were not operating under the illusion that abortion care would be widely available the day after the vote. We anticipated a long slog.
First, you have to sue the state to have “Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers,” a.k.a. “TRAP laws,” struck down. TRAP laws are medically inappropriate regulations disguised as health protections that have been enacted by anti-abortion officials in order to make it impossible for abortion clinics to function. Missouri’s TRAP laws are the reason abortion care was nearly eliminated in Missouri prior to the overturning of Roe.  
Why a particular TRAP law is medically inappropriate can be pretty technical, and not at all obvious to the average person — or judge. In their lawsuit seeking to invalidate the many TRAP laws on the books in our state, Missouri’s ACLU and Planned Parenthood affiliates succeeded in convincing the court to preliminarily enjoin (that is, pause) a number of regulations while the litigation proceeds, allowing some abortion care to resume. 
But the court declined to enjoin other TRAP laws that continue to make it impossible to expand access, especially to medication abortion. With the benefit of a trial beginning today that will include expert testimony, the court should enjoin the remaining regulations because the Missouri constitution now imposes a “super-strict scrutiny” standard that puts the burden on the state to prove that a regulation actually has a health benefit and is consistent with clinical standards. 
If the trial court gets it right, it still won’t be over because the state will likely appeal. 
Second, once a state’s abortion care infrastructure has been decimated, a legal win can’t restore it overnight. Clinics close and medical professionals leave. Even with a perfect ruling from the Missouri Supreme Court, rebuilding will take not only time and money, but providers who are willing to endure ongoing attacks from our anti-abortion supermajority in the legislature and other state officials.
Like I said, it’s gonna be a slog, during which many Missourians will have to continue to rely on out-of-state providers. That’s no reason not to fight the fight. Nor to dismiss how essential the protections that are in place today thanks to Original Amendment 3 are, which New Amendment 3 would eliminate.
Legal abortion does not equal accessible abortion. But legality has already made Missouri significantly less dangerous, even while abortion access remains limited. This is for two reasons: (1) hospitals are significantly less likely to deny or delay care for patients experiencing miscarriages due to the amendment’s protections against prosecution of medical professionals, and (2) Missourians are protected from criminal penalties for having abortions via telemedicine or self-management, and for experiencing miscarriages or stillbirths. 
As to miscarriage treatment, I can’t promise you that every hospital has stopped delaying care or sending patients out of state and putting patients at risk of sepsis, loss of future fertility or death. Hospitals don’t typically make their legal guidance to medical providers public. But any decent hospital attorney should be advising that the Missouri Constitution now essentially eliminates the risk of prosecution for providing miscarriage care and provides a seemingly airtight defense in the unlikely case of a prosecutor going rogue and bringing charges anyway. 
I am aware of hospitals and medical practices who have indeed updated their guidance.
As to the threat of criminalization of Missourians who self-induce their abortions or have adverse pregnancy outcomes, I cannot overstate how important the protections are that we established with Original Amendment 3 and stand to lose with New Amendment 3. 
The vast majority of abortions occurring in Missouri today are either via telemedicine, that is, medical providers providing remote care from states with shield laws through organizations like Aid Access; or via self-management, in which individuals procure abortion medication without the assistance of a medical provider. 
Before Original Amendment 3, telemedicine or self-management were legally risky, exposing abortion-seekers to law enforcement involvement or threats of it from abusive partners, family members or hospital staff. 
Many in the anti-abortion movement deny any desire to see women prosecuted for having abortions. Missouri’s now invalidated ban exempted “a woman upon whom an abortion is performed” from prosecution for a “conspiracy” to violate the ban. But that left room to charge someone who was not part of a “conspiracy” because she self-induced.
The threat is real. Women are being prosecuted across the country. Missouri has long been at the forefront of anti-abortion legislation. We have a fetal personhood law on the books that was upheld in 1989 by a less fanatically anti-abortion U.S Supreme Court than we have today.  State Sen. Mike Moon has once again introduced a bill that would subject women who have abortions to homicide charges. 
Missouri’s attorney general has concurrent jurisdiction over abortion prosecutions, which means that if your local prosecutor has no interest in prosecuting abortion seekers, the attorney general can. 
Our new attorney general, Catherine Hanaway, recently demonstrated her enthusiasm for harsh criminal penalties for abortion by citing the Comstock Act multiple times in a recent court filing. The Comstock Act is an 1873 federal anti-vice law that was the subject of backlash at the time and hasn’t been enforced in over a century. It states that “every article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion, or for any indecent or immoral use, shall not be conveyed in the mails” (Emphasis mine).
Today’s anti-abortion extremists are pushing the novel (to put it lightly) legal theory that the Comstock Act currently makes it punishable by up to five years in prison to provide or obtain any abortion anywhere in this country because abortion can’t be provided without medication or medical instruments transported by mail or common carrier. Hanaway’s office did not respond to a request for comment as to whether her filing should be read to indicate she holds this maximalist view.
In the days before Roe, few providers were prosecuted for providing abortions and even fewer women were prosecuted for having them. That was another time, very different from our age of mass incarceration and surveillance. “Prosecutors are gonna prosecute,” Sussman told me, “pregnancy loss has become more and more suspect, as is any action someone does or doesn’t take during pregnancy.” 
The legal protections already in place thanks to our Reproductive Freedom amendment are vital, and no one should downplay the consequences of losing them if New Amendment 3 succeeds.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051425_abortionaccess1-1024x615.jpg,,,2026-01-12 06:58:03.719837

Simpson, a felon prohibited from possessing guns, used an AK-style assault rifle and shot 20 times at the car carrying the victims.
“Kendrick Simpson hunted his victims, executed them without hesitation, and then boasted about what he had done,” said Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond. “The families left behind have endured unimaginable pain, and nothing in Simpson’s decades on death row has shown that he deserved the mercy he refused to give others.”
Simpson is expected to argue that he suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder after being the victim in a 2004 shooting in New Orleans and because he was a child victim of sexual abuse. 
Prosecutors say the PTSD, if he has it, does not explain or excuse the murders.
Simpson is also expected to go into details about a traumatic childhood that included violence and drugs. His attorneys allege he had an “anemic defense,” which failed to show the jury the truth about his history.
According to his clemency packet, Simpson is “profoundly remorseful,” and takes responsibility.
He is asking the panel to “look at the whole of his life rather than a snapshot of the worst thing he has ever done and show mercy,” according to his clemency packet.
If the panel recommends clemency, Gov. Kevin Stitt will make the final decision.

The Milwaukee Police Department says it doesn’t have a plan in place if federal immigration authorities mobilize into the city at a scale similar to operations in nearby Chicago and Minneapolis. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement launched one of the largest operations in its history last week, sending about 2,000 agents into the Twin Cities. That mobilization resulted in an ICE agent shooting and killing 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good Wednesday morning in Minneapolis. Minneapolis schools were closed Thursday because, in a separate incident, ICE agents deployed tear gas at a high school as students were being dismissed.
Late last year, ICE’s “Operation Midway Blitz” similarly sent a large number of federal agents into the Chicago area. While the operation was underway, ICE and other federal agents killed a 38-year-old Mexican man during a traffic stop and in another incident rammed into the car of a woman who was warning neighbors about ICE presence before shooting her five times. 
The Chicago operation included at least another dozen incidents in which federal agents pointed their guns or fired less-lethal weapons at residents, according to data compiled by The Trace. 
In both cities, the massive presence of immigration authorities has caused significant ripple effects through local communities, straining the ability of local law enforcement to control crowds of observers and protesters and respond to the disruptions in traffic caused by caravans of federal SUVs traveling over city streets. 
“Local police departments and many state governors have been very firm in their communication to federal law enforcement that federal law enforcement is not welcome in their cities conducting these sorts of major operations because of the fact that it is so disruptive,” says Ingrid Eagly, a law professor at UCLA who focuses on immigration enforcement. “Because people you know can be injured and harmed, and communities are living in fear. It’s causing a great amount of disruption in communities to have this kind of strong law enforcement presence.” 
In cities across the country where ICE agents have been deployed in large numbers, local officials have had to decide how local cops engage with the operations and what that engagement communicates to local residents. Eagly says that operating as “a backup service for unprepared ICE agents” would be using local resources to legitimize ICE’s presence. 
“To send in local law enforcement, as backup, as sort of part of the enforcement team, would be essentially being part of the of the federal police force conducting ICE operations,” she says.
The operations in Chicago and Minneapolis, two largely Democratic Midwestern cities  that are frequent targets of rhetorical attacks by Republicans, are prominent displays of force in communities similar to Milwaukee. Even though Wisconsin has so far avoided the brunt of the Trump administration’s stepped-up immigration enforcement efforts, that could change. 
Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel that the city had to be prepared for the “eventuality” that an ICE surge is coming.
“Given what happened [Wednesday] and the young woman who was killed by a federal agent in Minneapolis, we got to prepare on the ground,” Johnson said.
But when asked if the Milwaukee Police had a plan for managing a potential ICE operation in the city, a spokesperson for the department only pointed to the department’s existing immigration policy. 
The department’s immigration policy states that Milwaukee Police officers are not allowed to cooperate with ICE’s civil immigration enforcement actions. 
“Proactive immigration enforcement by local police can be detrimental to our mission and policing philosophy when doing so deters some individuals from participating in their civic obligation to assist the police,” the policy states. 
But the written policy does not include any provisions for how police personnel should respond in the event of massive ICE presence in the community. Having a noncooperation or “sanctuary” policy could make Milwaukee a target for Trump’s mass deportation program. Despite that, when pressed for clarification because the policy does not state now the department would manage the fallout of an ICE surge, the spokesperson refused to answer.
“It states what our policy [is] in regards to immigration enforcement,” a Milwaukee police spokesperson said in an unsigned email on Tuesday, before the Minneapolis incident. “We do not have an operation like Chicago therefore cannot provide information about a policy of something that we do not have in our city.” 
Pressed again for an answer to the specific question about managing the traffic and crowd control implications of a massive ICE operation in Milwaukee, the spokesperson again refused to answer. 
“We have an immigration enforcement policy just because you do not like the answer does not mean we are going to answer different to you,” the spokesperson wrote. 
After the shooting in Minneapolis, in answer to a follow-up question from the Examiner, the MPD spokesperson again cited the department’s existing policy preventing cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)More than seven years after Idaho voters approved Medicaid expansion, the Republican supermajority-controlled Legislature is still talking about repealing it.
In the past, repeal bills haven’t gone that far. But this year seems different — since the state is facing multimillion projected budget shortfalls after years of tax cuts, Idaho’s DOGE committee recommended repeal, and even Idaho House Speaker Mike Moyle is open to the idea.

“Heck yeah (it’s on the table),” Moyle told the Idaho Capital Sun last week. “I don’t have a problem with that. Everything is on the table. I don’t have a problem with that at all.”
The debate over repealing expansion has largely settled into two camps: Some Republican lawmakers complain that expansion is much more expensive than initial projections, and that it could eat into the state’s budget for other services such as education. 
But opponents say expansion has saved lives, repealing it wouldn’t save the state money since the feds pay so much into the program and the policy saves state money in other areas. They also say repeal could jeopardize the state’s health care system in ways that everyone — not just the almost 90,000 Idahoans on expansion — would feel.
That’s pretty much what folks have been saying for years. 
“It’s Groundhogs Day,” Idaho Cancer Society Cancer Action Network government relations director Randy Johnson said in an interview. 
What’s frustrating, he added, is that “we’re spending so much time on talking about repeal, we never get to the real issue: What is driving up health care costs?”

 What is Medicaid expansion? And how did it close the ‘Medicaid gap’?

Under the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, the federal government incentivized states to expand Medicaid to a broader range of low-income earners by offering to cover Medicaid expansion policies at a higher federal matching rate of 90%. 
Idaho was one of several states that didn’t expand Medicaid.
Idaho Republican lawmakers have long worried states would be left to pay higher costs for expansion if the federal government reduced its extra pay. 
But by not expanding Medicaid, tens of thousands of Idahoans were left in a medical insurance assistance gap, dubbed the Medicaid gap. People in the gap earned too much to qualify for Medicaid, but too little to qualify for tax subsidies on Idaho’s health insurance marketplace, Your Health Idaho. 
Medicaid expansion set one eligibility cap for everyone: 138% of the federal poverty level, which is now roughly $21,600 annual earnings for a single person. 
In 2018, after years of stalled legislative efforts to address the Medicaid gap, nearly 61% of Idaho voters approved a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid. 
Since then, support for expansion has risen, polling from 2023 shows.



 Idaho spent $92M this year in general funds on Medicaid expansion. The feds pitched in $1 billion.

In 2020, Idaho Medicaid expansion took effect, extending the health insurance public assistance program to more low-income workers for a population commonly called the working poor. Before expansion, they were in what advocates called the gap; they earned too much for Medicaid, and too little for subsidies to buy insurance on the state’s exchange.
Republican lawmakers often call Idaho’s Medicaid budget out of control, and they frequently point to the program’s full budget — not the state’s portion. Advocates have said Medicaid’s budget growth is stable.
Here’s a few snapshots of Idaho’s costs to expand Medicaid: 

States only pay 10% of costs of Medicaid expansion, with the federal government paying the other 90%. That’s much higher than Idaho’s usual share of Medicaid costs, which is more than 30% for other Medicaid populations such as people with disabilities and children. 
Overall, Idaho Medicaid expansion’s budget is appropriated about $1.34 billion this fiscal year, about twice as high as the program’s roughly $670 million budget in fiscal year 2021, the first full year that expansion was implemented. 
Medicaid expansion’s current budget in Idaho has the state paying $91.7 million in general funds this fiscal year, and the federal government paying more than $1 billion. 
Savings from expansion surpasses the state’s costs for the policy, the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy found in a report last year. In 2023, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare said repealing expansion would cost the state $78 million more. 
Expansion has also contributed $1.5 million to the state’s economy and generated almost $47 million in state taxes last year, a report by a University of Idaho economist found.

Speaking to reporters Friday, Idaho Gov. Brad Little cautioned against repealing Medicaid expansion, saying it’d spark unintended consequences. After expansion, he said the state took away some health care safety nets that were in place before — like the Catastrophic Health Care Fund, a state indigent health care program that gave financial assistance to people who were uninsured.

“If you look at Medicaid, there’s all kinds of unintended consequences,” Little said. “The raw number for repeal is not the actual number, and the Department of Health Welfare is working on that.”
When asked, Little stopped short of saying he would veto a bill to repeal Medicaid expansion. Instead, Little said he doesn’t say what he will do with bills before they arrive on his desk. 
Idaho Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, a Boise Democrat, called repealing expansion “probably one of the most expensive cuts we’ll make.”
And there’s also a health cost, doctors say.
“It just doesn’t make sense. It’s cruel and unusual punishment. And it’s not going to save the state money. It’s going to cost us money and lives in the long run,” said Dr. Kenneth Krell, a former ICU director in eastern Idaho.
An Idaho ‘reform’ bill would likely repeal voter-approved Medicaid expansion. Here’s why.

He advocated for Idaho Medicaid expansion after one of his patients died. He says her death was preventable. 
If the state repealed expansion, that would pile onto a range of cuts headed for Idaho Medicaid and health care: to doctor pay cuts, mental health cuts that could risk public safety, reforms from the state’s Medicaid law last year, federal cuts from the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” and expired federal health insurance subsidies.
Dr. Brian Birch, who leads the Treasure Valley’s Children’s Clinic in Meridian, said the state can’t handle more health care cuts. 
“There are pediatric practices that are on the brink of going out of business with the existing cuts,” Birch told the Sun in an interview. “… Ultimately, more cuts will lead to less access to care for everyone. Because if a (medical) practice closes down, they’re not just closing down to just Medicaid patients or Medicaid expansion patients — they’re closing down to everybody.”
 Ballot initiative to expand Medicaid didn’t come as surprise to some lawmakers, Republican senator says

Last year, a bill, pitched as a reform measure but which would’ve likely repealed expansion, narrowly passed the House. But Senate Health and Welfare Committee Chairwoman Julie VanOrden, a Republican from Pingree, halted the bill in her committee, preventing it from going to a full vote before the Senate.
Then she banded together with Republicans to back the big Medicaid bill that successfully became law. The bill, a comprehensive cost-cutting measure, proposed work requirements, shifting to privatized management of Medicaid benefits, and more policies that will take years to materialize. 
So far this year, she said she hasn’t seen a bill drafted to repeal expansion. She said she hasn’t supported a repeal because of all the ripple effects that could come.
“It’s just not repealing expansion and doing away with an expense that we have on our budget,” she told the Sun last week. “It’s not as plain and simple as that.”

She remembers the legislative debates leading up to the ballot initiative that expanded Medicaid. She was serving in the House in 2018, as the ballot initiative was gearing up. 
Legislative leadership was trying to find a way to address the gap, but they couldn’t reach an agreement on a bill, she said.
“So when Medicaid expansion became a citizens initiative and made it to the ballot and passed, it wasn’t surprising to some of us because we knew that there was a problem and it needed to be addressed. And the Legislature had failed to address it,” VanOrden said. “And so the citizens took it into their own hands.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Ahead of the 2026 legislative session, Iowa statewide elected officials have released proposals they hope lawmakers will address, including DNA testing for arrested individuals, increasing penalties for public employees and officials who steal public funds and combating business fraud.
Several offices, as well as state departments, have submitted legislative proposals leading up to the start of session, which begins Monday.
Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird held a news conference alongside former New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez and other Iowa public safety officials where she announced her office’s aim to pass a measure known as “Katie’s Law” in Iowa.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
This proposal, named after Katie Sepich, a 22-year-old University of New Mexico student who was killed in 2003, would require DNA be collected from criminal defendants after being arrested for a felony or aggravated misdemeanor charge — an expansion from current requirements that state DNA be collected only after a person is convicted.
Martinez said she supported the law as governor to allow criminals to be more quickly caught, pointing to Sepich’s murder as a reason for the need to collect this evidence. While law enforcement officers collected DNA evidence under her fingernails, as there was not a match in national databases for her murderer — Sepich’s killer was not arrested for more than three years after her death, after he submitted a DNA sample following his prison sentence for convictions of burglary, resisting arrest and fraudulent refusal to return leased property.
“Katie’s Law” will help bring criminals to justice quicker in cases like Sepich’s murder, Bird said.
“No family should have to wait years for answers about what happened to their loved one, and no criminal should ever get away with murder, rape or any other violent crime,” Bird said. “We need to give law enforcement the tools they need to investigate and to bring violent criminals to justice. Over 30 other states already have Katie’s Law — I think Iowa should too.”
Martinez, who signed an expansion to New Mexico’s law in 2011, said it has survived challenges up to the U.S. Supreme Court and is an important tool in closing cold cases.
“When we wait until conviction to collect the DNA, we give serial offenders a free pass between the time of their arrest and their final sentencing. We allow them to remain anonymous for periods of time and different crimes that they’ve already committed. Katie’s Law closes this window.”
Bird also proposed another measure she said will help victims of crimes in Iowa, which included provisions allowing victims of sex crimes to get lifetime no-contact orders, shortening the period of time required for sex offenders to notify local authorities of changes in their residence, work and vehicle and allowing crime victim counselors to share certain confidential information with law enforcement when there is a risk of immediate harm.
Bird said these changes are issues specifically brought up by crime victims and victim advocates as steps that could help prevent new traumatization and further crimes.
“We don’t take lightly the pain that victims endure, and we will take meaningful action and make sure that victims are safe and that their voices are heard,” Bird said.
Secretary of State’s office combats business fraud
Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate also has a proposal in 2026 to help Iowans facing a different type of crime — business fraud.
In an interview with Iowa Capital Dispatch, Pate said his top priority in the 2026 session will be passing a measure to help protect Iowa homeowners from certain business crimes in which person creating a fraudulent business chooses a random individual and home address as their “registered agent.”
“They just randomly pick you and put your address down, so you’re now the registered agent — and that means any creditors or legal action gets directed to you,” Pate said. “This is very disturbing, obviously, because first thing I’m going to think, is there’s nothing good coming out of this, this is not a legitimate company. And it’s been very difficult to always find these, and more difficult even to dissolve them, because it’s a very cumbersome process.”
Pate said he plans to propose an “expedited process” for marking the business as illegitimate, which he said would allow his office to dissolve the company and take care of related issues so that “the consumer or the homeowner is not getting put in a bad position.”
While there have been instances of these crimes being reported around Des Moines metro and in other parts of the state, Pate said it is difficult to find numbers on how often this type of fraud is occurring due to underreporting from affected homeowners as well as the rate at which these fraudulent businesses are created and dissolved.
He said the proposal will aim to address an oversight in Iowa’s current system for effectively identifying and addressing these crimes.
“The frustrating thing is … in Iowa, we don’t have a real clear line of who should be out there as a point person on these things,” Pate said. “The attorney general handles consumer fraud, but when you talk about the business side, it’s a bit of a gray area. And I am not looking at becoming the attorney general, but I want to make sure I can help shepherd and get the information to the attorney general, or to (the Department of Public Safety).”
Sand calls for repeal of auditor’s law, increased penalties for stealing public funds
Iowa Auditor Rob Sand said in a Monday news conference one of his biggest priorities for the 2026 session was to reverse a measure passed by the Legislature in 2023 that restricts his office from accessing certain documents and personal information, and that stops taking other state agencies to court.
Sand, the sole Democrat to hold statewide elected office in Iowa, has repeatedly criticized Senate File 478 as a “pro-corruption bill,” saying it prevents the state auditor’s office from being able to effectively audit state government institutions. In addition to limiting access to certain documents and personal information, the 2023 law directs disputes between the auditor’s office and state entities to a board of arbitration instead of to court. The panel made up of two members involved in the dispute — the auditor’s office and the entity being audited — in addition to a third member appointed by the governor’s office.
As Republicans hold a trifecta of control at the Iowa Capitol, Sand’s proposals face long odds of making it through the legislative process. However, he said he believes the measure would help provide better transparency and accountability to Iowa state government.
“Standing up here today is me doing the right thing — suggesting ideas that directly impact the state auditor’s office, not weighing whether or not the Legislature wants to pass them,” Sand said.
The auditor also introduced a measure proposing mandatory prison time for public employees and public officials convicted of stealing $10,000 or more of public funds. Sand said not allowing courts to defer or suspend a defendant’s prison sentence in these cases was a “common sense” measure, as it would ensure people who steal taxpayer funds face prison time.
Other statewide officials
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig has proposed the Iowa Farm Act, a measure rolling several ag-related measures into one bill, including tax relief, zoning for farm-related businesses, school purchasing of farm products and biosecurity.
State Treasurer Roby Smith has not publicly announced a legislative agenda.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraskans have participated as the state’s “second house” and voiced the “will of the voters” in 23 statewide ballot measures since 2004. 
More than 17.6 million votes were cast for or against those issues.
Voters have weighed in on statewide measures in every election since 2014, one of the longest stretches of voter-advocated ballot issues in state history. Advocates across the political spectrum say part of the reason for consistent petitions is failure to reflect voters’ wishes in the Legislature, the one-house, one-in-a-nation system designed by voters themselves under a 1934 constitutional amendment.
The Nebraska Constitution, since 1912, has allowed Nebraskans to create new state laws and constitutional amendments and repeal laws passed by the Legislature. Some 18 statewide ballot measures have passed including and since the 2004 election.
Signatures and campaign finance

There are strict signature-gathering requirements to reach the ballot, including bulk totals and a distribution requirement. Measures reaching voters over that span required more than 2 million signatures for an up-or-down vote. Tens of thousands more signatures were gathered for measures that fell short or were disqualified from being voted on.
Groups vying to reach voters spent $95 million over that period. Of that total, the 2022 and 2024 election cycles accounted for more than half.
The upward trend in fundraising and spending for ballot measures is similar to what’s facing legislative races, including the 25 seats up for election in 2024. Legislative elections exceeded $10 million in spending, a new record.
Of the legislative tally in 2024, $1 million came after freshman State Sens. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha and Tanya Storer of Whitman joined a new tactic in which candidates purchase campaign advertising for ballot measure campaigns more cheaply than the ballot campaigns could without them. University of Nebraska Regents Rob Schafer of Beatrice and Jim Scheer of Norfolk and John Yoakum, a member of the Lower Platte South Natural Resources District, also joined in as part of competing abortion-related ballot campaigns.
Nebraska’s 49 state senators are paid $12,000 a year.
Voter-lawmaker tension
Tension between voters and state officials escalated in 2025, with multiple bills and legislative debates around implementing or tweaking medical cannabis, paid sick leave, minimum wage, state support for private schools and more. The Constitution requires 33 votes from legislators to tweak voter-approved state laws.

As a result of the 2025 legislative session, a 2026 petition campaign seeks to make it harder for lawmakers to intervene and require 40 votes to do so.
Eight more petitions are circulating for the 2026 ballot — around abortion, property taxes and property valuations, teacher pay, recreational marijuana, hand-count ballots and how the state awards its Electoral College votes for president. Another, to legalize online sports betting, waits in the wings pending legislative action, or inaction.
Lawmakers in 2025 invoked phrases like the “will of the voters” and “will of the people” 499 times in 2025. Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, too, used the phrase while advocating to change how the state awards presidential electors during his 2025 State of the State address.
Embattled State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst, who faces a possible expulsion vote as soon as this week, has invoked the phrase in defense of his service.
Lawmakers define ‘will of the voters’
Starting in June 2025, the Nebraska Examiner invited all 49 state senators to reflect on what the phrase “will of the voters” means to them as they approach legislation proposing tweaks to voter-approved ballot measures. Lawmakers were also asked if they supported any specific changes and, if so, what.
As of publication, 33 senators had responded. A couple said they did not have time to respond or worried that, however they responded, it could be a “trick question.” View the project in a new online window here.
This is the first in a series of articles examining ballot measures and campaign finance that the Nebraska Examiner intends to publish in January 2026.

If we truly want to reestablish our national “greatness,” then we, and especially those who represent us in government, must all recommit to the fundamental and very simple proposition that America is, and has always been, a nation of laws, not men, write a group of Wyoming attorneys and retired judges.
The post The American way appeared first on WyoFile .","Since the events of Jan. 6, 2021 and its aftermath, we and many others in the legal profession have warned about the steady erosion of the Rule of Law and the breakdown of our constitutional order. Still, over the last year, the decline has accelerated and has now reached locomotive speed. 

Opinion

There is more than one cause for this, including partisan congressional gridlock, but it is clear the primal force behind the recent dramatic deterioration of our constitutional guardrails is the unprecedented assertions of executive power by President Trump and the accompanying unwillingness of our Congress to restrain him. 
The president’s unilateral decision to send a large U.S. military force into Venezuela last week, without seeking congressional approval, is just the latest example of his executive power overreach. Through the use of hundreds of executive orders, proclamations and executive memoranda often disingenuously justified with self-declared “emergencies,” the president has repeatedly evaded Congress to take unilateral executive action beyond what any other peacetime president has done before.
The chronic resort to unchecked executive action based on one man’s declared “emergency” should raise an enormous red flag to anyone who claims to support American constitutionalism. Indeed, only a few years ago, our own U.S. Rep. Harriett Hageman sought to curb President Biden’s far more modest use of emergency executive orders by co-sponsoring the “Restoration of Separation of Powers Act” in Congress. Quoting James Madison, her bill rightly affirmed that “[t]here can be no liberty where the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person.” Her bill thus proposed that every executive order be expressly supported by a presidential “statement of [its] specific statutory or constitutional authority” and that every “emergency” order would be short-lived, automatically terminating after 90 days absent congressional approval. 
But her bill did not pass. And now that President Trump is declaring the emergencies and signing the executive orders, her previous concern about runaway executive power has vanished. Both she and Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis have stood by mutely while the president, claiming one emergency after another, has wrecked congressionally approved programs and agencies, impounded or re-directed congressionally appropriated funds, circumvented congressional authority to impose crushing tariffs on our allies, deployed military forces into states against their wishes, imprisoned and deported thousands of individuals without due process, authorized the killing of over 100 foreign civilians via multi-million dollar missile strikes on unproved charges of “narco-terrorism,” and, to start the new year, shaken our entire hemisphere by directing our armed forces to invade a sovereign nation of 30 million people, seizing its head of state and killing 80 people in the process. 
These presidential orders are direct assaults on Congress’ constitutional authority to tax and spend, declare war and oversee the military — the fundamental powers over the “purse and the sword,” which our founders fought a long and bloody war to take from a king and instead place in the hands of “the people” through our elected Congress. 
Yet, in the face of these unprecedented presidential actions, our Congress has done nothing to protect its hard-won authority — authority bestowed upon it through the supreme sacrifices of our ancestors. Indeed, in a perversely ironic twist, many in Congress, including our own representatives, have howled in protest when federal judges, seeking to preserve congressional authority, have declared various executive orders unconstitutional. As we wrote previously, this shameful condemnation of our judiciary by members of our legislative branch has not only encouraged the president to further exploit his executive power, but it has also weakened the independence of both the judicial and legislative branches and enflamed threats of violence against judges and their families.
The president and his supporters say all of this is “great” because our nation has become weak and only radical actions by a “strong” leader can save us. Espousing these views, the president thus quotes Napoleon to proclaim, “he who saves his Country does not violate any Law.” But this ends-justify-the-means worldview is both morally bankrupt and utterly at odds with our founders’ deliberate design based upon shared powers between three branches of government — a design inherent in our national and state constitutions and the laws established by our representative legislatures. Over the last 250 years, millions of Americans have fought and died to preserve our unique form of republican democracy, a governmental structure that has made America the hope and envy of the free world. 
Yet the president and his followers now increasingly see our Constitution and laws as optional; they seek to discredit citizens like us who dare to challenge the authority for the president’s bold actions by calling us “elitist” or “radical woke leftists.” They say the world has changed and that our problems are now too big to solve through legalistic constitutional processes and “rules-based systems.” Tired of democracy, they cheer the president’s every action, including his ever-growing resort to force, whether through the expanded deployment of masked ICE brigades in blue American cities, or by bombing, blockading and threatening a growing number of sovereign countries. 
It should be impressed: The president took his recent actions regarding Venezuela without even consulting Congress, let alone seeking its permission. Worse, our own three congressional representatives did not even want to be informed. Barrasso and Lummis both voted against a recent resolution merely seeking to give the Senate the opportunity to debate and discuss whether the president’s military actions in Venezuela required congressional approval under the War Powers Act. Their vote against even engaging on the topic gave the president a blank check to launch last week’s invasion, and seemingly whatever other military action he may have in mind for Venezuela — or anywhere else.
This is not the American way. Americans have always vigorously debated the proper ends of government, but we decided 250 years ago that the means to accomplish those ends must always conform to our Constitution and laws. Americans teach our children “might does not make right,” rules matter and the ends do not justify the means. We have not always lived up to our lofty national standards, and those standards have evolved through costly trial and error. Even so, pursuing our public goals the “right way,” in accordance with established law, international treaties and recognized principles of justice, is foundational to our national identity. It is also at the heart of American moral and religious traditions, which have always asked: “For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?”
We’ve come to the 250th anniversary of our founding, and yet another important election year.  If we truly want to retain or reestablish our national “greatness,” then we, and especially those we choose to represent us in Congress and our state and local governments, must all profoundly recommit to the fundamental and very simple proposition that America is, and has always been, a nation of laws, not men. This is the American way. And it is the only means through which Americans can authentically pursue “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” consistent with our founding. Our parents and grandparents and so many more fought and died for this principle. We can no longer allow our priceless heritage as Americans to be sacrificed on the altar of those who shortsightedly value their personal ambitions or political party power over our Constitution, laws and moral code.
Please join us this special anniversary year to demand that every Wyoming political candidate and office holder protect and defend America’s constitutional values and democratic institutions from further debasement. Our children and grandchildren depend on it.

[…]","A family makes its way down rapids on the Illinois River near Watts, Oklahoma, on June 1, 2024. (Photo by dlewis33/Getty Images)One of the earliest lessons parents teach their children is if they break someone else’s things — even if it’s by accident — they have a responsibility to make it right.
This virtue transcends into adulthood in practical ways, such as carrying automobile insurance in case of a crash or paying restitution following a crime.
But a group of influential Oklahoma Republicans apparently believe this moral code applies to everyone except our state’s poultry industry. Because otherwise, they’d be celebrating a long-awaited decision mandating those big businesses to fix the damage they’ve caused to our waters while spreading too much phosphorus-rich chicken manure as fertilizer. The practice has damaged the ecosystem in eastern Oklahoma and neighboring Arkansas.
Over the past few weeks, it’s been embarrassing to watch these Republicans — including Gov. Kevin Stitt, House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, several gubernatorial hopefuls and a number of other elected lawmakers — publicly bow before their agricultural overlords and kiss their ring in a bid to gain favor.
Usually this obscene obsequiousness occurs behind closed doors, but apparently the Farm Bureau has grown so powerful that lawmakers are more fearful about being viewed as disloyal to this group than to their constituents.
The poultry industry, meanwhile, is panicking. 
They’ve been on notice now for at least two decades that their practice of spreading copious amounts of chicken poop across the Illinois River Watershed has been polluting the area that millions of people in two states rely on for drinking water and recreational purposes. The 100-mile Illinois River begins in the Ozarks in northwest Arkansas and runs through the mountains in eastern Oklahoma before dumping into Tenkiller Ferry Lake.
Former Democratic Attorney General Drew Edmondson first sued several large companies over 20 years ago to stop their contractors’ pollution and to press the companies to repair it. While there has been some movement to fix the issue, it’s been slow, and a judge has found it’s been insufficient to restore the contaminated ecosystem.
And the industry continues to spread poop. 
The case languished in court for decades, but now these bad environmental policies are coming home to roost thanks to a rare Republican leader: Attorney General Gentner Drummond, who refuses to let the industry get away with it.
Just before Christmas, federal Judge Gregory Frizzell, who was appointed by former Republican U.S. President George W. Bush, found several large poultry companies that have operated across the watershed responsible for polluting it. 
He ordered the companies to pay to fix it and to immediately put $10 million into a fund to begin. He also limited how much manure they can spread.
The companies, including Tyson, Cargill, George’s, Simmons, Cobb-Vantress, and Cal-Maine, have appealed.
In recent weeks, the debacle has revealed unsavory flavors of Oklahoma politics and the role that agriculture lobbyists still play in shaping our political outcomes, even as our state becomes increasingly urban and suburban.
At a Dec. 16 poultry industry rally backed by the Oklahoma Farm Bureau in Adair County, Republicans vied to be seen.
Speaker Hilbert told the crowd that the Oklahoma Legislature has proven to poultry producers that “we’re going to have your backs.” He said they’ve done that not just with words, but with actions. He celebrated a new law that limits the poultry industry’s liability.
What about having the backs of the rest of us who don’t have as much money or influence and that don’t work in agriculture?
Why aren’t our lawmakers passing legislation that makes sure that we all have clean water, unpolluted lands and stringent environmental protections? Why do the interests of a minority of agriculture producers outweigh everyone else’s?
Stitt, meanwhile, told the industry that he’s standing with them. Bizarrely, he’s convinced that this is an issue of trial attorneys trying to get rich.
He told the crowd that he fired his previous secretary of energy and environment because he refused to write Judge Frizzell a letter stating that Oklahoma is not “trying to go after your (poultry) industry” and instead attended a court hearing supporting the litigation.
One would think that it’s good that former secretary Ken McQueen chose to stand up for the average Joe.
“I fired him on the spot,” Stitt said to cheering and applause, adding that he appointed Jeff Starling to the post. 
Take note, Starling, who Stitt said also attended the rally, is running as a Republican for attorney general. I suspect we all know exactly what will happen to this lawsuit if Starling wins.
Stitt said he’s pushing for a “common sense settlement” that protects both the environment and food producers. He believes if spreading poultry waste is banned, nobody is going to want to grow chickens in Oklahoma.
The industry has had decades to sort this out and could have if they wanted. Clearly, they’re not willing to do so in a manner that best serves public interest. And we should not give away the farm to settle this, not when we have a group of lawmakers championing weak environmental protections that favor industry over people.
Maybe the better solution is for the industry to leave Oklahoma and spread their manure in another state if they won’t make things right. It’s not like we’re getting discounted eggs at the grocery store.
According to Stitt, former House Speaker Charles McCall was one of four 2026 Republican gubernatorial hopefuls that attended the rally. Chip Keating, Mike Mazzei and Jake Merrick were the others. Drummond, who is also running, did not attend.
McCall is particularly proud of his decision to champion Senate Bill 1424, which he said “protects growers from lawsuits when they follow environmental rules set by the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality.” 
What McCall omits is that the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality has the reputation of being an ankle-biting chihuahua, not an attack dog that passes regulations that clearly protect the public and environment.  If they did, we wouldn’t be here.
One can only hope our politicians won’t forget who actually elects them and who they’re supposed to be serving — people, not special interests.
But if this rally, candidate pool and pandering is any indication of what’s to come, don’t count on it.

Residents complain state board has inadequately addressed concerns. Then, Gov. Mark Gordon and Secretary of State Chuck Gray get into ugly spat.
The post Wyoming’s top officials promise to reckon with ever-increasing wind projects, other development appeared first on WyoFile .","For 2.5 hours Thursday, state officials heard testimony and emotional pleas from nearly two dozen residents throughout central and southeast Wyoming about a growing “wall” of wind turbines that critics say threatens to proliferate unchecked. 
The State Board of Land Commissioners, most speakers agreed, has fumbled its responsibility to effectively engage the public, has approved state land leases for various industrial projects that it sometimes regrets and generally failed to consider cumulative impacts critics say threaten private property, ranching and small communities.
“This is no longer a series of isolated projects,” Cheyenne area resident Wendy Volk said. “It is a continuous, or near continuous, industrial corridor stretching across multiple counties and landscapes.”
Niobrara County rancher Bobby Giesse was more direct.
“Why is it when 90% of the people are saying, ‘We don’t want this. [It threatens] things like the oil and gas industry. It’s against tourism. It is in direct conflict with agriculture.’ But yet it’s getting pushed down our throats and people aren’t listening. So the question is, why?”
The board, made of Wyoming’s top five elected officials, held the special meeting in Douglas — one of the hotbeds of existing and planned large energy projects, including the controversial Pronghorn H2 wind and hydrogen energy proposal. Board members empathized with residents’ frustrations.

“One of the complaints I’ve heard about this decision is that we aren’t willing to admit we made a mistake,” Auditor Kristi Racines said, referring to the board’s decision last year to grant state land leases to the Pronghorn H2 developer. “And so me, personally, I am here today to tell you that I apologize. I apologize for the mess that this has become.”
The board has sometimes whiffed on public notices, Racines added, and failed to give the public a proper platform to engage, including a December meeting that didn’t allow for a full discussion between the board and concerned residents. “I was horrified by the way that came out,” Racines said. “It was very unsatisfying to everyone there.”
Though wind energy stood at the center of the discussion, residents and local officials alike referenced myriad new energy projects, as well as what appears to be a wave of data center proposals. Combined, the tsunami of industrial ventures threatens viewsheds, tourism, agriculture and scarce water resources without a cohesive government venue to deal with either specific projects or bigger picture impacts.
“My request today is very simple,” Cheyenne area resident Niffy McNiff Bube told the board. “Please slow down, take a broader view and fully consider cumulative impacts when evaluating, when leasing on state-trust lands, especially in the areas where development is forming continuous corridors.”

Though public testimony was emotional at times, the decorum of the hearing went smoothly — until a spat erupted between board members Gov. Mark Gordon and Secretary of State Chuck Gray. The two have frequently sparred in public forums.
While hashing out procedural matters at the end of the hearing, Gordon accused Gray of casting aspersions against Attorney General Keith Kautz, who was not at the meeting. Gray denied doing so, and things quickly escalated.
“Step outside,” Gordon said to Gray. “Do you want to step outside?”
“Are you threatening me?” Gray responded while seated next to the governor.
“No, I’m asking if you want to step outside?” Gordon said.
“Are you threatening me?” Gray said again.
The bickering de-escalated from there, with Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder commenting, “This has been very unproductive the last couple of minutes. I’d like to get us back on track.”
Asked for an explanation regarding the governor’s remarks, Gordon Communications Director Amy Edmonds told WyoFile, “The governor just wanted to sort of cleanse the palate. Step outside, have a conversation. And really, it was asking the secretary, ‘Do you need to go outside?'”
State board’s role
The Office of State Lands and Investments, which includes the State Board of Land Commissioners, has come under increasing public pressure for its outsized role in determining the viability of energy and mining projects.
“Please slow down, take a broader view and fully consider cumulative impacts when evaluating, when leasing on state-trust lands, especially in the areas where development is forming continuous corridors.”Niffy McNiff Bube
The agency administers more than 3 million acres of school trust lands scattered throughout every county in the state. Because of that scattered pattern, energy and mining projects — if their footprint is large enough — commonly include state-owned lands, or “school sections.” If a developer acquires a state land lease, it makes their project seem much more viable to investors and other permitting agencies, several concerned residents asserted.
Some argued Thursday that developers even seek out state land leases as a fulcrum to gain leverage over neighboring landowners.
There can also be an inherent conflict between the agency’s fiduciary duty to utilize state school sections to maximize revenue for K-12 schools via mining and oil development and other, less lucrative uses, such as recreation and grazing. Sometimes priorities differ between the state and a county’s land use plan. A recent example is the dispute over a proposed gravel mining operation at the base of Casper Mountain — an ongoing episode that began with the board of commissioners approving mining leases without reviewing the applications or consulting with locals.
Responding to a rancher’s criticism of a singular focus on maximizing revenues from school sections, Treasurer Curt Meier offered empathy, but no apologies.
“I’m going to continue to live up to my constitutional duties” as a state board of land commissioner, Meier said. “I can’t do anything less. I understand the situation that you guys are in. You’re impacted.”
Still, residents said they feel like the state is failing them.

“Our regulatory framework, designed decades ago, was not intended to address development at this scale or concentration,” Volk said. “Evaluating projects one-by-one while ignoring what surrounds them creates blind spots large enough to affect entire landscapes, surface lessees and communities. Wyoming deserves better than a piecemeal process for decisions of this magnitude.”
More recently, the board has been in hot water with residents living between Glenrock and Douglas, who are frustrated that Colorado-based Focus Clean Energy, the Pronghorn H2 developer, received leases despite widespread opposition. A rancher challenged the state leases — spanning some 15,500 acres in total — in district court and won, resulting in an order to repeal the leases.
Gordon earned the ire of Secretary Gray — who voted against granting the leases — when Attorney General Kautz appealed the decision to the Wyoming Supreme Court. Gordon and Kautz have said the primary reason for the appeal was that the lower court’s ruling appears to redefine leasing language in a way that might open the state to much broader challenges.

Gordon also surmised on Thursday that other board members might want the attorney general to withdraw his appeal to the state’s high court and voluntarily rescind the Pronghorn H2 state leases. In response to a motion by Gray to do just that, Gordon noted that the board had not provided public notice for such actions and declared the motion “out of order.”
Potential solutions
Several board members appeared to concede that the agency’s narrow focus, combined with a bureaucracy of siloed institutions at the local, state and federal levels, has proven inadequate to meet the challenge of orchestrating development guided by cultural and land values.
Gordon, during the meeting, likened such deficiencies to criticism during the coalbed methane gas boom of the 2000s. He issued a statement after the meeting, noting “Wyoming has spent decades finding the ‘sweet spot’ — from the coalbed methane fields to today’s discussion on wind. 
“The broad takeaway is these are issues Wyoming has been struggling with for decades and those of us who are constitutionally entrusted with the responsibility of these lands by the people have grappled with similar issues over time,” he continued. “Getting to the perfect solution for everyone may not be possible but it’s clear everyone is working toward getting as close to that outcome as possible.” 
One potential tool, Gordon suggested during the meeting, is to “repurpose” the rare or very uncommon provision in the Wyoming Environmental Quality Act — a tool that has been mostly neutered by the Legislature, he said.
“It allowed for a nomination to be done that could set aside portions of state land,” Gordon said while addressing Glenrock Republican Rep. Kevin Campbell. “I have been trying for at least four years to repurpose that provision so that citizens like these could say, ‘This is a very special part of Wyoming. This needs to be protected,’ which would then give this board more of an opportunity to say, ‘Here’s a reason why we shouldn’t be talking about fiduciary'” duties alone.
Campbell accepted an invitation from Gordon to take up such a measure in the Legislature.
Meantime, concerned residents pressed for a broader solution and perspective.
“I would like to emphasize that asking for cumulative corridor level review is not opposition to wind energy,” Volk told the board. “It is a request for responsible asset management. Wyoming’s trust lands are finite. Once they’re fragmented and industrialized at this scale, the loss of flexibility, productivity and landscape integrity cannot be undone.”

Rep. Bill Allemand's arrest for drunk driving calls voters' tolerance for transgression into question. We should consider deeply who we decide to trust with the routing numbers to the people’s bank account, writes guest columnist Susan Stubson.
The post With power over the people’s purse strings should come higher standards appeared first on WyoFile .","My friend Millie and I are running buddies. She’s smart, educated and thoughtful. She is also single and would love to have a companion to hang out with, settle down and raise a family. For now, our runs are populated with horror stories of creeps, cads and crazies that come across her radar. To her credit, she refuses to lower the bar and is committed to her search for the right one who can live up to her standards. That is yet to happen. We keep running.

Opinion

I wish our electorate would be as discerning as Millie when it comes to those we elect to hold the keys to our kingdom.
When Rep. Bill Allemand, R-Casper, was arrested last month and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, I scratched another tally mark in my ballooning list of “ways our leaders have failed us” chart.
It is not the arrest that raises concern. I’ll leave it up to Allemand to preserve his sterling reputation and contest the whys and ways, which landed him in the slammer. Allemand has not been convicted and rightly deserves his day in court to defend the allegations. To those of you who are busy dismantling the Rule of Law, remember you’ll hate it until you need it. In the meantime, let us bow our knee and thank the high holy Constitution, we are innocent until proven guilty. 
It is what followed, Allemand’s pitiful response to the allegations, which bothers me. Allemand could have taken the high road and issued a public statement, rife with sincerity and remorse, asking his constituents for grace as he looks forward to his day in court and an opportunity to address the allegations.
Rather, he took to the swampy trenches and refused to accept responsibility for his actions. Taking a page from the MAGA playlist, he turned the lens outward, attacking the arresting officer, who may have been unaware of the Big Deal he just pulled over, and who potentially saved lives in the process. 
Allemand argued his arrest was the result of his constitutional exercise of free speech and accused law enforcement of refusing to let him exercise his civil rights. I would have loved to have been a chaff of wheat on that county road to hear the maybe not-so lucid lawmaker expound on the virtues of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Dodge, divert, deflect. Repeat. Throw in a conspiracy theory or two and you have a premium toolbox for redirecting attention away from those responsible to any unsuspecting pawn within striking distance. 
Public servants and constituents are both human, imperfect, and capable of mistakes and lapses in judgment. Who among us has not fallen short? Would it have hurt him to appeal to our good graces? Consider how an acknowledgment of poor behavior and a promise to do better would have landed with his electorate. Could it have been any worse than publicly attacking another public servant who is in the business of protecting us from ourselves? 
Legislating is serious business and we expect serious lawmakers. Allemand is a member of the Joint Appropriations Committee. Membership on the JAC is a lofty perch, highly coveted, typically secured after years of listening, studying, and understanding the complexities of government, its agencies and revenue streams. This is the committee where the seasoned dogs are, the best and brightest, those with a wonky, nerdy knowledge of the state’s budget who sit on the committee only after doing their time of slow-grind legislating. 
Allemand has been in office since 2023. His legislative profile is silent as to his occupation, ditto for his education and professional background. There is no showing of civic organizations with which he is involved. He is part of a ranching operation listed as inactive on the Secretary of State’s website. He runs, by his own account, an unnamed trucking company. He is a stranger to the business community, which props up our economy. His skill and expertise in representing his constituents is unclear. In this curious void, it is fair to judge Allemand by the content of his character. 
His fury and sputter, blaming everyone but himself, is a tell he cannot avoid. Is this a lawmaker we should trust with the routing numbers to the people’s bank account, which holds an estimated total investment of $33 billion?
This isn’t an Allemand problem, this is an us problem. Why do we settle for unexceptional folks, with undefined day jobs who hover on the banks of a civil society, to represent our interests? Is this the best we can do?
Wyoming’s long street runs both ways. By entering the public forum, legislators willingly submit themselves to the public microscope. In return, we too should honor and respect the office and model civility while at the same time holding them to a higher level of scrutiny. Rather than attack a wayward politician, pay attention and vote the bums out when they fail to live up to the task for which we elected them. 
Know thyself, Rep. Allemand. There is honor in stepping down, releasing your seat to someone better suited, better equipped for the noble yet arduous task of managing a state. 
Resign, Rep. Allemand. Do the right thing. Make America Honorable Again.

Wisconsin State Capitol on a snowy day. (Baylor Spears | Wisconsin Examiner)After WisconsinEye, the state’s version of C-Span, went off the air in December, Republican lawmakers rediscovered rules that bar members of the public from making video and audio recordings of committee hearings and decided to start enforcing them.
Wisconsin lawmakers, journalists and members of the public returned to the Capitol last week for a packed slate of committee hearings and executive sessions but for the first time in nearly 20 years, WisconsinEye was not broadcasting daily legislative proceedings.
A notice passed around Assembly committees listed two rules. Assembly rule 11, related to committee procedures, states that “insofar as applicable, the rules of the Assembly apply to the procedures of standing committees and special committees.”
Assembly rule 26, which relates to members of the public observing from visitor galleries in the Assembly chambers, states that they “may not use any audio or video device to record, photograph, film, videotape, or in any way depict the proceedings on or about the Assembly floor.” 
Senate rule 11 also states that “no persons other than members of the chief clerk’s staff, members of the staff of the sergeant at arms, members of a senator’s staff, and accredited correspondents of the news media may engage in any audio or video recording of the proceedings of the Senate or any committee without permission of the committee on Senate organization.” According to the Senate Chief Clerk Cyrus Anderson, the rule was first adopted in 2005. 
Wisconsin’s open meetings law expressly states that governmental bodies “shall make a reasonable effort to accommodate any person desiring to record, film or photograph the meeting,” but the law includes a provision that says that “no provision of this subchapter which conflicts with a rule of the senate or assembly or joint rule of the legislature shall apply to a meeting conducted in compliance with such rule.”
Rep. Jerry O’Connor (R-Fond Du Lac) told the Wisconsin Examiner that the rules were reviewed in caucus at the start of the year.
“Many of [the members], like me, I didn’t know there was a rule,” O’Connor said. “So it was a reminder.” 
Rep. David Steffen (R-Howard), who has served in the Assembly since 2015, said he couldn’t remember looking at the rule in the last decade. 
“How many times have I just kind of breezed past it? I guess I never really thought of it, primarily because I’ve always had WisconsinEye to rely on to assist with that coverage, as well as present media and in-person public,” Steffen said. 
Steffen said lawmakers, seeking to understand their options in the absences of WisconsinEye, looked over the Assembly rules.
“One of the things that immediately became apparent is that under our Assembly rules, we already have some things that are readily available — for example, credentialed media — but we also have things that have always been prohibited,” Steffen said. “It remains the rule of the day, so this isn’t a new rule… In terms of the enforcement, I think it’s more of an awareness campaign than anything.”
The rule enforcement caused some confusion throughout last week.
Notices related to the rules were passed around and posted outside committee rooms. Committee chairs issued directions at the start of meetings. Reporters in committees were asked to show their credentials as they set up cameras and stood to take photos, and others, including staff members and members of the public without credentials, were stopped from doing so.
Rep. Clinton Anderson (D-Beloit), seeking to help fill the gap left by the absence of WisconsinEye, livestreamed on Facebook the meeting of the Assembly Local Government Committee on Wednesday, writing that “we have to step up and do what we can.” Anderson said on Thursday that he sought to do the same in the Assembly Agriculture Committee but was stopped from doing so as Rep. Travis Tranel (R-Cuba City) reminded the room of the rules related to recording.
“We’re now hearing that this will become standard practice across committees. If that’s the direction Republican leadership is heading, it represents a clear move to restrict public access,” Anderson said in a statement. “After WisconsinEye went dark, the response should have been to expand transparency, not quietly close another door on the public. I am disappointed to see the Assembly GOP go after the public’s First Amendment rights.”
Testimony from two Republican lawmakers on a bill to exempt overtime from income taxes was interrupted during an Assembly Ways and Means committee meeting on Thursday afternoon by  a point of order relating to video recording.
“I don’t have a problem, video all you want,” said Rep. Mike Bare (D-Verona), the committee’s ranking member, to someone who was holding up a cellphone “You’ve got nothing to hide. These guys have nothing to hide, but if we’re going to have a rule…”
“I know that there was staff taking a photo, yes, and I gotta challenge that if you’re videoing… if you’re doing a video that you’re not allowed in the committee area,” O’Connor said. 
O’Connor told the Examiner after the meeting that he is fine with photos being taken in his committee and he believes committee chairs can use their discretion on whether to allow photos. He said video is different because of  its potential use for political purposes.
“If it’s staff taking photos of their rep, I don’t have a big problem of it,” O’Connor said. “You could have somebody, an outsider, come and testify, and their best friend is sitting in this seat and wants to take a picture, that’s not the issue.”
“Trying to capture video, quite frankly, it gets down to it can be used politically,” he added. “So WisconsinEye tapes this, you cannot use a WisconsinEye clip in political campaigns. That’s why the rules originated, and I get that… I don’t want either side to violate that or benefit from it adversely.”
Bare said he wanted to ensure that the rules were being applied evenly if they were going to be enforced. 
“We have a long, rich tradition in Wisconsin of open government, open access to government, and we shouldn’t have be limiting that access to members of the public to staff to members and to the media in any way,” Bare said, adding that the enforcement of the rules is “clearly a response to WisconsinEye being offline, being dark, which seems like a preventable problem.”
“There’s plenty of states in the country who provide funding for broadcasting… We shouldn’t be in the situation where we members or our staff have to livestream onto social media,” Bare said. “We’ve got decades now of precedent of these things being broadcast out to the public.”
WisconsinEye halted its coverage in December due to a lack of funding after failing to raise sufficient funds to meet a matching requirement for the release of $10 million in state funds.  WisconsinEye leadership has been in discussions with lawmakers about a potential solution, including releasing part of the  $10 million that is intended to build an endowment.
“We’re only going to be in session for maybe eight to 10 more weeks, and if we’re unable to get WisconsinEye back up and running in that timeframe, I’m hopeful the public isn’t going to be impacted any more than they already have been,” Steffen said. 
Bill Lueders, president of the Wisconsin Freedom of Information Council, told the Examiner that the enforcement of the rule is a bad idea.
“Regardless of the law, denying the public the ability to record and film legislative meetings, especially in the absence of a functioning WisconsinEye, is deeply undemocratic and, in my opinion, foolhardy. Nothing that goes on in these meetings is anywhere near as insidious as what people will assume is happening if the ability to film and record it is being curtailed,” Lueders said.
Lueders said the Wisconsin Freedom of Information Council (WFIC) doesn’t support anything that treats the media differently from ordinary citizens.
“Although they may legally be able to pass their own rule and enforce their own rule to deny people an opportunity, it doesn’t make it any less of a good idea,” Lueders said.  
Steffen said he would be open to having options for the public to record and photograph meetings as long as they are not obstructing the activity of a committee. “I think that this situation, this hopefully short-term downtime, has created an opportunity to discuss some of those rules that have been on the books for some time, and perhaps there’s some that need to be modified.”
In the meantime, Steffen said lawmakers are focused on finding a solution to make up for the loss of  WisconsinEye and options for the public are limited to attending in person and consuming coverage by journalists in the Capitol.
Steffen called on local reporters to “fill the gap” in a press release on Friday.
“All of them have the ability to record, maybe sometimes just audio, but they all have the ability to record a proceeding and put that on their website,” Steffen said. “That at least would provide some opportunity for transparency during this interim.”
Lueders said local media “absolutely does not have the resources to film as many legislative hearings and sessions as WisconsinEye was doing; it just doesn’t have that capacity. Cameras can come and show up for part of a hearing, but they’re not there filming entire meetings on a daily basis, and that’s not a function that can be replicated… It’s more important than ever that ordinary citizens who attend these meetings are able to film and record it.”

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)The political deliberations and deal-making within the marbled halls of the Idaho Capitol may seem far removed from everyday life, but the decisions made during the frenzied three-ish-month annual legislative session have real lasting impacts on Idahoans. 
Roads, schools, taxes, health care access, grocery assistance, libraries, and youth sports teams are all things that may be affected by state elected leaders. 
For those with perhaps a hazy memory of watching Schoolhouse Rock’s I’m Just a Bill, it may be intimidating to jump in to follow or get involved. But as the people who reside in the Gem State, the lawmakers are there to represent you. And, as Thomas Jefferson once said, “Whenever the people are well-informed, they can be trusted with their own government.”
For those new to the process, the following is designed to be a comprehensive guide to the Idaho Legislature. 
 How does a bill become law? 

On a basic level, the legislative process is pretty similar from state to state, and even at the federal level. However, Idaho has a unique introduction process for legislation. 
To help visualize a bill becoming law, Boise State Public Radio has this informative flow chart. 
What does it mean for a bill to be ‘introduced’? 
Lawmakers bring draft legislation, called a “routing slip,” or RS, to committees that will vote on whether to “print” the draft bill. If it’s printed, it officially becomes a bill with a bill number. 
After a bill is “printed” or “introduced” — these terms are used interchangeably — it’s eligible to come up later for a public hearing, during which people may testify in favor or against it.

If the term “RS,” is unfamiliar, you’re not alone. Idaho’s bill introduction process is unique among state legislatures, according to Jaclyn Kettler, a political science associate professor at Boise State University who researches state legislatures and teaches comparative state politics.  
“We actually have this additional stage, in some ways, that provides a little bit of extra gatekeeping,” Kettler said. “Which can be positive or negative.” 
She said lawmakers who want to be able to introduce more bills may find it frustrating if they can’t get a vote to print their bill, but the process also may weed out unpopular bills early on. 
She said Idaho has a higher bill passage rate than many states, even among other legislatures with large majorities of one party. 
“A lot of the items that are not going to have a chance of getting passed, don’t even get fully introduced as a bill,” she said. 
Some states constrain legislating by putting limits on how many bills individual lawmakers may introduce, Kettler said. Idaho does not have any limits, and the number of bills prepared has trended upward since 2020, according to the 2025 final progress report from the Legislative Services Office. 
In 2020, there were 830 pieces of proposed legislation prepared, and 559 bills introduced. In 2025, there were 1,036 draft bills prepared, and 708 bills introduced. 
An entire list of bills introduced during the session can be found online here on the Legislature’s website. Past bills may be viewed by selecting a different year on the legislative session dropdown menu. 
If a bill was introduced in a Senate committee, it will go to the Senate floor for “first reading,” which is exactly what it sounds like. If it was in a House committee, it goes to the House floor. 
Bills in first reading are read by the clerks; usually it’s just the bill number and title read, unless a member requests that the text be read in full, which does happen – but rarely – as it is time-consuming. Once read and assigned a bill number, the chamber leader, either the House speaker or lieutenant governor in the Senate, sends the bill to a committee where it may come up for a hearing.

 What is the role of the committees and committee chairs? 

Before a bill may be debated by lawmakers on the floors of the House and Senate, it must advance out of committees, which are made up of a subset of lawmakers. 
The House has 14 “standing committees,” which meet regularly each session, as well as an Appropriations Committee, which meets jointly with the Senate Finance Committee. 
These standing committees include Agricultural Affairs, Business, Education, Health and Welfare, Revenue and Taxation, and Judiciary, Rules and Administration. 
The Senate has nine standing committees as well as its Finance Committee. 
House and Senate members meet together in the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, which writes budget bills for every state agency.
Typically, bills are considered in committees with a subject focus that most aligns with the content of the bill. However, legislative leaders have relatively broad discretion to decide which committee the bill goes through.   
When lawmakers or members of the public are upset that a bill goes through a committee with members perceived as friendlier to the bill, they may accuse legislative leaders and bill sponsors of “committee shopping.” 
During the 2024 election, Lewiston Republican Rep. Lori McCann told Idaho Education News that she thought leadership shopped around “school choice” bills that would allow state funds to go toward private K-12 tuition, after proposals failed to advance out of the House Education Committee and a school choice tax credit bill went to the House Revenue and Taxation Committee. 
Not every bill introduced gets a hearing. 
Idaho’s state government is somewhat unique in the amount of power committees have, said Kettler, the political science associate professor at Boise State University. Committee chairs have the authority to set meeting agendas and determine how the meetings will run. 
For example, some committee chairs will not allow remote testimony by video, but most will. 
During the 2023 session, two committee chairs prohibited testimony from those under the age of 18. House Judiciary and Rules Committee Chairman Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa, ended up changing the policy to allow testimony from minors under 18 if they had parental permission after a flood of concern about the policy, the Idaho Capital Sun reported.  
“Idaho is definitely one of those states with a strong committee chair and a powerful role for the committee,” Kettler said. “There are some state legislatures that require all bills to get a vote in committee, for example. That creates a very different dynamic compared to states like Idaho, where the committee chair has a lot more influence over what there’s going to be activity on.” 
Once a bill does come up for a public hearing, it will be posted on the committee agenda online and outside the committee room door on the bottom floor of the Idaho Capitol building. 
Most committee chairs limit testimony to two-to-three minutes. People may also email committee members with their thoughts on bills, and Idahoans can find contact information for legislators online. After the public testimony portion of the meeting ends, members take a vote. 
A committee member must make a motion on what to do with the bill before them, and that motion requires the majority vote of members to pass. There are a few options: 

Vote to send the bill to the full chamber for debate and vote, with a recommendation that it “do pass,” which moves the bill forward in the process. 
Hold the bill in committee, which is typically the death of the bill. 

Sometimes, members will ask to temporarily hold the bill for a vote on a later date if they want more time for deliberation.  


Send the bill to the full chamber for amendments. This is a special order of business during the House and Senate floor sessions, during which any member of the chamber may propose amendments to the bill, and the amendments are separately voted on by the whole body. 

In the House, this is called “General Orders” 
In the Senate this is called the 14th order. 
If amendments are proposed that are not approved by the primary bill sponsor, they are often called “hostile amendments.” 


Send the bill to the floor for a vote with “no recommendation.” Lawmakers don’t often use this option but will sometimes make a motion to do this if they are unsure if they approve of the bill but feel the issue warrants further debate by the entire chamber. 
According to the Idaho Legislature’s website, committees could also vote to send the bill to the full chamber for a vote but with a recommendation that it “do not pass.” This is seldom used. 

Once the bill goes to the floor, it will be put on the “second reading calendar.” Like the first reading, it will simply be read by name and title, which then makes it eligible for the “third reading.”

Bills on the third reading calendar are ones that are most likely to come up for a floor debate and vote. However, lawmakers frequently tinker with this list, asking for ones that aren’t ready for a vote to be held and bringing others that are ready up for a vote before they get to the top of the list. 
A House bill that went through a House committee and gets debated and voted on by the entire House, will, if approved, go through the same committee process in the Senate. 
If someone was interested in testifying on a bill and missed the first public hearing, they could get another chance when it comes up again on the other side of the Capitol rotunda.

 How do I get involved with a bill? What’s Idaho’s public hearing process like? 

If Idaho residents find there’s a topic or certain bill that affects them or involves a topic they care about, there are a few ways they can get involved with the legislative process. 
If a bill of interest has been introduced and assigned to a committee, it could come up at any time for a public hearing. Although nearly every other government entity in Idaho is bound to the Open Meetings Law, the Legislature is exempt from many of its requirements. This means there is no minimum time for notice required for hearings. Idaho is one of 21 states that exempts its legislature from open meetings laws, according to a 2020 analysis by professors from Notre Dame and The University of Virginia. 
All agendas can be found on the Legislature’s website legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/agenda by selecting Senate Committee Agendas, House Committee Agendas, or Joint Legislative Committees. Sometimes there is very little time between when the agenda is posted and when the hearing is scheduled to begin. 
“For me, as a lobbyist, that’s one of the last things I do before bed, is check the agendas,” said Randy Johnson, government relations director for the advocacy arm of the American Cancer Society, called the Cancer Action Network. “The hard part, though, is for community involvement … what I fear and what I dread are those, the night before I see it posted at 8 p.m. and the hearing is at 8 a.m.”

Johnson said the quick turnaround can be difficult to give enough notice for volunteers interested in testifying to be able to show up. 
The conservative think tank Mountain States Policy Center has advocated for the Idaho Legislature to require three-day notice for public hearings. Policy Center Vice President and Director of Research Jason Mercier in a commentary column for the Idaho Capital Sun noted that some of Idaho’s neighbors have minimum notice requirements — Washington largely requires five days, Montana has a three-day notice requirement, and Wyoming has a one-day minimum notice requirement.  
The speed at which a bill can go through the process sometimes may pick up toward the end of session, which is usually toward the end of March or early April. 
At the end of the 2025 session, lawmakers introduced a bill to allow the sale of over-the-counter ivermectin, had two public hearings, held a House and Senate debate and votes, and sent the bill to the governor for signature all in one day. To expedite the process, lawmakers have to waive some of their own rules. 
Despite some of the challenges, Idahoans regularly weigh in on legislation that they care about. This can be done by emailing their districts’ lawmakers, testifying at a hearing, or getting involved with an advocacy organization that’s working on the issue. 
 I’m ready to get involved, now what? 

Here are some ways to make your voice heard: 
To sign up to testify for a specific committee, navigate to that committee’s webpage, and click on the “testimony registration (remote and in person)” tab at the top.

To watch a hearing, viewers may access the live stream from Idaho Public Television’s In Session website, and navigate to the room where the meeting is happening. Or viewers can clink the link at the top of committee agendas online. 
To find out the legislators who represent your district, and to find their contact information, go to the Legislative Services Office’s website and put in your home address and ZIP code. Once you’ve entered that information, the three legislators – two House members and one senator – who represent your district will appear, and you can click on their headshots to find their email address and phone number.

Johnson, from the American Cancer Society advocacy group, and Boise State political science associate professor Jaclyn Kettler recommended that people try and find advocacy groups that focus on their area of interest.

If it’s health care, maybe the ACS Cancer Action Network, or Idaho Voices for Children.  Lobbyists with the Idaho Association of Commerce and Industry, or IACI, follow numerous business-related bills each session. 
The Idaho Republican Party and the Idaho Democratic Party follow many bills during the session and provide some updates and information to email subscribers. 
There are many other lobbying, industry or other special interest groups in Idaho who will notify members or subscribers when there’s movement on a bill of interest.

Lobbyists and special interest groups are frequent fliers in Idaho Capitol meeting rooms, but as lawmakers set policies that affect Idahoans’ everyday lives, Johnson said, it’s most important that they hear from those Idahoans. 
“I’ve talked to a lot of these lawmakers already. They know who I am,” Johnson said. “They already know about my talking point, I’m not going to convince them, for the most part, already going into those meetings, we know a lot.” 
“What we depend on to change those minds are people within their own districts. And that’s when having those storytellers, having that flood of people calling in, showing up, saying, ‘I want to testify to this,’ ‘this is so important to me and the community.”

 How is the state budget set? 

As a part-time Legislature, Idaho’s lawmakers convene for a roughly three-month session each year. Lawmakers’ sole constitutionally required task for the session is to approve a balanced budget, but this isn’t always a straightforward task. 
The state budget does more than keep the lights on, it determines public school funding, road and bridge maintenance projects, water infrastructure, university funding, public assistance programs, state parks maintenance, wildfire suppression, and so much more. 
 Step 1: Pick a revenue number 

To ensure the budget is “balanced,” budget-writers must determine how much revenue the state expects so that expenditures don’t exceed that number. Without the ability to peer into the future and see what happens, this revenue number amounts to an educated guess. 
The state fiscal year runs July 1 to June 30, so lawmakers in January must estimate how revenue will finish out the current fiscal year and the next fiscal year. 
There are a number of factors that can contribute to revenues coming in above or below projections, such as elevated or stalling sales tax revenue depending on people’s spending habits during the year. 
Income tax revenue may vary depending on worker and business earnings, and this number shifts depending on changes to the tax rate the Legislature enacts. The federal government can provide boosted or diminished funds for programs, depending on policy decisions made by Congress or the president, such as tariffs and federal tax code changes. Other economic factors can impact this number as well.
The Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee is a group of state House representatives and senators who are provided with a variety of  reports and projections from economists, university scholars, industry representatives, state budget staffers and others to recommend a feasible state revenue projection. 
After hearing the estimates and factors laid out by all these groups, the committee must vote on the number members believe will get the closest to reality. 
In 2025, committee members and presenters came up with fiscal year 2026 revenue projections that spanned from $5.5 billion from the Idaho Tax Commission up to an estimated $6.5 billion from House Majority Leader Rep. Jason Monks, R-Meridian. The governor’s budget staff predicted around $6.4 billion, while the mean of the committee members’ estimates came to $6 billion.
“Generally in forecasting, that’s how it goes. You see more variability if the projection’s farther away because there’s more things that can happen to change that projection,” Legislative Services Office budget staffer Hayley Kaae-Domgaard told committee members at their Jan. 9, 2025, meeting. 
Discussion at that meeting included a desire to have enough revenue to accomplish policy goals, such as an income tax cut, which the Legislature did. That year the state approved a $253 million income tax cut, the largest in state history.

Sen. Scott Grow, R-Eagle, who also chairs the state budget-writing committee, at the time expressed some concerns about the then-threat of tariffs, as Idaho is a strong trading partner with Canada, and the looming uncertainty of when the next recession would occur. 
One member expressed annoyance at the common practice of purposely estimating a low revenue to constrain spending and keep a higher number on the bottom line. Eagle Republican and House Assistant Majority Leader Josh Tanner argued that this results in agencies having to come back the next legislative session and ask for supplementals — a mid-fiscal-year budget request to cover costs incurred that could not be covered by what the agency was appropriated for that fiscal year. 
While the individual factors vary year to year, these are the types of considerations lawmakers must contend with each year to pick a revenue number. 
During that 2025 session, the revenue projection was just narrowly agreed on in a 10-8 vote by the committee. 
Is that the end of it, now the budget-writers can start setting budgets? 
Nope. 
The Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee can only make a recommendation. It’s up to the members of the powerful state budget writing committee, the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, called JFAC, to choose a number to work from. 
Historically, the budget-writers on JFAC have voted on and approved revenue projections early in the legislative session. But, because it’s politics, sometimes the politicking delays this process. 
In 2025, after failing to garner majority support for 59 days into the legislative session, JFAC adopted a revenue projection on March 5. By then, lawmakers had already approved the $253 million income tax cut. 
With all that deliberating, the projection must be pretty accurate, correct? Not always. 
As of December, Idaho’s state budget was projected to end the fiscal year on June 30 with a $40.3 million deficit. That estimated deficit shrunk from the previous months’ projection of $58.3 million more in expenditures than revenues. 
In 2022, amid an influx of federal COVID-19 pandemic assistance, Idaho boasted a record budget surplus of $1.5 billion.

 Step 2: Agency requests

Idaho’s government functions are run by its agencies, commissions and councils. To get a sense of what those agencies need, they submit detailed budget requests to the governor’s budget staff within the Division of Financial Management well ahead of the legislative session. 
The administrator of the Division of Financial Management then works with those agencies and with the governor to create the governor’s state budget proposal.

Gov. Brad Little, nor any other governor, cannot ultimately set the budget. But on the first day of the legislative session, he stands before the Legislature and unveils his properties and his budget proposal for the next fiscal year. 
The governor’s proposals and agency requests then go to budget writers on JFAC. 
Each budget gets its own hearing in a format that has changed over the last couple of years. As of 2024, budget hearings are reduced to a roughly 90-minute presentation from the legislative budget staffer assigned to work on that agency’s budget, and short remarks by the head of that agency at the end. In the past, legislators heard three-hour long presentations from the agency directors themselves as they detailed how they’d spent prior funding and their needs for the upcoming year. 
Unlike other committees, the public at large never has a chance to weigh in on these hearings. 
The budget hearing schedule can be found online here.
 JFAC work groups craft budgets

The joint budget-writing committee was formed in the Idaho Legislature in the late 1960s, and at the time, was fairly unique among other state processes, said Jaclyn Kettler, a political science associate professor at Boise State University who researches state legislatures and teaches comparative state politics.  
Some states have committees in each chamber produce their own budget proposals, and then must find a way to reconcile them to approve one budget. Other states, as well as Congress, also sometimes do large omnibus budget bills that include spending for every agency and program. 
Members of the Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee listen to a presentation at the Idaho State Capitol building in Boise on Jan. 11, 2023. (Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)
For the most part, Idaho passes a budget for each agency in separate bills. However, with the changes adopted in 2024, the committee has since undergone a “maintenance” budget process and “enhancement process.” 
“Maintenance budgets” include the funding for agencies that has already been approved by the Legislature, but no new spending. These budgets are passed in around 10 omnibus bills that combine agencies under general topics such as public safety, general government or economic development. The committee votes on the 10 budgets all at once early in the legislative session. 
Then, new spending requests are considered line-by-line for each agency. To work on these requests and determine proposed budgets for each agency, JFAC is split into working groups for different agencies. 
Which lawmaker serves on which working group is not typically publicly shared, and the groups’ work is all done behind closed doors. 
Sometimes members who work on the agency disagree on how to set a budget. 
When it comes time to vote, members bring prepared motions to set how much state funding the agency gets as well as the authority to spend any federal money that agency may receive.
There is typically a motion made for one budget and a “substitute motion” made if there’s a competing budget proposal. If there’s a third proposal, a lawmaker can make an “amended substitute motion.” After that, there can be no further motions on an individual budget. 
The committee votes on the most recently made motion first. For instance, if there was an amended substitute motion to spend $1,000 of general funds on ice cream for the Idaho Ice Cream Commission (a fictitious agency example), that would be the first motion to get a vote. If the motion dies, the committee would move on to the substitute motion to spend $2,500 on ice cream. 
If that motion also fails, the committee moves on to the original motion of $1,200 on ice cream. If all three motions fail, the work groups must get back to work and bring something different for the committee to vote on again.  
Much of the focus of the state budget is on the state’s general fund, which consists of unobligated money that the state uses to pay many of its bills and to enact policies. 
For fiscal year 2025, the state’s total budget, using all sources, is about $13.9 billion. Federal and dedicated funds typically are earmarked for certain programs or projects. The state general fund budget was around $5.2 billion for fiscal year 2025. 
 JFAC members also approve ‘intent language’ 

Once the numbers for the budget are approved, the committee members will also vote on what’s called “intent language.” This language usually dictates how the money must be used or conditions for approval. Sometimes, it may require a report on how a certain grant was used, or clarifies that certain funds may only be used for a specified purpose. 
Intent language is part of the law, and agencies may face consequences for using the funds for other purposes. The committee has the authority to order an audit of use of funds if there’s suspected misuse. 
If the audit findings are serious enough, auditors may recommend referring the case to the state attorney general for criminal prosecution. Most times, the issues are resolved before legal proceedings are brought. 
 Approved budgets go to House and Senate floors 

Once budget numbers are approved by the committee, they go to legislative staffers to be drafted into a bill. This process can take a few days, after which the budgets would show up in the House or Senate floors calendars. It’s up to leadership to decide which chamber will hear the budget first. 
The bills must pass both chambers and go to the governor to be approved.

If the House or Senate votes down a bill, it goes back to JFAC budget writers who must get back with work groups to craft a new bill that will be more likely to pass. 
If a budget passes the Legislature, the governor may then veto it. If the governor vetoes an entire budget, it’s likely that JFAC would have to take it back up. The governor also has the option to do a “line item veto,” only striking one section of the bill. 
Little has used this line-item veto power one time, and it was to strike out a section of his own office’s budget that would have eliminated his emergency fund.

 Once the budget’s passed and signed into law — that’s it. Sine Die. 

Once every agency budget has been approved by both chambers of the Legislature and signed by the governor, that’s it. 
However, some budget bills may sometimes be held on reading calendars as “hostages,” keeping lawmakers in session until preferred policy bills move forward. 
Once all the negotiating is complete and the policy bills that are going to move forward are approved, the hostages are released, and the chamber may vote on the bill. 
At the end of the session, which includes paperwork and some procedural moves that can sometimes delay the actual adjournment. The final adjournment of the session is called “Sine Die,” Latin for “without day,” which indicates that the work is done until next year. 
During the interim between sessions, there may be work groups and task forces and other interim committees, but the Legislature as a whole won’t meet again unless a special session is called. 
The governor may convene a special session for a specific purpose, and as of a 2022 voter-approved state constitutional amendment, the Legislature may call itself into special session with approval from 60% of each chamber’s members.

Steven Jackson, D-Shreveport (Photo by Allison Allsop/Louisiana Illuminator)The Louisiana Board of Ethics has declined to waive most of the nearly $10,000 in fines state Rep. Steven Jackson, D-Shreveport, faced for not submitting his campaign finance and personal disclosure documents on time or properly. 

The board voted to reduce Jackson’s fines by $3,000 at his request, but he has a remaining fee balance of $6,720 to pay. 
The full reduction was also contingent on Jackson submitting some missing personal financial disclosure paperwork from 2023 by midnight Friday. Otherwise, the board said it would reinstate another $1,500 in penalties, for $8,220 in total. 
Jackson accrued the fees after he filed four ethics and campaign finance reports late and failed to file one at all. He also did not correct two reports the ethics board flagged for mismatching campaign account balances, which resulted in extra penalties. 

All but one of these reports was related to Jackson’s campaign for Louisiana House of Representatives in 2023. He also ran up thousands of dollars in fines previously when he ran for and served in Caddo Parish government. 
By his own estimate, Jackson had already paid $10,000 to $15,000 in penalties for missing deadlines for 15 old campaign finance reports, not including those before the board Friday.
“What I will tell you is none of what you see is intentional,” Jackson told board members.

Campaign finance reports and personal financial disclosure paperwork are the primary way the public knows who donates to a political campaign and what conflict officials might have. Hundreds of candidates, elected officials and public employees are required to file them each year. 
As a state legislator, Jackson told the board he now has better systems in place to make sure his campaign finance and personal finance disclosure forms are filed on time. 
“Now that I’m in the legislature, we have staff that comes around that reminds us. I have a staff person in my office that has a calendar set,” Jackson said. “I am now able to pay a CPA to remind me. So I get three reminders now to submit my personal financial disclosure or to file for that extension if needed.” 
Ethics board members were reluctant to reduce Jackson’s fines further because of his poor track record meeting past deadlines. 
“You have a history going way back of late filings, and you paid a fine numerous times. And that’s not setting a great example for your citizens, your constituents,” said board member John Crigler, a retired judge from St. Joseph. 
Jackson responded by saying he tried to take responsibility for missing those deadlines by paying large penalties in the past. 
“That’s me taking ownership in my part, in my role and my responsibility in that,” he responded.  

Yet when Jackson had paid ethics fines in the past, his hand has often been forced to do so. 

The ethics board filed a short-lived lawsuit in August 2019 to block Jackson from qualifying to run for his second term on the Caddo Parish Commission over $3,600 in late fees for his 2015 race. State law requires candidates for public office to pay their penalties in full before they enter a new election cycle. The suit was withdrawn a day later after Jackson hastily met with the board and paid some of the fines he owed. 
Over a separate group of fines, the attorney general’s office in 2022 garnished more than $1,000 monthly from Jackson’s paychecks for three months. 
Jackson also pushed back with the board Friday on the newer fines that were under consideration. 

He said he had never received the board’s written warnings about one of them because his mail had been picked up by campaign volunteers from a shared post office box and never handed to him. Jackson now has a new mailbox he doesn’t share with others, he said. 

The board has also struggled to deliver late fee notices to Jackson via certified mail, which requires a recipient’s signature. Four attempts to send penalty notices to Jackson went unsigned from August 2024 to March 2025, according to information the ethics board staff provided.
Eventually, Ethics Administrator David Bordelon personally hand delivered Jackson’s most recent late notices directly to Jackson while the representative was at the State Capitol on April 23 for the 2025 legislative session. 
Jackson said he is always open to contact from the ethics board and its staff. 

“What I will tell you is that I always try to make myself available,” he said. 
Yet Jackson was given several months to correct problems on two campaign finance reports that would have reduced or eliminated some of his fines altogether and he didn’t, said Charles Reeves, an ethics board attorney. 
“We spoke to [Jackson’s] attorney multiple times, and she assured us that [a report change] was forthcoming, and when we reviewed the investigation report, it had not been amended,” Reeves told the board. 
One time, the ethics board staff reached Jackson by phone to talk about his inaccurate or late campaign finance reports, and Jackson said he could not talk because he was on his way to the gym. The state representative said he would call the staff back but never did, Reeves said. 
By the end of Friday’s hearing, Jackson appeared frustrated and confused over the ethics board not further reducing his fines. 
“I followed the staff’s recommendation, and I got here today only to find out that the recommendation that the staff gave me didn’t resolve the problem,” Jackson said. “I just want to be clear. What do I owe at this point and what is still outstanding?”
The board voted 10-0 to reduce two $2,500 fines by $1,500 each and 7-3 to keep the remaining five fines, totaling $4,720, the same.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/LaIllum-01-1024x681.jpg,,,2026-01-12 06:12:23.844289

Jan. 11, 2025. | Photo by Erick Diaz Veliz/Michigan AdvanceDozens of candles illuminated the Mill Pond in Brighton on Sunday evening in honor of Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother who was killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis during a morning raid on January 7th.
Around 100 people from Brighton and the surrounding area, holding anti-ICE signs and candles, gathered at the vigil to honor Good and to protest against ICE in an event organized by the Indivisible Livingston Group.
“We are gathered here this evening with a variety of emotions, but beginning with grief for what happened to Renee Good and for grief for what is happening in our country,” said Reverend Rudra Dundzila of Community Unitarian Universalists church.
The murder of Good, shot by an unmasked ICE agent identified by the Minnesota Star Tribune as Jonathan Ross, 43, during the confrontation, led thousands of demonstrators to take to the streets around the country to protest against the federal agents and their immigrant crackdown.

Multiple vigils, rallies, and protests have been held in Good’s honor across the country since her killing, including from coast to coast in Michigan.
“We pray for peace for our country and for finding ways of reconciliation and communication, and talking with each other. For the common good of all people that we live with in our country. This is what we invoke tonight in our vigil,” Dundzila finished.
The video of Good’s death went viral worldwide in a matter of hours, generating polarized opinions. Kelly Lovelady, 58, who has lived in Brighton for almost 30 years, says she watched the video repeatedly and disagrees with the federal government’s “gaslighting” statements about the situation.
Republican officials from the president on down were quick to defend Ross, claiming he fired in self-defense and standing with ICE. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem mentioned that the officer acted based on how he was trained to act in situations like that and described Good as a “domestic terrorist.” In a Truth Social post, President Donald Trump called protesters “professional agitators” and blamed the “radical left movement of violence and hate.”

“We’re supposed to be allowed to protest in the United States, and we are supposed to have constitutional rights that are being trampled on right now. And if we allow this to stop us from coming out, they win, and we lose, and we lose more than what is there today. We lose the future for our kids that we had when we were growing up,” Lovelady added.
Some attendees chose to march along a section of the small lake with their candles and signs in hand. Carrying an inverted flag, Simon Ren, 67, said that attending the vigil is a duty.
“Being a citizen comes with responsibilities, not just privileges,” Ren said.
Since Good’s death, politicians in Michigan have been no exception to the polarization of opinions, with Democrats condemning the shooting and Republicans defending Ross. However, for Richard Gienapp, a member of the Indivisible Livingston Group, there are many mixed emotions among the people.
“I know there’s a range of emotions that bring people here tonight, and we really want to acknowledge those emotions. Whether it’s anger, outrage, sadness, grief, or frustration,” Gienapp says.
Protests demand accountability
Amidst the various vigils to honor Good, there were also numerous protests focusing on the actions of ICE, specifically in regard to her death, but more generally opposed to the Trump administration’s use of the agency to disregard constitutional rights and carry out its mass deportation agenda.
They ranged from larger gatherings in Detroit and Grand Rapids, to smaller communities across Michigan. On Saturday, dozens of protestors gathered in Howell for an event organized locally by Stand Against Extremism Livingston County.
Among those attending the rally was Mariah McDonald of Brighton, a mother who said she has been attending protests regularly and felt compelled to speak out after Good’s death.
“I’m here to show my support for people in the United States and for immigrants,” McDonald said. “They make America great. I want to raise my kids in a country that accepts all and loves all.”

McDonald said she has not been surprised by the polarized response to video of the shooting circulating online, noting that even among friends, there are starkly different interpretations of what happened.
“It’s frustrating,” she said. “Some people believe one narrative without looking at the bigger picture. I just wish people would be more open-minded.”
She also expressed skepticism that Good’s death alone would lead to meaningful change, pointing to past moments of national outrage that failed to result in lasting reforms.
“How many times have we said, ‘This is going to be the spark?’” McDonald said. “George Floyd was supposed to be the spark. Kids being zip-tied was supposed to be the spark. It only changes if we keep showing up and saying this is not OK.”

Curtis Hamilton of Howell said he attended the vigil not only to mourn Good, but to speak out against what he sees as an alarming political trajectory.
“This is a vigil for that woman who was killed in Minneapolis, but it’s more than that,” Hamilton said. “When you look at all the people who have died in ICE custody, too many people are asleep to what’s going on.”
Hamilton, who described himself as a student of history, compared current trends to those seen in authoritarian movements abroad.
“This is the same playbook that Mussolini and Hitler went through, the same playbook used by authoritarians in Hungary and elsewhere,” he said. “We’re living through it right now.”

The annual speech, which is roughly the Idaho’ equivalent of the State of the Union address, is scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. Mountain time at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise. 
There are multiple ways to watch the speech and stay engaged with state government during the 2026 legislative session. 
The speech will be streamed live online, for free, via the Idaho in Session service and clicking on the “House stream” feed. After the speech ends, the streaming video will be available in the Idaho in Session digital media archives. 
Additionally, free public seating (which usually fills up well before the speech begins) is available in the public seating gallery above the House Chambers at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise.
The State of the State address is always a closely-watched speech in Idaho government and political circles because it gives the governor a very public forum to lay out policy goals for the year, present budget recommendations, highlight certain programs or initiatives and provide an overall assessment of the “state” of Idaho. 
 Idaho Legislature’s committee meetings, floor sessions to again be streamed online

Once again, the Idaho in Session service will livestream all of the Idaho Legislature’s committee meetings and floor sessions each day during the 2026 session. 
The Idaho Legislature’s website is updated daily with the committee agendas and floor calendars that indicate what the Idaho Legislature is working on and voting on each day.

 Idaho Agriculture Day is Tuesday at the Idaho State Capitol

State officials are inviting the public and elected officials to connect with farmers and members of the state’s agriculture industry during Idaho Agriculture Day on Tuesday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise. 
Hosted by the Idaho State Department of Agriculture, the free event features food samples, interactive activities and information booths. Events are scheduled to run from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. on the second floor of the Statehouse. 
“(The Idaho State Department of Agriculture) invites attendees to engage directly with farmers, ranchers and commodity group representatives while sampling foods that showcase Idaho produced commodities and products,” state officials wrote in a press release issued Jan. 6.
“Idaho Agriculture Day serves as a platform for dialogue and connection offering state leaders and the public insight into how agriculture and food processing fuels our communities and contributes more than 26 billion dollars to Idaho’s economy,” officials added.
Several representatives from Idaho’s agriculture industry are scheduled to participate in the events, including officials from the Idaho Apple Commission, Idaho Barley Commission, Idaho Beef Commission, the Idaho Water Users Association, the Idaho Dairymen’s Association, the Idaho Wheat Commission, the Snake River Sugarbeet Growers Association and more.

The council also unanimously approved an increase of the utility’s impact fee for new customers, creating potential future revenue that could reduce the need to raise customer rates, according to the utility’s CEO, Jonathan Hardin.
The vote followed weeks of intense debate and input from residents of Columbia and surrounding cities that purchase water from the utility. Dozens of people packed the Columbia Council’s chambers Thursday night to speak ahead of the vote, with the majority asking council members to delay the decision and examine alternatives in hopes of finding a cheaper option.
Proposed Columbia water rate increase for new infrastructure clears first vote

Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation Water Resources Division Director April Grippo said other ideas that have been pitched would require additional study.
“We are not aware of another alternative that is as mature as Columbia Power and Water’s that would be available for the next several years,” she said during a council meeting on Tuesday.
Staff from Columbia Power and Water Systems and the state’s water division said the project, which has been under consideration for at least 10 years and has cleared state environment and wildlife oversight, is necessary to ensure continued water delivery as the region’s needs grow. Water systems are required by the state to plan for expansion when they meet 80% of their capacity, and the Columbia utility is at 93% capacity now, Grippo said.
Elected officials representing Maury County residents opposed the rate increase or advocated for city leaders to delay the vote and explore other options, including Maury County Mayor Sheila Butt, multiple Maury County commissioners, and State Rep. Scott Cepicky, a Culleoka Republican. 
Maury County residents living outside of Columbia city limits repeatedly said they felt disenfranchised by the rate approval process. Columbia Power and Water Systems is a city utility that sells water at wholesale rates to other nearby water systems serving a combined 35,000 customers in Maury County, Spring Hill and Mount Pleasant, but rate changes are approved solely by the Columbia City Council.
A few speakers, including Trent Ogilvie, who sat on the Columbia utility’s board in 2018, recalled the project was estimated to cost $225 million at the time, compared to more than $500 million eight years later.
“But yet, we say, let’s continue to wait,” he said.
Plans for the project have been publicly available on the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation’s website since 2021, and the state has hosted nine public meetings on the project since 2020.
Ward 1 Council member Carl McCullen initially voted against the proposal in December, but supported the measure on Thursday. McCullen recalled discussions about persistent and intensifying water supply issues stretching back decades.
Columbia considers water rate hike of up to 150% over next 5 years for new intake, treatment plant

“Water’s a problem. You can’t keep putting it off, and pause it … I think it’s time for us to do something about that,” McCullen said.
What this means for water bills
The new water rate schedule allows Columbia Power and Water to increase rates up to 20% each year, but Hardin and Columbia Vice Mayor Randy McBroom have referred to this cap as the “worst case scenario.”
The low-interest federal and state loans that will fund the project require stress tests that do not allow the utility to assume any new revenue will come from a growing customer base or new customer impact fees. 
All customers will see a 20% hike in their water bill in the first year, according to the utility, but Columbia Power and Water expects increases in years three through five will be lower.
Annual cost of service studies will determine increases for each type of customer — including industrial customers, wholesale customers, and customers inside and outside of the city limits — for years two through five.
For an average monthly bill for 5,000 gallons for a Columbia Water and Power System customer inside city limits, a customer paying a $34.75 water bill might pay up to $86.47 by 2030, according to the utility. An average customer outside city limits may go from paying $45.25 for 5,000 gallons to as much as $112.60 by 2030. 
Multiple speakers at Thursday’s meeting said those higher rates will be detrimental to farmers, elderly residents, those on fixed incomes and households that are already struggling to keep up with bills. Several lamented that “past sins” and continued approval of new development without matching infrastructure are to blame.
“If you don’t have the resources, you can’t have the people here,” Joey Davenport said. “If I have an empty glass of water and I have a full glass of water, what does it matter if you can’t afford that full glass? It’s no different than the empty glass.”
Maury County Water System customers already pay higher rates than Columbia Water and Power customers, because the county utility buys its water from Columbia’s utility at wholesale prices and sells it to county customers after adding on additional costs. This particularly concerned farmers and those who live on rural land outside of the reach of the city’s utility. 
Jason Gilliam, a member of the Maury County Water System Board, said the extra cost for county water system customers has to do with economy of scale. Columbia has about 500 miles of pipe in the ground and about 27,000 customers, while Maury County Water System has 475 miles of pipe in the ground and serves 8,800. Gilliam, who also chairs the county’s Republican Party and leads a group advocating for the construction of a new dam in Columbia, also urged the council to vote against the raise.
“I’m not going to waste any more time discussing the enormous cost of the project or the detriment it would cost to so many people that live here — those who have spent their entire lives here, making this place what it is,” he said. “I want to remind you … of your role on the city council … you said that you wanted to serve your community.”
Molder, who voted against the increase, said “this is the right project at the wrong time,” and he could not justify a vote in favor due to concerns about skyrocketing costs of living.
Molder is also in the running to represent Tennessee’s fifth Congressional district, which covers portions of Maury, Davidson, Lewis, Marshall, Wilson and Williamson counties.
Columbia Power and Water will send out sample bills to each ratepayer so they know what to expect on their bills after March 1.
Project details
The higher impact fee and water rates will allow Columbia’s water utility to secure low-interest, long-term loans from the state and federal governments.The $520 million price tag includes all project costs, including design, construction and mitigation, according to Columbia Power and Water.
The new intake will be located downstream from the utility’s current intake at Riverside Drive. The new intake can withdraw up to 32 million gallons of water per day from the Duck River, 12 million gallons more than the current intake is permitted to withdraw.
Grippo said the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation would not approve raising the withdrawal cap at the Riverside Drive intake because water flow at that portion of the river is too low to sustain it. Flow is higher downstream.
The utility has already secured 63% of the land easements needed for the project, and anticipates it will hold 75% in the next two to three weeks, Hardin said.
Work on the intake and water treatment plant is slated to begin in Spring 2026 and conclude in summer 2029.

(File: NC Newsline)When a mental health crisis strikes a classroom in Hyde County Schools, a school psychologist does not walk down the hall.
There isn’t one.
Instead, administrators begin a series of phone calls to outside providers or neighboring districts. Then, they wait.
“We are provided those services by somebody that we call in, but that’s not always easy,” said Melanie Shaver, superintendent of Hyde County Schools. “They have a very set schedule. And when you do have a crisis, which you do, we really rely on other districts to help us out.”
Between the 2020–21 and mid-2024–25 school years, 14 North Carolina districts have operated without a staff psychologist, according to data provided by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction.
Districts contract with outside providers to meet legal requirements for special-education evaluations. But students still lack consistent access to a psychologist for ongoing mental health support, including preventive care.
In practice, students in crisis may sometimes wait hours or days for help.
School district leaders cite funding constraints and a statewide shortage of school psychologists, a problem that hits rural districts hardest, where many have no full-time staff and lack the resources to compete with larger, wealthier districts.
***
A 2025 School-Based Mental Health Plan report found that more than half of school leaders cited insufficient staffing as the biggest barrier to student safety. The report described mental health services in many districts as “reactive rather than systematic,” with schools responding to crises instead of preventing them.
School psychologists are the only school-based professionals trained to conduct legally required special-education evaluations while also providing preventive mental health services. They are part of a broader support network that includes counselors, social workers and nurses.
“When your only access to a school psychologist is someone who appears once a week or twice a month, you lose the preventative and consultative work they’re also trained to provide,” said Deirdre Martyn, president of the North Carolina School Psychology Association. “You’re only putting out fires.”
Most of the districts without psychologists are clustered in rural northeastern North Carolina, where high-poverty communities overlap with limited mental health infrastructure. Along with Hyde County, the districts include Cherokee, Gates, Granville, Hertford, Mitchell, Northampton, Warren and Washington counties, as well as the city systems in Hickory, Roanoke Rapids, Weldon, Clinton and Elkin.
National guidelines recommend one school psychologist for every 500 students. In North Carolina, the ratio is closer to one for every 1,928 students. Even in districts that have psychologists on staff, many are split across multiple schools.
Martyn said that was her experience working in a rural North Carolina county, where she rotated among three schools spread miles apart.
“On the days I was in a school building, my time was almost entirely consumed by legally required evaluations,” she said. “I would test five or six students and then leave to write reports on another day, which makes it very difficult to build relationships with students and families or to provide the comprehensive, preventative services schools need.”
“We are almost four times the recommended level,” said Michelle Ries, president and CEO of the North Carolina Institute of Medicine. “Regardless of whether a district has a psychologist or not, those we do have are overwhelmed.”
For North Carolinians aged 10 to 17, suicide is now the third-leading cause of death, Ries noted. “When you don’t have psychologists who are able to recognize early signs,” she said, “you put kids more at risk.”
***
The absence of psychologists creates ripple effects across schools, said Leigh Kokenes, who also represents NCSPA. Without psychologists to conduct behavior assessments or develop prevention plans, that work often falls to teachers and social workers who are already stretched thin, Kokenes said.
“In our rural communities across North Carolina, where many times there are no school psychologists in schools, the mental health needs of children remain untreated,” Kokenes said. “Triage occurs and the gaps are filled in the moment, but the root cause will not be resolved without comprehensive care over time.”
And without a specialist to guide intervention, discipline often becomes the default response, she said.
The 2025 state report found that staffing shortages have reduced schools’ ability to make referrals and provide consistent follow-up. When mental health teams are missing key members, students often lose continuity of care — the person who evaluates a child one week may not be there to follow up the next.
***
Patrick Miller, former superintendent of Greene County Schools, said his district went three years without a psychologist. “The person we worked with was excellent, but she served multiple districts,” Miller said. “We had to get in line. If something urgent came up, you were at the mercy of her schedule.”
Contracting was also more expensive, he said, and more limited. “You get assessments. You don’t get the full role. Kids don’t stop needing support because the contract hours are over.”
For Hyde County, that arrangement means relying on mobile crisis units for mental health emergencies, Shaver said, with responses typically arriving within the day. Students who need ongoing care are referred to outside agencies or primary care providers.
The district budgets about $80,000 a year for contracted psychological services, she said, and completes special education evaluations within the required 90-day window.
In Weldon City Schools, Superintendent Tammy Boone relies on partnerships that bring private providers onto campus daily. She described the arrangement as a stopgap until the district can secure funds for a full-time staffer.
Recruitment adds another challenge. Compared with larger, wealthier districts that can offer salary supplements to attract and retain talent, rural districts with smaller tax bases rely largely on grant funding, especially now that federal funding has expired.
“Sometimes it can be a challenge to attract people to this area, especially when there are so many other larger areas that border us,” Boone said.
A majority of districts surveyed in the 2025 state report cited inadequate funding as their primary issue.
***
Shaver said Hyde County faces the same hurdle. “We don’t have maybe some of the sign-on bonuses or supplements that other counties have that tend to help recruit,” Shaver said.
But that may soon change.
In the 2026-27 school year, the district expects to have a staff psychologist for the first time in years.
Kathryn Oneal Brown, a longtime special education teacher in Hyde County, decided to pursue the role herself. “It’s nice to have someone who really knows a student and can do a comprehensive evaluation … versus someone just coming in, giving a test, and then that’s their limited interaction with the student,” Brown said. “I think just, you know, better data.”
In 2023, she enrolled in a virtual graduate program through Eastern Washington University, driving to neighboring counties on Fridays for unpaid practicum work. “I wouldn’t have been able to do this if there was no virtual option,” Brown said.
State lawmakers are now trying to expand that pathway. During the 2025 legislative session, legislators introduced Senate Bill 259, a $20.4 million proposal that would provide monthly salary supplements for school psychologists and fund a virtual training program at Appalachian State University.
But the 2025 state report warns that without a shift toward sustained, recurring funding, any progress made by such initiatives could be short-lived.
Meantime, Boone’s district is seeking grant funding for a full-time school psychologist.
“Everything in North Carolina tends to be a funding issue,” said Boone.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/return-to-school.jpg,,,2026-01-12 06:12:23.844289

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)Nearly five years after West Virginia’s transgender athlete ban became law, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in a case to decide its future Tuesday. Becky Pepper-Jackson, a now 15-year-old Bridgeport, West Virginia, high school sophomore, is seeking to overturn West Virginia’s Save Women’s Sports Act, which former Gov. Jim Justice signed into law in 2021.
The law bars transgender athletes from competing on girls’ and women’s sports teams in public schools and colleges. It does not ban transgender males from competing on boys’ or men’s teams. 
Supreme Court justices are expected to decide whether West Virginia’s law violates Title IV, which prohibits discrimination based on sex in education programs and activities that receive federal financial assistance, and the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, which prohibits states from denying equal protection of the law to anyone within its jurisdiction.                                                                                                                                                                    
In a news release, West Virginia attorney general J.B. McCuskey called the case “monumental” not only for West Virginia, but for the entire country. The outcome of the case will impact the future of women’s sports, the promises of Title IX, and the safety of our daughters, he said in the news release.
“We are hopeful that the Supreme Court will uphold the Save Women’s Sports Act and agree with what West Virginia has been saying for years: biological sex matters in sports, and allowing males to compete against female athletes is unfair and dangerous,” McCuskey said in the news release.
Billy Wolfe, a spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia, which is representing Pepper-Jackson in the case, said the state’s transgender athlete ban is part of a broader national effort to target transgender people and use them as political cudgel. 
“There is, of course, no threat posed by Becky Pepper-Jackson to women in West Virginia sports,” Wolfe said. “We’re a state of 1.8 million people, and there is one single trans girl in this state who wants to play sports with her friends. She doesn’t represent a threat to the existence of women’s sports in any way. Sadly, all of this stuff is about politics.”
Speaking to reporters Thursday afternoon, McCuskey said it was “slightly disingenuous” to argue that the state’s transgender athlete ban affects only Pepper-Jackson. 
“It’s decidedly not about one person,” McCuskey said. “It’s about the totality of athletics in West Virginia.”
“We want to make sure that the playing fields are delineated by their biological sex,” he said. 
Along with Pepper-Jackson’s challenge, the Supreme Court on Tuesday will also hear arguments in Little v. Hecox, which challenges Idaho’s transgender athlete ban.
Dale Melchert, senior staff attorney for the Transgender Law Center, said the two cases are narrow and specific to the students who have filed the challenges, but decisions by the Supreme Court can have broad impacts. 
“At the end of the day, this is really about whether or not all students are able to receive the same benefits of education,” Melchert said. “Athletics are a key part of community life and educational life. They’re a place where young people get to learn about being on a team, building self confidence, learning leadership skills, or simply just playing and having fun. But bans like West Virginia’s and and Idaho’s, they’re blanket bans that make it impossible, regardless of the specifics of any individual trans girl, to play.”
In July 2021, US District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia issued a preliminary injunction allowing Pepper-Jackson to continue competing on the girls’ cross-country and track and field teams while the case moved forward. In 2023, the court ruled that the law is constitutional, dissolving the preliminary injunction and granting summary judgement for the state of West Virginia.
In 2023, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals granted Pepper-Jackson’s request to keep playing while the case was being appealed. In April 2024, the same court ruled in favor of Pepper-Jackson, reversing the Southern District’s decision. In the latter decision, the court ruled that the law violates transgender students’ rights under Title IX, a federal civil rights law prohibiting discrimination based on sex in education programs.
Wolfe said according to the ACLU’s count, Becky Pepper Jackson’s case is only the third case in recent history to have originated in West Virginia to go before the U.S. Supreme Court. In Barnett vs. the West Virginia Board of Education during World War II, the ACLU of West Virginia represented two Jehovah’s Witnesses students who successfully challenged a school requirement to recite the Pledge of Allegiance, which went against their religion. In 2022, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of West Virginia and other Republican-led states that sought to limit the federal Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to limit carbon emissions. 
The ACLU of West Virginia is chartering a bus to Washington, D.C. so that supporters of Pepper-Jackson can join a rally outside the U.S. Supreme Court as the case is being heard. The bus will pick up passengers in Charleston, Martinsburg and Morgantown.
Wolfe said the bus rides and rally can be a community-building exercise for people against legislation designed to make marginalized people feel like they’re all alone with a target on their back. 
“I think that these events tend to bring people together, remind them that they’re not alone, that there are people who are in this fight with them,” Wolfe said. “And so it makes for, I think, a very positive atmosphere. Even though we know that what we’re fighting for is very serious. It’s very harmful stuff that we’re pushing back against.”

Nancy Mace runs for governor, a whopping 14 candidates have announced bids to replace her in Congress, making the race for the coastal 1st District by far the most crowded among South Carolina’s 2026 elections for state or federal offices. 
The field breaks down to 10 Republicans and four Democrats. Five are military veterans. Many are first-time candidates: They include a mechanic, a waiter, and a Marine pardoned for his participation in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.


The 14 announced candidates
Republicans: Dan Brown, Jay Byars, Logan Cunningham, Tyler Dykes, Jack Ellison, Jenna Costa Honeycutt, Sam McCown, Justin Myers, Mark Smith, and Alex Pelbath
Democrats: Mac Deford, Max Diaz, Matt Fulmer, and Mayra Rivera-Vázquez


State Rep. Mark Smith of Daniel Island is the only legislator. Three other Republicans — Logan Cunningham, Jay Byars, and Jenny Costa Honeycutt — have elected experience as county councilmembers. One Democrat has political experience as a former county chair. Another Democrat ran for the seat unsuccessfully two years ago.  
On their websites and in conversations with the SC Daily Gazette, most Republican candidates put a heavy emphasis on border security and reducing the national debt. Some called for hardline policies to curtail immigration. 
Alex Pelbath, a retired lieutenant colonel in the Air Force who lives in Mount Pleasant, supports President Donald Trump’s effort to end birthright citizenship. Tyler Dykes of Bluffton, a Marine Corps veteran, told the SC Daily Gazette he’d like to ban or halt most immigration of any kind.
Byars and Cunningham highlight their desire to preserve the Lowcountry’s natural resources. 
Cunningham, who sits on Beaufort County Council, says on his campaign website that his top local priority is protecting the Lowcountry’s waterways and coastline. 
Byars, on Dorchester County Council, calls himself a “conservative conservationist.” He told the Gazette he wants to emulate Teddy Roosevelt, his favorite president, by protecting public land and national parks.

Many candidates are pitching voters on their non-polarizing style. 
“When the conversation becomes more about focusing on clickbait that’s going to generate some cheap donor ads, that’s where things really start going off the rails,” said Byars. “I tell people all the time: some of my best friends are left-leaning, left-thinking Democratic folks,” he said. “We can have a conversation, we can debate seriously, and then we can go grab a pizza and a beer afterwards.”
“Too many politicians chase headlines instead of fixing real problems, and that’s not who I am,” Honeycutt, a lawyer on Charleston County Council, began her statement to the Gazette.
 Republican Justin Myers, a Navy veteran who lives in Charleston and owns a moving business, has repeatedly called for unity across parties on his campaign Facebook account. Last month, he applauded California Gov. Gavin Newsom for praising Turning Points co-founder Charlie Kirk, who was killed last September while debating college students in Utah. 
The four Democrats include Mac Deford, a Coast Guard veteran and Charleston-area attorney who ran for the same seat in 2024 and lost his party’s primary by 3 percentage points. Mayra Rivera-Vázquez, whose parents are Puerto Rican, is a retired paralegal and former chair of the Beaufort County Democratic Party.

The other two Democrats are political newcomers. Their platforms include creating a single, government-provided health insurance system funded by taxpayers that covers all residents nationwide.
The 1st District had a Democratic congressman in not-too-distant memory: Joe Cunningham flipped the seat for a single term before Mace ousted him in 2020. 
After the 2020 census, the district was redrawn to favor Republicans. Mace won re-election in 2024 with over 58% of the vote against a Democratic challenger she barely acknowledged.
The SC Daily Gazette called each candidate that has filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission and reached 11 of the 14 candidates who publicly announced their bids. 
Immigration
Many Republicans cited mass immigration as one of the top issues they want to address in Congress.

In a statement to the Gazette, Pelbath said families were being “crushed” by both higher prices and open borders. His campaign website says he wants to solve those problems by deporting every immigrant not legally in the United States and bringing jobs home. 
Pelbath piloted the last American plane out of Kabul when American troops withdrew from Afghanistan, The Post and Courier reported. 
Dykes, a 27-year-old salesman, said in an interview that the rising cost of living and mass immigration were the “two biggest issues” impacting people in the Lowcountry area. He said he supports solving both problems through mass deportations and ending all work visas for noncitizens. 
Dykes pleaded guilty to assaulting law enforcement during the U.S. Capitol riot that followed the “Stop the Steal” rally five years ago.
The FBI arrested him in July 2023. He was sentenced a year later to 57 months in federal prison but was released after Trump pardoned him among more than 1,500 others convicted for their roles. He told the SC Daily Gazette he pleaded guilty just to get a deal but “never touched” an officer.

Deford, a Democrat, said he believed border security and immigration were among the top issues in the 1st district. He said he intercepted drug shipments and defended U.S. borders when he worked for the Coast Guard. Unlike most Republicans in the race, he criticized Trump’s immigration crackdown and the administration’s recent capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.  
“These things can all be true: Maduro is a thug. America must lead. And we cannot lead the free world by breaking our own laws and bypassing Congress,” Deford wrote on X.
Six of the Republican candidates have publicly praised or supported Trump’s capture of Maduro on social media.
Dykes appeared to take a different approach: He recently retweeted a 2019 post from Trump that reads “The Endless Wars Must End!”
Republican Jack Ellison of Charleston wrote on social media that Trump should have gotten congressional approval.

“Maduro is a criminal — the head of a corrupt regime that has trampled democracy, destroyed its economy, and driven millions to flee. That needs to be stated plainly,” wrote the Army veteran. “But how the United States responds matters. Any serious action — military, economic, or diplomatic — must have the support of Congress and the American people. Acting without that legitimacy weakens our position and our credibility abroad.”

Smith, who replaced Mace in the state House, was the first candidate to announce a bid to replace her in the U.S. House. 
His campaign launch video prominently featured Trump. In his video, Smith touted his support in the Legislature for state income tax cuts and a special immigration enforcement unit at the State Law Enforcement Division. The unit existed prior to his 2020 election to the House. In 2024, Smith voted for a law that moved it from the state Department of Public Safety to SLED.
“Mark Smith will join President Trump to bring us into a golden age,” Smith, the CEO of McAlister-Smith Funeral Homes, said in the video.
Cost of living 
Almost all candidates emphasized the rising cost of living as a problem they want to help solve.

Dan Brown, a Bluffton Republican who works at a Land Rover dealership, said he decided to run when he first saw his baby son’s ultrasound. 
“I just want him and everyone of his generation and the generations after that to grow up and live in an America that gives all the opportunities that I and my generation have had,” Brown said in an interview. 
He, Smith, and Honeycutt call for reducing the national debt and cutting government spending as a way to make life more affordable in the Lowcountry.

Charleston physician and businessman Dr. Sam McCown said in an interview that America was facing an “affordability crisis,” as he criticized the cost of health insurance. McCown encouraged the use of Health Savings Accounts, as a U.S. Senate GOP plan seeks to do, saying that will give consumers more choice.
He also said the health care industry is over-regulated and called for policies that would limit lawsuits and potential payouts. Doctors often order exams patients don’t need just to protect themselves from a potential lawsuit, he said, and that drives up cost.
Democrat Matt Fulmer, a Hilton Head waiter, advocated for getting rid of private insurance and transitioning to a system where everyone gets health insurance from the government. He told the Gazette he’s not dissuaded by advice that Democrat candidates in Republican-leaning districts should “not rock the boat” with their policy ideas.

Max Diaz works as a mechanic and lives in Hanahan. (Courtesy of Max Diaz’s campaign)
“I think that strategy is a lot more appealing when people are doing well,” Fulmer said. “When people are experiencing this level of economic pain, they are looking for big solutions.” 
Democrat Max Diaz, a 25-year-old Hanahan mechanic, told the Gazette he also wants a single, government-provided health insurance program. 
One issue has bipartisan appeal in the field: stopping large investment firms from buying up single-family homes.
Last Wednesday, Trump announced he wants to ban the practice.
Democrats Diaz and Fulmer, as well as Dykes, the pardoned Republican, like that idea. They advocate for proposals that would tax or stop investment companies from buying single-family homes or apartment complexes.

unanimously passed House Bill 4667 on Monday, March 4, 2024.

It now heads to the governor. (West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia state agencies — in charge of schools, road repairs, foster care and more — along with the state Supreme Court have been asked by the Morrisey administration to cut their budgets by 2%.
Additionally, an August memo from the Department of Revenue told agencies, “Additional state funding should not be requested to replace lost federal funding.”
Spending cuts under President Donald Trump are likely to impact states like West Virginia that are constitutionally-bound to balance their budgets. 
As West Virginia agencies prepare budget requests for the next fiscal year, the state is going to lose hundreds of millions of federal dollars for important programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program this year and in the coming years, making it one of the hardest hit states by federal funding cuts. 
West Virginia is the nation’s most federally-dependent state, meaning the state relies on federal dollars to operate critical programs. 
West Virginia “can’t just absorb all of the reductions or changes that may come from other places,” Gov. Patrick Morrisey told reporters Jan. 5. The governor has been focusing on weeding out “wasteful spending” in state government, issuing an executive order that asked agencies to review their spending to highlight inefficiencies. 
“We have to live within our means, and I’m working to make sure that there’s a continued period of strength where we’re managing our budget very, very carefully,” Morrisey said, adding that his administration would continue to invest in problems like too many foster children sent out of state.
The Morrissey administration did not provide an estimate of how much federal funding the state has lost in the last year.
Kelly Allen
Kelly Allen, executive director at the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, said there will be a significant impact on residents if the state doesn’t fill in the gaps left by lost federal dollars.
“I understand the pressure and probably the frustration that state lawmakers are under having all these federal costs shifted down onto the state budget,” Allen said. “If people don’t understand why services are suffering, then they’re going to blame the wrong people, like the people in that agency, rather than people actually understanding it’s all of these federal cuts.”
A December report from the center said, “West Virginia’s revenue and economic numbers signal concerns for the FY 2027 budget and the state’s ability to invest in programs proven to help families and workers thrive,” noting several years of lawmakers’ passing skinny budgets.
Along with the agency budget reductions, Morrisey called for cuts to the state’s personal income tax, and the Republican-led Legislature will have to approve his plan. Morrisey said the state could “deliver meaningful tax relief without sacrificing essential services” due to his administration’s work on agency budgets in the past year.

West Virginia will lose millions of federal dollars for Medicaid, SNAP
Federal budget slashes are expected to heavily impact the West Virginia Department of Human Services, which oversees the state’s SNAP and Medicaid programs along with other emergency aid programs and foster care. 
KFF estimated that West Virginia will lose up to $1 billion per year in health care funding due to changes to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act once it’s fully phased in.
DoHS is likely to take on an additional $18 million a year in new SNAP administration costs as a result of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Allen noted.
“If the state does not step up and fill in that gap, we could see people who rely on SNAP having more trouble accessing customer service or getting help when they need it,” she said.
“The West Virginia Department of Human Services is currently in the process of outlining its FY 2027 budget; however, this process is deliberative, and any program changes will not be communicated until the release of the governor’s budget in January,” said DoHS spokesperson Angelica Hightower. Morrisey will deliver his budget proposal to lawmakers at the start of the legislative session this week in Charleston. 
“All departments are being asked to identify efficiencies in an effort to save taxpayer dollars and ensure we’re addressing the state’s long-term structural budget challenges,” Hightower continued. “The state is not in a position to absorb the significant amount of spending from the federal government, although it will look to make strategic investments where they can be beneficial to our citizens.”
Gailyn Markham, director of communications for the state Health Department, said the agency, which contains public health programs and the Office of Emergency Services, also said any program changes due to budgeting wouldn’t be communicated until Morrisey releases his budget proposal.
Markham emailed the same statement as Hightower.

Education department sees $12M loss in federal funding  
The West Virginia Department of Education saw a more than $12 million reduction in federal funding for the current fiscal year, receiving around $127 million for this year.
“As for [fiscal year 2027], we haven’t heard anything about when we can expect preliminary allocations from [United States Department of Education],” said Elizabeth Younis, manager of the state’s education department’s Office of Elementary and Secondary Education Act, Improvement and Support. 
“I do know that as our enrollment decreases our percentage of the funding will decrease,” she said.
State funding has also decreased for schools as the student population in West Virginia is tied to the state-level funding amount. More than 70 public schools have closed across West Virginia since 2019, and more school closures and consolidations have been proposed this year. 
The education department has submitted flat budget requests for at least the past five years, Younis said. 
“If funds aren’t sufficient, then the program would either look to find ways to operate more efficiently to provide the same level of services or would have to reduce services provided,” Younis said. “As costs have increased over that period, then these programs are shrinking as a result of the inflationary effects which does make it an issue.”
Younis said local education agencies have reserved some previous funding in expectation of the possibility of funding cuts to help continue services for students.  
“LEAs are having more conversations about next year and how to operate within decreased budgets,” she said.
Courts communicating funding needs to Legislature
West Virginia courts receive federal dollars to support some positions and programs but changes in Washington, D.C. aren’t expected to affect their funding.
The Supreme Court has experienced budget pressures, and the judicial branch last year received less funding than it requested from the Legislature while more judicial positions were added across the state. There have been rising public employee insurance costs, and the courts had reported a possible $7 million funding gap in its payroll.
“While we had some preliminary concerns with the initial guidance offered by the State Budget Office, mainly in context and considering the budget cut the judicial branch absorbed in the current fiscal year, we have been working collaboratively toward a fiscally responsible budget plan for fiscal year 2027,” said Jared Hunt, communications director for the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia. 
“We continue to maintain an open and constructive dialogue about our funding needs,” he continued. “We are optimistic that we will be able to work with lawmakers throughout the budget process during the upcoming legislative session to secure the necessary funds that will enable us to efficiently and effectively administer the judicial branch of government.”
Morrisey will deliver his State of the State address on the evening of Jan. 14, which will provide a better look at the governor’s budget priorities. State agencies will have their individual budgets vetted by lawmakers during the legislative session.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookoout) Nearly four years after explosive allegations first surfaced about a Johnson City serial rapist who preyed on women and children without consequence, a civil lawsuit brought by his victims has neared its conclusion.
The man at the center of the allegations, ex-Johnson City businessman Sean Williams, is now serving a 95 year prison sentence, convicted in February of child sex crimes and attempted escape. Williams, 57, faces other drug and sex charges in Tennessee and North Carolina.
But, for years, victims alleged Johnson City Police ignored or mishandled their reports of sexual assault while Williams remained free to prey on other victims. When Williams was finally arrested in 2022 out of state, a search of his electronics yielded images of more than 50 women and young children being sexually assaulted in his downtown Johnson City condo. 
Johnson City officials in February agreed to settle a lawsuit brought by victims for $28 million, the largest legal payout in the northeast Tennessee city’s history. In November, the city approved an additional $2.64 million to settle claims brought by child victims. 
‘A punch in the gut’: women accuse Johnson City officials of victim-blaming in serial rapist case

Then, last week, a federal judge signalled approval for the last portion of the settlement in the case: $4.2 million to be divided among 350 women and minors who reported to Johnson City Police sexual assaults by perpetrators other than Williams between 2018 and 2023. The $4.2 million is a subset of the $28 million approved by Johnson City and will be divided equally among these victims, amounting to about $7,500 each. Lawyers for the original plaintiffs who will share the lion’s share of the $28 million settlement said how it will be distributed remains confidential.
Vanessa Baehr-Jones, an attorney representing victims with California-based Advocates for Survivors of Abuse, said the outcome achieved not just justice, but made victims feel “finally seen.”
“Justice can take many forms,” Baehr-Jones said in an interview with the Lookout. “It can be compensation, which we have here with a class settlement of $4.2 million. It can by system change, institutional change, which we also had here with the city’s agreement of equitable relief and years of monitoring going forward.
“And justice an be found in the process of bringing a lawsuit like this one where survivors are standing up for hundreds of women. The process gave these women a voice. It empowered them and it was inspired to others,” she said.  Other attorneys bringing the case are Brentwood-based Heather Moore Collins with HMC Civil Rights Law and San Francisco attorney Elizabeth Kramer
As part of the settlement, the Johnson City Police Department agreed to four years of monitoring by an independent overseer, which includes detailed audits of 15 sex crime cases each year for the next two years. An outside consultant hired by the city had concluded police failed to collect evidence, interview suspects and witnesses and make arrests in numerous sex assaults reported to them over four years.
Johnson City settles serial rapist class action lawsuit for $28M

“The City Commission approved this settlement with the hope that it would help the victims begin to heal and to rebuild their lives,” a statement released by the city said. 
“It will continue supporting measures that were put in place to ensure that reports of sexual assaults are properly and thoroughly investigated. The City Commission stands behind the Johnson City Police Department and its current leadership,” the statement said.
Two separate lawsuits challenging the police department remain ongoing.
In 2022, former special federal prosecutor Kateri Dahl accused the police department of protecting Williams through incompetence or corruption and forcing her out of her job when she raised questions. Dahl’s lawsuit against the city remains ongoing. 
A third lawsuit filed by an alleged victim of Williams who suffered life-threatening injuries after she said she was pushed out of Williams’ five-story condo during an attempted sexual assault also remains ongoing.
The lawsuit is expected to formally end within weeks after a federal judge requested wording changes to the final settlement, Baehr-Jones said.

Valley City State will be the first North Dakota campus featured on “The College Tour,” a series entering its sixth season. The 27-minute episode is available on Valley City State’s website and will air on the Amazon Prime streaming service starting June 2. 
“I think that this is a great way to showcase some of our students and what they’re doing, and really kind of focus on a lot of the benefits of what VCSU has to offer,” Erin Heide, director for enrollment services at Valley City State. 
The publicity is not free, however. The video production cost the college $92,000. 
Enrollment up nearly 4% at North Dakota public colleges, universities

Mark Potts, director for public relations at the university, said the school had some money designated for marketing that covered the cost. 
“This is a strategic investment to increase the exposure of our university and potentially grow our enrollment. We are anticipating several years of use from the episode,” Pott said in an email. 
The university is able to use smaller segments of the episode and background video in promotions to students across the country. 
Heide said the college recruits students from distant states such as Alaska, Hawaii and Florida.
“Sometimes, when they move into their residence hall in August, that is the first time they step foot on campus,” Heide said. 
She said for those students who have not made an in-person visit, the video tour could provide “more comfort in coming to campus. Maybe they feel like they’re a little bit more familiar with the place before they just have to move all their stuff in and start their new life.” 
Valley City State has seen enrollment rising since the COVID-19 pandemic. The fall 2025 enrollment at 1,827 students marked the third consecutive year of record enrollment.

Alex Boylan, creator and host for the series, said schools featured on the series can see a 5% increase in enrollment and a 2% increase in retention after their episode airs. 
Boylan said the series originated six years ago when his niece was struggling to choose which college to attend. He said the goal is to save families time and money by capturing what a campus is like before families decide to visit or enroll. 
A video crew was on the campus Sept. 8-12. The production crew did interviews with students and recent graduates who had been selected by the university. 
Grant Larson graduated with an education degree in spring 2025 and is teaching in Watford City. 
Larson said he wanted to highlight the opportunities for students on the campus, like his involvement with shooting sports. 
Larson came to Valley City from Leeds in northeast North Dakota. He said he had a good impression of Valley City State, but wasn’t anticipating that he would enjoy college. “So I kind of wanted to just get in and get my degree and get out as quickly as I could,” Larson said. “But the student clubs and organizations enhanced my experience so much there, and I owe a lot to those organizations for so much professional development, so many friends, so many connections.” 
Anna Palmer is a sophomore from Hebron, majoring in health sciences with hopes of becoming  a dentist, who was chosen for the video.
“One of the main things that I enjoyed talking about was the feel of campus,” Palmer said. “One of the things that really drew me in was that it’s a smaller campus, and it feels more homey.” 
Other segments highlight the music, computer information systems, and fisheries and wildlife programs. 
Boylan, who has produced 200 episodes of “The College Tour,” said he was surprised by the beauty of the Valley City State campus along the Sheyenne River and how well the university and people of Valley City get along. 
“The college has an amazing relationship with the community,” he said.

(Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)A recent federal report again identified Arkansas as the hungriest state, with nearly one in five people on average struggling to afford or access nutritious food over a three year period ending in 2024.
A little over 19% of Arkansans were food insecure between 2022 and 2024 on average, reversing pre-pandemic improvements made by the state, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report released in December. Comparatively, 15% of the state’s residents were food insecure between 2019 and 2021.
People are considered food insecure in the USDA report if they do not have the financial resources or physical access to consistently obtain nutritious food. 
“These numbers represent real families – parents skipping meals so their children can eat, seniors choosing between groceries and medication, and working households struggling to make ends meet,” Sylvia Blain, CEO of the Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance, said in a press release. “No state should hold this ranking year after year.”
Changes coming to Arkansas SNAP program Friday due to Big Beautiful Bill

The percentage of Arkansans who experience food insecurity over the report’s three-year period is higher than the 2024 national average of 13.7%. The number of Americans who are considered food insecure spiked post-pandemic after a decade of sustained improvements, and has yet to decrease again. Arkansas has consistently held a place at or near the top of American food insecurity rankings in recent years.
The number of Arkansans on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program has been decreasing for years, even as food insecurity has risen post-pandemic. The Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance wrote that while the program, originally known as food stamps, are “essential tools” for reducing hunger, more was needed. Better access to food and nutrition education are also necessary.
Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders made childhood food insecurity one of her priorities after taking office in 2023, regularly touting a bipartisan state law passed by the Legislature last year providing free school breakfast to all public school students, regardless of income. 
She has also supported moves by the second Trump administration to implement stricter work requirements for SNAP recipients as well as bans on using food stamps to purchase junk food.
Critics argue such restrictions are overly burdensome, do not address the underlying economic struggles that drive people to need assistance and could result in eligible people losing benefits.

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)From scrambling to fill gaps left by resignations in the Idaho House of Representatives to choosing or rejecting conformity with federal tax code, the legislative session begins on Monday with elevated levels of uncertainty.
The number and complexity of decisions lawmakers will face is head spinning, and all in the context of an estimated $40.3 million deficit this year and as much as $555.3 million next year. 
The issues include Medicaid expansion, tax cuts, lowering the income tax rate to 5%, easing abortion restrictions, training and retaining physicians, potential public school budget cuts, the Idaho Home Learning Academy, the Parental Choice Tax Credit program, mental health services, easing restrictions on offering first aid to minors, alleged abuse of female prisoners, managing public lands, competing needs connected to water, agriculture, energy, transportation, and population growth, workforce, economic, and public safety issues resulting from federal immigration policy, the cost of living, additional social behavior restrictions in state-funded spaces, the presidential primary date, federal involvement in state elections, and money in politics.
The uncertainty lawmakers will confront this year will beget uncertainty across the state, compounded by a federal government replete with surprises. The individual anxiety of prolonged uncertainty is, according to psychologists, among the most insidious stressors human beings experience. As it lingers, individuals enter a state of burnout — emotional, physical, and mental weariness. 
The temptation to check out is strong. 
We cannot. Idahoans willing to fight for our state will engage in one civic act they can control. They will vote in the May primary and again in November with a high degree of confidence that their ballot will be counted accurately. The integrity of Idaho’s elections has received national recognition and statewide praise. If you are an Idaho resident with a current Idaho driver’s license or other government issued ID, registering to vote is easy at VoteIdaho.Gov. Voter ID laws enacted in 2024 have made registering to vote for others more complicated, more time consuming, and often more expensive. The League is in the business of helping people in this group—among them: college students who do not drive, people with disabilities, homebound elderly, residents of care facilities, those who are unhoused, and women who have changed their name because of marriage. For those who face barriers, the clock is ticking to prepare for the May primary. County clerks, the League, and other voter service nonprofits are eager to help.
Even if your side loses in this year’s elections, you will have used a sliver of your time otherwise viewing the news and doom scrolling to accomplish one of the few acts in your control. It will not make watching this legislative session any easier or ease all stress. But it is an important start.

McMerty said her office does not endorse the use of dark money but that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled it is unconstitutional. (Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)A new website allows members of the public to view the financial interest statements of North Dakota political candidates and other elected or appointed officials.
For decades, candidates and some government officials have had to disclose information including their family’s primary source of income, as well as businesses they or their spouse have a financial stake in.
State filings previously were maintained as paper records and could only be accessed by submitting a request to the North Dakota Secretary of State’s Office, which could involve a fee.
Moving forward, the public will be able to download the forms for free online. On the office’s new website, which went live Jan. 1, users can search for filing by name, year, position, agency and other categories.
More financial reporting proposed for North Dakota elected officials

The Legislature directed the Secretary of State’s office to make the filings available online in a law passed last year.
The law, House Bill 1469, also for the first time requires candidates and certain officials to update their statements annually.
The statements were previously only required when someone became a candidate for elected office, or when they were appointed to a position by the governor. 
That meant a lot of the information on file about officials’ financial interests was out of date, said Carol Sawicki, treasurer for the League of Women Voters of North Dakota.
“Things could change — which they usually do — and the public wouldn’t know about it,” said Sawicki, who testified in support of the legislation.
The new deadline for annual filings is Jan. 31 of each year. That means candidates and officials will submit a new batch of statements by the end of this month.
As of Friday afternoon, there were more than 150 filings on the website. The vast majority are for 2026. Deputy Secretary of State Sandra McMerty said that for practical reasons, the Secretary of State’s Office doesn’t plan on digitizing paper-copy statements of interest from past years.
House Bill 1469 also for the first time requires filers to provide the following information:

A list of any local governments or state agencies that the individual or their spouse have provided more than $5,000 worth of goods or services to.
A list of any employer, business or trust in which the individual or their spouse has more than a 10% stake in.

McMerty said the agency has reached out to officials and candidates to notify them of the new requirements, and is hosting trainings to make sure they understand the changes.
Candidates for federal office are exempt from the statement of interest reporting requirements, since they already report this information to the Federal Election Commission.
Sawicki said she hopes the Legislature considers requiring more detailed statements of interest in the future. She suggested that candidates and officials be required to share information about not just spouses, but other relatives as well — like children, parents and siblings.
“Children and parents are very often very closely financially intertwined,” she said.
The launch of the new site coincides with a major upgrade to the Secretary of State’s Office’s campaign finance search tool.
Effort to improve North Dakota campaign finance reporting fails

McMerty said the update allows users to search and analyze campaign finance data in greater detail.
“The general upgrades are really a more user-friendly platform for both the public and those who are required to file,” she said.
City and county candidates and office holders don’t file their information with the Secretary of State’s Office, but with local agencies.
A proposal to change several elements of North Dakota’s campaign finance laws failed at the tail end of the 2025 legislative session.
The bill was partly intended to incentivize more candidates to file on time by increasing late fees and making info about late filers public online.
Lawmakers also debated adding other requirements, including publicizing candidates’ beginning and ending campaign fund balances, and itemized campaign expenditures. North Dakota already makes campaign contributions above $200 public.
Legislators opposed to the additions said they doubted the information would be useful to the public, and feared the changes would discourage North Dakotans from running for office. 
The Secretary of State’s Office is in charge of collecting late fees for officials and candidates that file with its office. Late fees range from $25 to $200.
Those who willfully violate filing requirements could also be subject to a class A misdemeanor.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which appears to be leading the inquiry through its Criminal Investigation Division, has so far said little about the search at Smitty’s Supply Inc. in Roseland and initially refused to confirm or deny it took place. Some details were revealed in EPA progress reports the agency’s emergency response team used to document daily actions that took place at the disaster site in Roseland. 
“The CID, with support of the FBI and Louisiana State Police, executed a search warrant for the site,” a progress report entry for Nov. 18 noted. 
It’s unclear what federal agents were targeting in their search. Neither Smitty’s Supply nor the public relations firm it hired to handle communications responded to a request for comment. 
Some recovery operations at the facility to identify hazardous chemicals and products were paused while agents conducted the search, the report stated. The search continued through the next day with an entry for Nov. 19 noting operations to segregate products behind two warehouses “were still paused today during CID activities.” 
After two days of searching, law enforcement agents left the site, allowing the EPA’s response team to continue oversight of the cleanup. On Nov. 20, Smitty’s Supply and its contractors were allowed to resume the work they were doing behind the two warehouses, a report entry stated. 
The Environmental Protection Agency filed its progress reports, which are public records, with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality. The Illuminator obtained them from the department’s public database during an ongoing review of the Smitty’s Supply file, which includes thousands of records.
Spokeswoman Meagan Molter said the state Department of Environmental Quality is not involved in the investigation and directed questions to the EPA. 
EPA spokeswoman Jennah Durant refused to comment on whether a search warrant was executed. The agency refused the Illuminator’s public records request but acknowledged the existence of the warrant in a denial letter from its Office of Criminal Enforcement, Forensics and Training. 
“There is an ongoing regulatory investigation, and the records responsive to your request have been compiled for law enforcement purposes,” the letter stated, citing a Freedom of Information Act exemption that applies strictly to law enforcement records that, if disclosed, could interfere with enforcement proceedings.
Environmental laws are generally enforced through civil actions such as lawsuits or administrative fines. The infractions can lead to criminal investigations, but they are exceptionally rare, said Victor Flatt, a professor and associate director of the Burke Center for Environmental Law at Case Western University in Cleveland.
“Criminal charges are much less common — much, much, much less common — than civil,” Flatt said. “For whatever reason, there’s a possibility there were criminal acts here, and that’s what they’re investigating.”
Environmental criminal cases often arise from either an intentionally bad act or gross negligence on the part of the defendant, such as cutting corners or violating regulations in order to save money and increase profits, Flatt said. Other common elements of environmental criminal cases include the concealing of violations or falsification of records, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. 
Several environmental statutes allow for criminal prosecution, including the Clean Water Act, Toxic Substances Control Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Clean Air Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act.

Defendants can include company employees, executives and even the corporations as individual entities.
“You generally only see criminal charges in the really big cases,” Flatt said.
One of the most notable cases was the 2010 Deepwater Horizon offshore rig explosion, which resulted in the largest oil spill in history. BP, the primary operator of the rig that exploded off the Louisiana coast, pleaded guilty to 14 felony charges, including 11 counts of manslaughter, obstruction of Congress and violations of the Clean Water Act and Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The company was ordered to pay $4 billion in criminal fines and placed on probation for five years, which involved enhanced monitoring and a slate of improvements to eliminate the risk of a similar disaster.   
Transocean Deepwater Inc., which owned the Deepwater Horizon rig and leased it to BP, pleaded guilty to Clean Water Act crimes. The company was ordered to pay $400 million in fines and also placed on five years probation. 
Several BP executives and employees were indicted on related federal charges, but the most serious charges against them were eventually dropped.
The government can be reluctant to prosecute environmental crimes because the burden of proof is much higher than it is for civil offenses, Flatt said. Also, corporations tend to have considerable resources to mount strong defenses, according to a Department of Justice webpage explaining the work of its Environmental Crimes Section. 
“Because these cases routinely involve medium to large corporations, sophisticated white collar crime defense counsel are our usual adversaries, which means that our cases must be airtight,” the page states. 
The EPA and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality are jointly pursuing a civil case against Smitty’s Supply, alleging a long list of violations of the federal Clean Water Act and other federal and state environmental laws for incidents going back nearly five years. The agencies filed their lawsuit Nov. 5 in the federal court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.
It’s possible for the EPA to use a search warrant in connection to a civil case if, for instance, a defendant was preventing access to evidence or a site location. However, Flatt said the search seems more likely to be part of a criminal investigation.  
Smitty’s Supply bottled and manufactured a variety of oils, fluids and other chemicals for distribution to automotive and industrial retailers. Its facility was almost completely destroyed in the Aug. 22 disaster. Storage tanks and drums holding millions of gallons of hazardous substances caught fire, with some exploding. 
Motor oils comprised most of the plant’s inventory, though the government’s lawsuit also noted the presence of other chemicals such as a concentrated form of hydrogen peroxide, which can be highly volatile under certain conditions.  
The fire took two weeks to fully extinguish while oil and chemicals stored at the plant spilled onto both private and public lands and waterways, reaching as far as 47 miles downstream on the Tangipahoa River, according to the EPA. The agency estimates cleanup crews recovered oily waste and petroleum-based materials totaling 11 million gallons, which matches the facility’s storage capacity.
State and federal officials have been unable to determine what started the fire but have discovered numerous violations of laws and environmental regulations they allege could have prevented the disaster or lessened its impact.  
If the EPA concludes its investigation and decides to file criminal charges, the case would then be turned over to the U.S. Department of Justice for prosecution, Flatt said. Those proceedings would be separate from the civil case proceedings.

Aftyn Behn, a Nashville Democrat, turned out Democratic voters -- and possibly Republican ones -- in a December 2025 special election. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Here in a deep red state where elections for federal office are mind-numbingly (and for Democrats demoralizingly) predictable, it was serious political fun—right?—to see Middle Tennessee briefly take center stage in the national spotlight for December’s 7th Congressional District special election. 
A favorable climate for Democratic gains in special elections combined with polling showing a tight race drew scads of outside money on both sides, juicing a campaign ad frenzy the likes of which we don’t usually see in congressional races here. The whole thing had Tennessee Democrats starry-eyed with possibilities.
When the moondust settled the Republican from central casting, Matt Van Epps, took down the activist Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn by 9 points. President Donald Trump won this district in 2024 by 22 points, so Behn’s campaign moved the district 13 points in a blue direction. That’s not nothing though it did lag heftier Democratic overperformance (16-22 points) in the four congressional specials in 2025 in other states. 
Now it’s on to the 2026 midterms, where Van Epps will seek to keep his seat in a regular election. Noting the inroads Behn made and the fact that she finished the campaign with an unspent $465,000 stash in her campaign account, the Nashville Scene’s Eli Motycka wrote last week that Behn “has positioned herself to take another shot at Congress.” In a post-election interview on the Nashville City Cast podcast in December Behn said “We’ll see if I decide to run again next year.” Should she?  
Penning her own campaign post-mortem on Substack in December, Behn sounded triumphalist notes: her single-digit margin (of defeat) “was years in the making,” powered by a door-knocking and voter contact enterprise that operated on a “jaw-dropping scale.” Behn wrote that “our theory of change was affirmed again and again.” As bullet-pointed in the piece that theory revolved tightly around Behn herself: a candidate with a history of turning out their voters (like her, she says), issue ownership (like her on the grocery tax, she says), and a command of grassroots dynamics (like she has, she says). 
In tight Tennessee congressional race, Republican Matt Van Epps pulls out victory

There is a bit of a tinge of “only I alone could pull this off” political vanity to it, which is scarcely more appealing in a populist well-meaning liberal than in the professional narcissist in the White House who regularly traffics in this sort of thing.
Behn justifiably takes credit for improved Democratic margins over 2024 in each of the 14 countries in the district. Importantly, though, the blueward shift Behn pulled off was engineered largely by gains in Davidson County (a 20 point gain over the 2024 presidential margin) with markedly smaller overperformance in the crucial suburban and exurban counties of Montgomery (10 point gain over 2024), Williamson (7 point gain) and Robertson (8 point gain). 
This led some analysts looking at us from the outside in to speculate that liabilities of the candidate herself might put a ceiling on Democratic overperformance in TN-7. NBC’s Steve Kornacki, for example, mused that Behn needed to do a lot better in Montgomery and Williamson to have a chance and wondered “if a Democrat without her baggage could have [made] far more meaningful inroads.” The baggage, of course, is the fodder some of her past actions and comments provided for scorched-earth attack ads.
Behn, it won’t surprise you to learn, flat out rejects the hypothesis that candidate quality explains the loss. Writing on Substack she dismissed what she calls “the delusion that with the right candidate thousands of MAGA or Republican voters would *poof* magically convert to Democrats.” It makes no difference who the Democratic candidate is, she argued, because “the cut-and-paste playbook exploited by the RNC would have been weaponized against any of us.”
Speaking of delusions, this feels half right at best. Yes, mass conversion wasn’t in the offing no matter who ran—a special election is a battle of turnout, not persuasion—and of course Republicans would have aimed their fire at any Democrat, but the weapons would have looked quite a bit different. The Democrats Behn bested in the October primary all came with progressive policy stances similar to Behn, to be sure. But those would have made them look more like run-of-the-mill Democrats, not feed into the AOC-brand far-left identity Behn’s past politically maladroit utterances served up. 
In a turnout race, to state the obvious, it’s about turnout on both sides. Behn rightfully claims credit for a field operation that elevated turnout well above where these special elections typically land—notably higher than the other 2025 congressional specials and actually reaching midterm levels. 
Yet the argument can be made that Behn was a turnout machine on both sides. Republicans spent what they needed to spend down the stretch (which to Behn’s credit was a lot) to make the case to their voters that they need to get off the couch and turn out to make sure the scary commie blonde lady gets nowhere near levers of power. Behn made this a relatively easy case to make. It won’t be any harder next time.

Steve West on the Senate floor. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Isabella Sepahban)FRANKFORT — The legislative session that kicked off last week brings Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher his first opportunity to influence Kentucky’s two-year budget as the state’s top school officer.
High on Fletcher’s priority list is an overhaul of the assessment and accountability systems  that has been in the works since before Fletcher, the former Lawrence County superintendent, became commissioner.
The plan is contained in House Bill 257 introduced last week by Rep. J. T. Payne, R-Henderson, assistant principal of the Henderson County Career and Technical Center.
Fletcher, who in 2024 became the first Kentucky education commissioner to be confirmed by the Senate, has been on the job for less than two years. In a recent interview with the Kentucky Lantern, he  talked about some of what he’s hoping to accomplish in the new year working with the Republican-controlled legislature and Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear. 
School accountability
The local piece is the “most exciting area” of the new accountability model, Fletcher said. Schools would ask their communities what should be expected of graduates and incorporate local feedback into education quality measures.
The Kentucky Department of Education (KDE), which Fletcher oversees, has been working for several years on the new model to measure students’ academic progress following a statewide survey in 2020 and a listening tour in 2021. In addition to local accountability, the model framework directs schools to provide vibrant learning experiences with the communities they serve. 
Fletcher said the new system would focus on measuring individual student growth rather than comparing larger cohorts of students. A news release from the education department says the current system evaluates schools based on the change in accountability indicators from year to year. “In the new system, schools would be evaluated by the academic progress each individual student makes over the course of a year in reading and mathematics.”
KDE would like to work with lawmakers to shorten annual statewide testing after hearing feedback in town halls and introduce an adaptive test for reading and mathematics that would show students’ grade level equivalency and proficiency. After students answer a test question, an adaptive test would then give them another question of a different difficulty level based on if they correctly answered the previous question. 
Teacher pay
Fletcher pointed to a state law going into effect in Tennessee that would make the Volunteer State’s minimum teacher salary $50,000 in 2026. That raises the competition for employees for southern Kentucky school districts along the Tennessee border. 
Fletcher said that “one of the areas that we’re always going to focus on” is raising salaries for Kentucky teachers. Last year, an annual report by the National Education Association ranked Kentucky 42nd in teacher pay, with an average salary of $58,325. 
The same report said Kentucky ranked 48th in starting teacher pay, with an average of $40,161. 
“We want high quality people in front of our kids. We want to make sure that we have the best and brightest, but we also need to compensate them, because we want them to be able to raise a family comfortably,” Fletcher said. “We want to make sure that they have a competitive wage with those around us. That way they want to go into the field and, more importantly, stay in Kentucky.”
Universal Pre-K programs
KDE supports “expanding pre-K opportunities,” Fletcher said. The commissioner is a member of Beshear’s Pre-K for All Advisory Committee, which issued recommendations for gradually introducing universal pre-K programs statewide in recent months. 
Fletcher said he supports a phased approach, as it would allow districts without the necessary facilities and resources at present to prepare to offer universal preschool.
“I do believe that legislators, a vast majority of legislators, would love to have pre-K opportunities for all students. I know our governor would too,” Fletcher said. “The big question is: how do we make that happen in an approach that allows districts to come along?”
Two school districts’ finances
The state’s two largest public school districts — Fayette and Jefferson counties — have faced large budget deficits. Lawmakers have publicly raised concerns about the school districts’ budgets and the topic may come up during the 2026 legislative session. 
Fletcher said that the ways a school district spends its funding are “local decisions” made by superintendents and school boards. Fletcher gave new Jefferson County Superintendent Brian Yearwood credit for reaching out to KDE to ask for help on tackling the deficit. 
As for Fayette, “nothing triggered a management audit or management review for us,” Fletcher said. The district’s budget had more than a 2% contingency fund. If a requirement like that wasn’t met, then KDE could step in with a management review or potentially an audit, Fletcher said. 
DEI
Sen. Lindsey Tichenor is renewing her push to end diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in Kentucky’s public schools. The Oldham County lawmaker filed Senate Bill 26 on the first day of the legislative session. 
In 2025, KDE, as well as 169 of the state’s public school districts, signed a form with the U.S. Department of Education, saying they comply with the Trump administration’s restrictions on DEI in public schools. The form outlined possible consequences for a state or local education agency that protects a DEI program that violates the new federal guidance, including losing federal funding or facing a federal lawsuit.
Asked about Tichenor’s proposal, Fletcher said he believes educators have a moral and legal obligation to “make sure that we’re meeting the needs of all kids” and to help them achieve academically. “The way we approach everything is we want to make sure that every student has opportunity and access.” One way to do that is by looking at data points to identify achievement gaps among populations such as students who qualify for and reduced meals because of low socioeconomic status. 
Fletcher said KDE would never “deny a kid opportunity.”
“As a matter of fact, it’s just the opposite. We want to make sure we have every single kid access and opportunity,” he said. “As far as Sen. Tichenor’s bill, I’d like to see what it looks like, and then we’ll go from there.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DSC_0420-1024x680.jpg,,,2026-01-12 05:58:36.875733

(Middle Susquehanna Riverkeeper photo)A bill aimed at averting another government shutdown this month would divert $500 million for states and tribal governments to repair landscapes damaged by coal mining.
Pennsylvania, with a centuries-long legacy of resource extraction, stands to be the hardest hit by a loss of grant money if the transfer of funds remains in the final version.
House Resolution 6938 passed by a 397-28 vote in the U.S. House and is now in the U.S. Senate for consideration. The money is from the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and would be redirected to wildfire management and National Forest Service operations.
It’s one of three bills in a “minibus” appropriations package for the upcoming fiscal year that congressional Democrats lauded for rejecting the Trump administration “draconian” cuts to a variety of federal programs, including the National Park Service and the Forest Service.

Each of Pennsylvania’s 17 U.S. representatives voted in favor of the bill except for Rep. Scott Perry (R-10th District). His office did not respond to a request for comment.
While the commonwealth is one of more than two dozen states and tribes that received grants last year, Eric Dixon, a researcher at the Ohio River Valley Institute, said coal mining regions in Pennsylvania are most likely to feel the impact.
In 2025, the state  received about $245 million or nearly 34% of the $725 million the U.S. Department of the Interior distributed. If Pennsylvania receives the same proportion of funds in the 2026 fiscal year budget, it would get between $130 million and $175 million less.
The money is used to address hazards from old open pit and underground mines, Dixon said, such as acid drainage polluting rivers and creeks, spoil piles that mar landscapes, and subsidence from subterranean collapses that can endanger homes and businesses. 
“It’s not going to shut the program down, but it is going to be very meaningful for the homeowners who have subsidence or property that’s along a stream that’s not going to get cleaned up now,” he said.
Pennsylvania has the most acres of abandoned and unreclaimed mine lands and most abandoned wells of any state in the nation, according to Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Press Secretary Neil Shader. The bill would also transfer $285 million for an Interior Department fund to stop uncontrolled natural gas emissions from orphan wells.
“Cutting federal funding for these projects will hurt Pennsylvania’s ability to continue its historic work to create jobs and protect public health and safety,” Shader said, noting that IIJA funds paid to cap a majority of the 350 orphan wells under the Shapiro administration. The AML Fund is being used to address 450 abandoned mine sites across the state, he said.
Critics have characterized the transfer as a raid on the trust fund established by the 1977 Surface Mine Reclamation Act, the primary U.S. law regulating the environmental impact of coal mining. It requires mine operators to restore mined land and places a fee on mined coal to fund cleanup work at mines abandoned before the law was passed.
“The Abandoned Mine Land Fund is not a slush fund. It is a promise to communities that built this country and have lived for decades with the environmental damage left behind. Raiding it is unconscionable and an insult to hard-working families across Appalachia,” Patrick McDonnell, president and CEO of the clean energy group PennFuture.
Bobby Hughes executive director of the Eastern PA Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation said Pennsylvania was responsible for about one-third of all coal produced in the United States since it was first mined on an industrial scale in the late 1700s.
As a result, there are 28,000 abandoned mine sites across the commonwealth, 5,500 miles of polluted streams and at least 5,000 sources of acid mine drainage, Hughes said. That’s caused when water inside mines reacts with minerals in the rock, increasing its acidity and causing elements such as iron, aluminum and manganese to leach out.
“These are hazards that we’ve lived with, at least, I’ve lived with them for the last 50 some odd years, growing up here in the Wyoming Valley in the northern anthracite coal fields,” Hughes said.
Hughes’ organization receives AML Fund money to identify and map abandoned mine sites, drainage sources and to restore streams. The loss of those dollars would prevent such work and potentially have a negative impact on efforts to restore, reforest and redevelop them for industry, recreation and tourism.
“To take this kind of money away from … is not really doing any favor to our Appalachian communities that are already still struggling to come back out of the legacy of past minded practices,” Hughes said.
He added the investment in restoring mine land in Pennsylvania has benefits far beyond the commonwealth. The Susquehanna River, which receives mine drainage from northeastern Pennsylvania, is the  Chesapeake Bay’s largest tributary. Hughes, who also sits on the board of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, called it a national treasure.
“What we’re doing up here is cutting down on all kinds of sedimentation loads, coal, silts, metals, organics, phosphorus, nitrogen, that would end up going into the waterways, eventually reaching the bay, if we didn’t do the work we’re doing up here,” he said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Catawissa-Creek-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-12 05:58:36.875733

I’ve been thinking about Renee Good’s dog because my heart hurts too much to think about what happened to Renee Good. Her dog in the backseat of her SUV; her dog looking out the rolled-down window at an ICE agent as he walks around her vehicle, filming with his cell phone; her dog, who we later see alive, in a Reuter’s photo, on the icy pavement next to Renee Good’s partner because Renee Good is dead.
Last week was the first week of Kentucky’s General Assembly for 2026. And though nothing much happened outside the filing of bills and adjusting to having no House or Senate galleries for the public, I can’t help but feel dread. Why? Because in addition to lawmakers returning to Frankfort to fight the DEI culture wars, the rolling tsunami of national news — Venezuela, the fifth anniversary of Jan. 6, Renee Good’s execution on an icy Minneapolis street — is drowning us here in the commonwealth, too.
On Friday night, I watched “Comment on Kentucky” like I always do. The conversation sounded so polite. So normal. So like the good old days, distant and sanitized from the 24/7 political dumpster fire we are all, every last one of us, living in.
Ten years ago this month, we bought our house in rural Anderson County. It would be another year and a half before we moved here permanently with our three big dogs, but to a person our neighbors welcomed us from the first day with bonfires and open houses and, “Hey, do you have a minute to walk on over here and meet our new grand baby?” 
We thought we had arrived in paradise. 
We thought we had arrived in paradise because there was proof of that paradise every single day, and then a billionaire playboy from New York City came down an escalator and changed our lives from there all the way to rural Kentucky?
There are no more neighborhood bonfires. There are no more open houses, not even during the holidays. There are no more calls to “walk on over here.” 
It turns out that a decade of poisonous political rancor — Facebook and Twitter sniping, cable TV talking heads and yard signs and Trump flags, the seemingly joyful cruelty of the president, the Kentucky legislature with its addiction to culture wars and embarrassingly obvious envy of the governor, the decimation of local news, the immense chasm we feel between us and neighbors within walking distance — takes its toll. Even the Republicans out here don’t socialize with many of the other Republicans. 
My heart hurts.
I’ve been thinking about Renee Good’s dog. Her big black dog with his white-tipped nose staring out from the back window of her SUV the same way my big dog — Jack, Jack-o’-Lantern, Lantern of Love — with his black snout whitening with age, stares out the back window of my truck, excited for every 10-mile drive to town as if it’s the first time he’s ever been to town. The joy in him.
I found Jack at the Lexington Humane Society as a puppy in November 2017, one year into the MAGA presidency that was, even then, already shifting the tectonic plates of our humanity. 
A few months earlier, I’d put our elderly yellow lab to sleep at the veterinarian’s office, and since I was sobbing they kindly waved me past the reception desk and out the door. Come back another day, they said, you can pay later. 
If you have ever walked out of your vet’s office with just the leash, you understand.
Days later I was back at the vet’s office, standing in line to pay, when the man behind me, his own big elderly dog at his side, said under his breath, “You’re that lady that writes for the paper” and proceeded to tell me what he thought of my politics. He kept on until I turned around and said, “I’m sorry this is taking so long, I put my dog to sleep last week” and suddenly the politics disappeared. How old was my dog, he wanted to know, what happened, boy he was sorry, there’s no friend like a dog, is there?
I was watching “Comment on Kentucky” on Friday night, my dogs asleep on the couch next to me, thinking about universal pre-K and the number of times I’ve sat in Frankfort committee meetings listening to dejected citizens tell the legislature about child care deserts, the prohibitive cost of child care, how common it is for kids to show up in kindergarten not knowing their colors or how to hold a book. And I thought about how this year’s legislature is going to waste our time and our tax dollars, yet again, arguing about DEI. 
They won’t even consider universal pre-K, and it has nothing to do with the budget. Today’s politics are a zero sum game. Our lawmakers can’t give the governor a perceived win, even if it means we all lose.
Ten years ago, when we bought a house in the paradise that was and is rural Kentucky, who could have imagined the massive, deleterious effect a multiply-bankrupt New York City billionaire playboy would have on us, on our neighbors, on our legislature, on our lives.
I’ve been thinking about Renee Good’s dog. How scared he must have been in the backseat of her SUV as she was shot to death at pointblank range by an ICE agent who was filming her — we see this clearly in video — with his cell phone in one hand while drawing his gun with the other. Her SUV smashes into another car and a pole and we hear the ICE agent say, “Fucking bitch.”
I am thinking about Renee Good and her loved ones and her children and her community. 
I am thinking about her blood on the airbag, her six-year old who will never see his mother again, her dog in the backseat.
Renee Good was not shot to death because she did anything wrong.
Renee Good was shot to death because this is where a decade of 24/7 hateful, dehumanizing political rhetoric leads; because the leaders we elected to represent us in our statehouse and the U.S. Capitol have allowed the president they either worship or are terrified of deploy masked gunmen into our streets to terrorize American citizens in states that he lost.
Renee Good was shot to death by a member of the president’s personal police force, filming his actions for the president’s entertainment.

Steve Pearce has been nominated to lead the Bureau of Land Management. (Courtesy NMPBS) The Bureau of Land Management oversees 8.3 million acres of public land in Colorado, including some of our most iconic landscapes, from the volcanic tuff spires of Penitente Canyon to the alpine basins of the San Juans.
The agency’s director has enormous authority to set the priorities for these lands, whether it be conservation, recreation, mining, grazing or renewable energy development. It’s a job that shapes the beloved landscapes in our state and sets the stage for what future generations may inherit.
That’s why Steve Pearce’s nomination to lead the BLM should alarm every Coloradan who values the freedom our public lands provide.

Pearce has spent decades championing the sale of the very lands he now wants to manage. He co-sponsored the HEARD Act, which would have forced the sale of federal lands to state and local governments that, in his words, “we do not even need,” falsely claiming it would pay off the deficit. These weren’t offhand comments — they reflect a worldview that sees our public lands not as national treasures but as disposable assets.
Pearce has targeted the laws that safeguard Colorado’s wildest places, too. He attacked the Antiquities Act — the same law that empowered President Barack Obama to designate Browns Canyon National Monument in 2015, conserving world-class whitewater, wildlife habitat and cultural artifacts in the heart of Colorado. Pearce also co-sponsored legislation to strip presidents of the power to designate new monuments and cheered President Donald Trump’s 2017 review to shrink or eliminate existing ones.
In his home state of New Mexico, Pearce fought against the creation of Organ Mountains–Desert Peaks National Monument, despite broad public support and clear economic benefits, and later urged a 92% reduction. With such a hostile record, his confirmation could further put our beloved national monuments at risk.
In Colorado, the stakes are enormous. Our public lands aren’t just scenic backdrops, they’re our competitive advantage, helping to sustain a $62.5 billion outdoor recreation economy and support 1 in 8 Coloradan jobs. Access to world-class skiing, climbing, trail running, hunting and angling opportunities is core to attracting businesses and talent to our state. Colorado needs a BLM director who prioritizes recreation and conservation if our outdoor industry is to continue thriving.
Pearce’s conflicts of interest raise serious red flags. While in Congress, he owned two oilfield equipment companies and reported earning hundreds of thousands from them annually — not to mention the millions in campaign contributions from oil and gas interests he accepted. It’s no surprise his legislative record reads like a fossil fuel industry wish list including bills to exempt drilling from environmental review and fast-track permits.
Colorado has worked hard to strike a balance between energy development, agriculture, recreation and conservation on our public lands. We’ve shown that “multiple use” doesn’t mean “extraction only.” But Pearce’s approach is lopsided: His record shows little regard for protecting wildlife corridors, preserving backcountry access or ensuring our waterways stay clean.
Even more troubling, he’s praised efforts to confront and undermine federal land managers, including encouraging counties to “take control” of public lands and threatening federal employees. This type of rhetoric is dangerous. It not only undermines the trust and collaboration our communities depend on to manage wildfire and drought; it places a target on federal employees and on future generations’ freedom to access and enjoy public lands like we do.
Fortunately, Colorado has two U.S. senators who are strong supporters of keeping our public lands public. Sen. John Hickenlooper, a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that will debate Pearce’s nomination, came out swinging in opposition, saying, “Americans deserve a BLM director who will be a true steward of the millions of acres under the agency’s care. Steve Pearce is NOT that person.” Sen. Michael Bennet, also opposing Pearce, added, “Pearce’s views on public lands are completely out of touch with Colorado’s values.”
Thank you, Sens. Bennet and Hickenlooper, for your early and strong opposition. We need continued leadership to rally senators from both sides of the aisle to oppose Pearce’s nomination. Our public lands — which are a shared inheritance for all Americans — deserve a true steward, not someone who views them as inventory to be liquidated.
Colorado’s future depends on it.

(Left photo by Norman E. Jones, 2021)Nikki — the main character of Dolen Perkins-Valdez’s 2025 novel “Happy Land” — is a busy real estate agent living and working in Washington, D.C. who can’t recall the last book she finished. 
While visiting her maternal grandmother Rita for the first time in the hilly, Appalachian stretches of North Carolina, Nikki is surprised to see her elderly and estranged kin reading plentifully despite never having gone to college. 


2027 Reading Across Rhode Island nominations now open 
The Rhode Island Center for the Book welcomes nominations for next year’s book selection. All genres are eligible, including young adult, nonfiction and short stories General criteria include:

     A good story with a universal theme
     Appealing to a wide range of readers, from age 14 and up
     Accessible in language and content
     Available in different formats
     Written by an author who is available to visit and speak with Rhode Islanders about the book
     Over time, the titles selected should reflect diversity in content, culture and genre

Anyone wishing to nominate a book can email kate@ribook.org.


Mother Rita offers a scold: “Don’t act like D.C. is someplace special … I’m just as busy as you, and I still find time to read nearly fifty books a year.”
While 50 tomes may be a tall order for most, the Rhode Island Center for the Book is encouraging Ocean State residents to read at least one this year. The nonprofit center at Salve Regina University chose “Happy Land” as its 2026 selection for Reading Across Rhode Island (RARI), a statewide initiative that takes the concept of a book club and widens interest in a particular book to people all over Rhode Island.
A kickoff event where readers can learn about the book and get a free copy is scheduled for Friday, Jan. 24, from 2 to 4 p.m. at the Rhode Island State House. Donations covered the cost of 80 copies of the hardcover book that will be given away. A separate author event with Perkins-Valdez is scheduled for April 14, with details and registration to arrive sometime in March at ribook.org. 
Released in April 2025 and due out in paperback in March, “Happy Land” follows Nikki on her trek to a place “where neighbors are too far to be heard and the worst threat to mammals is the crack of a rifle.” Summoned unexpectedly by Mother Rita, Nikki discovers more about her family, as well as a dispute which threatens her grandmother’s comfort and security. Simultaneously, the reader tags along with Nikki’s 19th-century ancestor Luella, a freedwoman who helps create an independent Black kingdom in the Reconstruction era. 
Reading Across Rhode Island began in 2003, in response to the somber mood after 9/11, with librarians, educators and readers working together each year to choose “a single inspiring book as a basis to engage in a statewide dialogue,” said Kate Lentz, the Center for the Book’s director.
An associate professor of literature at American University, Perkins-Valdez has published four books since 2011. Her first book “Wench” fictionalized the lives of four enslaved women and was chosen for a citywide reading initiative in Santa Monica, California, while her own homebase of Washington, D.C. has also selected “Happy Land” for a citywide read in February. She said she’s thrilled each time it happens, because it means more libraries will hold her books, making them “so much more accessible to people to check it out.” 
The public can nominate books for each year’s Reading Across Rhode Island title, and a selection committee reviews the options before making a final choice. Perkins-Valdez’s book beat out three other finalists this year, and impressed community readers like Samely Rosario, a Classical High School student who was among those reviewing the nominations.   
A self-described “slow reader,” Rosario said in a statement shared by the Center for the Book that she was first lured in by the book’s “beautiful” cover art. The reasonable chapter lengths, Rosario said, more readily invited her to get invested in what she found to be a compelling narrative.  
“I honestly didn’t expect to like it as much as I did. It was so emotional and powerful in ways I didn’t see coming,” Rosario said. “And not even gonna lie, it actually brought me out of a reading slump. I hadn’t been excited to read in a while, but this story reminded me why I love books.”
Scanned pages from a National Archives publication show ‘slave schedules’ from Georgia recorded during the 1860 Federal Census. These documents were used in the 1850 census as well and listed enslaved people by descriptors like age and sex, often removing their names while listing those of their enslavers. (National Archives via Archive.org)
The draw of historical fiction
Another reason Perkins-Valdez likes community-wide reading challenges: “It reaches people in the community who may not typically read historical fiction,” she said.
Perkins-Valdez’s entire oeuvre is this genre she sees as a window into the past and its vastness, and a way for people to access stories they might otherwise miss. When she reads historical fiction, Perkins-Valdez said, she hopes to learn something, leaving with the impression, ‘‘Wow, I didn’t know that.”
“Happy Land” is Perkins-Valdez’s “love letter to the hills of North Carolina, to the people who live in the Appalachian Mountains,” she said, adding that the book is really for “anybody that lives in any kind of small community with an extraordinary story.”
“Because I think a lot of the most extraordinary stories don’t come from the major cities,” Perkins-Valdez said.
A banjo first led Perkins-Valdez up the mountain road to what would become “Happy Land.” 
In late 2021, like many people looking for a hobby during the pandemic, Perkins-Valdez was learning to play the instrument. A search for historical banjo players from western North Carolina routed Perkins-Valdez toward a rabbit hole that ended in a newspaper article: a story about a “reclusive community that named a king and a queen and called themselves royalty,” she said. 
Known as the Kingdom of Happy Land, it was a community of once-enslaved people who settled near the North and South Carolina border after the Civil War. “I thought, ‘Is this true or not?’ I wasn’t sure if it was true,” Perkins-Valdez recalled.










Not even gonna lie, it actually brought me out of a reading slump. I hadn’t been excited to read in a while, but this story reminded me why I love books.


– Samely Rosario, a Classical High School student who reviewed “Happy Land” and other nominations for the 2026 Reading Across Rhode Island book 


So she reached out to a librarian named Ronnie Pepper at the Henderson County Public Library in Hendersonville, North Carolina, who confirmed the tale. Perkins-Valdez collaborated and shared resources with Pepper over telephone until 2022, when she made her first in-person trip to Hendersonville. There she worked with Pepper and Suzanne Hale, both members of the local Black History Research Committee pushing publicly for the Kingdom to persist in memory. 
The real Kingdom ultimately molded the one crafted in Perkins-Valdez’s book, and Nikki’s research process to find her ancestor echoed her author’s. One scene in the novel has Nikki poring over Federal Slave Schedules in the local library. The not-so-neutral records prove a traumatizing thing for Nikki, who sees her ancestors reduced to line items and rendered not as humans but as property. 
“Maybe this is why a lot of Black people don’t know our history,” Nikki narrates. “Just the search requires fortitude.”
It’s a process Perkins-Valdez herself navigates with a mix of sensitivity and toughness. She said she has not researched her own family history in any thorough way.
“It’s very emotionally difficult to look through it for African Americans, because some of that history can be quite dark,” Perkins-Valdez said. “When I’m researching this about other people, I can put a little bit more emotional distance than if I were researching my own family.”

Haas/Library of Congress, Historic American Engineering Record)
To migrate or not to migrate
Perkins-Valdez’s more immediate family did, however, inform parts of the emotional terrain in “Happy Land” — specifically, the distance between migrating children and their parents. Perkins-Valdez distilled this theme via Nikki’s mother, whose decision to move away from the mountains carves a multi-generational rift with her own mother Rita.
“There’s something real there in terms of the relationship between the migrant and the person who didn’t migrate,” Perkins-Valdez said.
The author’s back-and-forth with her own mother is much gentler and lacks the tension of the family fictionalized in the book, she said, but shades of bittersweetness remain.  
“One of the things that I tapped into with Nikki was, I’m from Memphis, and I moved away, and I was the only of my siblings to move away, and to this day, my mother asks me, ‘When am I coming back?’ It breaks her heart.”
Her mother still sends an occasional Memphis job posting. Perkins-Valdez counters that her retired mom could always move closer to her daughter.
“I still hold Memphis close to my heart, but so many of my friends who migrated away will say, I’ll never move back,” Perkins-Valdez said. “I do think there’s a feeling of the people who stayed home that we kind of left them behind. …I‘ve made a whole life here in D.C.”
She’s more of a reader than Nikki, but not any less busy in her personal and professional life. Books require a measure of devotion to materialize, and Perkins-Valdez said she’s improved over the years at “how to get the work done in the face of a busy life,” such as 25-minute writing sprints just to get something down.
Organizing the daily stuff is not necessarily easier. Perkins-Valdez referenced an interview with Aretha Franklin: “They asked her what was the hardest thing about being a traveling superstar singer. And she said ‘figuring out what’s for dinner.’ I felt that.”    
But Perkins-Valdez does know the flavor she seeks from a piece of prose. She said she sometimes asks herself of her students’ most memorable works, “Why do I remember, out of the hundreds of stories I read, why are there some that stay with me for years?” 
Perkins-Valdez argued those lasting impressions come from writers who “access that part of yourself that a lot of people don’t want to access.”
“As a writer, that is what I’m trying to capture,” she continued. “I’m trying to capture something that sticks with the reader, that kind of sticks to the ribs, as we say in the South.”

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)When the Virginia General Assembly gavels in Wednesday, lawmakers will face one of the most consequential and politically unusual sessions in years, with a new Democratic trifecta, four major constitutional amendments nearing the ballot, and a fresh biennial budget colliding with fiscal uncertainty and early maneuvering for the 2026 midterms.
Democrats enter this year’s session in control of the governorship, House of Delegates and state Senate for the first time since 2021, after Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger’s November victory. They hold a narrow 21-19 majority in the Senate and a commanding 64-36 edge in the House of Delegates, positioning the party to advance much of its agenda with a governor ready to sign it.
At the top of the docket are four proposed amendments to the Virginia Constitution that, if approved again by both chambers in the coming weeks, would go before voters statewide later this year. 
They would protect abortion access, enshrine same-sex marriage, automatically restore voting rights to felons who have completed their sentences and allow a rare mid-decade redistricting ahead of the 2026 congressional elections. 
The session will also set the stage for negotiations over a new $212 billion biennial state budget, introduced last month by outgoing Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, that will likely see significant changes as it moves through the Democratic-controlled body.
“This is not a normal opening act for a legislative session,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington. “Spanberger is setting the stage for an aggressive year one.”
The four constitutional amendments loom large because the governor has no formal role in approving or vetoing them. Each has already cleared the legislature once and must pass again before heading to the ballot.
Two — the same-sex marriage and voting rights amendments — advanced last session with bipartisan support, reflecting a political shift on issues that once divided the chambers sharply. 
The proposed abortion amendment, by contrast, drew opposition from every Republican lawmaker, after years in which GOP leaders explored abortion limits or near-total bans. 
Democrats have argued the measure is necessary to lock in protections as Virginia remains the least restrictive state on abortion in the South.
The redistricting amendment is perhaps the most controversial. 
It would permit lawmakers to redraw congressional lines mid-decade, a move prompted by President Donald Trump urging Republican-led states to gerrymander in their favor ahead of the 2026 midterms, with Democratic states signaling they may respond in kind. Critics warn it could further politicize redistricting, while supporters say it is a defensive necessity.
The state budget may also be a sticking point. 
Youngkin’s proposed two-year spending plan includes tax relief and spending increases but landed just as federal policy shifts threaten to squeeze state finances. Recent federal legislation — including the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill — reduced support for health care programs, raising questions about how much Virginia will backfill lost dollars.
“Overhanging everything that the Democratic trifecta wants to do is a significant fiscal challenge,” Farnsworth said. He warned that cuts to Medicaid and Affordable Care Act subsidies could hit rural hospitals especially hard. 
Spanberger’s early cabinet appointments suggest a pragmatic approach, Farnsworth said, pulling from both the legislature and prior Democratic administrations. 
“The choices suggest a ratification of her campaign’s strategy of being a more moderate Democrat,” he said, adding that could frustrate some progressive activists. 
Republicans, now firmly in the minority, will have limited leverage but still have a role to play. Farnsworth sees potential bipartisan cooperation on health care impacts in Southside and Southwest Virginia and on statewide data center policy.
As debates unfold over taxes, education funding, energy infrastructure and reproductive rights, Farnsworth said one theme will cut across nearly every issue.
“The success of the next governor’s agenda will depend to a significant degree on the key campaign promise of affordability.”
Some of the proposals that The Mercury will be tracking in the next 60 days: 
 Cannabis

Adult-use cannabis retail is poised to come to Virginia this year after Spanberger pledged to sign legislation creating a regulated market, reversing repeated vetoes by Youngkin. 
The proposal, still being finalized, would establish a statewide retail licensing system, prioritize small and independent businesses, eliminate local opt-out provisions and strengthen testing, zoning and public safety requirements, setting the stage for legal sales to begin later in 2026.
House Bill 26, sponsored by Del. Rozia Henson, D-Woodbridge, would create a process for people convicted of certain marijuana-related felonies before July 1, 2021 to receive an automatic court hearing to consider modifying their sentences. 
The bill would apply to individuals who remain incarcerated or on community supervision as of July 1, 2026, and would sunset July 1, 2029. A companion bill has been filed in the Senate.
 Child care

As 88% of Virginia employers report worker lateness or absences due to child care shortages, with high costs and limited access hurting hiring and retention, lawmakers are expected to file new child care bills this month.
Sen. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg, introduced Senate Bill 3 to create an Employee Child Care Assistance Program that would provide state matching funds to employers helping cover workers’ child care costs. Del. Adele McClure, D-Arlington, is carrying a similar proposal across the hall, House Bill 18.
Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, has also filed SB 20 to expand eligibility for Virginia’s Child Care Subsidy Program by raising income limits.
 Data centers

With more than 500 data centers now operating across Virginia, lawmakers will grapple with how the facilities are powered and who bears the cost. Proposals under consideration would increase oversight of high-load customers, primarily data centers. 
House Bill 155, carried by Del. Josh Thomas, D-Prince William, would require State Corporation Commission review and approval before such customers are connected to the grid, and lawmakers are also debating whether data center operators should more directly fund generation projects or transmission lines.
Environmental groups are also pressing for changes to Virginia’s data center tax incentive. 
While most lawmakers remain reluctant to repeal the incentive, which forgoes nearly $1 billion a year in revenue, some are considering adding requirements companies must meet to qualify.
 Education

For years, local governments have said they need more revenue to support their school divisions, but proposals to create new local taxes have drawn opposition from Republicans, including Youngkin.
Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, has reintroduced Senate Bill 66, which would allow localities to levy an additional local sales and use tax of up to 1% for public school capital projects, subject to voter approval.
Lawmakers are also advancing proposals aimed at supporting teachers and school staff. 
Democratic Virginia Beach Del. Michael Feggans’ House Bill 31 would create a supplemental pay program for experienced, fully licensed teachers working in schools with persistent vacancies.  SB 61, sponsored by Sen. Tammy Mulchi, R-Mecklenberg, would offer financial incentives to school psychologists who earn national certification and expand eligibility under an existing state program. 
Both proposals would require funding approval, though cost estimates have not yet been released.
House Education Committee Chair Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, is also carrying HB 92, which would update school staffing ratios for teachers, librarians and counselors.
Several bills address student well-being and access to services. 
Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, has filed Senate Bills 33 and 39 to expand allowable supports for at-risk students and study how schools can better use technology to support student safety and mental health.
Sen. Danica Roem, D-Manassas, has reintroduced Senate Bills 4 and 42 to expand access to school meals and address meal debt. SB 4 and its companion, HB 96, would make school breakfast free for all students, while SB 42 aims to prevent penalties tied to unpaid meal balances.
Lawmakers will also consider changes to student assessment and classroom rules. SB 16, filed by Sen. David Suetterlein, R-Roanoke County, would extend a temporary option allowing alternate assessments, while HB 36 by Del. Joshua Cole, D-Fredericksburg, would allow larger sixth-grade ensemble music classes.
In higher education, Feggans’ HB 56 would expand eligibility for free tuition under the Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education Program, with costs falling to institutions. 
As of Jan. 3, no bills had been filed to change how governors appoint members to governing boards at Virginia’s public colleges and universities, a flashpoint in the state’s higher education landscape for much of last year, culminating in a court battle between lawmakers and Youngki’s administration. Spanberger is expected to fill multiple vacancies after taking office Jan. 17.
 Elections and voting

Lawmakers have filed several election-related bills aimed at campaign finance transparency, voting rights and election administration.
House Bill 44, sponsored by Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, would require the Department of Elections to create a searchable, sortable public interface for campaign finance reports, allowing users to filter, export and analyze data on candidates, committees, contributors and spending. 
Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, is carrying two key measures. 
Senate Bill 34 would clarify that a finding of incapacity in guardianship or conservatorship proceedings does not automatically disqualify a person from voting, requiring a specific court finding that the individual lacks the capacity to understand the act of voting. 
Favola’s SB 58 would extend the deadline for receiving absentee ballots and related materials from noon to 5 p.m. on the third day after an election.
Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, introduced SB 52, which would expand the 90-day “quiet period” for voter list maintenance to all primary and general elections and extend timelines for registrars and voters responding to cancellation notices. 
A House companion, HB 28, has also been filed.
Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, filed SB 76 to move all primaries in presidential election years to the presidential primary date, allow earlier collection of petition signatures and adjust campaign finance deadlines accordingly.
HB 51, sponsored by Del. Rob Bloxom, R-Accomack, would allow some localities to reverse recent moves to November elections and return to holding local elections in May, potentially resulting in multiple election dates in a single year.
 Energy

Spanberger has made energy efficiency and affordability central to her first legislative session, including plans to rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and restore funding for weatherization projects.
If those funds return to the Resilient Virginia Revolving Fund, bills such as House Bill 214 would support local flood resiliency grants.
Spanberger is also backing expanded solar and energy storage. Legislation reintroduced by Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, would revise the Virginia Clean Economy Act to increase utility energy storage requirements and ease regulatory barriers. 
Other proposals she supports would give the State Corporation Commission more authority to review grid efficiency and limit unnecessary transmission line construction.
 Environment

Concerns about PFAS, or “forever chemicals,” contaminating Virginia waterways are prompting new legislative attention. 
Lawmakers are considering measures to require testing of biosolids used as fertilizer, a known pathway for PFAS contamination. Senate Bill 138 would require PFAS testing at wastewater treatment facilities and could lead to limits on allowable levels.
Debate over menhaden, a key forage fish, will also be revived, as environmental groups again call for a Chesapeake Bay–specific population study amid concerns about low fish numbers and broader ecosystem impacts.
Separately, Virginia has signed a renewed Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement, committing the state to pollution reduction benchmarks, expanded education efforts and continued funding to help farmers reduce runoff into the bay.
 Guns

As they did in 2020, Democrats are using their control of state government to advance a new slate of gun control legislation this session.
House Bill 217, re-introduced by Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, would ban the importation, sale, manufacture, purchase and transfer of assault firearms and large-capacity ammunition feeding devices, with limited exceptions. 
Violations would be Class 1 misdemeanors, with convictions triggering a three-year ban on firearm possession. The bill would also prohibit anyone under 21 from possessing or transferring an assault firearm.
Sen. Jennifer Carroll Foy, D-Prince William, sponsored Senate Bill 27 to establish standards of responsible conduct for firearm industry members, requiring safeguards to prevent unlawful sales and misuse. 
The bill would allow civil enforcement actions by the attorney general, local prosecutors or injured individuals.
Favola filed SB 38 to tighten firearm transfer rules for people subject to protective orders or convicted of domestic assault, adding age, residency and reporting requirements to ensure firearms are relinquished.
HB 106, sponsored by Del. Jason Ballard, R-Giles, would lower fees charged by local law enforcement for processing concealed handgun permit applications.
 Health care

A right-to-contraception bill vetoed last year is back as House Bill 6. 
Republicans had argued they might have supported the measure if it more closely resembled a Tennessee law that acknowledges a right to contraception without creating a legal entitlement. Virginia’s version passed the legislature but was vetoed by Youngkin.
Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, who is again carrying the bill, has said it would protect access to contraception if federal protections are rolled back. The proposal is also part of a broader debate occurring alongside a constitutional amendment to protect abortion rights.
Lawmakers will also again consider legislation to create a Prescription Drug Affordability Board. Bills carried by Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, and Del. Karrie Delaney, D-Fairfax, would establish a panel to analyze data and set payment limits on prescription drugs in state-sponsored health plans.
The proposal passed last year with bipartisan support, but was vetoed by Youngkin, who called it “noble in its intent” but raised concerns about medical innovation. 
Separately, lawmakers are revisiting concerns about outdated technology used by social service workers administering SNAP and Medicaid benefits. Feggans is carrying HB 66 to spur system upgrades as agencies prepare for increased workloads tied to recent federal changes.
 Housing

Housing bills vetoed by Youngkin last year could see a different outcome this session, as Spanberger has signaled support for policies aimed at housing affordability, stability and supply.
Among the measures already filed is House Bill 15, which would extend the grace period for late rent payments from five to 14 days, delaying when landlords can move to terminate a lease. 
HB 4 would allow local governments to establish a first right of refusal to purchase publicly funded affordable housing developments when affordability restrictions expire.
Lawmakers are also expected to revive proposals allowing faith-based organizations to build housing on land they own, an effort that failed last year but mirrors legislation introduced in Congress by U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va.
VanValkenburg said he plans to reintroduce bills encouraging housing along certain commercial corridors and urging local governments to address affordable housing shortages — proposals that previously drew resistance over state versus local authority.
 Taxes

Republican lawmakers have introduced several tax-related proposals this session, though it remains unclear if they will advance with Democrats controlling both chambers and the governor’s office.
House Bill 12, sponsored by Del. Joe McNamara, R-Roanoke County, would permanently extend Virginia’s higher standard deduction, setting it at $8,750 for single filers and $17,500 for married couples filing jointly. Under current law, those amounts are scheduled to drop sharply after the 2026 tax year.
McNamara is also carrying HB 13, which would eliminate the remaining 1% local sales tax on groceries and essential personal hygiene products beginning July 1. To offset the loss, the bill would require the state to reimburse cities and counties monthly for the forgone revenue.
Del. Tim Griffin, R-Bedford, has filed House Joint Resolution 14, a proposed constitutional amendment that would exempt one personally owned, noncommercial motor vehicle from state and local personal property taxes. 
The exemption would apply only to automobiles, motorcycles and pickup trucks and would take effect only for vehicles acquired after the amendment is approved.
Griffin is also sponsoring HJ 15, which would direct the Department of Taxation to study the potential impact of repealing Virginia’s individual income tax. The study would examine broader tax reforms needed to replace that revenue and report findings to lawmakers by the start of the 2027 session.
 Transportation

Transportation funding and safety are once again on the General Assembly’s agenda, with lawmakers eyeing long-term support for public transit and expanded traffic enforcement.
No bills have been filed yet, but a legislative subcommittee has discussed dedicating Virginia’s share of $460 million in new capital funding for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority starting in fiscal 2028, alongside Maryland and Washington, D.C., to stabilize service and support long-term investments.
Among the transportation measures already filed is Roem’s Senate Bill 41, to allow voluntary donations for highway safety improvements during online license or registration renewals. 
Sen. Jennifer Carroll Foy, D-Prince William, reintroduced SB 31 to require two qualified workers on freight trains, with a House companion carried by Del. Bonita Anthony, D-Norfolk.
Lawmakers have also filed multiple bills expanding automated traffic enforcement and updating who can certify speed camera violations, including Senate Bills 81, 84 and 59. 
Other proposals would allow single rear license plates and eliminate certain vehicle registration fees for disabled veterans or their unremarried surviving spouses.
 Workforce development

Strengthening Virginia’s workforce and bolstering the worker pipeline is top of mind for legislators this year. 
Sen. David Suetterlein, R-Roanoke County, introduced Senate Bill 10, which would allow 16- and 17-year-olds to participate in certain work programs if they are enrolled in registered apprenticeships or state-approved training programs, or hold required certifications or licenses.
Workforce development has long been a focus in Richmond, and Spanberger outlined plans last fall to strengthen career pathways, increase community college funding and better prepare students for emerging technologies.
More workforce-related proposals are expected as the session unfolds. 
 Measures on minimum wage, FOIA, child abuse, recalling delegates

Lawmakers have filed a mix of labor, transparency and social policy bills that often reflect sharp partisan divides.
Senate Bill 1, sponsored by Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, would raise Virginia’s minimum wage in stages to $15 an hour by Jan. 1, 2028. The bill would codify the $12.77 hourly wage set to take effect in 2026, raise it to $13.75 in 2027 and index future increases to inflation starting in 2029.
Roem introduced SB 56 to limit how much public bodies can charge for responding to records requests under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act. 
The bill would cap fees based on employee pay rates, clarify notice requirements and streamline court procedures when agencies seek more time or relief from fee limits.
House Bill 158, sponsored by Griffin, would expand the legal definition of child abuse or neglect to include cases in which a parent or guardian attempts to transition a child to a sex or gender other than the child’s “biological sex.”
Del. Lee Ware, R-Powhatan, filed HB 8, which would set rules for selecting and overseeing Virginia delegates to a potential constitutional convention under Article V of the U.S. Constitution. 
The bill would allow lawmakers to recall delegates, require them to follow legislative instructions, and impose criminal penalties for exceeding their authority.

(Mechelle Hankerson/Virginia Mercury)A resolution on how the state measures students’ performance in history and social science was delayed for two months during the Board of Education’s business meeting on Thursday, giving Virginia and social studies leaders time to reach a compromise.
Measuring student success helps address a number of factors, including ensuring students are meeting state academic standards, informing curriculum and improvements to teaching and learning, and encouraging critical thinking and civic knowledge, all of which align with the State Board of Education’s months-long discussions and accountability changes.

 Board Change

On Thursday, the board elected board member Mashea Ashton as board president to succeed Grace Creasey, who resigned in December before her  term was set to expire in June 2026.

However, the problem facing the board is determining how much flexibility social studies leaders will have once the combined subject of history and social science is added to the state’s Consolidated State Plan, the recognized accountability system, and ultimately approved by the board and the U.S. Department of Education. 
“We’re not opposed to accountability, but we want the option for performance assessments because it is what is better for students and more reflective of what our discipline goes in our defense, what historians do,” Danyael Graham, Virginia Social Studies Leaders Consortium president, said in an interview last week. “Historians don’t sit there and answer multiple-choice or select-response questions about all their historical knowledge. They’re developing arguments. They’re using evidence.”
In addition to expanding opportunities for students and incorporating JROTC leadership courses into the state plan, the board is considering adding U.S. History or Civics to the state accountability system for the 2027-28 school year. Virginia is preparing the update following last year’s redesign of the plan.
The federal government requires states to assess students only in math, reading, and science.
A January study published by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission found that the proposal could face challenges due to the current scarcity of qualified instructors and the logistical difficulty of fitting extra classes into existing schedules. 
Board member Beth Ackerman said at the board’s meeting last week that what makes her “nervous” about adding social studies to the accountability system is hearing concerns from the social studies community and from special education, “because they will also need significant time” to prepare new assessments. 
She said the board must consider requirements if the subject of history and social studies becomes an alternate assessment for students with significant cognitive disabilities. 
Given these concerns, Ackerman suggested, “Maybe we move forward and exclude social studies for now, but I really feel like we should yield to some of the concerns we’re hearing around social studies.”
Vice President Bill Hansen opposed the idea.
“I hear your concerns, and I appreciate them, and we’ll take them into account … but I just think we’ve got to proceed with what we have and get the input from folks,” Hansen said.

Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, who is also a teacher, threw his support behind adding history and social science to the accountability system into a letter shared with the board last summer. Recognizing this, the letter argued that although Virginia is “stronger than many other states in emphasizing social studies education,” the subject has still been “deprioritized” in recent years.
Todd Truitt, a parent who spoke at Thursday’s meeting, said he, too, supports the ESSA amendment, citing the value of standardized tests for ensuring schools teach essential historical knowledge and support educational equity. 
“Opposition to content-based standardized exams often rests on the assumption that critical thinking skills transfer independently of knowledge, yet cognitive science consistently shows that thinking is domain-specific and driven by the content students know, making these exams one of the few reliable ways to verify whether schools have taught this essential knowledge,” Truitt said.
Social studies leaders have advocated for flexible, performance-based local assessments. These allow schools to measure student learning in meaningful, varied ways, while maintaining alignment with state standards. Such assessments balance accountability with recognition that students learn and demonstrate knowledge differently.
Neely Minton, president-elect of the Virginia Social Studies Leaders Consortium, said the group supports accountability but argued that the amendment conflicts with last year’s approved House Bill 1957, which she said allows for local alternative assessments instead of standardized Standards of Learning tests.
Minton and other social studies leaders are concerned that moving the subject into the state’s accountability system will provide less flexibility and potentially rely on an older testing method that emphasizes rote memorization.
Virginia social studies leaders warn proposed testing shift could sideline critical thinking

“Returning to rote instruction and selected response testing will not solve the literacy crisis that we’re in; it will make it worse,” Minton said.
Since November, interest in local alternative assessments in history and social science has grown, sparking further dialogue between the state education agency and social studies leaders across the commonwealth.
Graham said she has been pleased to see the agency’s engagement on the subject, clarifying that history and social science courses differ from math because their progression is not “linear” and course sequencing varies. 
She maintained on Thursday that existing “rigorous, equitable, and scalable” assessment systems should be prioritized and called for greater transparency and collaboration in the amendment process.
“We want it done right,” Graham said in an interview. “If (history and social science) are in there, let’s take our time. Let’s do it right. Let’s not rush it just to say we got it in the ESSA Consolidated Plan.”
The board delayed any action to amend changes to the state accountability plan until March, when it meets for its work session and business meeting on March 25 and 26.

(Photo by Angela Breck for Maryland Matters)A multi-year attempt to create a Prescription Drug Affordability Board in Virginia will face a new test in 2026. 
The bipartisan proposal would create a special board of medical and health experts tasked with analyzing data to set payment limits on drug prices. Virginia would become the 12th state to have such a board if the law were to pass, but the concept is still novel and has drawn skepticism from a diverse range of opponents, including outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin.
When Youngkin vetoed the bill last year he called it “noble in intent” but suggested it could hinder medical innovation or discourage certain pharmaceutical companies from putting down stakes in the state. 
Other opponents, typically pharmaceutical manufacturing lobbyists or trade associations, have pointed to how Maryland’s PDAB has taken years to be fully operational after becoming the first state in the country to establish one in 2020. 
Virginia AARP Freedom Virginia — an affordability-focused advocacy group — have backed Virginia’s PDAB proposal each year and touted its potential as a key factor in reducing drug prices. Meanwhile, life sciences trade group Virginia Bio director John Newby called PDABs an “unproven experiment,” in a statement celebrating Youngkin’s veto last year.  
Late in 2025, however, Colorado’s PDAB became the first state to approve a cap on a drug. 
By capping the cost of a medication called Enbrel, which is used to treat autoimmune diseases, starting next year a ceiling will exist for how much a patient or insurer in the state has to pay for it. That vote had been years in the making and staved off a previous legal challenge. 
While the news of Colorado’s board setting a cap could spell success, the matter continues to be litigated. 
The board has most recently been sued for the second time by the company that manufactures Enbrel, with its first hearing supposed to happen this month — a full year before the price cap would kick in. 
The previous suit, filed when the board was still deliberating a cap on Enbrel, was dropped because the plaintiffs were not able to prove the board would cause damages. 
And Maryland, Virginia’s neighbor to the north, is another state with a PDAB catching national attention. 
As the first state to kick off PDABs nationwide, Maryland has served as an example of timely innovation as prescription drug prices have surged as well as a cautionary tale for states seeking a speedy solution, due to the time it’s taken to get off the ground. 
The stalled journey, however, was due to various factors. After passing legislation to create it in 2019, the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic spurred then-Gov. Larry Hogan to pull the board’s earmarked funding and not assign board members. 
When current Gov. Wes Moore started to get the ball rolling again by releasing those funds, the board then took a year and a half to set up a regulatory framework before settling on six drugs to consider for cost reduction. But the matter is not a done deal yet.
Maryland Matters reporter Danielle Brown, who has covered the state’s PDAB in recent years, noted thatColorado’s action “is pretty encouraging for a lot of the supporters.”
But she said opponents are “seeing this five-year lapse (in Maryland taking action) as kind of a sign that this is a lot of time, a lot of money that may not yield much in terms of out-of-pocket costs for consumers.”
But the savings to consumers is “yet to be seen,” she added, and can be a test for Maryland and other states that have enacted or are considering creating boards.  
Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger is still cautiously monitoring PDABs nationwide as a proposal here could make its way to her desk. 
The matter was absent from her health care affordability platform and she did not endorse the idea on the campaign trail. 
“I want to make sure that whatever we might implement in the future will be a best practice based on the successes or challenges that other states have faced,” she told The Mercury last year when asked what she thought about the PDAB proposal. 
When reached last week about the subject, her staff indicated the sentiment from last summer’s comment remains the same.
Still, state lawmakers plan to try again on their PDAB proposal in this year’s legislative session. Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, and Del. Karrie Delaney, D-Fairfax, will carry the bills again. 
“The problem is that the concept is just beginning to show progress in other states,” Deeds said, acknowledging some people’s skepticism.
But that progress also signals how the model can work.
Deeds said this year’s version of the bill could have a specific focus on drugs to treat rare diseases — for which medications can sometimes be most costly. Ultimately, Deeds hopes that Virginia’s PDAB, if it becomes a reality, can be successful and provide relief. 
“I want a bill that’s going to work and bring down costs. I think (Spanberger) does too,” he said.

(Photo by Evan Visconti/For the Virginia Mercury)As the state prepares to inaugurate its next governor and lawmakers return to Richmond for 2026 next General Assembly legislative session this week, energy and environment policies are expected to dominate debates. Advocacy groups are laying out policies they want to see garner lawmakers’ support and the governor’s signature, with many familiar bills that failed in recent years.
With a hefty Democratic majority in the House of Delegates and a slimmer Democratic hold in the Senate, several bills that had previously been vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin that will make a return. Gov.-Elect Abigail Spanberger has already outlined multiple measures aimed at efficiency programs and reducing the need for transmission line buildouts that she plans to support.
The Commission of Electric Utility Regulation (CEUR), a group made up of legislators and citizen members, have presented a slate of legislative recommendations after months of public hearings that have gained support from various groups. Here are the key proposals.
 Affordability

The voters of Virginia spoke loud and clear last fall: making life more affordable is their priority concern. The commission suggests that there be more transparency around potential energy efficiencies and involuntary service disconnections through monthly reports to the State Corporation Commission. It also suggests extending the 2038 commitments for the companies to fund programs for low-income households.
Legislation from Sen. Kannan Srinivasan, D-Loudoun, also aims to urge the utilities to aid low-income households with upgrades to help reduce their power usage. The major companies already have programs in place to help homeowners get access to grants and other funds for efficiency upgrades.
 Regulation reform

Clean Virginia, a powerful clean energy lobbying group, is pushing lawmakers to pass utility regulation reforms. Some of the tweaks they recommend include directing the SCC to create a group to design performance-based regulations for utilities that they say would control costs and lessen vulnerability. The group plans to deliver recommendations for future legislation.
CEUR also recommends changing how utilities file their biannual integrated resource plans. The IRPs are what the utilities use to show their long-range projections on power usage from their customers and what power generation projects will be needed in order to retain grid reliability. There have been some debates over how the utilities calculate what customer bills could look like in the future and the SCC has ordered the companies to show two different methods of those calculations.
The commission wants to take a closer look at how the companies are calculating their projected load growth and how to ensure the numbers are accurate as data centers proliferate across the commonwealth. 
 Data centers

The ongoing debate around data centers centers on the tremendous amount of power they use, and how to ensure they are paying a fair share of the power generation. 
A recent rate case for Dominion Energy was seen as “a step in the right direction” by the Southern Environmental Law Center. The case created a new rate class for high load customers and locked them into 14-year contracts to make sure they pay for the energy they are projected to need, even if the projects don’t come to fruition or may not stay online for more than a few years.
Clean Virginia is recommending additional oversight, proposing the SCC review and create an approval process for large load users over 25 megawatts before they can get hooked up to the grid. The group said there needs to be more consideration of how adding these power-hungry facilities will have an impact on ratepayer’s bills and the energy infrastructure that would be needed to sustain grid reliability.
Along those lines, a bill filed by Del. Lee Ware, R-Powhatan, suggests that the SCC consider large load customers  voluntarily financing energy technologies as a way to speed up their connections. Another proposed bill from Del. Josh Thomas, D-Prince William, recommends the SCC having a review process for high load users over 25 MW to ensure the state has the infrastructure to meet their power needs. 
Lawmakers will also have to consider if they wish to keep or alter the current tax incentive for these users. There has been discussion of tightening the requirements for companies to meet in order to be eligible for the tax breaks. 
 Environment

On the environmental policy side, there are moves to expand the state’s efforts to reduce pollution that ends up in waterways. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation has laid out their priorities, which include maintaining funds for the agricultural cost share program that helps farmers implement best practices that reduce sediment and other pollutants from escaping their properties.
Despite signs pointing towards a tighter budget process this year, CBF also is urging the state to invest in the Community Flood Preparedness Fund as well as the Stormswater Local Assistance Fund. The group stresses how important it is to help coastal communities become more resilient against rising flood waters.
There is also a push by lawmakers and environmental groups to urge the Department of Environmental Quality to take a closer look at the source of forever chemicals ending up in rivers and streams.

Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder (file photo)Monday marks the start of Georgia’s annual legislative session, when state legislators will head to Atlanta for 40 days of deliberating and passing laws underneath the Gold Dome of the state Capitol.
What does that mean?
The Gold Dome. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
The yearly legislative session is when the representatives and senators Georgians elect pass new laws, so the Capitol will be buzzing for the next three months with politicians and lobbyists trying to make deals and get their priorities into law.
The session lasts 40 days, but not all in a row. Sometimes lawmakers take days off or set aside days just for committee meetings. One of the lawmakers’ first priorities will be to set a schedule for the year, and leaders from both chambers got a jumpstart on that when they released a proposed calendar Sunday.
Under the proposed schedule, lawmakers will eagerly wrap up their work on Thursday, April 2.
Georgia law prevents lawmakers from raising money for their campaigns during the session – the idea is to prevent even the appearance of pay-for-play politics.
And 2026 is set to be a seismic election year with Republican Gov. Brian Kemp term-limited from running again. This future vacancy at the top has caused a cascade effect of politicians running for higher office, especially in the state Senate.
Lawmakers who are not planning to upgrade their title are also under pressure because the entire House and Senate will be up for re-election in November.
A busy first day at the Capitol
Advocacy groups such as the ACLU of Georgia have planned events to kick off the first day of session. Alongside partner organizations like Indivisible Georgia Coalition, representatives from the ACLU of Georgia will hold training sessions, provide an update of ongoing court cases and preview their legislative priorities for the upcoming session.
Christopher Bruce. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“Georgians are telling legislators we need to emphasize people over politics, and that’s going to be the message that happens at the Capitol,” said Christopher Bruce, who works as the ACLU of Georgia’s policy and advocacy director.
Over 600 people have signed up to attend the “Pack the Capitol” event hosted by the ACLU and other advocacy groups, he added.
Faith leaders from different traditions will also be among the groups gathering at the Capitol Monday as the session kicks off. The event, which will include speeches and a group singing of “God Bless America,” is organized by First Five Freedoms and aims to promote civility and empathy.
Pastor Randy Rainwater with Grace New Hope Church in Lawrenceville will be among the faith leaders there to pray for state lawmakers.
“As a pastor, as someone who cares about people both in my congregation and out of my congregation, the wellbeing of us as Georgia citizens and as Americans depends so much on our unity,” Rainwater said. “And that’s what made us a nation. It’s what’s allowed us to survive for now 250 years. If we’re not a civil people, this doesn’t work.”
Can much be accomplished?
Rep. Michelle Au. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
With so many sitting lawmakers seeking higher office this year, there’s debate over whether much will be accomplished in the next few months.
And the dim prospects of a productive session can be frustrating for those who plan to walk into their respective chamber Monday with policy goals in mind.
For Rep. Michelle Au, the start of session represents a chance to put into action the plans she’s been developing since lawmakers adjourned last year. She likened returning to the Gold Dome for the start of the session to the excitement of going back to camp after time away, even as she acknowledged the election-year constraints that will likely limit how much gets done.
“I do think it’s going to be, in my mind, the more annoying confluence of having the inability to get a lot of stuff accomplished along with a lot of performance art and posturing and electioneering,” said Au, a Johns Creek Democrat and anesthesiologist who takes leave from her job during the session.
“So, there’s going to be more talking taking more time with less output,” she added.
House Speaker Jon Burns, a Newington Republican, speaks to reporters ahead of the 2026 legislative session. Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder
Speaking to reporters in the Capitol on Wednesday, House Speaker Jon Burns said he believes “meaningful legislation” can still be passed.
“There are a lot of things being said about how this session may not be productive,” he said. “I don’t agree. I think our job is to come here and perform, do our jobs, and I believe we’re going to pass meaningful legislation this session.
Burns said his top priority for the year will be to pass legislation aimed at boosting Georgia’s literacy rate, citing statistics showing that only a third of students read at a proficient level by the time they finish third grade.
With Georgians struggling to deal with rising costs of living, and with Democratic flips of a state House seat and two seats on the state board overseeing utility costs underscoring the importance of the economy on the minds of voters, the word “affordability” is likely to pass the lips of many a lawmaker in speeches this year.
Sen. Max Burns. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Senate Republicans want to help make life more affordable by reducing and eventually eliminating the state income tax by 2032, while Burns said the House will introduce a plan to cut property taxes. Details on both plans, including how the state and local governments can compensate for revenue losses, have yet to be publicly revealed.
Sen. Max Burns, a Sylvania Republican and chair of the Senate Higher Education Committee, said Republicans will be eyeing ways to make getting a degree in Georgia more affordable as well.
That could include creating needs-based financial aid for college students for the first time, Burns said or reducing the time it takes to graduate.
The average time it takes to earn a degree varies between University System of Georgia schools with an average of about four years and nine months system-wide. Georgia Tech students graduate the quickest on average at about four years and two months. Atlanta Metropolitan College has the longest average time to degree completion at six years and eight months.
“If we look at the challenge of affordability, it’s not necessarily the cost of tuition or the direct cost of education, it’s the ancillary costs that are really driving that, especially the cost of living and some of the fee structures,” he said. “But if we can compress graduation by a semester or two, then what you do is you really reduce the cost of education.”
Republicans control both chambers and the governor’s mansion, so what they say typically goes, though Democrats can try to wield some influence, especially when there is disagreement in the GOP ranks.
Sam Park. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
House Minority Whip Sam Park of Lawrenceville said that Democrats in the House will be focused on ensuring that every Georgia resident can afford necessities like child care, health care and housing.
“Health care, housing and education will be our areas of focus in which we’re really looking at affordability,” he said.
However, Park also said he is worried about Republican-led tax cuts and the potential reemergence of social issues dominating the Legislature during a year full of high-profile elections.
“Especially with my Republican colleagues, it seems that they’re very much focused on seeing who can out-MAGA each other, which I think is ultimately to the detriment of Georgians who are really struggling with this affordability crisis,” Park said.
Back from the dead
The Legislature runs on a two-year cycle, which means that bills that were introduced but not passed last year could be revived this year.
Some significant bills that could be roused from their slumber include:

A ban on puberty-blocking drugs for transgender minors which was dialed back in a House committee
A bill preventing state workers or their dependants from receiving gender-affirming care through the state health plan
A ban on diversity, equity and inclusion policies in schools and colleges that was grafted onto a bill dealing with sick days for teachers after it did not pass the Senate ahead of a legislative deadline
Duelling plans to deal with traffic cameras in school zones, either by putting new regulations on them or getting rid of them altogether.
A push to make hand-marked paper ballots the primary voting system across the state
A bill preventing political campaigns from knowingly publishing certain audio or AI-made materials within 90 days of an election.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)My smile at work was only a mask for the pain and fear I was carrying in my body. I am not new to the scourge, devastation, and loss of gun violence — but this was different. Very different. A cold-blooded murderer was on the loose in Providence, Rhode Island — my city.
After shooting and killing two students at Brown University and injuring nine others on Dec. 13, law enforcement — local, state and federal agents — frankly, no one knew where or who the shooter was.
I watched and listened intently to every press conference and news report about the manhunt, but the uncertainty — the where, the how, the when was deeply unsettling.
Brown University president announces trauma recovery initiative for campus community

It was Monday morning, the first school day after the horrific shooting. I woke up at 3 a.m., listening to my own breath and wondering. I quickly wrote an email to my assistant principal letting him know that I would not be able to stand at the door to welcome students. This was new for me. My role as a greeter sets the tone for the entire school day.
“I just woke up to the news that they released the person of interest detained in the horrific Brown University tragedy,” I wrote. “As a gun-violence survivor with a personal history of loss, I am not emotionally able to perform my door duties this morning. I went to bed feeling a sense of safety, but this news has left me unsettled and fearful.”
My assistant principal responded quickly — with care, thoughtfulness, and grace.
Throughout the week, administration and front office staff implicitly checked in on me. I felt seen and cared for in a way that made me feel safe — and in a way that allowed me to teach and care for my students.
As a teacher, my job is to show up for work, protect my students, remain calm, maintain routines, and teach — all while holding fear, courage, and resistance in my body. On the surface, this may seem easy. In reality, it is a herculean task.
I had no idea how good I was at masking my own feelings. I’ve always said I wear my emotions on my sleeve. Not this time. No one could see the pain and fear I was holding. I smiled. I attended meetings. I stayed busy regulating my own emotions while helping my sixth- and seventh-grade students regulate theirs, just days before school vacation. This is the quiet, unseen emotional labor of educators like me.










As a teacher, my job is to show up for work, protect my students, remain calm, maintain routines, and teach — all while holding fear, courage, and resistance in my body. On the surface, this may seem easy. In reality, it is a herculean task.


I thought about the students in Providence who were once on my class roster and whom we lost to gun violence. I remembered their names, their smiles and whispered prayers for them and their families. I thought of the Brown University students who were killed or injured. I whispered prayers for them, too — and for us. 
Yes, we have strong protocols in my school district. Yes, I have participated in countless active shooter drills, worked on gun violence prevention  policies as a former state legislator. But being a gun-violence survivor teaches vigilance.
Knowing that a cold-blooded murderer was targeting an educational institution in my city and that no one knew where he was — was nerve-wracking. As a teacher, I had to perform normalcy and predictability while carrying the weight of personal loss.
In quiet moments, I was not only responding to my own fear, but to the very real possibility that an active shooter could breach the doors of my school. With fear in my heart and courage in my mind, I was ready to protect my students with my body if I had to. I was ready.
I made it through four difficult school days not on my own. I made it through because my students kept me grounded — too young to fully absorb the gravity of the news cycle, still laughing, still learning.
My students are my heroes. They are the reason I show up — even in moments when I didn’t think I could.
For my fellow educators: If you are holding fear, grief, or memories in your body while still showing up for your students,  know this—you are not weak, and you are not alone.
Give yourself permission to pause, to ask for support, and to be human. Holding space for students does not mean abandoning yourself. Your presence matters—but so does your healing.

Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George's and Anne Arundel) discussing the upcoming 2026 legislative session. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Maryland House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) begins her first session leading the 141-member chamber Wednesday looking to balance a budget with a $1.5 billion deficit, provide affordable health care and protect immigrants.
All of it, she says, will be achieved against a backdrop of civility.
“We’re not Washington, D.C. We’re going to act appropriately. We’re going to make sure that we have civility, that we have decency and that we have respect,” Peña-Melnyk said during a recent interview in her Annapolis office.
“Those are things that you make a choice, that you have to be intentional about. I demand it, and I expect it. I set the example,” she said.
That doesn’t mean there won’t be tough discussions and decisions, particularly on the budget, where she does not expect tax increases to be part of any soluion. Part of the budget review process, she said, will be assessing where to make cuts and having the discipline to keep from spending on new programs the state can’t currently afford.
“We have to make sure that we take care of the programs that we have right now,” Peña-Melnyk said. “Maryland is required, unlike the federal government, to have a balanced budget. We will adjourn with a balanced budget.”
Another task will be assessing how the expansive tax and spending cuts package, the so-called One, Bg Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed into law July 4, will affect Maryland. Among other changes, the legislation Pena-Melnyk called the “big, awful bill,” increases state tax exemptions on federal returns, makes deep cuts to health care spending and bans Medicaid funding from health care providers “primarily engaged in family planning services, reproductive health, and related medical care.”
Maryland lost 25,000 federal jobs in 2025, latest data show

But Peña-Melnyk also understands the necessity of having a relationship with the federal government, noting that Maryland had the highest number of federal job losses in the nation last year at about 25,000.
“That impacts the bottom line,” she said. “So, as we look at this session, I’m going to be looking at everything through the angle of affordability, accountability and opportunity.”
“We’re going to make sure that we give relief to people that are struggling. For example, to pay their electric bill. That are struggling to be to put food on the table,” she said. “I am a balanced person, a respectful person, and we deal with very tough issues, but we’re going to find solutions.”
In terms of immigration policy, Peña-Melnyk supports the reintroduction of legislation to ban 287(g) agreements, which allow local police to perform certain immigration enforcement roles. She served as a co-sponsor last year of legislation sponsored by Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s), but the Senate stripped out the language blocking such agreements when it passed the so-called Maryland Values Act on the final day of the 2025 session.
Since then, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) has said he supports the bill, giving supporters new hope.
“I think it’s important, especially given the climate that we have presently in this country,” said Peña-Melnyk, a native of the Dominican Republic. “The states have to act. This is a way for us to tell our immigrant community, ‘We love you. You’re part of us. We see you. We hear you, and we want to give you protection,’ and that’s why this is important.”
As part of her agenda to focus on the “energy crisis,” Peña-Melnyk said there will be legislation to prevent utility companies from using ratepayer dollars on executive bonuses.
The legislature took aim at utility spending last year through the Next Generation Energy Act, an expansive bill that Gov. Wes Moore (D) signed into law in May. It bans investor-owned electric and gas companies from using ratepayer dollars to fund trade association memberships and private planes.










We’re going to make sure that we give relief to people that are struggling. For example, to pay their electric bill. That are struggling to be to put food on the table. I am a balanced person, a respectful person, and we deal with very tough issues, but we’re going to find solutions.


– House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George's and Anne Arundel, on on some of her goals for the session


“So many people are not able to afford to pay their energy bill. They’re struggling, and we have to make sure that we give them relief this session,” Peña-Melnyk said. The bill proposes “to make sure that bonuses that the CEOs get doesn’t come from the ratepayers. That’s one of our priorities.”
Some help
Some of the solutions this session, she said, will come from House standing committees.
“I have good people on these committees that bring experiences like I do [and] that work really hard like I do…. Do the homework like I do, and they care about their constituents like I do,” Peña-Melnyk said. “Do we have all the answers? No, but are we willing to roll our sleeves and work like crazy? Absolutely.”
The new speaker has already made several changes, including splitting the former House Health and Government Operations Committee into Health Committee, chaired by Del. Heather Bagnall (D-Anne Arundel), and a separate Labor, Elections and Government Committee, chaired by Del. Melissa Wells (D-Baltimore City).
Dels. J. Sandy Bartlett (D-Anne Arundel) and Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery), who served as vice chairs of the Judiciary and Ways and Means committees, respectively, have been elevated to chairs of those committees.
Del. Kris Valderrama (D-Prince George’s), who was elected to the House in 2006, the same year as Peña-Melnyk, will chair the Economic Matters Committee.
In 2026, affordable housing is needed ‘now more than ever,’ but getting there is the challenge

“I’m honored and humbled. I don’t pretend to know everything. I want to do my best and I want to work with the members,” Valderrama said Friday. “My number one thing in being in Annapolis is constituent services. Policy comes second to me. We are there to make policy, but I’m there to represent my constituents to the best that I can.”
‘Sense of responsibility’
As Peña-Melnyk sat on the dark leather chair inside her office, she tapped the arm rests and paid homage to former House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County), who was the first woman and first person of color ever elected to the position.
“She was a transformative leader when it came to education, addressing health disparities and affordability … she did so much,” Peña-Melnyk said. “It’s such a responsibility to make sure that I honor her legacy, but that I build on that. It’s important that she sat right here, and that I have to continue that work. It’s something that I respect and do not take lightly.”
Peña-Melnyk, who became the second woman to become speaker but the first Afro-Latina when she was elected Dec. 16, called it a “sense of responsibility.”
“It is such an enormous responsibility, not just for Afro-Latinos, Blacks, for everyone,” she said. “To be the leader of 141 people, to be someone that has to guide the House in a respectful way, and when we adjourn to make sure that we deliver for the people. That is how I see it.”
Her family was able to see her stand at the rostrum and lead the House chamber during the special session where she was elected last month. Once it was over, her family left and she stayed in Annapolis.
“They had lunch without me because I told them to go. I had a lot of work to do,” she said. “My family is used to it.”

(Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)When New Hampshire called for more housing, the Lakes Region answered, and development in several central cities and towns took off fast. Then, the gas ran out.
New natural gas connections in several municipalities throughout the region are paused, according to officials and developers. Liberty Utilities, the regulated company that serves as the region’s gas supplier, says it lacks the capacity to add more customers without upgrades that could take years, and millions of dollars, to realize. 
Local officials said the situation was an unexpected roadblock that threatened development they had worked hard to court under the assumption that gas service would be available to new homes and businesses.
“We found out the hard way,” said Pat Consentino, a member of the Tilton Select Board for nearly two decades and the town’s current land use coordinator. Within the last year, she said, plans for nearly 400 residences had been approved in the town. “We have a tremendous amount of development going on right now … but people, the developers, are going to the utilities and not getting gas.”
Municipalities in the lakes region including Franklin, Gilford, Laconia, Northfield, and Tilton are facing a pause on new connections, according to David Chunn, planning and zoning director for the city of Franklin. A spokesperson for Liberty declined to clarify which municipalities were affected when asked via email Jan. 6. However, at a meeting of the Tilton Select Board on Dec. 4, Liberty engineer Ian Crabtree said demand in the area was at the upper limit of what the company could supply with existing infrastructure.
The line that supplies the Lakes Region was originally constructed in the 1960s. Shortly after, the area’s population grew rapidly throughout the 1970s and ‘80s, Crabtree said. In the early 2000s, anticipating a capacity shortfall, the company began widening the line, but the project was never completed. Today, a stretch of about 10 miles of the original six-inch line remains.
Liberty’s preferred next step would be widening that stretch to a modern 12-inch line, Crabtree said, but that would be a “huge undertaking.” Representatives at the meeting estimated it could take upwards of five to seven years to complete the work.

The company operates the station as a supplement to the region’s strained gas network, which is linked to Concord with a line originally constructed in the 1960s. Even with the plant running near constantly in the winter and the pipeline transmitting as much gas as it can, the region is facing a capacity shortfall, Liberty representatives said at a meeting of the Tilton Select Board in December. (Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)
Where gas network does exist, access is not guaranteed
Natural gas service is somewhat uncommon in New Hampshire. About 1 in 5 households uses the fuel for home heating, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2023 American Community Survey. 
That’s because most of the state lacks natural gas infrastructure, said Don Kreis, New Hampshire’s consumer advocate. But the municipalities saying they’ve been hit with a moratorium do have access, falling within Liberty’s “franchise area,” or the region in which the utility can operate. The capacity shortfall, then, means the utility has “customers it can’t serve,” Kreis said.
It wasn’t the lack of gas that was the biggest problem in Franklin, Chunn said, but rather the lack of warning.
“The lack of capacity is a bummer, understandably,” he said. “My irritation is that it was allowed to get to this point, and it was known about many, many years in advance, and no notice was shared with anyone, as far as municipalities. … Many of us only learned about this through people coming to tell us about it, homeowners and property developers, as they encountered the issue. It would have been nice to know about this in advance, from the state regulators.”
Kreis said planning to ensure a utility can meet customer demand was the responsibility of the utility, not the state.
“It’s convenient to blame the government for having failed to plan, but it’s the utility’s job to plan and execute,” he said. 
And planning and executing a project as extensive as a pipeline expansion to the Lakes Region, he added, would be a significant investment.
“Liberty is a cash-strapped company. … They have limited capital resources, and they’re only willing to spend so much building facilities like pipelines.”
A tentative step toward expansion
In a Jan. 7 email, Liberty Utilities spokesperson Pamela Bellings said the company had begun the “design and engineering” phase for the next upgrade project, though she did not specify what that would entail.
Engineering, design, and permitting alone would likely take years, Crabtree said at the Dec. 4 meeting.
Liberty lawyer Mike Sheehan added then that simply planning the project was not the only hurdle. Another “limiting factor,” he said, would be whether such growth would be considered justified.
The cost of projects undertaken by utilities is distributed across all ratepayers in a system. In deciding whether to incur the cost of this project — which would affect rates for customers across the state, not just in the Lakes Region — the Public Utilities Commission and Liberty would have to consider whether such an investment is justified, Sheehan said. 
“That’s always the push-pull we have,” he said. 
During the meeting, Crabtree estimated such a project would cost in the “tens of millions.”
The land abutting the former Laconia State School and surrounding buildings is slated to be redeveloped in a project called “Laconia Village,” featuring about 2,000 housing units. City Planning Director Rob Mora said he is worried the units will become excessively expensive if the development cannot use natural gas as heat, but a pause on new gas connections in the Lakes Region could prevent those units from accessing the network. (Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)
Assessing options
Though the project would take years, local officials said they still believed it was important. Rob Mora, planning director for the city of Laconia, said that without more gas, the Lakes Region lacked the infrastructure to support the state’s goal of boosting the housing supply.
Mora said he worried higher costs of alternative fuels would raise local development out of the reach of those who need it most. 
“Especially if you’re trying to build larger-scale, you know, residential development, that’s really going to be for that ‘missing middle’ income bracket or that workforce development, those are going to be the people that are affected most by this, and those developments that are supporting those people,” he said. 
Mora pointed to the planned development of about 2,000 homes and adjacent commercial spaces at the site of the former Laconia State School, and said he worried costs would increase for future residents without natural gas. 
But as fully electrified development becomes more common, disregarding alternatives to gas heating might be a missed opportunity, said Sam Evans-Brown, executive director of Clean Energy New Hampshire. 
Given the long time frame for gas expansion, adapting both residential and industrial development plans to electricity instead of gas could be both faster and cost effective if done right, he said. 
“I would encourage them to get a lot more creative than just thinking, hey, how do we pressure Liberty to build more natural gas? Because even if that’s the solution they want, it’s going to take years, and I do think there’s been an enormous amount of innovation on the industrial electrification side of things.”
Electricity is expensive in New Hampshire, Evans-Brown said. But investing in a more efficient building envelope and heat pumps can bring down the cost, making an electrified building more feasible. 
New Hampshire’s first net-zero multifamily building was constructed in West Lebanon in 2019, with 29 units of housing for low-income individuals and families — all climate-controlled with electric heat pumps. 
“I disagree with the assessment that gas is the only way,” Evans-Brown said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Tilton-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-12 05:12:33.303759

The arrests were made Dec. 16-21 during Operation Buckeye, which ICE launched in Dec. 16.
Ohio Immigrant Alliance reported last month that at least 214 people were arrested and were in detention as of Dec. 24. Ninety-three percent were men and 80% appear to be Latino, according to a report from the Ohio Immigrant Alliance. They said the actual number is likely higher.

“(ICE is) not here to make Columbus better,” Ohio Immigrant Alliance Executive Director Lynn Tramonte said in a statement last month. “They are bringing violence. When Columbus leaders said ICE makes our communities less safe, that is exactly what they meant.”
An ICE officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis on Wednesday. Good was a U.S. citizen who, according to reports, was operating as a “legal observer.” 
“We said ICE brings violence to our communities, and this is exactly what we meant,” Tramonte said in a statement Wednesday.
ICE did not respond to questions sent by the Ohio Capital Journal, but listed ten people who had been detained in the Columbus area with criminal charges through Operation Buckeye in a news release. 
The homeland security department listed eight people who had been detained with criminal backgrounds. 
“We operate in Ohio every day, but we recently surged our resources there under Operation Buckeye,” ICE Director Todd M. Lyons said in a statement. “Since Jan. 20, we’ve arrested drug traffickers, spousal abusers, thieves and worse.”
However, it’s unclear how many people ICE has detained have a criminal background.  
“The facts really bear out that who they’re picking up are people with no criminal records,” said Angela Plummer, executive director of Community Refugee & Immigration Services. 
Maqueli Eldredge, a paralegal at Legal Immigration Services in Dublin, said there are typically a few ICE reports every day, but there were more than 19 reports on Dec. 16.
“ICE has always been here in Columbus, but we’ve never seen anything like that,” she said. 
Legal Immigration Services in Dublin began realizing an ICE operation was underway when calls started coming in from people saying their husbands never came home or their their spouse’s car was found abandoned, Eldredge said.
One of their clients was detained in Dublin when ICE officers pulled her over, she said. 
“They don’t have any probable cause to pull over someone just because you have brown skin,” said Walter Messenger, a lawyer at Legal Immigration Services. “It’s just ridiculous that people have to go through this.”

ICE took a break over Christmas and New Year’s, but have started detaining people in the Columbus area again, Eldredge said. There were three ICE reports on Monday last week and five on Tuesday, she said.
“They’re still here,” Eldredge said. “They’re still detaining people. We have clients being very afraid of going to their ICE visits and getting detained. But if they don’t go, they are considered absconder.”
Some of their clients have stopped sending their children to school, she said. 
“They cannot go pick up the kids at school, or they’re afraid they’re just gonna take their kids,” Eldredge said. “It’s a tragedy. I don’t know how we’re gonna make it.”
Lack of space in detention centers became a problem for ICE last month, Plummer said. 
“The practicalities became a problem because there wasn’t enough place to put people they were detaining,” she said.
There are six Ohio detention facilities that contract with ICE to hold people who have been detained: Butler County Jail in Hamilton, the Seneca County Jail in Tiffin, the Geauga County Safety Center in Chardon, the Corrections Center of Northwest Ohio in Stryker, the Northeast Ohio Correctional Center in Youngstown, and the Mahoning County Justice Center in Youngstown.
Of those who were detained in Operation Buckeye, 137 were taken to the Butler County Jail, 61 went to the Corrections Center of Northwest Ohio, 10 went to the Seneca County Jail, three went to the Mahoning County Justice Center, one went to the Calhoun County Jail in Michigan, one went to the Hamilton County Jail, and one went to the Miami Valley Jail, according to an analysis by the Ohio Immigrant Alliance. 
Eldredge said their clients who are being detained at Butler County Jail say it’s overcrowded. 
“They cry,” she said. “They say there’s no food, too many people in the same cell.”
A few Ohio Democratic lawmakers sent a letter this week to the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections Director Annette Chambers-Smith asking the department to make sure there are safe conditions for people detained by ICE at Butler County Jail. 
There were 1,044 people in Butler County Jail as of Thursday. The general housing capacity for Butler County Jail is 844, even though ODRC recommends 756 as the housing capacity, according to a July ODRC inspection report.  
“This continued practice of exceeding safe capacity limits represents a fundamental failure to meet the state’s duty of care to those held in its facilities,” according to the letter, which was written by Ohio state Reps. Christine Cockley and Mark Sigrist, and Ohio state Sen. Bill DeMora.

(Photo by Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)When Washington, D.C., agreed to hand over billions in land and tax breaks for a new Commanders football stadium, experts thought it would long remain an outlier in sweetheart deals for sports teams.
But just months later, attention turned to Kansas, where officials in December announced plans to fund 60% of a new stadium for the NFL’s Kansas City Chiefs. The state committed to spending up to $1.8 billion — the largest-ever professional sports subsidy.
Geoffrey Propheter, who studies stadium deals as an associate professor in the School of Public Affairs at the University of Colorado Denver, thought the Commanders deal would stand out for years to come “for how ludicrous it was.”
The D.C. Council in September finalized a plan to dedicate more than $1 billion in public funds to move the Commanders some 7 miles from a suburb in Maryland to a new facility planned for the old RFK Stadium site.
The city’s deal, which offers free riverfront land and exclusive development rights, means the district could forgo between $6 billion and $25 billion in revenue over time, Propheter said. By his calculations, that makes the planned Commanders stadium project the most valuable package ever awarded to a sports team. The team is primarily owned by Josh Harris, an investor with a net worth above $11 billion who also owns majority stakes in the NBA’s Philadelphia 76ers and the NHL’s New Jersey Devils.
The stadium deals in Washington and Kansas — both involving relocations within the same metropolitan area — have set separate records for taxpayer subsidies to sports teams. They serve as further evidence that public officials are uninterested in curbing giveaways to billionaire team owners, despite decades of research suggesting stadiums are a wasteful use of limited tax dollars.
And the deals could further push up the public price tag for projects in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey, all of which are discussing new or upgraded venues for NFL and NHL teams.
‘Pure emotion’ frequently drives debates on sports stadium deals

“Kansas lawmakers have done every NFL team and every pro-subsidy lawmaker everywhere else in the country a huge favor, because now teams can look at the Kansas deal and say, ‘Hey, what we’re asking for is not nearly as bad or as crazy or stupid as what Kansas is offering,’” Propheter said. “So now we’ve just pushed the expectation upward.”
Decades of research has found stadium subsidies are a poor investment of public dollars. Yet the median, inflation-adjusted stadium subsidy amount has ballooned over time.
The Chiefs deal is poised to surpass the $1.48 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars awarded to Montreal’s Olympic Stadium, opened in 1976, marking it as the costliest outlay ever in the U.S. and Canada, said J.C. Bradbury, a Kennesaw State University economics professor who researches stadium subsidies.
Adjusted to 2024 dollars, the median stadium subsidy for projects that opened in the 2010s was about $400 million. That increased to $605 million for projects slated to open in the 2020s. Already, 2030s-era projects have reached a median of $825 million, he said.
“There are many different ways we can measure these deals,” he said, “but by any metric, the recent Chiefs and Commanders deals are historically high.”
The Kansas deal
Kansas officials pushed aggressively to lure the Chiefs some 20 miles from their longtime home at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri.
Officials maintained the new stadium would spur billions of dollars in economic activity despite serious questions from experts and local officials about taxpayers’ ability to cover the massive new debt.
“Quite frankly, I believe [it is] the biggest economic win we’ll ever have in the state of Kansas,” Republican state House Speaker Dan Hawkins said last month.
Chiefs’ move to Kansas leaves experts grappling with possible revenue drain, massive unknowns

But officials also acknowledged the pursuit was about more than economics: Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly said landing the NFL team would make Kansas a tourist destination, help retain young people and defy stereotypes of Kansas as a flyover state.
“And what could be cooler than being home to the Kansas City Chiefs?” she said.
Kansas officials, the Chiefs and the Commanders did not respond to Stateline’s questions about the deals.
The Chiefs are owned by the Hunt family of Texas, one of the nation’s wealthiest families, estimated by Forbes to be worth nearly $25 billion.
As both the Chiefs and MLB’s Kansas City Royals — also in Missouri — openly weighed new stadiums in 2024, lawmakers in Topeka passed legislation amplifying an already lucrative tax incentive program to lure a pro sports team across State Line Road.
To fund Kansas’ expected $1.8 billion share of the new Chiefs stadium, state officials will divert sales taxes from a wide swath of the metropolitan area to pay back stadium debt. Officials say that won’t cause tax increases, but those tax diversions could cut deep into other city and state spending priorities.
Neil deMause, a journalist who has written extensively about stadium subsidies, said Kansas was effectively “negotiating against itself,” since Missouri was not prepared to offer such a lucrative deal. The same situation was true in Washington, he said, as it became clear that Maryland and Virginia, which were also vying for the new stadium, would not offer billions in free land and other benefits.
The new Chiefs stadium will be owned by the state, meaning the team won’t be subject to property taxes, a lucrative perk. The Chiefs will pay rent, but those funds will go into an account that can be used for ongoing facility maintenance and security. The state will also contribute millions to that fund every year.
The Chiefs will keep all revenue from ticket sales, parking and concessions, including for nonfootball events such as concerts and Final Four basketball games.
‘Painful day’: Missouri officials react to Chiefs announcing move to Kansas

In Missouri, the Chiefs had previously committed $126 million in funding for education, transportation, health care and other community benefits over a 40-year period. But no such arrangement has been announced in Kansas.
In a nonbinding 33-page term sheet released by the state, the team agreed to set aside $3 million per year for a community impact fund. That fund, though, is controlled by the Chiefs, who can spend it on charitable endeavors or on profit-generating, team-branded ventures like fitness clubs.
The Chiefs also agreed to match their current charitable and volunteer efforts in Missouri, but neither the team nor Kansas officials answered questions on how that provision would be calculated or enforced.
Kansas will receive some access to its stadium for events including graduation ceremonies and free concerts, but those are subject to team-determined availability, and the state must cover all costs.
State officials are guaranteed one stadium suite for most events. But the term sheet notes that state officials must pay for their own food, except for free soda and water.
“They could have at least held out for free jerseys or something,” deMause said.
‘It’s about panic’
The lopsided deal in Kansas will likely boost efforts by other team owners looking to update their facilities, deMause said.
“For whatever reason, we’re in a moment where team owners feel entitled to demand a lot more billions of dollars than anybody else has,” he said. “And the more they get away with that, the more their fellow owners are going to be emboldened to ask for the same thing.”
In Illinois, lawmakers have discussed for years an effort to relocate the NFL’s Chicago Bears from Soldier Field to a new site along Lake Michigan in Chicago or in the suburb of Arlington Heights. For decades, the team has been primarily owned by the McCaskey family. Last month, Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren cited a lack of “legislative partnership” in announcing the team would explore a potential stadium in neighboring Indiana.










We’re in a moment where team owners feel entitled to demand a lot more billions of dollars than anybody else has.


– Neil deMause, a journalist who has written about stadium subsidies


That news received an icy reception from Illinois lawmakers, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.
“I don’t believe it’s a real threat,” said Illinois state Rep. Kam Buckner, a Democrat whose district includes parts of Chicago’s South Side. Buckner said lawmakers have been pushing the team to provide a more detailed proposal before approving a package of taxpayer-funded site and infrastructure improvements.
Buckner said lawmakers in Springfield watched the Kansas stadium deal closely, but are determined not to follow a similar route.
“What happened in Kansas is exactly what Illinois should not do,” he said. “Kansas is preparing to hand billions of public dollars to one of the wealthiest ownership families in professional sports history — not for schools, not for transit, not for housing, but to subsidize a stadium for a team that’s already printing money.”
Buckner said his constituents have a long list of legislative priorities — ranging from health care to affordability issues — ahead of professional sports.
A devout Bears fan, Buckner said he won’t be drawn into a “hostage negotiation” with the team.
“It’s about panic. It’s about fear,” he said. “It’s about this system that we’ve created, where, if you don’t overpay, a billionaire might just take his toys and leave town, and folks are scared of that.”

The Community and Housing Infrastructure Program allows municipalities and developers to borrow money for infrastructure for a housing development — and then use the property tax revenue boost from the new homes to help pay back the debt.

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
The city of St. Albans recently bought the longtime office building of the local newspaper. Officials want to build apartments there – but first, the place needs work, and a new state program could help foot the bill. 
Dirty soil must be cleaned up on the site of the former Saint Albans Messenger printing press, and water, sewer and parking need upgrades before the city can court a developer to build the 14 homes and ground floor commercial space that officials envision, said St. Albans City Manager Dominic Cloud.
To finance that site work, local officials plan to turn to a new state program: The Community and Housing Infrastructure Program, or CHIP, which allows municipalities and developers to borrow money for infrastructure like roads, sidewalks and sewers for a housing development – and then use the property tax revenue boost from the new homes to help pay back the debt. 
The program could unleash $2 billion in infrastructure spending over the next decade. 
The initiative officially launches this month, after lawmakers and Gov. Phil Scott authorized its creation last summer. State officials opened a pre-application interest form and have kicked off a series of training sessions to drum up interest from municipal leaders and homebuilders.

“We basically have a once in a generation opportunity here,” said Jessica Hartleben, executive director of the Vermont Economic Progress Council, which oversees the program. 
CHIP is essentially a scaled-down version of Vermont’s existing tax increment financing program and is aimed at smaller towns. The Vermont League of Cities and Towns is standing up technical assistance to support municipalities in applying.    
As the program gets off the ground, bigger municipalities with plenty of TIF experience – like St. Albans – have begun eyeing it for projects that fall beyond their existing TIF districts. But some smaller towns have begun to register their interest, too. 
The Rutland County town of Fair Haven recently acquired a 24-acre former race track donated by a co-founder of the Castleton-based lighting company Hubbardton Forge. The town plans to utilize CHIP and ultimately spur the construction of middle-income homes for sale on the site, the Rutland Herald reported in late December.
Housing built via CHIP must be used as primary homes while the infrastructure debt gets paid off. Projects with a certain amount of affordable units get incentives, like the ability to retain a higher level of tax revenue. The local selectboard or city council will need to hold a public hearing on a municipality’s project before plans advance.
CHIP faced considerable scrutiny before its passage last legislative session. Democrats in the House pushed for more guardrails around the initiative, arguing that any new development that might have occurred even without help from the tax incentive would result in foregone property tax revenue to the overstretched Education Fund. Its loudest proponents – including the Scott administration and a new pro-housing lobby – argued that boosting the state’s overall housing supply would help spread the burden of high education costs.
When the market itself isn’t producing enough housing, local governments should play an active role in building more homes, said Cloud, from St. Albans.
“The city can use all the tools that the Legislature has given us to level the playing field and get the projects that we want,” he said. “The Messenger building is a great example of that.”
Applications for CHIP will open by the end of January, according to Hartleben.

(Photo by Jackyenjoyphotography/Getty Images)Four New Hampshire hospitals are among the more than 700 across the United States at risk of closing due to financial struggles, according to a December report from the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform.
The report does not identify which hospitals. Harold Miller, president and CEO of the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, acknowledged in an email exchange with the Bulletin that some of the data is not up to date, due to reporting delays, and a lot can change in a few years for a small hospital. Miller also said the report didn’t take into consideration which hospitals are part of larger health systems that can insulate them from financial challenges.
The center’s data shows four rural hospitals with negative operating margins. Concord Hospital-Laconia, Concord Hospital’s affiliate in the Lakes Region, was operating at a minus-7.7% margin, as of 2024, the most recent data available. Littleton Regional Healthcare, which recently announced plans to be acquired by Dartmouth Health, was operating at a minus-6.9% margin. Cheshire Medical Center in Keene, which has been affiliated with Dartmouth Health for over a decade, was operating at a minus-2.6% margin. And Cottage Hospital in Woodsville was operating at a minus-0.1% margin.
The Bulletin reached out to all four hospitals for comment.
“Although Cheshire Medical Center has had operating losses, we closed FY25 with a positive operating margin due to increased clinical volumes across the organization,” Joe Perras, CEO & President of Cheshire Medical Center, said in a statement to the Bulletin. “In our case, fortunately, Cheshire is a member of the Dartmouth Health system, which puts us in a stronger position, albeit challenged. Barring some unforeseen circumstance impacting the entire health system, the risk of closure is of no concern due to our affiliation with the Dartmouth Health system.”
Bob Nutter, CEO of Littleton Regional Healthcare, said in an email that the implementation of a new electronic health records system made their fiscal year 2024 “challenging,” but maintained “our overall financial footing remains solid.”
“The challenges LRH experienced were anticipated to some degree and not atypical,” he said. “In most instances, organizations can expect to experience similar challenges while navigating the complexities of converting EHRs (electronic health records).”
Nutter said financial challenges were not the motivation behind the hospital deciding to join Dartmouth Health.
“At the very beginning and through the affiliation process, our goal has been to ensure that high-quality, local health care remains strong for generations to come,” he said. “We are moving towards affiliating with Dartmouth Health because they share our vision, mission, and values. Financial issues have never been a driver for affiliating.”
Across the nation, more than 100 rural hospitals have closed over the past decade, according to the report. The 756 rural hospitals currently at risk of following suit, per the report, represent a third of all rural hospitals in the country. Of the 756, the report identified 323 at “immediate risk” of closing, including three of the four in New Hampshire.
The Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, which is based in Pittsburgh, blames health insurance companies for the hospitals’ financial challenges. Private health insurance plans, the report argues, are paying too little for patient services. The center also reports that hospitals lose money treating uninsured patients and those on Medicaid, though at a lower rate than privately insured patients.
The report emphasized how, in rural communities, many hospitals are a patient’s only option within their local community for services such as imaging or laboratory tests and primary care. That means when a rural hospital closes, patients are often forced to travel far for care, even in life-threatening situations.
While he acknowledged the challenging financial position rural hospitals are in, Steve Ahnen, president of the New Hampshire Hospital Association, told the Bulletin he wouldn’t go as far as the report in his own estimation.
“I don’t know enough about the methodology relative to who’s at risk of closure,” Ahnen said. “Financial challenges are very, very real, but I don’t know that there is a hospital in New Hampshire that is at risk of closure today. ”
Ahnen believes the more realistic threat is that hospitals are forced to reduce services.
The New Hampshire Hospital Association put out a report of its own in 2025 about the financial challenges Granite State hospitals are facing. That report found that seven hospitals, both rural and nonrural, had negative operating margins. It also reported that operating expenses rose 44% from 2019 to 2024 and labor costs rose 36.1%.
Ahnen cited a number of factors making it difficult for rural hospitals to function.
He decried how private insurers covering Medicare Advantage patients are denying coverage that traditional Medicare plans cover. Indeed, the U.S. Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General has repeatedly cited Medicare Advantage insurers for delaying or denying services that should be covered.
Ahnen also noted the difficult labor market in New Hampshire. The hospital association’s report highlighted that across the state’s health care industry, hospitals had a 13.1% vacancy rate for all positions. For registered nurses, the rate was 16.8% and for certified or licensed nurse assistants it was 15.9%. He urged policy makers to work on creating talent pipelines for these communities.
Lastly, Ahnen noted that challenges with rural EMS systems mean that hospitals often have to absorb the costs of housing patients who are waiting for ambulances or other transportation to move them.

(Photo by Glen Stubbe/Minnesota Reformer)Thousands took to the streets to protest a masked federal officer’s point-blank shooting Wednesday of a 37-year-old woman in Minnesota. As they did, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials didn’t address allegations of persistent violence by officers in Ohio.
One, a supervisor, has been charged after dozens of police calls alleging domestic violence against his much younger, noncitizen partner. Another was convicted of forcing a vulnerable immigrant to have sex with him.
ICE’s regional media office was asked by the Ohio Capital Journal more than two weeks ago whether it knew the supervisor’s history, but after asking for more time to respond, has not yet responded.
In Minneapolis, an unidentified ICE agent shot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in the face Wednesday morning while she was behind the wheel of her SUV. Just after, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and later President Donald Trump claimed that Good was trying to run over the masked agent. 
But a New York Times analysis contradicted that claim. It displayed video evidence showing that Good was steering her vehicle away from the agent when he shot through her windshield mere feet away.
The analysis also showed agents blocking a man who said he was a doctor from assisting Good before medical help arrived. And it showed the shooter and other masked agents speeding away.
There are long-standing questions about the adequacy of the training ICE agents receive. And when Trump this year ramped up hiring to support his mass-deportation plans, people with criminal records and other disqualifications were hired without being adequately vetted.
Even so, Trump eased training and recruitment standards, and offered bonuses of up to $50,000, to attract more people. That raises fears among critics that things will get worse at an agency they say has long lacked adequate accountability and oversight.
In Ohio, immigrant advocates have been asking how ICE didn’t know about chronic, extreme allegations of domestic violence against Samuel Saxon, assistant field office director of the agency’s Enforcement and Removal Operations Cincinnati Suboffice.

In December, Saxon, 47, was arraigned on charges of attacking the woman he lived with and putting her in a chokehold after a neighbor shot video of part of the incident, prosecutors said.
Over the course of a year, police had been called to the residence about 23 times. In 2018, Saxon’s partner suffered a broken nose, and in April, she suffered a broken pelvis, WXIX reported prosecutors as saying.
Saxon began his relationship with the woman, a noncitizen, when she was 18 and he was in his 40’s, the station reported.
Saxon is also charged in federal court with lying to a federal investigator. 
In an interview with a Homeland Security special agent and a Cincinnati police officer, Saxon denied being in physical contact with his partner when the alleged attack took place. Saxon laughed as he said that — and at other junctures in the interview, according to a partial transcript that was included in his criminal complaint.
In one, he laughed as he referred to a completely separate incident.
“Do you want to hear the accusation that we got today?” the Cincinnati police officer asked.
“That’s fine. I mean, I imagine — now that you’re telling me all this, it’s not about the dude at the Mexican place, so [laughs],” Saxon said, according to the transcript.
Saxon’s federal public defender didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
ICE’s Midwest media office was asked on Dec. 26 whether it knew about Saxon’s history. On Dec. 29, it asked for more time to respond. As of Thursday, it still hadn’t.
Lynn Tramonte, founder of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance, said it’s impossible that ICE officials didn’t know about allegations against Saxon, a supervisor in one of the agency’s field offices.
In an email referring to published allegations against Saxon, she said:
“There’s no way ICE was unaware of Saxon’s history of violence. His victim had broken bones that required surgery… The police came to his home 23 times in less than a year and a half. He had a DUI.

“One of his bosses even called the police to do a welfare check when he didn’t show up for work, and they found him holding a knife. His supervisor admitted he was a ‘loose cannon.’ This went on for years, ICE knew about it, and they kept promoting Saxon instead of firing him. That’s not how a law enforcement agency should operate.”
Saxon’s arrest comes after a federal jury in 2024 convicted Andrew Golobic, an ICE deportation officer in Cincinnati, of extorting sex from a noncitizen woman over whom he had power. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison last March.
In a press release announcing his conviction, the U.S. Justice Department said that Golobic exploited the woman even though he had a special responsibility to protect people who had already been victimized.
“In his role, Golobic supervised immigrants with vulnerable backgrounds including those fleeing violence, exploitation, and sexual assault,” it said. 
“Golobic knew he had power over women under his supervision. Golobic had discretion over the degree of freedom and movement afforded to participants under his supervision.”
In justifying mass detentions and deportations, Trump and his administration have claimed they’re getting rid of violent criminals. But a November analysis by the Cato Institute found that just 5% of detainees had been convicted of violent crimes, while 73% have no convictions at all.
Tramonte said Trump and his subordinates should look closer to home if they want to fight violent crime.
“I find it ironic that we’re constantly hearing DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin make up lies about immigrants, calling every single one a criminal, yet we haven’t heard a word from DHS about the dangerous crimes that ICE agents are committing,” she said. 
Of Saxon, she added, “If he was an immigrant, DHS would have posted his mugshot all over the media by now. Instead, they are avoiding questions from the media because he’s one of their own, and there’s no excuse for keeping him in his position for so long. There’s something very rotten at the Cincinnati ICE office, and hiding from the truth doesn’t change it.”

In a recent ruling from the Ohio First District Court of Appeals, a lawsuit over the 2019 Ohio Senate Bill 23 law, which created the state’s near-total abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest among other provisions, was sent back to a trial court.
The trial court had previously rejected both the law’s abortion ban after six weeks’ gestation and the other provisions related to abortion care that were passed along with it.
The appellate court judges said the unconstitutionality of the abortion ban was not in dispute during the appeal.
Instead, the appeal focused on provisions such as those that required physicians to check for a fetal or embryonic cardiac activity before conducting an abortion, and record-keeping requirements.
The First District said the appeal was “less about abortion, and more about civil procedure and the equitable authority of Ohio’s courts.”
The case stemmed from a lawsuit in the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas, where women’s health clinics and the ACLU of Ohio sued the state.
The law had been entangled in court battles since it was signed into law by Gov. Mike DeWine in 2019, first being put on hold while Roe vs. Wade was still in place, and then being put into active law for several months in 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade.
Activists then sued and the law was blocked again by the Hamilton County court. The lawsuit against the law was bolstered after 57% of Ohio voters in 2023 passed a reproductive rights amendment to the Ohio Constitution.
In October 2024, Hamilton County Judge Christian Jenkins permanently overturned the six-week abortion ban and the provisions that went with S.B. 23, citing the constitutional amendment as one of the reasons for striking down the law.
“For even after a majority of Ohio’s voters … presumably both women and men – approved an amendment to the Ohio Constitution protecting the right to pre-viability abortion on Oct. 8, 2023, the (Ohio) Attorney General urges this court to leave ‘untouched’ all but one provision of the so-called ‘Heartbeat Act’ clearly rejected by Ohio voters,” Jenkins wrote in his 2024 decision.
Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost’s office decided not to fight the rejection of the six-week abortion ban itself, but instead has argued to the appeals court that not all of S.B. 23 should be declared unconstitutional, and some of the provisions in the bill even existed before being added to the law, so some of the law should be allowed to remain intact.
They also argued that the challengers of the law never presented an argument that provisions other than the abortion ban were unconstitutional.
Senate Bill 23 included a “severability” clause, which is a legal concept that allows parts of legislation to continue, even if other parts of the law have been struck down by a court or removed.

As the appellate court put it, severability involves interpreting the law in a way that asks, “what should the court understand the law to be, given that the unconstitutional provision cannot be enforced?”
It is that severability clause that was the main argument by the state in oral arguments to the First District Court of Appeals last September.
Ohio Deputy Solicitor General Stephen Carney said striking down the six-week abortion ban “did not create a super abortion exception” applying to all other parts of the law, and upholding the trial court decision would impact every other law, regardless of subject, passed in the state.
An attorney for the health clinics and abortion rights advocates said the provisions shouldn’t be allowed, because their role was to enforce and uphold the abortion ban that had been struck down.
“Those don’t just stand on their own; they have no meaning without the rest of the ban in place,” said attorney Cassie Mitchell in September.
The appellate court agreed with the state that the lower court should not have ruled that the provisions outside of the ban should be struck down. The judges said the other provisions “are presumptively constitutional.”
“The allegations in (the lawsuit challenger’s) complaint centered around the harm plaintiffs and others would suffer under (the six-week abortion) ban, but not under the disputed provisions,” the court wrote in its decision.
The attorney general’s office was “pleased to see the appeals court agree with what we said all along – it is important for courts and parties to follow procedural rules.”
“Here, proper procedure was not followed, so the appeals court ordered a do-over in the trial court,” a spokesperson for Yost stated.
The clinics and pro-abortion advocates in the case said they were glad to see the court keep the six-week abortion ban under wraps.
“Ohioans have unequivocally rejected politicians’ attempts to ban abortion, and the ruling is a step in the right direction to continue protecting the right for all people in our state to make choices over their own personal medical decisions,” according to a joint statement. “Abortion remains legal in Ohio up to 21 weeks (and) six days of pregnancy.”

(iStock / Getty Images Plus)The Ohio Department of Health has warned residents about a new outbreak of measles identified in Cuyahoga County.
This past Thursday, the department announced the first measles cases of 2026, three children from a household in the Northeast Ohio county.
The state health department said all the children were unvaccinated at the time, and had traveled outside Ohio to “an area in the United States with an ongoing measles outbreak.”
“The fact that we have measles cases in Ohio underlines the importance of being fully vaccinated,” said Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff, director of the Ohio Department of Health. “This disease can be very serious, but it is also preventable.”
Ohio has had three years over the last two decades where measles numbers rose above single digits: last year’s 44 cases, 2022’s 90, and a 2014 outbreak of 382 cases tied to an Amish community with limited vaccinations.
The 2014 case happened after the Ohio residents took a mission trip to the Philippines, a country that was experiencing an active spread with thousands of cases. The Ohio outbreak made national headlines and caught the attention of medical researchers.

Outside of 2025, 2022, and 2014, Ohio has seen only 27 cases since 2000, according to state data. Measles was declared “eliminated” in the United States in 2000, according to the CDC, meaning the continuous spread of the disease hadn’t occurred in more than a year.
“This was thanks to a highly effective vaccination program in the United States, as well as better measles control in the Americas region,” the CDC stated on their website.
With measles cases now increasing in states across the country, that eliminated status could be in doubt, especially as vaccination rates decline as well.
The overall vaccination rates of kindergartners has gone down, according to the federal agency, but in the 2024-2025 school year, about 286,000 U.S. kindergartners attended school without documentation of the immunization for measles – called the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.
In Ohio, CDC data showed 88.3% MMR vaccination coverage among kindergartners for that school year. The rate was down from the previous year, when coverage was shown at 89.2%.
The decline also comes at a time when Trump administration officials have reduced the number of vaccines recommended for children, though the most recent changes left the recommendation for the MMR vaccine in place.
The Ohio Department of Health said Thursday that while measles is extremely contagious, spread through coughing and sneezing, the MMR vaccine is “very safe and effective.”
Receiving the two doses of the vaccine, as the CDC currently recommends, is 97% effective, and the risk of getting sick is “very low” if Ohioans are up to date, according to the state.
“If people are not protected against the disease, nine out of 10 people who are exposed will become ill,” the state health department stated.
The infection can live for up to two hours in the air, and people infected with measles can spread it starting four days before a rash appears, and continue spreading it until four days after.
Symptoms other than a rash include a high fever, runny nose, cough, loss of appetite, and red, watery eyes.
Complications can occur, most commonly in children younger than 5, adults older than 20, pregnant individuals, and those with compromised immune systems.
Measles complications can include diarrhea and ear infections, along with pneumonia, which the state health department is the most common cause of death in young children with the disease.

A state court has extended a temporary block on Ohio’s plan to tap unclaimed funds to help pay for a new Cleveland Browns stadium in Brook Park — along with other sports and cultural facilities across the state.
A temporary restraining order preventing the state from moving money around was set to expire at 5 p.m. Thursday. Now it will stay in place, while the court weighs whether to approve a preliminary injunction to block the state from taking permanent ownership of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion in misplaced money while a legal battle plays out.
“The TRO’s going to remain in effect until this preliminary injunction hearing is decided,” said Jennifer Hunt, a Franklin County Common Pleas Court magistrate who presided over a hearing in Columbus on Thursday.
“So the status quo will stay in place?” asked Jeff Crossman, one of the lawyers representing Ohioans with unclaimed funds.
“Yes,” Hunt said.
That unclaimed funds at the center of this fight are from old bank accounts, insurance policies, uncashed checks, utility deposits and other sources. The state is sitting on nearly $5 billion that belongs to people, businesses, nonprofits and local government entities.
The Ohio General Assembly voted last year to move unclaimed funds the state has been holding for at least a decade into a new fund dedicated to sports and cultural facilities.
The first $1 billion originally was scheduled to transfer into that sports and cultural facilities fund on Jan. 1, with $600 million of it earmarked as a grant for the new Browns stadium project in Brook Park. But a Franklin County judge issued the temporary restraining order on Dec. 23, delaying the move.
Lawyers representing Ohioans with unclaimed funds are fighting the state’s move, calling it an unconstitutional taking of private property that will ultimately benefit the Browns and team owner Haslam Sports Group. Those attorneys, led by Marc Dann and Jeff Crossman of DannLaw, also argue that Ohio needs to do much more to notify people about their unclaimed funds before cutting off their rights to the money.
They’re asking a Franklin County Common Pleas Court judge to maintain the status quo by issuing a preliminary injunction.
“Isn’t there a tension now between the state’s purpose of reuniting owners with their property — and using that money to transfer into another account to pay for sports facilities?” Crossman said during Thursday’s hearing.
Attorneys for the state, meanwhile, argue that people with unclaimed funds that have been sitting for more than a decade have had ample time to file claims. They assert that the General Assembly’s recent changes to the state’s unclaimed funds program don’t violate the Ohio or U.S. constitutions.
And they’re fighting the preliminary injunction request.
The state’s lawyers say the division of unclaimed funds still has plenty of money left to fulfill claims. They’ve pointed out that anyone whose missing money gets claimed by the state this year can still seek repayment until Jan. 1, 2036, under a grace period created by state lawmakers.
Going forward, people will have a decade to file claims and get paid. The clock will start ticking when a bank or other business turns missing money or property over to the state, which acts as custodian — a lost and found for owners.
It’s unclear when Franklin County Common Pleas Court Judge Julie Lynch will make a decision about the preliminary injunction.
A separate, but similar, lawsuit is playing out in federal court over the state’s plan to set a clock — for the first time — on people’s ability to claim their missing money. In December, a federal judge declined to issue a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to keep the state from moving the money.
The lawyers representing Ohioans with unclaimed funds appealed — and asked the appeals court to approve an injunction.
On Thursday, the appeals court declined to do that. In a two-page order, the court said “plaintiffs have not even remotely shown that they face irreparable harm absent an injunction.”
A spokesman for the Browns declined to comment on the litigation Thursday afternoon. But he said the team remains confident in its timeline for the Brook Park stadium project, with a groundbreaking expected this year.

Hush stripped Emporia State University for parts, firing tenured faculty and overseeing an exodus of students. He thankfully departed at the end of 2025, with the Board of Regents hiring an experienced university administrator to replace him. Hush, it must be noted, had no advanced degrees or experience in running a college.
Kansas legislative leaders looked at the smoldering crater of ESU and decided: We want that for all Kansas schools.











That’s right, they’ve voted to pay Hush $10,000 a month for five months to help lawmakers “be very careful and prudent with the dollars in our budget,” in the words of House Speaker Dan Hawkins, R-Wichita. This comes after legislative budget writers made noise last month about supposedly wasteful spending by institutions of higher education.











I’ll grant Hush this: He can instantly identify $50,000 of excess spending.
His consulting salary.
It’s difficult to look at Hush’s hiring, along with budget committee chatter, and not come to a dreary conclusion: Hawkins, Senate President Ty Masterson and their allies in legislative leadership mean to kneecap higher education in Kansas. In the process, they hope to leave state universities weaker and poorer and their students dumber.
There are politically practical reasons for this. College towns like Lawrence and Manhattan routinely vote for Democrats. Even college towns like Pittsburg and Hays look less red than their surrounding areas. The two main parties have separated along educational lines, and healthy universities threaten Republican leaders’ political project.
If too many people go to Kansas universities, too many Democrats will be elected. So Masterson, Hawkins and their ilk mean to destroy universities to preserve their political power.
Call it the knucklehead agenda.
I must make myself clear early in this column. I don’t believe that all or even most Republicans subscribe to that approach. I don’t believe that all or even most Republicans want such policy outcomes.They’re not knuckleheads, and they don’t want anyone else to be a knucklehead either.
I am instead highlighting a small number of powerful Kansas Republicans who serve in the Legislature. Masterson and Hawkins are among them, as are allies who chair or sit on key committees.
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, left, and Senate President Ty Masterson speak during a Jan. 8, 2026, legislative meeting. They voted to hire former Emporia State University president Ken Hush as a consultant on higher education budgets. (Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
These Republicans, as we have seen repeatedly over the past several years, have priorities more in line with national conservative news media and President Donald Trump‘s administration then any traditional form of Kansas Republicanism.
They’re the ones who wanted to redistrict to push out U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids. And they’re the ones who want to either destroy or remake universities into rightwing propaganda mills.











This might sound overwrought, except for the fact that it is happening in other states, too. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and his conservative allies have reshaped the formerly liberal New College. Professors and students have left, and the state has poured money into the school to keep it viable (much as Kansas lawmakers sent an extra $18 million to Emporia State to balance the books).











In Texas, legislators have barred a swath of subjects from even being taught. Texas A&M University informed a professor this month that he cannot teach Plato. Why? The ancient Greek’s writings don’t match officials’ ideas about race and gender.
So no, conservative ideologues don’t want to restore classical education. They want to preserve their antediluvian political project.
Attempts to follow a similar playbook in Emporia didn’t work either. Enrollment dropped for several years (it rebounded slightly in 2025), and the university is handing out record scholarships to entice students. Special giveaways from the Legislature kept the whole enterprise from collapsing. To reiterate: Emporia State hasn’t saved money. It has benefited from ideological largesse.
This is happening. It is real. Universities will be targeted and brought to heel. Republican politicians want to ensure that the next generation of college graduates — if they graduate at all — will quickly and uncomplainingly administer the Gilded Age fantasies of our billionaire class.
No one who runs a university in Kansas can say what I just wrote. No high-ranking Democrat in the House or Senate can say it either. In either case, they can’t talk about what’s going on because Hawkins and Masterson and their ilk will punish them for doing so. Look at what happened after Democratic Rep. Ford Carr raised concerns about racism last year.
But I’m not an elected official, and I’m not a university administrator. I’m just putting down what I see.
Beyond students, the greatest victims in this all are principled and courageous conservatives. Public thinkers such as William F. Buckley Jr. and Norman Podhoretz, George Will and Thomas Sowell, believed in the superiority of their ideas without the necessity of silencing opposing views. They engaged in persuasion and public debate.
Modern conservative leaders in Kansas no longer believe in such values. They don’t want discussion or compromise. They want to accumulate power, and they want to deploy that power against political enemies.
If it means creating a state full of knuckleheads, so be it. They already control of most of the Statehouse.

(Getty images file photo.)According to the Ohio Department of Development, Ohio’s population will shrink from 11.8 million people in 2020 to 11.1 million people in 2050.
To many policymakers in Ohio, this is a key public policy issue. Last year, Gov. Mike DeWine urged university officials to ramp-up recruitment efforts to “keep more talent in the state of Ohio.”
There is some truth to the benefits of population growth to population vitality. 
New people means new ideas, new businesses, new consumers. I like living in a city with a vibrant immigrant community where I can eat foods from places like the Philippines and go to karaoke nights where people sing Brazilian standards. 
I also like having friends from states ranging from Pennsylvania to California who have different backgrounds and life experiences from me.
But population decline can be a symptom as much as a cause of quality of life problems, if not more. 
The slowest-growing states in the country, West Virginia and Mississippi, are also states that struggle with the highest poverty rates, lowest educational attainment, and lowest life expectancies.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Understanding causality is hard here, though. 
Surely people with higher education and income have more ability to move from state to state, meaning part of what is causing these poor statistics is just losing people who are better off. 
On the other hand, there are reasons they are leaving, too, that could be attributed to quality of life.
Then there are the exceptional states like Vermont, which is one of the slowest growing states in the country despite having one of the lowest poverty rates and some of the highest educational attainment and life expectancies among U.S. states. 
Clearly there is something happening with Vermont. Meanwhile, Montana had bottom-five population growth in 2024, but is around the middle of the country when it comes to poverty, education, and life expectancy.
So what should we make of Ohio’s population growth trajectory? 
Compared to the rest of the country, Ohio has a high poverty rate (top half of U.S. states), low bachelor’s degree attainment (bottom half of U.S. states), and low life expectancy (bottom half of U.S. states). That means Ohio looks a lot more like the Mississippis and West Virginias of the country than it looks like Vermont and Montana. 
If this is the case, population decline could be an indicator for deeper quality of life problems in the state.
Ultimately, these other statistics matter more to Ohio’s trajectory than population growth. 
If Ohio lost 700,000 residents on net due to births, natural deaths, and migration rates but the poverty rate declined, bachelor’s degree attainment improved, and life expectancies rose, I think pretty much everyone would agree the state would be better off than it was before. 
Targeting public policy toward reducing poverty, increasing educational attainment, and improving public health will likely lead to a more well-off state population than one that focuses squarely on population growth. 
Let’s realize that quality of life is the most important consideration for Ohio residents, not how many people decide to move in or out of the state.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Nebraska’s high school curriculum standards do not make George Orwell’s “1984” mandatory reading. The state, however, allows latitude to local districts so the novel might show up on an English class syllabus because reading the book would cover many of the bases spelled out in Nebraska’s standards for critical reading. 
For those who get that chance and those who already have, one line from Orwell’s masterpiece has taken on a haunting patina as it intersects with headlines from today’s and yesterday’s news: “The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.”
We call Orwell’s “doublethink,” accepting two contradictory ideas as in “War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength,” cognitive dissonance, a psychological malady. Even as artificial intelligence challenges us to ferret out “slop” generated by large language models and deepfake videos, we can, for the most part, still believe what we see. 
That’s why when a number of videos reveal the same thing — that a Minneapolis woman, 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, does not appear to be trying to run over a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent when, claiming self-defense, he shot and killed her — our vision does not square with what the feds are feeding us. That includes a view from the shooter’s perspective.
In a federal rush to judgment — calling Good, “that woman,” a “professional agitator,” part of a “sinister left-wing movement” and in the act of committing “domestic terrorism” — the president, vice president, Homeland Security secretary and White House spokeswoman painted a picture the actual pictures do not support, essentially asking us to reject what we saw and heard. 
We’ve been here before. The videotaped beating of Rodney King after a traffic stop following a high-speed chase in Los Angeles in 1991 stunned us. The grainy video shot from the balcony of a nearby apartment showed LAPD officers relentlessly pounding King with nightsticks. 
Four of the officers went on trial for use of excessive force. Their defense centered on King posing a threat — that his erratic behavior and aggressive demeanor before the video justified the savage beating. But the images we saw were of a man offering no resistance being pummeled 33 times with night sticks, tased twice and kicked repeatedly for over four minutes. As you know, the officers were acquitted, and the City of Angels burned for the next five days.
In May of 2020 a Minneapolis police officer knelt on the neck of George Floyd for nine minutes to restrain him after his arrest for passing a counterfeit $20 bill. The “restraint” killed Floyd. At the officer’s trial, part of his defense was that the kneeling was necessary and “objectively reasonable,” even when Floyd became motionless. Our eyes and ears saw something else, thanks to an alert citizen, as did the jury that convicted the police officer, sentencing him to over 30 years in prison.
Having just passed the five-year anniversary of a violent mob storming the nation’s Capitol to undo the results of a free and fair election because of a lie, we again are asked to disbelieve what we saw and heard. The White House website, updated just last week, insists the 2020 presidential election was rigged and now places blame for the Jan. 6 insurrection on U.S. Capitol Police for escalating peaceful protests into “chaos” and on Democrats who “staged the real insurrection by certifying a fraud-ridden election.” The site goes on to accuse then-Vice President Mike Pence of “cowardice and sabotage” as he oversaw the eventual certification of the election results, his constitutional duty.
On his first day in office, the president pardoned over 1,500 people for their role in riots that severely damaged the Capitol and risked undoing the republic.
Meanwhile, as of this writing, the FBI is blocking local authorities in Minneapolis from access to evidence as it investigates the killing of Good. The city’s schools closed for the balance of the week according to Minnesota Public Radio News after ICE agents showed up on a high school’s property, handcuffed two staff members and tackled people at dismissal. 
As you recall, Winston Smith, Orwell’s protagonist in “1984,” works in the Ministry of Truth, where he alters historical tracts and documents to align the past with the Party’s current vision. Incumbent on all of us in today’s world where political, industrial, cultural, religious and technological leaders, with and without AI, commonly mislead, misinform and lie to their advantage, we must all be our own ministers of truth, our own debunkers of doublethink.
To that end, perhaps Nebraska high school curriculum standards should make “1984” mandatory. Better yet, today’s headlines should make it required reading for us all.

But, the housing market has experienced a lot of highs and lows over the past few years, and many buyers are sitting on the sidelines wondering if now is the right time for them to buy.
Here are a few questions and considerations to determine where you are in your homebuying journey and your next steps to securing the keys to your new home.
When is the right time to buy?
The market is ever-changing, and there’s a lot you can’t control. So focus on what you can control, which is your financial readiness, because the best time to buy is when you’re financially prepared to. Rates aren’t the only thing impacting housing affordability, and educating yourself on the homebuying process  and making informed decisions may help you find additional areas to save.
If buyers are concerned about daily rate fluctuations, consumers might be able to lock in today’s rate while they shop around. For instance, Chase’s Homebuyer Advantage with Lock and Shop program allows borrowers who are eligible to lock in their rate for 90 days while they begin the homebuying process. They also may be eligible for a one time option to lower their rate if rates improve. 
How do I know if I am financially ready for homeownership?
Homeownership is a dream for many, but most people don’t know that their dreams may be within reach. Here are some signs you may be ready to take on homeownership:
            •           Your financial health is sound. This might look like having a regular, dependable source of income, having a good credit score—lenders typically look for a score of 620 and above—and having a low debt-to-income ratio. This allows lenders to better gauge how much you may be able to afford.
            •           You understand the true cost of homeownership: This might look like understanding not only your borrowing capacity but also the monthly payment. You’re also prepared for the additional costs of buying a home, such as closing costs, property taxes, homeowners association fees, among other costs, as well as ongoing maintenance or repairs. Look for financial tools like the Chase affordability calculator to help determine buying power, based on income, and preferred monthly loan payments.
            •           Your personal goals and timelines match up: Think about your upcoming life events and whether it makes sense to own a home, such as retiring, relocating or a growing family.
What else can I do to save on the costs of homeownership?
A big misconception is that you have to put 20% of the total purchase price of the home down, but some loan types offer low down payment options—such as FHA and VA loans. For example, Chase’s DreamMaker Mortgage has flexible credit guidelines and down payments as low as 3%.
Find local assistance programs to help reduce items like closing costs, down payments or interest rates. There are assistance programs at the local, state, and national levels to support homebuyers on their path to homeownership. You can checkout tools like the Homebuyer Assistance Finder that helps you research and find additional assistance programs you may qualify for, such as Chase’s Homebuyer Grant which offers up to $5,000 in qualifying neighborhoods.
Also, don’t be shy to shop around for your loan — make lenders compete for your business. Check in with more than one lender and compare and contrast terms to get the best deal possible.

The 2026 Florida Legislative Session kicks off tomorrow.
You psyched? I know I am.
We can witness the majesty of democracy at work, the glory of our constitutional system, the sheer fabulousness of our elected representatives as they conduct the People’s Business.
My top priority — yours, too, I’m sure — is the state bird.
Mockingbirds are usually about ten inches in length, with a fifteen-inch wingspan, grayish upper portions, white undersides, and white patches on the tail and wings.Via FL Department of State
Our state avian is the Northern Mockingbird, a noisy and ill-mannered little bastard who likes to pick fights with other critters.
We’ve been stuck with this gray, aggressive, song-plagiarizing critter since 1927.
But perhaps not for much longer.
Rep. Jim Mooney, R-Islamorada, has once again filed a bill to replace the mockingbird with the flamingo.
He insists the change is vital: “If you ask people around the state of Florida what’s the state bird, very few people ever say the mockingbird. They’ll say the flamingo, they might say a pelican.”
Mooney reasons that, because flamingos feature on Florida postcards, the plastic variety are stuck into Florida lawns and appear on the Florida Lottery logo, it must replace the mockingbird.
Like the mockingbird, the flamingo is native to Florida, although in the early 20th century we damn near hunted it to extinction, “harvesting” its pretty feathers to adorn the hats of fashionable ladies.
“The reality of it is the flamingo represents Florida,” he says. “It always has since I was a kid.”
The mockingbird is also the official bird of some other states, so it’s not special enough for the special state of Florida.
Nevertheless, it has its defenders, including several North Florida lawmakers who feel the flamingo, all sleek pinkness and skinny supermodel legs, is a South Florida thing unrepresentative of the state’s non-pastel regions.
The only time a flamingo comes near the Panhandle is when a storm blows one up here.
‘Evil little bird’
Mooney’s biggest problem, however, may be Marion Hammer, former NRA president and longtime NRA lobbyist.
The woman feels very strongly about the m-bird.
“Mockingbirds have exceptional vocal abilities,” she says, “and can mimic songs of other birds, and the noise of mechanical devices like sports cars and tones on cellphones.”
Flamingos, on the other hand, produce a kind of nasal honk.
Florida Scrub-Jay viaFlorida Fish and WildlifeConservation Commission
Perhaps to mollify the anti-flamingo contingent, Mooney’s bill would also name the Florida Scrub Jay the state’s official songbird.
The scrub jay is the only bird endemic to Florida; its presence on our peninsula goes back 2 million years.
It’s clever and sports sky blue feathers: a lovely little critter beloved by all who see it.
Almost all.
As Coach Lee Corso, another famous Floridian, liked to say, “Not so fast, my friend!”
The Hammer hates the scrub jay, calling it an “evil little bird” whose kind “steal other birds’ eggs and kill the babies of other birds.”
Worse, because the scrub jay is friendly and will eat seeds and nuts out of your hand, she says it has a “welfare mentality.”
Really, really bad, the scrub jay is a threatened species, which means tree-huggers and their radical leftist Audubon Society ilk want to protect its shrinking habitat and stop decent Christian developers from paving over it.
The fate of Mooney’s bill may depend on whether the Hammer decides to oppose it.
Remember, she’s armed.
Suffer the little children
While we’re on the subject  of “welfare mentality,” Speaker of the House Daniel Perez is pushing a brace of bills to punish people who insist on being poor.
Or a child or old or pregnant or disabled or all the above.
Following the example of the huge bill Donald Trump calls “beautiful” and most Americans call “ugly,” Perez wants to cut aid to what Jesus (remember him?) called “the least among us.”
Perez and his pet House Republicans will tighten SNAP eligibility and slash Medicaid and Florida’s low-cost children’s health insurance program.
He says it’s to save money.
Fewer kids will have access to care. And thanks to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and our science-challenged state surgeon general, far fewer will be vaccinated.
You know what will happen: A non-immunized, no longer insured child gets measles or chicken pox or RSV, infects a whole classroom of other children, and has to go to the Emergency Room, thus costing everybody a lot more than if the child could get treated without bankrupting the parents.
Speaker Perez calls this “protecting taxpayer dollars.”
Also on the health beat, Rep. Jeff Holcomb, R-Spring Hill, wants to allow you to get ivermectin at your neighborhood Walgreen’s. No age restrictions, no prescription necessary.
Ivermectin, in case you have forgotten, is an anti-parasitic drug, good for round worms, hook worms, whipworms, and head lice.
What it’s not good for, according to reputable clinical trials, is COVID-19, despite quacks across the nation claiming it is.
Sojourners
At this point, you may be wondering if the Legislature plans to do anything to improve transparency, accountability, and the lives of ordinary citizens.
There are a few promising bills.
Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, wants ICE to take off the masks and wear visible IDs when they’re going around terrorizing people.
Given that ICE seems to enjoy apprehending anyone they don’t like the look of, including U.S. citizens, you’d think it was only fair — constitutional, even — for them to show identification.
As for the detainees, other lawmakers think it might be an idea to keep better track of them. FDLE has a database of a sort, logging “suspected unauthorized alien encounters.”
Senate Minority Leader Lori Berman, D-Boca Raton, wants a more comprehensive public database of who gets detained and how, where they were born, where they’re being held, and if they’re moved to another prison.
Right now, if someone is held in one of the state’s Sites of Penal Alliteration — ”Alligator Alcatraz,” “Deportation Depot” — their families and their lawyers may not be able to locate them.
However, as long as Gov. Ron DeSantis can keep claiming Florida is under a “state of emergency” (renewed for the 19th time in December), legislative oversight can be ignored, detainees can be abused in vile facilities, and the state can build all the “Alligator Alcatrazes” it wants.
No accountability.
According to DeSantis, hordes of rampaging undocumented types “remain within the State of Florida;” therefore he needs king-like powers to make sure they’re not running around mowing lawns and mopping nursing home floors.
Sen. Tina Polsky, D-Boca Raton says, “The state of emergency has allowed the governor to skirt more than two dozen state laws, including those related to requirements for competitive bidding, oversight of excessive spending, proper licensing, public transparency, and safety restrictions.”
People, Florida government IS the emergency.
Fetal personhood
Of the 20,000 arrested in Florida last year, a third had some kind of criminal conviction — anything from shoplifting to assault. The others either had no criminal past or else had been charged with heinous offenses such as driving without a license.
Some of those hauled in by ICE have pending asylum claims — they’re here legally. Others are United States citizens.
The worst of the worst, y’all.
Don’t expect anything to happen with these immigration-related proposals.
They’re sponsored by Democrats.
The ruling majority is likely to ignore them completely in favor of bills promoting hatred, cruelty, and destruction.
Rep. Shane Abbott, R-DeFuniak Springs, thinks a family member should be able to sue anyone who aids a woman in getting an abortion, even if, 1. The woman wants the abortion; and 2. The abortion takes place in a state or country where it’s perfectly legal.
Parents could also sue over the “wrongful death” of what SB 164 refers to as “a member of the species Homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb.”
This is a fetal personhood bill.
The persistent Sen. Erin Grall, R-Vero Beach, files it every year, hell-bent on criminalizing miscarriages, medical abortions, perhaps even contraceptives such as IUDs.
It would essentially give a fetus the same legal status as the woman who carries it.
If that’s not enough to make you consider moving to Tierra del Fuego, check out Sen. Stan McClain’s bid to make pollution great again.
Environmental plunder
SB 479 would stop uppity local governments from enacting their own water quality and wetlands protection rules.
Those rules make developers sad.
County and city governments across the state know something McClain and his ilk don’t get: Floridians like nature.
They want to protect local ecosystems.
They want clean water.
Wetlands are critical to clean water.
But this bill would let the Department of Environmental “Protection” decide who gets to pollute and where.
Of course, what they’ll decide is to let the developers who own state government lock, stock, and barrel haul off and build that huge new subdivision.
Never mind the run-off.
Did I mention McClain’s a residential contractor?
Perhaps he’d like to do some business in scrub jay habitat. The little sucker isn’t monetizing it.
And once that land has roads and houses and Starbucks, Publixes, and Wawas, Marion Hammer won’t ever have to worry about that bird again.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PC12185.jpg,,,2026-01-12 00:12:09.892877

This first of three pieces reviews what the Act does not do; its most beneficial provisions (most of which are not directly related to housing production); and two important study committees from which the Act requires reports in early 2026. Both have potential to improve or obstruct affordable housing. 
Part Two, tomorrow, will discuss the new Council on Housing Development and the Act’s housing programs: parking rules; transit-oriented communities; conversions of commercial and mixed-use zones to middle housing; priority housing development zones; Department of Housing-led developments; and tweaks to § 8-30g’s moratorium rules.  
Part Three will address the Act’s new regime of municipal and regional housing growth plans; and opportunities for developers and the General Assembly in 2026.
As we explain below, overall, the Act has many good provisions, but also too many sections that are confusing, and some that conflict with existing law and will likely be dysfunctional in practice.
What the act does not do
The Act does not tinker with, much less overhaul, the core problem of our land-use system:  169 towns, each exercising the broad discretionary powers of General Statutes § 8-2, the Zoning Enabling Act.  
In September 2024, Tim Hollister, a co-author of this article, wrote about how our system preserves the parochial status quo of exclusionary regulation and economic segregation.  
He stated that the legislature should recognize how towns are using their land-use authority to prevent lower-cost housing production; devise a list of powers and procedures to be purged or pruned; and then summon the political will to revise the state-local balance of delegated authority.  The new Act does little to address this goal, and in fact creates more roadblocks to progress.  The Act refers to financial incentives to amend zoning regulations but those “carrots” are not yet spelled out, and the Act otherwise contains no zoning regulation revision mandates.  There are no bold initiatives similar to what other states have adopted in recent years.
Continuing a statewide trend years in the making, the Act reconfirms a central role for General Statutes § 8-30g, the affordable housing statute, not only by leaving it substantively unchanged but also by adopting, in the new housing programs, several measures that utilize standards taken from § 8-30g, such as specifying when land-use commissions must demonstrate a public health or safety basis for denying permits (the § 8-30g standard), rather than the traditional standard of “health, safety, and the general welfare.”  The new Act recognizes that § 8-30g is now embedded in dozens of local housing programs and is here to stay.
The Act incentivizes municipalities to work with the Connecticut Municipal Development Authority (CMDA), created in 2019, funded in 2024, and now up-and-running.  That program encourages development agreements that will commit towns to affordable and multi-family development, mainly in transit-oriented locations.  However, the Act creates several new housing programs that will ostensibly compete and maybe conflict with the CMDA program, and with little explanation as to how the revised package of programs should work together.
A non-transparent process that led to poor drafting
Simply put, the new Act is replete with provisions that are confusing at best and others that, while relatively clear, display misunderstandings of existing Connecticut land-use law and establish new standards and procedures that will conflict with existing statutes, caselaw, and practice.
How did this happen? After the proposed text of the new Act was introduced at the November 2025 special session as House Bill 8002 (the bill vetoed by the Gov, Ned Lamont in June 2025 was House Bill 5002), the proponents tried to justify its immediate adoption, without public hearings or time for vetting the text, by explaining that the legislature had held numerous hearings on an array of housing issues during the 2025 regular session.  But this fact does not justify House Bill 8002 being made public on November 7 and then, under an “emergency certification,” voted on just days later.
Though no one in leadership has said so, the apparent emergency was avoiding giving opponents of the bill time to pick at it line by line, section by section.  Also, H.B. 8002, 53 sections and 107 pages, was not introduced as an amendment to H.B. 5002 but as a brand new document, such that comparing H.B. 8002 to H.B. 5002, much less in five days, was essentially impossible.   So, the new Act did not receive any public hearings or review of its wording.  As a result, the Act contains errors, misstatements, and several provisions that conflict with existing law and create impossible standards.
We intend no disrespect to the drafters.  They had a tough job.  Our point is that the final product could have been vastly improved with time for scrutiny.
Program notes
The good parts of the Act are mainly the holdovers from H.B. 5002 –provisions that were not the reasons for the governor’s June 2025 veto.  These provisions recognize that our affordable housing crisis has many facets and requires multiple approaches.
As you are reading this, most of the Act’s provisions are already in effect, adopted “from passage” on November 26 or effective January 1, 2026. Effective from passage are the sections creating the new Council on Housing Development; committees to study the § 8-30g Ten Percent List and sewer/wastewater policies; a pilot program of mobile showers and laundry facilities for the homeless; and priority access to environmental remediation funding for municipalities that adopt zoning regulations allowing conversion of commercial building to residential use.  
The only provisions delayed to July 1, 2026 are revisions to General Statutes § 8-2s regarding conversion of land zoned commercial or mixed-use to “transit community middle housing,” and the new standards for parking in residential developments.
On the other hand, a defining feature of the new Act is its extended timelines, in the form of far-out or unstated deadlines.  Future guidance on multiple matters will be issued by the Office of Policy and Management (OPM) and the Department of Housing (DOH).  The all-important housing growth plans will not be filed until 2028 and 2029.
Another notable point is the dispersion of authority over housing development to OPM instead of DOH.  It is hard to discern the basis for this shift, but going forward, OPM will be more of a major player in affordable housing development than previously.  This feature is also curious because, of course, a central theme of the governor’s office in 2025 was that municipalities, not the state, should “take the lead” in planning and zoning for affordable housing. In fact, while the Act does not force municipalities to adopt zoning regulations, overall the Act creates pervasive state agency oversight of the supposedly voluntary local and regional programs it introduces.
When reviewing our summaries below, the reader should pay attention to several provisions that address just “housing,” not specifically subsidized or affordable housing.  This may be a subtle shift forced by opponents of the prior bill’s tight focus on affordable units.
The Act contains 53 sections, but because most are now in effect and being codified into the General Statutes, we have included only minimal references to sections and subsections.
Finally, please bear in mind the variety of audiences we are addressing in these articles.  Many in local government and the development community need to understand the at-times-eyewatering procedural details, so we have tried to strike a balance between being complete and accurate but not going overboard with minutia.
Changes to existing housing programs
The Act makes these improvements to existing programs:

For the homeless population, creating a two-year pilot program of mobile vans with showers and health care service; and a permanent ban on “hostile architecture,” meaning physical obstacles that prevent the homeless from sitting or resting (Sections 23 and 26);
Modifying of rental assistance and voucher programs, including allowing non-profit entities to administer such programs and expanding the geographic areas where households use financial assistance (Section 28, 29);
Additional protections of renters and tenants in the eviction process (Sections 37-39);
Requiring about 30 cities and towns with a population between 15,000 and 25,000 to establish a fair rent commission or join a multi-town or regional commission (Section 35);
Extending existing protection of mobile manufactured homes and mobile home parks from zoning regulations that treat them differently from single-family, multi-family, and cluster housing, to homes narrower than 22 feet wide, provided that the home is built in compliance with federal safety standards (Section 18);
Banning the use of certain formulas and algorithms to calculate or set rents (Section 32);
Requiring additional reporting by municipal housing authorities about such matters as rental prices in relation to household income (Section 44); and
Authorizing the State Attorney General’s office to enforce the state’s fair housing and anti-discrimination laws in the same manner as the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities (CHRO) (Section 31).

Financial programs
The Act’s primary financial incentive is a grants-in-aid program administered by OPM to assist municipalities with costs of housing-related construction and infrastructure (Section 15).  However, no amount of funding has been specified, and OPM will issue details at some unspecified later time.  To be eligible for grants, a municipality must be in compliance with its housing growth plan or its regional council plan (to be explained in Part Three of this series); have in place a development agreement with the Connecticut Municipal Development Authority; or “meet additional criteria” to be developed by OPM.
Every good Act needs a “sleeper” provision, a section that seems innocuous but could have outsized impact.  The Act adds to the public school construction cost reimbursement program a five percentage point increase if the municipality is in compliance with its municipal or regional housing growth plan; has qualified as a transit-oriented community under the Act; or has entered into a development agreement with the CMDA.  If the school construction cost is, for example, $50 million, five percent could be a substantial financial incentive (Section 46).
In addition, the Act contains:

A modest income tax credit, based on household income limits, for first-time home buyers (Sections 1-3);
Expansion of CHFA’s Smart Rate Pilot Interest Rate Reduction Program, to provide additional help to mortgage borrowers (Section 36);
Additional funds for regional planning agencies to help them provide technical help with planning, development, stormwater control, and flood management (Section 30);
Direction to the DOH to establish an Affordable Housing Real Estate Investment Trust pilot program, to provide grants to municipalities with a population of 130,000 to 140,000, which apparently means New Haven and Stamford (Section 43);
Authorization to OPM to provide grants to regional councils of government to support public transit, bicycle, and pedestrian infrastructure (Section 25);
Direction to the DOH to establish a program by which union pension funds may “coinvest” in affordable housing development and thereby “create employment opportunities in the construction industry” (Section 34); and
DOH also is given new authority to make grants to municipalities of less than 50,000 for development of middle housing (Section 27).

Land use procedural reform
The Act eliminates the two-thirds “supermajority vote” provision that kicks in if adjacent property owners file a so-called “protest petition” to oppose a zone change application (these petitions are an antiquated exclusionary zoning tool), in favor of a simple majority vote (as is otherwise now required of all zone change applications), and an increase in the minimum amount of land abutting the zone change that the protest petitioners must own in order to file, from 20 to 50 percent (Section 24).  
The Act also clarifies which municipal body can vote to opt out of the 2021 standards for accessory apartments (Section 22).
Further study
The Act establishes two committees that will file reports in the 2026 legislative session and could be very important to affordable housing.  
The first is an interagency task force to study the state’s wastewater and sewer programs and the powers of municipal sewer commissions (Section 33).  Sewers are a well-established and frequently-used mechanism to prevent multi-family and affordable housing development, so this group has an opportunity to curb misuse of sewers to block housing.  
Second is a committee to study the § 8-30g “Ten Percent List,” by which DOH counts each municipality’s total affordable housing stock and exempts from § 8-30g those with more than ten percent affordable (Section 42).  
It seems inevitable that every municipality that wants to be shielded from § 8-30g application without having to produce any new housing will descend on this committee and argue that the current system has “failed” and/or is unfair. The committee should resist this pressure.  
The Ten Percent List was established in the original 1989 § 8-30g legislation to exempt about 30 of our 169 towns that had the highest percentages of existing affordable, deed-restricted, or subsidized units.  The ten percent threshold is, of course, a policy-driven number, but it has worked as intended for 35 years.  This committee should dismiss the naysayers who assert that other towns, not theirs, should shoulder the responsibility for affordable housing. 
Tim Hollister and Andrea Gomes are land use attorneys at the Hartford office of Hinckley Allen.  They both work regularly on affordable housing development.  
In 2022-23, Hollister co-chaired a statewide working group tasked by the legislature with reviewing all of the affordable housing plans (so-called “§ 8-30j plans”) prepared by nearly all municipalities and providing recommendations on how such plans could be improved.  In September 2024, he published here a five-part series about affordable housing reform and in July 2025, a two-part series explaining House Bill 5002, the one vetoed by the governor in June 2025, and what could be done to fix it.
Gomes regularly represents clients before local and state agencies and in state court. She has assisted with obtaining municipal approvals and litigating affordable housing matters and property disputes such as quiet title actions, easement disputes, nuisance actions, and adverse possession cases. 
Attorney Raphael Podolsky also contributed to this series.

But over the last decade, Connecticut’s largest cities have repeatedly demonstrated that our system is far too vulnerable to manipulation — especially when it comes to absentee ballots.
Bridgeport has become the national poster child for absentee-ballot abuse. Surveillance footage showing individuals depositing stacks of ballots into drop boxes during a contested mayoral primary forced a court to order a do-over election — a stunning acknowledgment that the integrity of the process had been compromised. That case produced multiple arrests and over a hundred criminal counts, including allegations of unlawful possession of absentee ballots and organized ballot “harvesting.”

Timothy Herbst

Stamford has seen its own high-profile failures. A years-long investigation into the 2015 municipal election revealed forged absentee-ballot applications and ballots. A former Democratic city chairman was convicted of multiple felonies; a former city clerk faced penalties for improper handling of ballots. These were not technical violations — they were deliberate abuses carried out by individuals entrusted with civic responsibility.
New Haven has faced documented cases involving fraudulent petition signatures and campaign-related election crimes, adding yet another layer to the pattern of misconduct in Connecticut’s urban political machines.
What ties these incidents together is not geography, but method. Time after time, the abuses involve absentee ballots — and most often, party operatives and campaign workers who handle ballots they shouldn’t. The public record speaks plainly: in the cities where ballot fraud has been documented, it has overwhelmingly involved local Democratic organizations and political insiders who exploited weak rules and minimal enforcement.
This isn’t about partisanship. It’s about honesty. And honesty requires acknowledging that Connecticut’s current laws do not deter organized schemes. When the worst offenders face fines or probation, not jail time, it sends a clear message: the risk is worth it, and the consequences are tolerable.
If Connecticut is serious about restoring election integrity, we need to strengthen absentee-ballot laws — and we must finally adopt a statewide voter ID requirement.
Voter ID is a necessary part of the solution
For all the debate, the truth is straightforward: the cities that have seen the most documented election abuses are the ones with the least safeguards. A uniform, statewide voter ID law — requiring a simple, government-issued photo ID at the polls — would bring Connecticut in line with the overwhelming majority of states and close one more avenue for misrepresentation.
Most Americans, including majorities of Democrats, Independents, and Republicans, support voter ID. It protects honest voters without stopping eligible voters from participating. If we are tightening absentee-ballot rules, it makes no sense to leave our in-person voting rules unchanged. Integrity requires consistency.
Five reforms Connecticut must enact now

Strengthen penalties for unlawful ballot possession and organized “harvesting.”Repeated or coordinated handling of absentee ballots should be a felony with real prison exposure, not a fine or suspended sentence.
Ban third-party ballot collection except for narrow categories of authorized agents. If a ballot leaves a voter’s hands, there must be a clear, provable chain of custody — no exceptions, no gray zones.
Require rapid referral of evidence to prosecutors. When the State Elections Enforcement Commission identifies likely misconduct, the case should move to the Chief State’s Attorney within 30 days, with mandatory evidence preservation.
Create enhanced penalties for public employees and officials who abuse their office. When registrars, clerks, or municipal employees engage in ballot misconduct, the law should mandate immediate suspension and heightened criminal penalties.
Secure ballot drop boxes and improve public notice.  Drop boxes should be monitored, alarmed, and clearly marked with warnings that illegal ballot collection is a crime. Public education must be proactive, not reactive.

The stakes could not be higher
Democracy is not self-enforcing. It relies on rules we trust and institutions we believe in. When voters in Bridgeport, Stamford, or New Haven see ballots mishandled, forged, or collected illegally, confidence collapses — not just in those cities, but statewide.
Connecticut cannot keep treating each scandal as an isolated event. The pattern is real, the damage is cumulative, and the public’s patience is running out. Strengthening absentee-ballot laws, adopting voter ID, and imposing meaningful penalties are not partisan measures. They are basic safeguards needed to ensure that every voter — regardless of party or ZIP code — can trust that their vote counts exactly once, and only once.
If we wait for the next scandal, it will be too late. The legislature should act now.

Since President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20, ICE arrests have soared in Maryland and across the country. (Photo by Immigration and Customs Enforcement)The GoFundMe page Julia Leverone created in February for legal fees and bond payments to get Minoska Maldonado-Deras out of Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody was successful, helping to get her out of custody and back with her family in Carroll County.
That’s until Maldonado-Deras, a cousin of Leverone’s husband, was hauled back into  custody during an appointment with ICE in October. She’s now in an ICE detention facility in Lousiana, and the GoFundMe page is back in business.
Maldonado-Deras was “doing everything she was supposed to do” following her first detainment, said her husband, Patrick Sortino, including probation meetings with ICE.
Sortino, a U.S. citizen, says he doesn’t have “any straight answers,” about what will happen to his wife, whether she will be granted bail or deported to Honduras — her native country that she has not been to in nearly 20 years.
“This was her new life, you know — here,” Sortino said. “We were hoping to spend the holidays together.”
Maldonado-Deras is one of the more 3,200 people in Maryland who were arrested by ICE from Jan. 21, 2025, the day after President Donald Trump returned to office, through Oct. 15, 2025. The data comes from the Deportation Data Project.
What comes after the ICE arrest video?

All told, ICE had arrested 3,308 people in Maryland from Jan. 1 to Oct.15, 2025, the last date that for which the Deportation Data Project provided numbers. That compares to 1,353 for all of 2024 and 387 for the last four months of 2023, according to the data.
ICE did not respond to Maryland Matters’ request for data.
Only one-third (1,073) of those arrested in Maryland had criminal convictions, and 50.9% (1,652) had no criminal charges whatsoever. The remaining 519 have or had criminal charges pending at the time of their detention.
“The administration comes out promising to deport millions and millions of illegal criminals, and what they’ve done instead is started picking up moms and grandfathers … who have no criminal convictions,” said Ben Messer, a senior immigration attorney at Wilkes Legal.
Nearly all of those detained originally went to holding rooms or field offices in Maryland, most often in Baltimore, with many then transferred to out-of-state locations — some being thousands of miles away.
Messer says there are more people asking for help since the Trump administration took over in January, but the ways that attorneys are able to help are dwindling because of the administration “closing off areas of relief.”
“Some people who would have had a case before are going to be unable to succeed under drastic changes in interpretation of law,” Messer said. “The cases that do remain are just quite a bit more difficult for the same reason.”
BWI protests fell short, but airline will still end deportation flights

There has been a “bloodbath” of immigration court judges due to actions by the Board of Immigration Appeals and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Messer said. Judges who have previously represented immigrants or worked at pro-immigrant organizations have been fired, he said, with some of them being replaced by military lawyers.
“We have a few of these temporary immigration judges now in our area — the DMV [D.C., Maryland, Virginia] — and they’ve supposedly gotten a crash course in immigration law, but none of them have any experience in it,” Messer said.
Messer noted that the Board of Immigration Appeals and Bondi’s decision to overturn “decades of practice and precedent” by determining that anyone who came to the U.S. without a visa does not have bond eligibility — a decision which many federal courts have rejected — as one of the new challenges.
The Justice Department, in a statement, disagreed with Messer’s assessment, saying the new interpretations of the law are common sense.
“The Executive Office for Immigration Review is restoring integrity to the immigration adjudication system, and Board of Immigration Appeals decisions reflect straightforward interpretations of clear statutory language,” a Justice Department spokesperson said in a statement.
“President Trump and the Department of Justice will continue to enforce the law as it is written to defend and protect the safety and security of the American people,” the statement said.

To make the best decision, we need a full and accurate picture of the impacts. The recent Friends of Sligo Creek report (SCR) presents only part of that picture and overlooks key facts. Having worked with the county as a community advocate for over 10 years, I hope to clarify those gaps so we can choose the option that does the least harm.
Solid waste management is complex. Responsible decisions require accurate comparisons of risks and benefits, something the SCR did not provide. I contributed to a comprehensive report  – Beyond Incineration – commissioned by the county executive that evaluated all available waste management options using a peer-reviewed life cycle analysis (MEBCalc) with public health and environmental justice criteria to identify the least-harm option. Many of the SCR’s conclusions do not align with those findings. Find a point-by-point review of this report here.

The SCR notes that the incinerator meets all but one EPA limit for emissions. This is not accurate. First, with regard to greenhouse gases, there are NO limits on carbon dioxide from incinerators in federal regs and there are no scrubbers in place.
Regarding toxic emissions, our incinerator not only exceeds the EPA limits for hydrogen chloride, it produces more than double the nitrogen oxides that any new incinerator would have to meet. Even more alarmingly, a Nov. 11 report by the incinerator operator, Reworld, revealed that the annual stack test showed dioxin and furan levels nearly double EPA limits. These are two of the deadliest substances known to science – there is no safe established limit. These toxins could have been streaming undetected into our airshed for the past 12 months.
For the rest, “meeting limits” does not mean our incinerator’s emissions are safe. The report relies on older studies to suggest the incinerator’s toxic emissions pose “negligible” health risk. Current health science recognizes the danger of cumulative exposure from multiple pollution sources.
The SCR also does not compare the incinerator directly to modern landfills. Our incinerator emits far more toxic pollutants — including mercury, dioxins, sulfur dioxide, arsenic, beryllium, lead, nitrogen oxides and fine particulate matter — than the landfills evaluated in the county’s study.
On environmental justice, the report raises concerns about landfills nationally but does not note that the Montgomery County report evaluated 42 regional landfills and found five that met every equity and performance criterion. We emit approximately 600,000 tons of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) annually. The top 10 landfills the Beyond Incineration report vetted emit an average of half that, much of which is methane. Gas capture rates would have to go as low as 30% for CO2e to be close to the incinerator’s. With health and environmental impacts added, not just climate impacts, incineration is still worse than landfilling even if there is 0% gas capture (see chart here).
The SCR also suggests keeping waste disposal “close to home.” While proximity can matter, it should not outweigh health and safety. The incinerator’s emissions affect communities near the facility and downwind. We send more than 150,000 tons of toxic ash each year to a majority-Black community outside Richmond, Virginia. Ceasing incineration would end this burden for both communities.
Vetted landfills pose the lowest pollution and toxic exposure risks for both Montgomery County and the receiving community.
Notably, Montgomery County is not planning to rely on landfilling alone. The county is already piloting countywide food-scrap composting and Save-As-You-Throw pricing. These strategies will significantly reduce the volume of waste ultimately buried. Thus, landfilling is part of a structured transition to significantly reduce waste overall and reduce costs. A Department of Environmental Protection report in July showed that moving to straight landfill will have slightly increased costs in the first year, but over the following years costs will drop considerably.
After years of study, the county concluded that closing the incinerator and using well-vetted landfills while expanding waste-reduction programs reduces toxic emissions, lowers climate impacts, protects vulnerable communities and aligns with long-term sustainability goals. I applaud our county leaders for moving toward a solution based on current science, best practices in waste management, modern health research, and a commitment to fairness for all communities touched by our waste disposal system.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/52469466397_e9d1353222_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-12 06:12:23.844289

In Fargo, an estimated 500 people gathered for a demonstration organized by Red River United Indivisible. 
Jerrod Baetsch stood with an American flag upside down — a sign of distress — as a north wind blew in the face of protesters lining a Red River bridge connecting Fargo and Moorhead, Minnesota. 
“To stay at home felt useless,” Baetsch said of joining Saturday’s protest of the shooting of Renee Good, a mother who was killed Wednesday by Jonathan Ross, an ICE agent in Minneapolis.

The demonstrations follow thousands of ICE agents deployed to neighboring Minnesota. Good’s wife, Rebecca Good, told the Washington Post they were supporting neighbors before the ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good. Video of the incident shows Renee Good’s vehicle blocking traffic and ICE officers approaching the vehicle, with one officer ordering her to exit her vehicle. Ross fired as Good pulled the vehicle forward.
Baetsch said any actions by Good in her vehicle did not justify the use of deadly force. 
The crowd observed a moment of silence for Good after gathering near a Statue of Liberty replica on the Fargo end of the Veterans Memorial Bridge. 
Minnesota begins collecting evidence into ICE shooting following ousting by feds

Speaking to the crowd, Colby Montigue of Fargo, urged people to continue to protest, organize and run for office. 
“This doesn’t stop until we do the work,” said Montigue, a member of the Red River Valley Democratic Socialists of America. 
Minnesota officials announced Friday they’re collecting evidence in an investigation of the shooting and are asking the public to submit information.
In Bismarck, demonstrators lined Boulevard Avenue on Sunday to rally outside the Capitol during an event called ICE Out for Good.
Cherie Schumacher, a volunteer organizer for Missouri River Indivisible, said there were a lot of hateful comments made on social media ahead of the Bismarck event, to the point that “it was actually kind of scary to go.”
Most people driving by had positive responses, Schumacher said, except for someone who drove by and fired what she described as foam BBs at participants as the event was ending. Schumacher said she was hit in the shoulder and someone else was hit in the back.
“They were just these little tiny foam things, so there was no harm to us,” she said. “But it’s sending a message anytime someone points anything at you to target you.”

Another event was held Saturday in Grand Forks, with the Grand Forks Herald reporting a crowd of about 150 people. 
The North Dakota Human Rights Coalition was among groups that condemned the killing of Good last week.  
“We urge residents to contact their representatives to demand oversight of federal enforcement actions, protections for freedom of speech and the right to protest, and policies that prioritize life, dignity, and community-based safety,” the organization said in a statement.

The predawn fire Saturday reduced the Beth Israel Congregation’s library and administrative offices to charred ruins and left smoke damage throughout the building. The destruction occurred in the same part of the building that was damaged when Ku Klux Klan members bombed the temple in 1967 because of the rabbi’s outspoken support of civil rights. 
Local and federal law enforcement made an arrest Saturday night after the suspect was found at a Jackson hospital with burns that were not life-threatening, said Charles Felton, a chief investigator with the Jackson Fire Department.

The fire was ruled an arson, meaning it was intentionally set. By Sunday afternoon, law enforcement had not released the suspect’s name, the exact charges he will face or a possible motive. It was not immediately clear whether investigators consider this a hate crime. 
A Mississippi Today reporter watched a segment of the congregation’s security-camera footage only hours before the arrest was announced Saturday. It showed a person wearing a hooded shirt and a mask over most of his face. The person was holding what appears to be a plastic container while dousing the inside of the lobby with liquid, including a wall adorned with the synagogue’s Tree of Life, an installation that marks special occasions for congregants such as bar and bat mitzvahs.
The video footage has become part of a joint federal, state and local investigation.

The fire was reported shortly after 3 a.m. Saturday, and firefighters extinguished it before sunrise. No congregants or firefighters were injured.
Beth Israel’s congregation president, Zach Shemper, said in a statement Sunday that damage assessment continues, and several churches have extended offers for Beth Israel congregants to use their buildings for worship space. He said the congregation has established a donation fund for rebuilding, with a link on the congregation’s website.
“We are a resilient people,” Shemper said. “With support from our community, we will rebuild.”
Jewish congregations have been attacked in the U.S. in the past several years, including in Pittsburgh, the San Diego area and Colleyville, Texas. The attacks have come amid a rise in  anti-Semitic rhetoric in public spaces and on social media.
News of the fire at Beth Israel prompted an outpouring of support from the Jackson metro area, including from Mayor John Horhn and local religious leaders.
The Rev. CJ Rhodes, pastor of Mount Helm Baptist Church in downtown Jackson, said on social media Sunday that Beth Israel Congregation “holds a sacred place in Jackson’s moral history” because of its courageous support of the Civil Rights Movement. 
Rhodes also said that attacks on houses of worship “strike at the heart of our shared moral life.” He called on people to pray for the Beth Israel Congregation and stand in solidarity with them.
“An injury to one faith community is a concern for us all,” Rhodes said.

Mississippi also has a history of bombings at Black churches. Those reached a peak during the Civil Rights Movement, including the June 1964 arson of Mount Zion Church in Neshoba County — a Ku Klux Klan conspiracy that drew civil rights workers Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman to the area to investigate the fire. 
Chaney was Black, and Goodman and Schwerner were Jewish. After the three young men were jailed a few hours in Philadelphia on an accusation that Chaney was speeding, they were released. Waiting Klansmen chased them on a rural highway, pulled them over and shot them to death. 
Beth Israel is Jackson’s only synagogue, with about 150 families. The congregation does not have a count of individual members but says a family could be one person or multiple people.

Two Torahs were destroyed and five were damaged in the flames that erupted during Shabbat, the weekly Jewish day of rest, according to temple leaders. One Torah that survived the Holocaust was in a glass case and was undamaged in the fire.
The day after the fire, Beth Israel held children’s Sunday school at a museum in Jackson. 
News of the fire drew international attention, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center is among several groups condemning the attack. 
“We owe gratitude to law enforcement for their swift response, and to civic and religious leaders from other faiths who made it clear that the Jewish community would not stand alone,” the center’s CEO, Jim Berk said in a statement Sunday. “Their leadership is a signal that hate will be met head-on, not met with silence.”

Four different Salesianum players scored in double figures defeating the Buccaneers, 80-71, Friday night.
 
WILMINGTON — With just over four minutes to play in the third quarter, Salesianum freshman Braelin Sosa stole the ball and drove toward the basket. A pair of defenders stopped his momentum forcing him to pass to the top of the key where senior Dominic Downs was awaiting the pass. Downs caught the pass and knocked down his third three-pointer of the game giving Sallies a 19-point lead they never relinquished. 
Salesianum handed Caravel its first loss of the season defeating the Buccaneers, 80-71, January 9 at Birkenheuer Memorial Gymnasium. 
The Buccaneers bounced back following Downs’ three-pointer by scoring six straight points to cut into the Sallies lead. The Sals ended the quarter on a 7-2 scoring run bumping their lead to 17 points going into the final frame.
At the start of the fourth quarter, Caravel mounted another strong comeback attempt. Junior Niquon Lee scored the first seven points of the quarter hitting shots from all three levels of the court. Lee started the fourth quarter with a three from the left corner, moved into the mid-range for his next bucket and then scored at the rim to cut the Sallies lead to ten. A steal and fastbreak score by senior Michael Sheehan brought the Salesianum lead to single digits for the first time since early in the third quarter. 
Salesianum senior Latrell Wright ended the 9-0 Caravel run with a right handed layup getting the score through a foul. Wright made the free throw, increasing the Sallies lead back to double figures. 
Like it was for most of the game, the fourth quarter moved quickly with both teams getting good looks at the basket. The Buccaneers cut the Sallies lead down to eight with a little over a minute remaining, but a strong performance from Salesianum at the free throw line — six for eight in the last 1:30 — kept Caravel from earning its ninth victory of the season and continuing its undefeated start to the year.
Downs finished as Sallies’ leading scorer with 17 points on three made three-pointers. Fellow seniors Kevin Coleman and Mark Brown finished in double figures along with freshman Braelin Sosa who ended with ten points. Lee was the game’s leading scorer with 20 points, eight of those coming in the fourth quarter. Sheehan finished the game with 16 points along with sophomore Prince McKnight.
Sallies will play twice next week taking on Middletown on Tuesday before returning for a two game home stand that begins on Friday against Odessa.

He was 79.
Codey’s family announced the news on Facebook, calling him “a beloved husband, father and grandfather.”
“New Jersey lost a remarkable public servant who touched the lives of all who knew him,” they said.
Codey, a Democrat, retired from the New Jersey Legislature in January 2024, capping 50 years as a member of the body representing parts of Essex County. He was first elected to the state Assembly in 1973 and became a state senator in 1982. He served as acting governor starting in 2004 following the resignation of Gov. Jim McGreevey, and again for nearly a month when Gov. Jon Corzine was injured in a car crash in 2007.
Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) called Codey “a remarkable public servant.”
“Dick Codey lived his life with humility, compassion and a deep sense of responsibility. He spoke the truth when others wouldn’t and he fought tirelessly to improve the lives of the people of New Jersey during his record-setting 50 years of service in the Legislature and as Governor. He gained the trust and respect of other public officials and made friends with Presidents just as easily as he did with strangers in all-night diners,” Scutari said.
Sen. Anthony Bucco (R-Morris), the Senate’s minority leader, said he is “heartbroken” over the loss.
“We worked together on many important issues that helped move New Jersey forward, and I came to know him as a true friend and someone who led with humility, kindness, and humor. He leaves behind a lasting legacy of service and integrity that will be felt for generations. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and all those whose lives he touched during this very difficult time,” Bucco said.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s top law enforcement official wants lawmakers to stiffen penalties for selling drugs in prison and making deepfake pornography, to create consumer protections for DNA data, and to give internet crime investigators swifter access to suspects’ user data.
Those bills are among the 10 proposed by Attorney General Marty Jackley for the 2026 legislative session that begins Tuesday at the Capitol in Pierre.
In a news release Wednesday, Jackley said the package “focuses on many issues this office has dealt with in the past year” and that he looks forward to “working with the governor and legislators during the session on these important opportunities to protect South Dakota.”
Lawmakers have endorsed most of Jackley’s proposals during each legislative session since his ascent to a second stint as attorney general in the 2022 general election.
Some proposals have seen tweaks, however, including one in 2025 that attempted to affix felony penalties for the failure of state employee supervisors to report employee misconduct. Lawmakers passed that bill, but ultimately opted for misdemeanor penalties.
Here are summaries of this year’s proposals.
Senate Bill 17: Foreign political donations
This bill would bar political candidates in South Dakota from accepting donations from foreign nationals. It aims to amend an existing law that prohibits campaign contributions from states, state agencies, foreign governments, federal agencies or the federal government. One violation could net a year in jail and a $2,000 fine. Two or more violations in a single year could draw up to two years in prison.
Senate Bill 41: Deepfakes
This bill targets “deepfake” pornography, created with digital technology to resemble a real person without that person’s consent. The bill would amend an existing law, adding a definition of “digitally fabricated material” and making it a crime to “create, disclose, disseminate, distribute, or sell” such material when it depicts a nonconsenting person in a “state of nudity,” or engaged in any manner of sexual act.
Senate Bill 42: Prison drugs
Currently, possession of controlled substances in prison — by inmates or staff members — is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. This bill would up the penalty to a maximum of 15 years. The bill would also update the state’s drug ingestion statutes to make it a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison, for an inmate or parolee to fail a drug test for controlled substances. Ingestion of a controlled substance was a felony for everyone until last year, when lawmakers voted to make first- and second-offense ingestion a misdemeanor. Jackley opposed that move.
Senate Bill 43: Digital currency seizures
Currently, law enforcement is empowered to seize money and property with suspected ties to felony crimes during criminal investigations. This bill would add “digital currency” like Bitcoin to law enforcement’s list of assets seizable during criminal investigations.
Senate Bill 44: Internet crimes
This bill would let the attorney general or a designee ask a Hughes County judge to subpoena information on internet users suspected of crimes against children or human trafficking. Hughes County judges would be able to issue those subpoenas regardless of where a crime took place, where the suspect’s internet service provider might be located, or where the subpoena would be enforced. The multi-agency Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force is headquartered in Pierre, which is in Hughes County.
Senate Bill 45: Marijuana-like intoxicants
Selling products made with the marijuana-like intoxicant known as delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (Delta-9 THC-A on product labels) to anyone younger than 21 could draw up to two years in prison under the terms of this bill. Buying THC-A products for or sharing them with a person under 21 would also be forbidden. Other products containing pot-like compounds, including Delta-8 THC or THC-O, are already covered by the provisions of the law SB 45 seeks to amend.
Senate Bill 46: Public meeting agendas
This bill would require agendas for open public meetings to list every item to be discussed. Each agenda item would also need to be “described in sufficient detail to reasonably inform the public of any official business or public policy intended to be considered at the meeting.” Violations would be punishable by up to 30 days in jail and a $500 fine.
Senate Bill 47: Closed sessions of public meetings
This bill would revise the rules for closed-door executive sessions during public meetings. It would add a handful of items, such as discussions of cybersecurity and talk of ammunition locations, to the list of acceptable reasons to go into executive session. The bill would also require that votes to enter an executive session and the section of law justifying the session be logged in the meeting minutes. Violations could draw up to 30 days in jail and a $500 fine.
Senate Bill 48: Advance meeting notices
This bill would “clarify” that agendas for public meetings of state agencies or commissions must be posted online 72 hours in advance of a meeting, not counting Saturdays, Sundays or legal holidays. Current law requires a 72-hour notice at the “principal office of the board, commission, or department holding the meeting” but doesn’t specify the timing for posting an online agenda. Violations of the law could draw up to 30 days in jail and a $500 fine.
Senate Bill 49: DNA data
This one is designed to protect consumer privacy as it relates to DNA data. It says that any person or organization that collects DNA has to spell out privacy policies and tell consumers upfront if their DNA will be shared with any partner organization. It would be illegal to share or sell DNA data to others without the express consent of the person who provided it, unless the data is “de-identified” and shared for research purposes alone. DNA collectors would also be required to let people access their own data and delete it upon request. Violations could draw civil penalties of up to $5,000 per violation. The rules wouldn’t apply for colleges, research institutions or forensic laboratories, or to data collected for medical purposes.

Linda McMahon, the nation’s secretary of education, says public schools are failing.
In November, she promised a “hard reset” of the system in which more than 80% of U.S. children learn. But rather than invest in public education, she has been working to dismantle the Department of Education and enact wholesale changes to how public schools operate.
“Our final mission as a department is to fully empower states to carry the torch of our educational renaissance,” she said at a November press conference.
To help her carry out these and other goals, McMahon has brought at least 20 advisers from ultraconservative think tanks and advocacy groups who share her skepticism of the value of public education and seek deep changes, including instilling Christian values into public schools.
ProPublica reporters Jennifer Smith Richards and Megan O’Matz spent months reporting and reviewing dozens of hours of video to understand the ideals and ambitions of those pulling the levers of power in federal education policy. They found a concerted push to shrink public school systems by steering taxpayer dollars to private, religious and charter schools, as well as options like homeschooling. The Education Department did not respond to a detailed list of questions from ProPublica.
They also found top officials expressing a vision for the remaining public schools that rejects the separation of church and state and promotes a pro-America vision of history, an “uplifting portrayal of the nation’s founding ideals.” Critics argue the “patriotic” curricula downplay the legacy of slavery and paper over episodes of discrimination.
Since its establishment in 1979, the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights has served as an enforcer of anti-discrimination laws in schools and colleges around the country. It’s the place parents turn to when they believe their schools failed to protect children from discrimination or to provide access to an equal education under the law.
The Trump administration laid off much of the office’s staff in its first months and prioritized investigations into schools that allegedly discriminated against white and Jewish students and accommodated transgender students. McMahon and the department have framed this as a course correction in line with efforts to be more efficient and curb diversity, equity and inclusion policies from prior administrations. It has left little recourse for those seeking to defend the rights of students with disabilities, students of color and those facing sex discrimination.

(Photo by Tom Banse)The days might be numbered for your next Puget Sound ferry ride to be a fleeting offline oasis, free from the incessant demands of email, pop-up ads and doomscrolling. 
Washington State Ferries is yielding to requests from commuters for internet access, which the state Legislature heard and turned into an order for a Wi-Fi pilot project.
In a newly published report to the Legislature, the ferry system laid out its plans for a limited trial of free Wi-Fi at one terminal (Bremerton) and on one ferry, the Chimacum. Installation of antennas and routers is slated for this spring to facilitate a Wi-Fi test period during the summer.
Traveler demand and reviews, along with the availability of future state funding, will determine if a wider rollout happens. The ferry system offered pay-to-use Wi-Fi hotspots previously, but discontinued that partnership in 2016 due to poor performance and low uptake. 
“The public expects to have internet access,” Poulsbo Mayor Becky Erickson wrote in a letter to the head of Washington State Ferries more than a year ago. “For many individuals, internet access is crucial for carrying out their daily tasks efficiently. The absence of internet access on ferries or the Bainbridge Island terminal decreases productivity.”
Cellular data signals sometimes drop out in the middle of the Sound. WSF reported there are also dead zones around bends in Rich Passage on the Seattle-Bremerton route. The San Juan Islands also suffer from cell service dead zones.
The city manager of Bainbridge Island sent in a nearly identical letter after getting unanimous backing from the city council. Similar sentiments filtered up to the state Senate through Kitsap County’s legislators. The result was a 2025 transportation budget proviso that directed the ferry system to give public Wi-Fi another try.
“We do want people to be able to work from the boat if that’s important to them,” explained Senate Transportation Committee Chair Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, in an interview last week.
However, the legislative directive to the ferry system had a catch. It said to carry out the new Wi-Fi pilot project “within existing resources,” which meant no extra money. Thus, the cash-strapped agency told lawmakers this winter it had to focus the tryout on one terminal and one vessel.
“Bremerton is strategically selected because it represents one of the system’s longest sailings, where customer demand for internet connectivity is likely higher, and where the physical layout of the terminal provides a manageable platform for initial installation,” the WSF project outline said.
The ferry Chimacum was chosen not only because it serves Bremerton, but because it has a scheduled maintenance layup in March that aligns nicely to do the hotspot installation with minimal extra disruption.
Technology choices
Satellite-based internet provider Starlink is making rapid inroads with airlines and major cruise lines based on having stable and fast service. The Alaska Marine Highway System recently chose Starlink to provide internet connectivity on the ferry assigned to the Bellingham-Southeast Alaska route.
Starlink has a rising Washington-grown competitor in Amazon Leo, another satellite-based internet vendor. But neither of these two companies will be considered for the ferryboat Wi-Fi deployment on Puget Sound this year. 
“For the first phase of this pilot, we are focusing on cellular data connectivity rather than satellite-based internet. Cellular connectivity is significantly more cost-effective,” ferry system spokesman Justin Fujioka said in an email. “Satellite-based solutions, such as low-Earth orbit providers, may be evaluated in the future.”
Fujioka added that the state’s ferries are equipped with commercial-grade antennas that are more powerful than consumer mobile devices. That could give the onboard Wi-Fi network a leg up over your personal cellular data plan, but Fujioka said slowdowns or brief dropouts could still happen. The ferry system’s previous, ultimately unsatisfying onboard Wi-Fi provider Boingo relied on terrestrial cellular data too, a decade ago.
The deployment schedule provided to the Legislature calls for free Wi-Fi to debut in May and last through August. In September, ferry workers expect to crunch the data on customer usage, technical performance and reliability.
Then they will toss the ball back to management and legislators to decide whether Wi-Fi will be offered permanently, and if so, whether to expand it across more terminals and vessels. A permanent Wi-Fi offering would not necessarily be free of charge. It could be tiered or subscription-based, WSF said.
A key legislator who holds sway over the ferry system budget said the estimated multi-million dollar price tag to roll out Wi-Fi systemwide caught his eye. State House Transportation Committee Chair Jake Fey, D-Tacoma, sounded skeptical about greenlighting big spending for new internet infrastructure and ongoing operational costs in light of all the other needs the beleaguered ferry system has.
“Given that it didn’t work before, I don’t think this would rate” for future funding, Fey said in an interview. “If this came back as uncertain that it would be profitable or break even, I would say another day, not now.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ferry-Chimacum-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-11 07:11:41.176244

Cindy Hyde-Smith?,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/11/democrats-hyde-smith/,"President Donald Trump embraces Sen.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
One variation of an old saying goes, “If ifs and ands were pots and pans, there’d be no work for tinkers,” and another goes, “If a frog had wings he wouldn’t bump his backside when he jumps.”
Those sayings are meant to dissuade people from hypothesizing about an event that is not likely to happen.
They are adages for a reason. They hold elements of truth.
Despite the warnings established by those adages, it is still worth noting that if the Mississippi electorate follows the pattern established by voters in other states in recent elections – even in solidly Republican areas – the Mississippi contest for the U.S. Senate later this year could be closer than expected.
Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, a close ally of President Donald Trump, is a heavy favorite to win reelection this November and continue serving in the nation’s Capitol as Mississippi’s junior senator. Heck, a Democrat has not won a statewide election in Mississippi since Jim Hood garnered reelection as attorney general in 2015.
But in 10 special elections, granted district elections not state contests, held across the country since Dec. 9, Democrats have performed on average 13% better than they did in the previous elections in those same districts.
Even in statewide elections – gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia – the Democrat did better in 2025 than in the previous election in 2021– by 9.4% in Virginia and by 5.6% in New Jersey.
If (there is that word) the Democrat running against Hyde-Smith could do as well this November, the election would be exceedingly close and she could even lose.
In her last election in 2020, she defeated Democrat Mike Espy 54% to 44%. When the pair ran against each other in a special election in 2018 months after Hyde-Smith had been appointed to temporarily fill the Senate seat, Espy garnered 46.4% of the vote.

This time around, Lowndes District Attorney Scott Colom is the favorite to win the Democratic primary on March 10 and face Hyde-Smith in November. He faces opposition from Albert Littell and Priscilla W. Till. Hyde-Smith, for that matter, is being challenged in the Republican primary by Sarah Adlakha and Andrew Smith. 
Ty Pinkins, who has run for statewide office in the past as a Democrat, will be vying in the Senate contest in the November general election as an independent, creating an additional headwind for the Democratic nominee. 
Democrats have exceeded their performances in recent elections presumably because of voter disenchantment with Republican President Trump.

A key question is whether voters in Mississippi, where Trump has historically been popular, feel the same disenchantment?
Trump faces various headwinds right now. Many voters are still struggling with economic woes. Plus, Trump still faces questions concerning his closeness to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and the fact that the U.S. Department of Justice seems to be violating the law to slow-walk the release of files that perhaps could shed light on that relationship. Then, there are questions about Trump’s strange obsession with controlling or acquiring other countries, even making threats of military action against longtime allies.
And there is always the issue of his inappropriate comments regarding the deaths of people he did not like. 
Will all of those issues and others impact elections in Mississippi, like they have affected elections in other states?
Heck, even in Mississippi, there was at least one recent special election where the Democrat did much better than in past contests.
In a Nov.10  special election in state Senate District 19 in northwest Mississippi, incumbent Kevin Blackwell won by only 6.6%. In the 2023 regular election, Blackwell won by a sizable margin of 31.4%. Granted, Blackwell ran in 2025 in a new court-ordered district that increased the percentage of Black voters, who tend to vote Democratic, but the increase was minimal from 25.4% to 27.5%.
If (there is that word again) those election trends hold true, Hyde-Smith could be in for a challenge this November.

Can we be friends?
Abigail Ulager, 16, Hinesburg
Why don’t we become friends?
We can carry one another through storms,
and catch each other when we fall.
The only thing is:
I’m weak,
and no matter how much I want to lift you up,
I don’t think I can.
Never mind that,
we can still be friends.
We can shine lights when the clouds hide the sun,
and show each other that the shadows aren’t all that scary after all.
I’m scared of your shadows too,
and I don’t know how to light up the darkness.
Maybe we can’t be friends… 
because what’s the point of doing something
if it’s not going to be any good?
But she, with brown hair,
twinkled her bright eyes.  
I don’t remember what she said
as she gently took my hand;
all I know is that she smiled 
like we would never die.
So maybe I can’t carry you across the raging ocean, 
or make the blackness white –
you’ll need someone else for that.
I’m no doctor, 
and I don’t know how to make your wounds hurt less.
But I will be here
with open ears and open arms,
because I don’t know how to make it better
but I have a shoulder on which you can cry
and a heart that yearns to laugh.
So, can we be friends?
I don’t have much to offer,
and will probably mess up a billion times.
But I really want to stand here,
my hands holding on to yours 
and yours resting in mine.

A viral video posted just after Christmas spurred an avalanche of news coverage, changes from the Trump administration, and congressional hearings that appeared to indicate that a massive trove of child care fraud was just uncovered in Minnesota.
Much of it has been misleading.
The video by right-wing YouTuber Nick Shirley posted Dec. 26 purports to show that various Minneapolis day cares run by Somali Americans are not providing services to children despite receiving public funding. Although the video has already been debunked by investigators, the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have seized on it. Vice President JD Vance said Shirley “has done far more useful journalism than any of the winners of the 2024 [Pulitzer Prizes].”
The fallout has been massive. In the past week, the Trump administration has frozen child care payments to five Democratic-run states and ramped up reporting requirements for all states receiving child care funds to cover services for the lowest-income kids. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, has suspended his reelection campaign over it.
But the real story behind child care fraud in Minnesota is far less nefarious.
Here’s what we actually know about child care fraud in Minnesota and elsewhere, and how day cares and families may be impacted by the new changes.
What does Nick Shirley uncover in his video?
Nothing conclusive. The video shows Shirley visiting day cares run by Somali Americans, sometimes under the false pretense of trying to enroll a child. In a couple of instances, workers do open the door but seem immediately suspicious when it’s clear Shirley is recording them and refuse to let him in or give him more information.
Because some of the sites appear closed and Shirley doesn’t see any children, he declares this as proof of fraud at these facilities.
Most child care centers are locked and have obscured doors or windows for children’s safety. Children are also kept in classrooms and would not likely be visible from a reception area. One of the day cares in the video told several news outlets that it did not grant Shirley entrance because he showed up with a handful of masked men, which raised suspicions that the men were agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. At least one of the centers was closed at the time Shirley arrived because it opens later in the day to serve the children of second-shift workers.

Is there a history of child care fraud in the state?
Yes, but it’s not as widespread as Shirley claims.
The federal government sends money to states to subsidize the cost of care for very low-income children, and some states put additional funds into that system. In Minnesota, it’s known as the Child Care Assistance Program, or CCAP. Centers that accept children on subsidies will bill the state for the cost of caring for those kids.
In 2019, a state investigation found that there was probably several million dollars in child care fraud taking place within that system, where centers were billing for children they were not providing services for. Investigators believed the level of child care fraud in the state was more than the $5 million to $6 million prosecutors had been able to prove until that point.
By 2019, state prosecutors had charged at least a dozen Minnesotans and centers with defrauding the state’s child care program in the prior five years.
After the 2019 report was issued, the state tightened oversight, including creating the Department of Children, Youth and Families to take over child care licensing, oversight and auditing. Last year, Minnesota passed a law to criminalize kickbacks for child care program enrollment referrals.
A 2025 report by the federal Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General found that issues with overpayments continue in the state. The inspector general sampled 1,155 child care centers and found that 11 percent of the payments made to those centers in 2023 had errors.
But that doesn’t necessarily mean there was fraud. Improper payments is an umbrella term that could include fraud.
For example, “an improper payment is a child was present for 40 hours and somehow the state paid only for 30 hours. Fraud is when you’re charging for kids that were never enrolled,” explained Danielle Ewen, a national child care expert.
An 11 percent rate puts Minnesota above the permissible 10% threshold established by the federal government, Ewen said. On average nationwide, the rate is 4%.
So while child care fraud is something Minnesota has been working to reduce in recent years, “these are not new issues, but they are being repackaged and they are being promoted in ways to make it seem like there is an epidemic,” said Elliot Haspel, a national child care expert, on a call with reporters this week.

Is there evidence of large-scale child care fraud nationwide?
No.
According to a 2020 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, only seven states since 2013 have had errors in more than 10 percent of their child care fund payments. That also does not mean there is necessarily fraud, but rather errors in overbilling.
The federal Office of Child Care did not respond to questions about The 19th about which states are above the threshold.
What did state investigators find when they investigated the day cares in the videos?
State investigators conducted unannounced visits at the day cares in the viral video over the past six months as part of the typical licensing and auditing process, according to Tikki Brown, the commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Children, Youth and Families. An analysis of publicly available inspection records by The 19th found that most of the centers had unannounced inspections as recently as October, November or December.
After the video was posted, investigators from the state Office of Inspector General conducted compliance visits to nine of the 10 centers in the video (one of the centers in the video has been closed for several years and has not received funds in that time). They found normal operations and children at all but one, which had not yet opened for the day. Further investigations are being conducted into four of the nine facilities, but the state has not said what exactly it’s investigating.
Most of the centers in the video did have numerous state licensing violations against them regarding cleanliness, staff supervision and some recordkeeping around immunizations and allergies. But none of the violations against the centers were regarding fraud, according to state enforcement records.
Quality Learning Center, the center most prominently featured in the video because one of its signs misspelled learning, closed this week. Another center in the video, Mako Childcare Center, has been closed since 2022, the Minnesota Department of Children, Youth and Families said.
There is evidence of one of the day cares in the video having a connection to prior fraud investigations. Fowsiya Hassan, the CEO of Minnesota Best Childcare Center, previously owned another day care called Sunshine Child Care Center that was raided in 2022 as part of an overbilling fraud investigation. No charges were brought.
Hassan sued the state last year over the raid, which led to the closure of Sunshine, claiming “licensing and fraud investigations in Minnesota have long been disproportionately targeted against Somalis.”
How can I check if my child’s day care has been inspected and audited?
Every state is federally mandated to publicly report the results of inspections at licensed child care centers (including the dates of the inspections), and day cares are required to undergo at least one unannounced inspection a year. In Minnesota, that information can be found at the state’s Licensing Information Lookup tool.
To find information on your state, visit The 19th’s child care safety dashboard which has a link to each state’s dashboard of child care providers.
Why was the Somali community targeted?
David Hoch, the lobbyist and former right-wing candidate for Minnesota attorney general who serves as the main source in Shirley’s video, received information on the centers from Republican staffers in Minnesota.
Hoch has had a particular focus on the Somali community and fraud for some time. In a now-deleted Instagram account, Hoch posted almost exclusively about the Somali community, according to reporting in The Intercept.
“EVERY Somali in MN is engaged in fraud. ALL of them,” Hoch posted.  “Even the Blacks have had enough of the demon Muslims,” he said in November.
Over the years, whistleblowers alleged that the fraud money in Minnesota’s child care system was being used to fund the Somali terrorist organization al-Shabab. The 2019 Office of the Legislative Auditor investigation found those claims to be unsubstantiated.
The Somali community has been a particular target of President Donald Trump, who has claimed that “much of the Minnesota Fraud, up to 90%, is caused by people that came into our Country, illegally, from Somalia.”
The president last month called Somali immigrants “garbage” who he doesn’t want in the country.
Minnesota has the largest Somali population in the United States, and child care has historically been an industry that employs large numbers of immigrants. About 1 in 5 child care workers are immigrant women.
Since Shirley’s video, there have been numerous reports of people harassing Somali-run day cares and businesses either through in-person visits demanding to see children, or through threatening phone calls. At least one center was broken into.
Day cares in Minnesota have reported concerns for children and staff safety, particularly as ICE activity in the state has ramped up.
Dawn Uribe, the owner of four Spanish-immersion preschools in Minnesota, said she “really can’t overstate how afraid” her all-immigrant staff is since the video was posted even though all have work authorization and most are citizens or permanent residents.
“We are really preparing for the next couple of weeks for people to be calling off [work] and not coming,” Uribe said.
What is the child care funding freeze and who is impacted by it?
After the video was released, the Trump administration announced a funding freeze to five Democratic-run states: Minnesota, California, Colorado, New York and Illinois. The freeze would stop federal child care funds from flowing to states to cover care for low-income children. It was also pausing $7.3 billion in funding for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which supports low-income families, in those five states.
The five states impacted sued the administration over the freeze arguing that withholding the funds from low-income and vulnerable families would cause “immediate and devastating impacts.” On Friday, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to release the funds while the case is pending.
Officials had previously said funds would be released “only when states prove they are being spent legitimately.”
In Minnesota, state officials had until Friday to provide additional documentation, including Social Security numbers for all of the estimated 23,000 children who receive child care funds in the state, to the federal Department of Health and Human Services.
The state has informed providers that it has “several months” of reserves to cover care for those children should federal funds be frozen, so child care centers and families have not been impacted directly.
It’s unclear what evidence the Trump administration had to justify freezing funds to California, Colorado, New York and Illinois. In a letter to Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, Alex Adams, the assistant secretary for the Administration for Children and Families, said the Trump administration was “concerned by the potential for extensive and systemic fraud in Illinois” and added that it has reason to believe the state is “illicitly providing illegal aliens with CCDF benefits intended for American citizens and lawful permanent residents.”
Nationally, every state will also now have to submit additional documentation to access child care dollars, a process that could slow payments to centers and increase the risk of day cares cutting staff or limiting operations.
Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, declined to comment on any of the questions from The 19th.
“For too long, Democrat-led states and Governors have been complicit in allowing massive amounts of fraud to occur under their watch,” he said in a statement. “Under the Trump Administration, we are ensuring that federal taxpayer dollars are being used for legitimate purposes.”
Are there other impacts from the freeze?
National child care experts said there is a lot of confusion around exactly what data the federal government is requiring states to submit, and whether it’s even data states have on hand to provide.
For providers and families, there is a lot of uncertainty on what happens next and whether a freeze could still occur.
Freezing child care funding can lead day cares to cut staff, close classrooms or close entirely because many don’t have reserves to continue operations. During the government shutdown at the end of 2025, for example, numerous Head Start child care programs that rely on federal funding closed in at least 13 states.
Kylie Cooper, a director of a child care center in the Twin Cities, said that the families who face the most uncertainty are those with the fewest resources if their child care options fall through.
“These are the families who absolutely need [it],” she said. “They likely don’t have PTO or benefits in place with their employers if they have to take a day off work for child care. There’s not a support system.”
About 95 percent of the families who receive assistance in her program are headed by single mothers.
“If that freeze were to go into effect there are a whole lot of centers that run on a very thin margin and most of their kids are CCAP,” Cooper said. “They would last less than a month before they’re closing their doors.”

But inside, the store is a welcoming oasis. Twinkly string lights adorn racks of donated clothing. Shelves and bins overflow with children’s books, allergy medications, and toiletries. Curtains cordon off one side of the room, where there’s a stage for musicians and a neon sign depicting roller skates for weekly free skate nights.
The space is part free thrift store, part over-the-counter pharmacy, part punk show venue — and wholly “a radical community center,” said Dan Bingler, who runs the place.
Bingler is a waiter and bartender in the city who founded a mutual-aid organization called the Greater New Orleans Caring Collective. He said the building owners allow him to use the space as long as he pays the water, electricity, and trash bills.
On Monday evenings, volunteers from other community organizations show up — some used to set up in the parking lot before Bingler opened the store. They offer free testing for sexually transmitted infections, basic medical care, hot meals, and sterile syringes and other supplies for people who use drugs.
The purpose of the space is simple, Bingler said: “We’re going to make sure we provide for the community.”
Although it’s been open for a few years now, the space has become even more crucial to this community in recent months, with the Trump administration slashing funding for many social service organizations and taking an aggressive approach to homelessness and drug use. In Washington, D.C., the administration has bulldozed tents to push people living on the street to leave the city. Nationally, it has called for people who use drugs to be forced into treatment. It has decried harm reduction — practices that public health experts say keep people who use drugs safe and alive but that critics say promote illegal drug use.
Dan Bingler, who runs the Fred Hampton Free Store, calls it “a radical community center.” The store, in an abandoned Family Dollar in New Orleans’ Lower 9th Ward, offers visitors free items, all donated by people and groups in the community.

The community space in New Orleans — named the Fred Hampton Free Store after the famous Black Panther activist known for bringing together diverse groups to fight for social reforms — aims to be a haven among this sea of changes.
 
It doesn’t receive federal funding, state or local grants, or money from foundations, Bingler said. It’s simply neighbors helping neighbors, he said, tearing up and adding, “It’s a really beautiful thing to be able to share all this space.”
All items inside are provided by people or organizations in the community. Bingler said one time a local hotel undergoing renovations donated 50 flat-screen TVs.
On nights the store is open, often more than 100 people visit, Bingler said.
One fall evening, dozens of people browsed for free clothing and over-the-counter medications. Others sat on the grass outside, chatting while keeping an eye on their bicycles or grocery carts full of possessions.
James Beshears stopped by the harm reduction group in the parking lot to get sterile supplies he uses to inject heroin and fentanyl. He said he’d been in treatment for years but relapsed after his doctor moved away and he was referred to a clinic that charged $250 a day. Street drugs were cheaper than treatment, he said.
He wants to stop. But until he can find affordable care, places like the free store keep him going. Without it, he said, he’d have “one foot in the grave.”
Another man in the parking lot was waiting for the arrival of Aquil Bey, a paramedic and former Green Beret well known for helping people overcome obstacles to getting health care. As soon as the man spotted Bey’s black Jeep, he ran up.
“I’ve got stage 4 kidney disease,” the man said, adding that he was scheduled for treatments at a hospital but was struggling to get there.
“Do me a favor,” Bey said as he unloaded folding tables and medical equipment from his car. “When our team gets here, come and see us. Maybe we can get you transportation.”
Bey is the founder of Freestanding Communities, a volunteer-run organization that provides free basic medical care and referrals for people who are homeless, using drugs, or part of other vulnerable communities. The group has a steady presence at the free store.
That day, Bey and his team connected the man needing kidney disease treatment to reduced-cost transit programs. They also did blood pressure and blood sugar checks for anyone who wanted them, cleaned infected wounds, and called clinics to make appointments for patients without phones.

A man with a leg injury mentioned he was sleeping on the concrete floor of an abandoned naval base. Bey noticed the free store’s furniture section had a mattress. He and another volunteer hauled it out, strapped it to the top of a car, and delivered it to where the man was sleeping.
 
“We’re just trying to find all these barriers” that people face and “find ways to fix them,” Bey said.
The clinic at the free store helped Stephen Wiltz connect with addiction care. He grew up in the Lower 9th Ward and had been using drugs since he was 10.
Fed up with discrimination from doctors who blamed him for his addiction, Wiltz said, he was reluctant to go to any treatment facility. But after years of knowing the volunteers at the free store, he trusted them to point him in the right direction.
At 56, Wiltz was in sustained recovery for the first time in his life, he said during a phone interview in the fall.
Those volunteers “cared for people who didn’t have nobody to care for them,” he said.
As the sun went down that fall evening at the store, a punk band started setting up for a show across the room from the medical clinic. Lights dimmed and music blared — a reminder that this was not your everyday clinic or community center.
Bey continued consulting with a patient who had gout.
“I get used to the sound,” Bey said of the rapid drums and loud power chords. “I like it sometimes.”

(Photo by Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)The two candidates most likely to be Colorado’s next governor shared a stage for the first time at a union hall Saturday just north of Denver, addressing a crowd of Democrats eager to hear about the party’s path forward under President Donald Trump’s second administration.
U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, both Democrats, took questions from moderators and audience members in a forum hosted by the Colorado Young Democrats at the headquarters of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 68.
Bennet began the event by acknowledging Renee Good, the Colorado-born woman who was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis on Wednesday, sparking protests around the state and nation. Weiser called Good’s killing a “painful reminder” of what can happen “when we fail to train officers for the work they need to do safely.”

In their first face-to-face appearance ahead of the June 30 primary for governor, both Democrats promised to stand up to Trump and make Colorado a more affordable place to live.
“We are living at a momentous time in Colorado history and American history,” Bennet said. “We are living at a time when we have some of the worst income inequality and wealth inequality that we’ve seen as a nation in a hundred years, and your generation is going to bear the cost of that, if we don’t act quickly to deal with it.”
“I’m here as the child and grandchild of Holocaust survivors, liberated by U.S. soldiers, who made a decision to come to America and build a life for themselves, to get union jobs and opportunity,” Weiser said. “And that’s what I want for everyone here.”
Heavily favored
But the two candidates sparred repeatedly over their differences in approach throughout their 30 minutes onstage together. Weiser criticized Bennet’s votes in favor of several Trump Cabinet nominees and a super PAC supporting Bennet’s campaign that has received donations from billionaires and dark money groups.
“Colorado and America want fighters — people who meet the moment,”  said Weiser, who touted the 50 lawsuits his office has filed against the Trump administration since last January. “And I’ve shown as attorney general what that looks like.”
Bennet twice objected to being “lectured” by Weiser about resisting Trump, dismissing the attorney general’s raft of legal actions against the administration — many of which are brought jointly by the attorneys general of numerous Democratic-led states — as “signing on to other people’s lawsuits.”
“My opponent spends a lot of time talking about — fight, fight, fight, lawsuit, lawsuit, lawsuit,” Bennet said. “But what we really need in this nation, in addition to fighting Trump, is a vision for what the future is going to look like.”
Weiser, a former law professor, is serving his second term as attorney general after he was first elected in 2018.
Bennet is a former Denver Public Schools superintendent who was appointed to the Senate by Gov. Bill Ritter in 2009. He ran unsuccessfully for president in 2020 before winning reelection to a third full term in 2022.
The winner of the primary between Weiser and Bennet will be heavily favored to win the general election in November. Coloradans have only elected one Republican governor in the last 50 years. Democrats have won every statewide election held in the last eight years by an average of more than 10 percentage points, and are widely expected to gain ground in a favorable midterm election year.
Democratic Gov. Jared Polis is term-limited.

That’s one of the few areas of bipartisan consensus left in a state that sometimes feels as polarized as the rest of the country. 
But every year — especially the ones when their name is on the ballot — the state’s elected officials and candidates flock to tiny Gillett in southeast Arkansas for its annual Coon Supper. They join hundreds of people in a school gymnasium to eat the mammal. Or at least the politicians pretend to.
“I think that’s kind of the strategy,” conceded Republican U.S. Sen. John Boozman, who began attending the annual event when the state was considered solidly blue. “You brag about eating coon, but you don’t say when you ate it.”
When asked whether he enjoyed eating raccoon meat, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe said: “No, but I ate it. Because you were expected to.”
The supper is one of those quirks of Arkansas politics that’s somehow stood the test of time. In an era where retail politicking is replaced with six-figure ad buys and dueling messages on X, it’s one of the few truly required stops left for the state’s politicians. 
You can skip a debate or two, you can miss a festival, but God help you if you don’t make time for this supper.
That was certainly the case on Saturday night, as hundreds packed the gymnasium for this year’s supper. Rows of tables were filled with attendees _ including a few wearing raccoon skin hats _ who sat down to help themselves to the titular main course, as well as brisket, sweet potatoes and rice. Politicians on hand included Republican U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton and Hallie Shoffner, who’s running for the Democratic nomination to challenge him this year.
Technically, the dinner is a nonpolitical event. Officeholders can speak, but non-officeholders cannot. That’s at least on the official program. 
Once a fundraiser for high school athletics, the event now raises money for college scholarships. Gillett High School is no longer open, but the school’s gymnasium is still used for the dinner.
The political lore surrounding the supper is legendary. Former President Bill Clinton often tells the tale about crash-landing in an airplane with the late Sen. Dale Bumpers on the way to the supper. The two arrived at the supper unharmed, and thus a favorite political story was born.
During 2014’s multimillion-dollar Senate fight between then-incumbent Mark Pryor and challenger Tom Cotton, the Gillett event drew swarms of national media. Pryor brought several Senate colleagues, including Dick Durbin of Illinois and Angus King of Maine. 
Glasses with the event’s familiar black-and-orange logo are a badge of honor for the state’s politicos and reporters. I still have mine from the first one I attended 20 years ago, and a ballcap adorned with images of pawprints and a camouflage bill.
By the way, I ate raccoon at all three  suppers I’ve attended. It’s not something I’d recommend as part of one’s regular diet.
Proof that the author ate some of the raccoon meat served at this year’s event (Andrew DeMillo/Arkansas Advocate)
Beebe recounts how in his first political race, for the state Senate district that included Gillett, the incumbent he was challenging went to a party before the supper at the late Marion Berry’s home and saw nearly everyone in attendance wearing a Beebe campaign button.
The incumbent dropped out about a month after seeing that.
Berry, whose congressional district included Gillett, said he wouldn’t have had a political career if it weren’t for the supper.
Berry, who passed away in 2023, was known for the parties he would hold before the supper with friends and supporters. Attendees would mingle, enjoy their “adult beverages,” and munch on food that’s not normally considered roadkill.
Berry’s family members, friends and former aides now use the pre-party as a fundraiser for a public service scholarship in Berry’s name for Arkansas State University students. The event is now held at the Berry farm shop, a short drive from the supper. Signs from the late Berry’s congressional campaigns adorn the shop and are used to help visitors find the party.
“It’s just such a unique environment,” said Gabe Holmstrom, a former Berry staffer and one of the organizers of the pre-supper party. “It’s this metal farm shop in the middle of a bean field in early January and you just have all these folks showing up.”
The supper and pre-party event in many ways is a scene from a bygone era, though with modern flourishes that include participants taking selfies for social media.
There are still some semi-required stops for politicians around the state such as the Hope Watermelon Festival and the Slovak Oyster Supper, but the Coon Supper has seemed to withstand most of the changes in Arkansas politics.
Boozman said the decline in such gatherings is “emblematic” of a larger problem: fewer people going out to gather in person to meet at places like civic clubs.
“It’s sad these things are in decline now,” Boozman said.
Eating raccoon may not necessarily be the solution to that decline, but it at least shows there’s still traditions in Arkansas politics that will endure.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CoonSupper1-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-11 06:12:07.422820

Fourteen months after crashing at the 2024 Killington World Cup, the Burke Mountain Academy graduate turned most-winning Alpine racer in history is again ascending — just in time for her fourth Olympics.

The last time many Vermonters saw Mikaela Shiffrin, the Alpine ski racer was standing atop Killington’s Superstar trail, seemingly a minute away from scoring an unprecedented 100th World Cup win.
Then, figuratively and literally, she went downhill fast.
The Burke Mountain Academy graduate had snagged the lead in the first of two giant-slalom runs on Nov. 30, 2024, only to follow up by slipping, somersaulting and slamming into a fence 12 seconds from the finish line.
Some 20,000 spectators went silent as the two-time Olympic gold medalist was rushed away on a rescue sled. They and 2 million national television viewers wouldn’t learn more until the skier took to Instagram at dusk from the nearby Rutland Regional Medical Center.
“I am so sorry to scare everybody,” Shiffrin said in a selfie video as she revealed an abdominal wound with a playful “ay, ay, ay.”
Fourteen months later, the 30-year-old is again on the rise in advance of next month’s Winter Olympics in Italy. Commentators point to her opening five-race winning streak this World Cup season. People with closer ties add that just returning to competition was a feat in itself.
“She’s been the best in the world for a long time, but given everything that has happened, to stay there is one of her most impressive accomplishments,” says Willy Booker, head of Shiffrin’s alma mater in the Northeast Kingdom.
Shiffrin graduated from the grade 8-12 ski school in 2013, the same year she became the youngest U.S. woman (at 17) to win a slalom world championship. Moving on to the Olympics, she scored slalom gold in 2014 and giant slalom gold and Alpine combined silver in 2018. A year later, she became the first skier to claim World Cup victories in all six disciplines — slalom, giant slalom, parallel slalom, alpine combined, super-G and downhill.
Booker, a onetime competitor himself, was at Killington on the 2024 Thanksgiving weekend when Shiffrin rocketed through the first of two runs of the giant slalom — a race down and around a series of gates — sparking the crowd to buzz about a potential new peak: a never-before-seen 100th World Cup win.

“It was amazing, building towards this crescendo,” Booker recalls of the anticipation.
Come the second round, NBC sportscasters spoke of especially icy course conditions just before Shiffrin launched from the start at 50 mph.
“She’s nervous, she’s a little bit stiff, and why would you not be?” commentator Picabo Street said on air. “But she’s forward, she’s leaning into it.” 
That’s when Shiffrin slipped, struck two gates, lost a ski, slammed into a fence and went scarily still — all in five seconds.

“Nobody knew how bad it was,” Booker remembers of the sudden hush.
Medics transported Shiffrin about 15 miles west to Rutland Regional Medical Center, where hospital spokespeople maintained patient confidentiality even as the athlete and her crew set up cameras in the emergency room.
Shiffrin posted on social media that night, then appeared on NBC from Killington the next day.
“We’re just not totally sure how I got punctured,” she told viewers of the stab wound that missed perforating her colon by millimeters. “Very lucky to not have worse injuries.”
But Shiffrin added that it hurt to breathe, let alone move — similar to how she felt after the accidental death of her 65-year-old father in 2020 and her failure to medal after three falls in the 2022 Olympics.
After Killington, some would sit out the rest of the season, especially with the concluding world championships less than 10 weeks away. But Shiffrin was determined to return, even after fluid buildup and infection-signaling fever and chills forced her into surgery two weeks later.
Developing a step-by-step rehabilitation plan, the skier focused first on simply standing, then walking, then easy exercises and, after four weeks, stepping into ski boots and snow.
Two months after her crash, Shiffrin raced the World Cup slalom in Courchevel, France, on Jan. 30, 2025, finishing a seemingly confidence-building 10th. But she continued to struggle off the course, seeing occasional flashes of imagined stumbles and spills.
A therapist viewed the visions as signs of post-traumatic stress disorder before sharing words from the late children’s television star Mister Rogers: “What’s mentionable is manageable.” And so Shiffrin expanded her recovery efforts from body to mind.
“A lot of it is trust that with time and practice and exposure, clarity will come back,” the athlete recalled in a recent self-produced video series, “Moving Right Along,” on her YouTube channel.
Shiffrin went on to ski at the February world championships in Saalbach, Austria, placing fifth in the slalom and helping the U.S. team win a combined event. She capped the month a week later in Sestriere, Italy, by finally scoring her 100th World Cup victory.
Since then, Shiffrin has increased her World Cup total to 106. Students and staff at Burke Mountain Academy are set to watch her attempt to add to her medal count at next month’s Olympics.
“There is a huge amount of pride,” Booker says. “They go to the same school as the greatest ski racer of all time.”
One who has little else to prove — yet, in her estimation, still more to gain.
“I’ve been doing this for a while, but I’m still learning new things,” Shiffrin concluded in her video series. “There’s new exciting adventures always just around the corner, and I’m looking forward to seeing what’s next.”

Although the idea may be new to Vermont, it’s not entirely unheard of in the country, said Rep. Leanne Harple, D-Glover, a member of the House Committee on Education.

Isa Harrington, a South Burlington High School student, is a firm believer in the democratic process — even though she hasn’t had a chance to exercise her rights to the fullest extent yet, as she is only 17.
Still, the right to vote has been heavy on her mind since the summer months, when she joined the Governor’s Institute at Champlain College, which gave her some firsthand experience into just how powerful youth action can be. So powerful that a bill, spearheaded by Harrington and the student group, set to hit the House floor this legislative session is, for the first time in the state, attempting to give student representatives on school boards a binding vote on issues that come before the elected body.
Although the idea may be new to the state, it’s not entirely unheard of in the country, said Rep. Leanne Harple, D-Glover, a member of the House Committee on Education, who plans to sponsor the proposed legislation this session.
“In Maryland, eight of the state’s 24 local school districts have student board members with the right to cast votes,” she said. “This is not completely new territory that the students just made up.”
Harrington is heavily involved in school happenings, especially as a member of the student council. She says that although opportunities are available for students to become involved, it can, at times, seem more like an illusion of power.
“Student voice just doesn’t have as much power as it should when it comes to making decisions regarding education,” Harrington said. “It’s really hard to make policy that is for the students if you don’t have student input on what is necessary. And so often, what happens is there are policies that are being enacted that are focusing on the wrong priorities.”
The South Burlington School Board has historically had two student representatives, a junior and a senior from the high school, to represent the student body on the board. While those seats had never been able to cast a vote — even a non-binding one — this year, senior Ally Leduc and junior Momin Waqar, broached the topic with the board, who ultimately agreed to allow the students to cast a non-binding vote on issues.
But Waqar and Leduc explained that even having this added responsibility of taking an unofficial vote has added a new level of seriousness to their roles. Being a student representative is a hefty time commitment, and Waqar noted that having a binding vote in the future could add even more time commitments.
“If we’re also given a binding vote, then it’s our responsibility to be on top of that work, to stay informed on everything we’re voting on,” Waqar said. “Even when we got our non-binding vote, it was a really important conversation we had about being able to abstain from the vote if you’re not fully aware of what’s going on.”
Overall, both students agree that having a binding vote could be a step in the right direction to bring student perspective into the conversation, but details still need to be fleshed out before the duo takes a firm stance on the issue. They are, however, putting a lot of thought into both sides of the debate — as any responsible representative would.
Harrington touted Waqar and Leduc as excellent representations of the student body, but said their dedication is only one small glimpse into how passionate students are becoming about cultural, social and political issues — especially ones that affect their education.
“What you’re seeing more recently is that students are turning out,” she said. “You’re seeing an increase in young people who are participating in protests, getting engaged with their school boards, with their communities. They’re taking these steps to be involved. And that’s super important in general, to having a community, a country, a state, where everyone feels that their voice is being represented. It’s kind of foundational.”
The student body is, after all, the future, Harrington said. And that’s a responsibility she doesn’t take lightly. But she isn’t naive about the fact that others may not have the same ideas as she does, and for her, that’s OK, because that’s also part of the democratic process. She just hopes this opens more doors for students to have a seat at that table.
She noted that the conversation is especially timely given the current landscape of Vermont’s public education system. New legislation passed last year has promised that how schools are funded and governed is going to change in the coming years.
“I think helping create this platform for myself to prove that it was possible has made a whole world of difference in increasing the conviction I already had that it is so important for students to be able to make these changes,” Harrington said.
The bill, still in early draft form, dictates that school district boards include voting student members in grades nine, 10, 11 and 12 and non-voting members in grades seven and eight. The appointment would be overseen by the superintendent of the district through a process outlined by the given school board.
Harple, who is also a teacher at Hazen Union High School, noted that while she has heard from some legislators about an interest in co-sponsoring the bill, she is aware that there is likely to be some pushback.
But the ethos of the effort itself is worth it.
“This was legislation that students came up with, where they identified a problem, that they didn’t think they had a strong enough voice and huge decisions that are being made right now are affecting the future of their education,” Harple said. “And when asked to find a solution, they came up with the solution. And I was like, ‘That’s actually not a bad idea. I’m going to see it through.’ And that itself is a reason to see this through, that students are doing this work. We should help them see if they can get this into law.”

It’s one example of shifts in Congress he’s dealt with.","In a year filled with power struggles between Congress and the White House, Jim Himes is one of the small group of lawmakers who have felt the brunt of it.
That came into stark relief last weekend after the U.S. strike on Venezuela and the capture of its president. As a high-ranking official on the House Intelligence Committee, Himes is one of the “Gang of Eight” who traditionally get some of the earliest information about major military operations.
Yet he was left in the dark for days.
So Himes, who represents Connecticut’s 4th District in the southwestern portion of the state, has had to learn to navigate not only the challenges of serving in the Democratic minority but also in a Congress that the executive branch increasingly bypasses on some military and federal spending issues, despite Congress’ constitutional authority.
But despite the Venezuela snub, the Democratic minorities in Congress and the broader challenges to democracy here and abroad, Himes says he’s still in the game and still able to wield power as a top Democrat on a key committee. 
That’s partly because the sands are slowly shifting in Washington.
Back in January 2025, “that was a pretty defeated moment, and almost all the Republicans were 100% Donald Trump,” Himes said in an interview from his Washington, D.C., office last week. “That’s changed, partly because of the result of the November elections.”
“So politics is back because Republicans know that if they are unquestioning in their support of Donald Trump, they’re going to get shellacked” in the midterm elections this fall, he said. 
‘Dangerous and unprecedented’
Himes went into the past year with some expectations of how President Donald Trump might operate in his second term, given his experiences the last time. But that has looked different, he said, with the vast expansion of executive powers. He argued the current administration has taken it to a “dangerous and unprecedented place.”
“A lot of this stuff is just picking up a baseball bat and hitting yourself in the head,” he said, running through a list of threats Trump has made regarding other countries in the wake of Venezuela. “We get nothing for that, and it hurts us.”
When Himes was preparing for Trump to take office almost a year ago, he devised a system of when to engage and decipher what was serious and what was just rhetorical bluster. At the time, he wrote off Trump’s comments about Greenland, calling it “obvious nonsense.”
Given Trump’s repeated overtures about the autonomous island that’s part of Denmark, the congressman said, he’s coming around to the plausibility of it becoming a reality, even as some downplay or rebuff the possibility of taking Greenland by military force.
Himes sees his job through different lenses, with varying degrees of interference. On the issues that are more Connecticut-specific — transportation and infrastructure chief among them — he said they’re “grinding away pretty well,” even with issues like the stop-work order at Revolution Wind. But from the vantage point of national security — the bulk of his job in D.C. — it’s “much more of a mixed bag.”
If you as a citizen decide that this is a Yankees-Red Sox game and the other side is evil and treasonous and seditious and you are the sole arbiter of truth, we’ll have an authoritarian government.U.S. Rep. Jim Himes
Serving in the minority party typically comes with its limitations, especially with Republicans’ political trifecta of the White House and both chambers of Congress. Yet the GOP’s narrow majorities means they need to take Democrats into account, given their votes are needed on most legislation, particularly in the Senate.
While some elements of his job involving intelligence matters have been hindered, other things haven’t changed as he had anticipated at the start of 2025. And he still feels like he’s able to assert himself.
“I don’t feel like I have no effect. And I worried about that a year ago. Republicans can’t ignore Democrats entirely,” Himes said, whether it’s on an annual defense policy bill or appropriations. “So I don’t feel irrelevant on a lot of things.”
The role of the Intelligence Committee
Because of his prominent role in Congress, Himes has repeatedly found himself at the forefront of major foreign policy matters with wide-ranging implications.
As a member of the “Gang of Eight,” a group of the Republican and Democratic leaders in the House and Senate plus the chairs and ranking members of both intelligence committees, Himes typically gets a heads-up on major military actions.
The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has oversight over U.S. intelligence agencies as well as some issues concerning the Pentagon and other government agencies. He’s served on that committee since 2013 and was elevated to ranking member in 2023.

But for Democratic leaders who are usually privy to such information, Himes said, he hadn’t received any communication from White House officials in the days since the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife until the Monday evening briefing with the Gang of Eight.
Lawmakers pushed back on the administration for not notifying Congress before the attack. But Trump officials defended the decision, saying it could have compromised the operation and put U.S. troops at risk. That has become more common of presidential administrations, led by both Democrats and Republicans. One recent example is former President Barack Obama not seeking congressional authorization or providing Congress a heads-up before bombing Libya in 2011.
“Presidents of both parties have long relied on their constitutional authority to act when foreign actors pose a direct threat to the safety and security of the United States and its people. President Trump did exactly that,” the Connecticut Republican Party said in a statement after the capture of Maduro, specifically naming Himes and a few other Connecticut Democrats for “playing politics.”
This wasn’t the first time Himes learned of significant military action through other channels.
When the U.S. launched strikes on nuclear facilities in Iran last June, Himes learned of the news through social media.
It was nearly déjà vu last weekend. Himes told NPR’s “Morning Edition” his wife woke him up on last Saturday, saying, “You won’t believe what’s happening.”
While he has said it was successful as a military and tactical mission, Himes called it “illegal” and “unwise.” And after sitting in on briefings, it was clear to him that officials had no plans for what to do after. 
But from a morality standpoint, it’s a bit more nuanced, because Maduro is a “bad, bad guy.”
As the administration maps out its next moves in the region, officials like Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of War Pete Hegseth have defended their approach.
“Our military is prepared to continue this,” Hegseth told reporters after Wednesday’s Venezuela briefings with all members of Congress. “The president, when he speaks, he means it. He’s not messing around. We are an administration of action to advance our interests, and that is on full display.”
In his own words, Trump made it clear how he views the limitations of his own powers, particularly abroad.

“Yeah, there is one thing. My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me,” Trump said in an interview with The New York Times on Wednesday.
Even so, Himes said, he’s had small victories, particularly in the intelligence community — including some he can’t discuss, given the classified nature of the job. He said he helped add a measure into the National Defense Authorization Act that supported the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Trump’s administration has been skeptical of NATO, and the alliance faces a potential crisis if the U.S. seizes Greenland. 
Himes’ role in it all
When it comes to Congress’ war powers, Himes acknowledged that administrations led by both parties have been chipping away at that for years.
In defending Trump, Republicans argued that Democrats didn’t take issue when their own party had taken unilateral action, like when the Obama administration intervened in Libya in 2011. At the time, Himes voted to limit further military action in the region.
“The other thing as a member of Congress that is really irritating is that we’re a participant in the now 100-year-long argument over who gets to approve the commitment of our troops,” Himes said. “Now the Constitution to me is pretty clear, but to be fair, we’ve had this argument with presidents of both parties.” 
But he argued the Trump administration has taken that to a new level.
That has left him to reflect on his role as a member of Congress and as a top member of the intelligence committee — even in more hyperbolic terms.

“In looking at the administration’s planned intelligence activities, I’ve had deep moral qualms, and I have expressed those, and I think I’ve had some effect on altering programs in ways that are not to my satisfaction but at least move, in my opinion, those programs in the right direction,” Himes said.
When speaking at the Connecticut Mirror’s “In the Room” event back in April, he mused about whether he’d need to break the law by speaking publicly about classified information, if it meant holding the administration accountable, in extreme circumstances. The hypothetical scenario he gave at the time was if Trump mobilized the CIA to target an American within the country.
He stands by the comments he made but said there’s a blurred line because “you got to think about policy disagreements differently than you think about clear moral stands.”
“If you had something that was legal and profoundly immoral, I’d be like ‘OK, what do I do?’ Himes said. “And in some ways, that’s the failsafe, right? If the administration, which I think has been authoritarian and beyond the pale, if it spun in a far darker direction, I would not be looking to compromise with that.”
Over the past year, Himes has mused about a democracy sliding closer to authoritarian system. Himes said it’s incumbent on everyone, including Democrats, to figure out why some Americans are turning away from it.
“It’s in dramatic retreat in the United States, and it’s in retreat all over the world,” Himes said. “That’s a belief that democracy is not providing for them. And we have some self-soul-searching to do in that regard.”
“If you as a citizen decide that this is a Yankees-Red Sox game and the other side is evil and treasonous and seditious and you are the sole arbiter of truth,” he said, “we’ll have an authoritarian government.” 
Small shifts in Congress
Trump is at the end of the first year of his second term, but Himes sees the tide slowly turning with elections on the horizon. That has given the self-described optimist some glimmers of hope — among them, those sporadic moments when Republicans have been more willing to buck the president.
To Himes, it’s a byproduct of the election cycle.
Last week, Congress pushed back repeatedly at the White House as it sought to reassert itself on policy fronts and matters of national security.
For example, the GOP-controlled Senate gave a rare rebuke of Trump as it voted for a war powers resolution to rein in Trump on Venezuela. Under that bill, Trump would need approval from Congress before further engaging in military action in the region.
And nearly a dozen House Republicans joined Democrats to pass the revival of lapsed pandemic-era enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans, as Trump has given mixed messaging on how to proceed with health care. 
On the same day, the House sought to override Trump’s vetoes on bills with overwhelming support, although those efforts fell short, with enough Republicans blocking the effort.
But Himes isn’t shy about criticizing his own party, which he says still needs to learn “how to center the core concerns” of Americans, such as the cost of living. Or that Trump shoulders the blame for everything.
Himes said the bipartisan infrastructure law passed under former President Joe Biden did “jack shit” for his southwestern Connecticut district.
“Shame on us,” Himes said. “That’s not Donald Trump’s fault.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25343796500718-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-11 05:11:42.392488
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-11 09:55:00+00:00,CT Mirror,PAID POST: 2025 Marked Real Mental Health Progress in Connecticut. But Access Gaps Are Still Widening.,Christian Damiana,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/11/paid-post-2025-marked-real-mental-health-progress-in-connecticut-but-access-gaps-are-still-widening/,"After a landmark year for Connecticut mental health reform, families still report widespread insurance and access barriers. New data highlights the urgent need for parity enforcement and stronger networks.","When Gov. Ned Lamont signed Connecticut’s bipartisan behavioral health parity bill on July 10, he framed it as part of a broader shift toward treating mental and physical health equally. He also acknowledged that families still face steep barriers when trying to use their insurance for behavioral health care, including high out-of-pocket costs or too few in-network providers. “Physical health and mental health are one and the same,” Lamont said at the signing. “And we’re going to make sure our insurance companies remember that every day.”
The announcement capped what many advocates say was the most active year for mental health legislation in more than five years. In addition to the parity bill, Lamont appointed the state’s first Behavioral Health Advocate and, during a special session in November, legislators approved a wide-ranging children’s behavioral health bill.
But new data shows that even as the state strengthens oversight, demand for care is rising sharply. According to the CT Parity Coalition’s recent State of Mental Health in Connecticut report, 689,000 adults — five times the population of Stamford — experienced a mental illness in 2024, and the state’s youth mental health ranking fell from second in the nation to 21st in a single year. School administrators, clinicians, and community providers have all reported increased need, particularly among adolescents.
Affordability and insurance barriers remain a major obstacle
The State of Mental Health in Connecticut report also noted that more than 77,000 Connecticut adults could not see a doctor due to cost, despite needing mental health treatment. Residents were four times more likely to be forced out-of-network for mental health care than for primary care, a pattern that advocates say reflects limited in-network provider availability and other longstanding parity issues.
Providers report similar challenges playing out in real time. In testimony earlier this year, one clinician described contacting “at least 27 in-network providers, only to find that none was accepting new patients.” With no available options, she said, a child remained in a higher level of care longer than clinically necessary at great cost to the family.

What parity is — and why enforcement matters now
These access barriers point to a system that is improving –– slowly. And not nearly fast enough to match growing treatment needs. State officials say the new parity law is designed to help close that gap.
Parity is a simple idea with far-reaching implications: mental health and substance use care must be treated the same as physical health care. That means equal coverage, equal access to in-network providers, and equal protection from delays or denials. Fundamentally, arity is the opposite of disparity. Connecticut’s reforms aim to turn parity from a legal requirement into a lived reality for families.
For years, regulators said they lacked the tools to enforce that principle. Until October 1, the maximum an insurer could be fined for a violation was $15,000, an amount advocates noted was negligible for large national carriers tracking tens of billions of dollars in annual profits. Under the 2025 reforms, the state Insurance Commissioner can now fine insurers up to $625,000 annually.
Lamont has emphasized that enforcement must be a priority, signaling that the state intends to use these new authorities.
“We’re going to enforce this. We’re going to make sure there is mental health parity… [the Commissioner of Insurance is] going to enforce this and hold people accountable and make sure our fines are allocated,” he said during the signing.
Connecticut’s next major inflection point will come when the Insurance Department completes its annual parity review, expected this spring. It may mark the first significant action in several years, at a time when other states are already responding aggressively. In September, Delaware fined UnitedHealthcare $450,000 for parity violations. In August, Georgia issued $20 million in fines against health insurers for widespread noncompliance.

Looking ahead
The Connecticut Parity Coalition, a statewide alliance of more than 25 clinician and advocacy organizations, has been tracking these challenges for years. Members say that while 2025 marked a turning point, the next phase of work must focus on ensuring patients can actually access the care they’re entitled to.
“Coverage is only meaningful if people can use it,” said one coalition member. “We finally have the tools. Now we need to make sure they work.”
State officials and advocates agree that Connecticut’s progress in 2025 lays a strong foundation for the years ahead. But many say the next test will be whether the administration follows through on the Governor’s commitment to robust enforcement, and whether insurers adjust their practices in response. With rising need, workforce strain, and administrative barriers, the work is far from over.
As Gov. Lamont said at the signing: “It’s great passing bills, but the bill’s got to be real. The bill’s got to make a difference.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Picture1.jpg,,,2026-01-11 04:57:50.574527

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)What happened after a judge expressed displeasure with the presence of ICE agents in her municipal courtroom last month was yet another sign that our democracy is fraying.
But it wasn’t the judge at fault. It was the heavy-handed response from the state’s top federal prosecutor, who accused the judge of improper conduct and warned city employees not to interfere with or even “disparage” federal immigration officers.
You may have missed this story from Manhattan, Kansas, because it broke on New Year’s Eve, when many of us were celebrating the death of 2025. Barely three days later, we sobered up to the news that our military had struck Venezuela to snatch an alleged drug criminal and his wife and import them to the United States.
But the judicial dustup that began at the Municipal Court building on Colorado Street in the Little Apple may say more about American democracy at ground level than the Maduro affair.
On Dec. 4, Magistrate Judge Sarah Smith Barr paused her opening remarks in a hearing against a woman accused of DUI and leaving the scene of an accident to look at the ICE agents and tell them they “should not be there.” That’s according to reporting by the Manhattan Mercury, which quoted a letter to the city from Ryan Kriegshauser, the U.S. attorney for Kansas.
From the reporting, it was unclear how Barr knew the pair were with ICE.
The plainclothes agents followed the woman out of the courtroom and arrested her in a hallway after the hearing, the letter said. Barr identified the pair as ICE agents to the 20 to 25 people remaining in the courtroom.
Kriegshauser’s letter accused Barr of improperly injecting political overtones into the proceeding and said her remarks were “inappropriate and potentially dangerous,” according to the newspaper. Suggesting ICE agents had no business attending municipal court hearings was improper, the letter said. It was within the discretion of agents to attend public court hearings in seeking lawful arrests and removal of “illegal aliens.”
The letter did not name the woman whom the ICE agents arrested.
The Mercury noted there was no record of what was said in the courtroom at the time of the hearing and that Barr declined comment. The paper also examined the court docket for Dec. 4. It listed 53 individuals, but none was a woman charged with drunk driving and leaving the scene of an accident. Neither the court nor Kriegshauser’s office would identity the woman, the newspaper said.
Barr did not respond to a message from me asking about the hearing. But assuming Kriegshauser’s letter is accurate, Barr’s action falls short of what judges in other states have been disciplined for. A Wisconsin judge who had helped a Mexican migrant dodge ICE agents by allowing her to slip out through a side door was found guilty of obstruction last month. A Massachusetts judge who was accused of helping a migrant evade ICE in 2018 was the subject of a federal indictment and a state ethics complaint.
Federal prosecution of state or local judges is rare, and when it does happen it’s typically been associated with bribery. A bribery scandal rocked the Oklahoma Supreme Court in 1965, for example, set off by a confession from the former chief justice, imprisoned for tax evasion, that he and others had taken bribes amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars for the past 25 years. In the era of Trump, attention has been redirected to “activist judges,” especially in states where sanctuary laws are in tension with federal immigration policies.
But Kansas is not a sanctuary state. In 2022, a law aimed by the Legislature at the Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City’s “Safe and Welcoming City Act” went into effect, banning sanctuary cities statewide.
During the first Trump administration, immigration agents started making arrests at courthouses, which had been long recognized, along with churches and other sacred areas, as “protected spaces.” Courthouse arrests were again prohibited under the Biden administration, but after Trump took office for his second term, in January 2025, Department of Homeland Security policy on courthouses was steadily rolled back, although a federal injunction kept some restrictions on places of worship. Local ICE field offices may now use their discretion to conduct immigration enforcement in and around courthouses.
Thus, many ICE arrests are made at immigration courts across the country, including in Kansas City, Missouri, where individuals are detained and then deported after showing up for what they believe is a routine immigration hearing. Although migrants are guaranteed due process by the U.S. Constitution, the Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to conduct lightning deportations largely unfettered by concerns about rights or racial profiling. With a budget of $28 billion, ICE is now the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the U.S. government.
The weight of this massive immigration enforcement machine was felt in Judge Barr’s municipal courtroom in December when the pair of ICE agents appeared. The agency is fond of courthouse captures because the location of their targets is known with a high degree of confidence and, because of security at courthouses, few are likely to carry weapons.
The problem is that courtrooms are meant to be safe and impartial places. The presence of ICE agents at a hearing they are not a part of introduces the very element of “political overtones” for which Kriegshauser criticized Barr. It would spark a range of emotions, from approval to fear, likely to disrupt the decorum of the court, if not derail the intended purpose of the proceeding. For that reason alone, Barr was correct in objecting.
The judge apparently did not obstruct agents by attempting to hustle the defendant out a side door or otherwise interfere with the arrest. To note one’s professional and ethical displeasure, as Barr did, is not “disparagement.” The message Kriegshauser sent with his letter was a warning to shut up or else.
The question of justice in a free society is, by necessity, eternally unanswered. To ask the nature of justice is to admit that there is still injustice to be addressed. Attempting to define justice is the realm of philosophers who have devoted careers to exploring the weave of democracy, justice and free societies.
“If a just society requires a strong sense of community,” Michael J. Sandel writes in his 2009 book about justice, “it must find a way to cultivate into citizens a concern for the whole, a dedication to the common good.”
What has eroded in the 17 years since Sandel’s “Justice: What’s the Right Thing to Do?” is this concern for the common good. I suspect it has to do with our increasing inability to grasp the important but abstract ideas that have driven American cultural life and domestic policy since the end of World War II. Thinking about justice is hard work.
Just try to imagine justice.
No, seriously. Take a moment, close your eyes, and attempt to imagine what justice looks like. If you’re of a creative bent you might explore whether justice has a sound or a texture. Taste or smell? Sure, why not. But no cheating. You’re not allowed to recall a symbol for justice, such as the famous blindfolded lady with a scale in one hand and a sword in the other.
Can you do it?
Thinking about abstract nouns can give you the equivalent of an ice cream headache. Yet justice is so essential to democracy that it’s something we all should be thinking about right now. The life work of political philosopher John Rawls was linking justice to fairness in a free society, and while we might not have a clear idea about justice, we all know in our gut when something is fair. As a country, we are now engaged in a great struggle over fairness at nearly every level of the public arena.
When I try to imagine justice — and fairness — I get a feeling.
It’s the feeling I get every time I enter a courthouse as a journalist to witness a proceeding. It could be a criminal case where somebody’s on trial for their life, a civil matter where a marriage or a fortune will be decided, or a minor action involving a speeding ticket.
It’s not that I’m naïve enough to believe that courts are perfectly just or that institutions are infallible. No, that feeling of civic reverence that stirs within me is a recognition of the constitutional principles upon which our judicial system is founded, the attempt by imperfect people — judges and lawyers and juries — to aspire to a perfect ideal. I have watched plenty of trials in which justice was more or less served, a few in which it was denied, and just one or two in which I thought the result could not have been more fair. That’s about as close to true justice as we can get in the real world.
Perhaps the most difficult part of believing in a fair and just America is reconciling the aspiration with the reality. People are fallible. Reason and mercy sometimes fail us. Bad laws are passed and oppressive policies enacted. But there is always hope for a correction, as long as there are people willing to speak up and take action.
It took guts for Barr to say what she did.
Courtrooms should not serve as part of the mass deportation machine.
But there’s another reason to keep ICE out of our courtrooms, and that’s the chilling effect that agents might have on the willingness of individuals to report crimes or agree to be witnesses. If you’re an undocumented migrant and you’re being beaten by your partner, wouldn’t you think twice about calling the police if you know deportation awaits at the courthouse door?
Barr, who graduated from the Washburn University School of Law at Topeka and whose grandfather was attorney general of Kansas and on the Kansas Supreme Court, could make a better argument for the sanctity of courtrooms. I suspect she will when the time is right.
Kriegshauser, a Trump nominee who has been U.S. attorney for Kansas since July and confirmed by the Senate on Dec. 19, sent his warning letter to Manhattan’s city manager and commissioners. He said his office is investigating to determine whether Manhattan is a “sanctuary jurisdiction.”
“Make no mistake, my office will take all necessary steps to enforce federal law as needed,” his letter said.
But equal access to the courts is a fundamental principle. Allowing ICE agents to troll courthouses — even municipal courthouses which hear the most minor of offenses — creates a situation in which access is denied entire classes of people. Yes, courtrooms must remain open to the public. But the agents, unlike journalists and other audience members, were not there as observers. They were there as government actors.
The courtroom is the civil cathedral of American government. It should be a place of reverence and a sanctuary from injustice. Of all of our institutions, it must avoid the taint of political influence to keep the trust of the people, for the power of the courts in a free society comes from the trust of the governed. Our trust has been tested time and again in the past year by high court decisions that appear contrary to the ideal of the common good. We must steel ourselves to frustration and keep the flame of a just America burning in our hearts.
The sanctity of American courtrooms must be preserved as a matter not only of justice, but of fairness. The notion that judges should not “disparage” federal immigration agents for shattering the sanctity of our most sacred civic space is dangerous to a functioning democracy.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-11 09:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Summer fruit in January — nature assisted by fossil fuels,Jim Cameron | Columnist,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/11/ct-summer-fruit-in-january/,"The next time you’re standing in the produce aisle, marveling at strawberries that taste like July, remember you’re not just buying fruit.","Over the holidays a dear friend sent me a wonderful present.  Not the proverbial “muffin basket” (of which I write so often), but a fresh fruit bonanza from Edible Arrangements that looked like a bouquet of flowers… beautiful and oh, so tasty!



As we devoured the perfectly ripe melon and delicious strawberries, it got me thinking about how lucky we in Connecticut are to be able to enjoy fresh, out-of-season fruit in the depths of winter.  But how it makes its way to our supermarkets is not only a tale of botany but of logistics and long-distance transportation at some cost to our environment: nature assisted by fossil fuels.
Take for example:
Strawberries: Mostly from Mexico, these are trucked but are prone to spoilage, hence the price.  Trade disputes and seasonal customs duties have periodically increased costs, also affecting avocados and berries.  Climate impact:  relatively high.
Oranges: Mostly from California and Florida, this fruit is picked, washed, sanitized, sorted and packed within 24 hours of ripening on the vine.  Stored at 38 – 45 degrees Fahrenheit in refrigerated trucks it begins a four- to six-day drive cross-country.  At food distribution hubs the truckloads are broken into smaller lots for local delivery.  Climate impact:  moderate.
Grapes: Your favorite snacking fruit has come a long way… 5,000+ miles from Chile.  After harvest the grapes are chilled to 32 degrees and packed in “reefers,” refrigerated shipping containers, for the 12 – 14 day ocean voyage to ports like Wilmington DE and Philadelphia for trucking to Connecticut.  Climate impact:  lower due to shipment by sea.
Blueberries: These are grown in Chile and Peru, hand-picked, washed, graded and packaged for refrigerated shipment to the U.S. by boat.  Climate impact:  lower per‑pound impact because sea freight is fuel‑efficient.
Bananas: This is the perfect fruit for long-distance delivery.  In Ecuador, Costa Rica and Colombia bananas grow on massive bunches weighing about 100 pounds.  Harvested while green and fully mature (but not ripe), they are washed, cut and packed into 40-pound boxes which must be stored at exactly 56 – 58 degrees and shipped in reefers with sophisticated monitoring of oxygen and CO2 levels.  After their 8 – 14 day ocean journey to the U.S. East Coast they are trucked to huge ripening facilities where ethylene gas is slowly added.  In about a week they’re ready for local stores.  Climate impact:  relatively low.
Pineapples: Almost all come from Costa Rica and Ecuador, not Hawaii. Picked almost fully-ripe, they are packed and shipped in reefers at a steady 45 – 50 degrees.  From harvesting to our local stores it’s a 10- to 16-day journey.  Climate impact:  moderate.
Melons: Cantaloupe and honeydew are largely imported from Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico in winter, with the Dominican Republic and other Caribbean sources supplying some specialty melons.  Climate impact:  moderate due to long distance reefer trucking.
Local greenhouses:  Not everything we enjoy in the winter is imported. Some Connecticut greenhouse keep turning out leafy greens, some tomatoes, cucumbers and herbs year round.  Climate impact: Minimal transport needs are offset by substantial winter heating requirements, which can give greenhouse crops a higher overall climate impact than their short travel distance might suggest.
So the next time you’re standing in the produce aisle, marveling at strawberries that taste like July, remember you’re not just buying fruit:  you’re looking at the literal ‘fruits’ of a globe-spanning transportation system running on diesel, refrigeration, container ships, human beings and carefully timed logistics.  
It’s a small reminder that our everyday conveniences quietly depend on a vast transportation network, one we rarely think about until those strawberries show up in the dead of winter.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/blueberries-1024x537.jpg,,,2026-01-11 04:57:50.574527

The Jackson Fire Department, the FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives  arrested a suspect Saturday night in the latest blaze after the fire department ruled it arson, according to lead investigator Charles Felton. Investigators did not immediately release the name of the suspect or the charges the person could face.
The fire was reported shortly after 3 a.m. at Beth Israel Congregation on Old Canton Road. No congregants were injured.
The library and administrative offices of Jackson’s only synagogue were reduced to charred ruins. Two Torahs were destroyed and five were damaged in the flames that erupted during Shabbat, the weekly Jewish day of rest, according to temple leaders. One Torah that survived the Holocaust was in a glass case and was undamaged in the fire.
Beth Israel has suspended services indefinitely. 
“We have already had outreach from other houses of worship in the Jackson area and greatly appreciate their support in this very difficult time,” the congregation president, Zach Shemper, said in a statement.

Arson is a criminal act of intentionally setting fire to a structure, Felton, the JFD division fire chief, told Mississippi Today. 
Investigators did not immediately know a possible motive, such as whether it was a hate crime. Jewish congregations have been attacked in the U.S. in the past several years, including in Pittsburgh, the San Diego area and Colleyville, Texas.
The state Homeland Security Office is also assisting in the investigation, said Mississippi Department of Public Safety spokesperson Bailey Martin Holloway.
Mayor John Horhn said he had spoken with Shemper and hoped for a “swift resolution as to the origin of these actions.”  
“I would hope that all Mississippians and all Jacksonians would commit themselves toward moving beyond such behavior and activity and find a way where we can all get together and get along,” Horhn said.

Felton said firefighters had responded shortly after 3 a.m. in response to a report about a possible “church fire.” After they could not determine the origin of the flames, he said his arson investigators were called to the scene and began to collect video surveillance. He said he received calls Saturday morning from the FBI and the ATF, as a matter of course when a fire occurs at a religious institution. 
On Saturday evening, reporters could smell soot outside the temple and observed a melted camera on the northeast wing of the building and six windows covered in plywood. 
An FBI agent standing next to yellow caution tape began collecting pictures and videos from people in the parking lot. Congregants and synagogue leadership had been at the temple all day, assessing the damage.

Some had gone inside the building, stepping over ash-filled puddles of water to retrieve sacred religious objects from the temple, including Torahs. One of the holiest objects in the Jewish religion, the scrolls typically weigh dozens of pounds and stand a couple feet tall.
The fire also burned the synagogue’s Tree of Life, a plaque that honors and records special occasions for congregants such as bar and bat mitzvahs. 
One congregant, David Edelstein, typically attends Saturday morning services. He did not know the synagogue had been burned when he arrived, but he immediately tried to figure out what had happened.

Initially, congregants believed lightning from thunderstorms the night before had started the fire, so Edelstein said he flew a drone over the top of the synagogue and determined that had not happened. 
The hours moved by fast, he said. As Edelstein, wearing a protective breathing mask, helped measure one of the broken library windows, he looked inside and spotted a book lying face up. He stepped into the library to look closer. 
It was open to the Shema, one of the most important prayers in the Jewish faith that reads “Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.” 
“Everything’s charred and stuff but one of the books was on top, opened up right to that,” he said.
Similar to Saturday’s blaze, the 1967 bombing and fire heavily damaged the synagogue’s administrative offices and library but injured no congregants. The rabbi at the time, Perry Nussbaum, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that “bigots” were responsible for the fire, and he believed they might have been inspired by anti-Semitic campaign materials used extensively in that year’s Democratic primary for governor.
Mayor Horhn, 70, said he has some recollection of the 1967 attack, when he was 12.
“I do remember that the Jewish community and the African American community in those days formed alliances and partnerships to fight racism, to fight injustice, to fight mistreatment of citizens for whatever reason,” Horhn said.

Phillip Ensler, D-Montgomery, kicked off his lieutenant governor campaign Saturday, promising to use the constitutionally weak office to bring people together.
“I am running to try to bring Alabamians with different backgrounds and political identities together, knowing that we will never agree on everything, but we can find common ground on the things that we all want,” Ensler said.
Speaking to more than 100 people at the RSA Activity Center in downtown Montgomery, Ensler pointed out Alabama’s low national rank in education and access to affordable health care. He promised to work to fix those issues instead of creating more, like what he said other politicians do.

“They demonize and marginalize those who are different. They create problems rather than solve them. They skew ignorance and lie in vitriol just to score political points,” Ensler said. “They enjoy having the title, but do not do a damn thing to actually serve the people.”
In his 10-minute speech, Ensler also promised to work to expand Medicaid, eliminate the sales tax on groceries and create a state lottery. The Legislature cut the state grocery tax to 2% in the 2025 legislative session.
“Most people in Alabama want the same things: more money in their pockets to afford the expenses of life,” he said. “They want safe neighborhoods and reduce gun violence. They want quality public schools that prepare our children for the future, and they want access to affordable health care.”
The governor can expand Medicaid by order, but the Legislature would have to approve funding for it. Ensler said that expanding Medicaid and a lottery would bring in revenue for the state to address its education and health care concerns.
“People are having to drive hours now to get to an emergency room. They’re having to drive hard instances to deliver a baby. So really focusing on Alabama implementing Medicaid expansion once and for all,” Ensler said in an interview before the event. “The lottery, that’s something the Senate came one vote short. Using the ability to bring people together, I have a record of doing that at the Legislature.”
The lieutenant governor presides over the Senate and votes if the chamber should deadlock on a proposal. The occupant of the office also becomes governor should the governor leave office before the end of his or her term, but otherwise has very little power. 
Before Ensler got into Alabama politics, he taught history at Robert E. Lee High School in Montgomery. Two of his former students, Udonna Simpson and Josiah King Rodgers, spoke of Ensler’s character.
“I am from Highland Park, which is a lower-income neighborhood here in Montgomery, Alabama, that is often affected by gun violence. However, Rep. Ensler, he was right there. In the Alabama heat, in the Alabama cold, morning, noon, day, night,” Simpson said. “He was right there, advocating, speaking for residents.”
In July, Ensler announced that he would not seek re-election for House District 74 to move back to his home state, New York, to be closer to family.
Rep. Patrice McClammy, D-Montgomery, attended the event in support of Ensler, but she said that even if there was another Democrat running for the position she would still support Ensler.
“I’ve worked with him in the State House, and all the things he’s done, in the Mayor’s office and the community,” McClammy said in an interview after the event. “I told him, ‘You’re not leaving.’”
Since the beginning of his campaign in mid-December, Ensler has raised over $54,000, according to campaign finance records. All of the campaign donations came from individuals, according to the reports. 
Ensler is the first Democrat to join the lieutenant governor race, joining five Republicans, who include current Secretary of State Wes Allen, Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture Rick Pate, businesswoman Nicole Wadsworth, former gubernatorial candidate Dean Odle and sheriff’s deputy Patrick Bishop. Qualifying for the midterm elections ends on Jan 23. 
Ensler acknowledges the uphill battle of winning a statewide office, despite flipping House District 74 in 2022. 
“I’m not running against someone, I’m running for something,” Ensler said in an interview before the event. “Whoever it is, we’re going to focus on the solutions and be laser focused on that, because that’s what people care about.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC_1139-scaled-e1768098281179-1024x612.jpg,,,2026-01-10 21:57:46.409962

Daricka Moore, a 24-year-old man related to at least four of the victims, is in custody charged with first-degree murder. He is being held without bail in the Clay County Jail in West Point.
Clay County Sheriff Eddie Scott said at a news conference Saturday that a cadre of state and local law enforcement arrested Moore at a safety checkpoint about a half mile from the second crime scene. The search included local officers and those from Mississippi Highway Patrol, the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation and the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics.
District Attorney Scott Colom said the charges could be upgraded to multiple counts of capital murder.
“I don’t know what kind of motive there could be to shoot a 7-year-old child,” Colom said.
The rampage began before 7 p.m. at a home on David Hill Road. Moore allegedly fatally shot his father, Glenn Moore, 67; uncle, Willie Guine, 55; and brother Quinten Moore, 33. Scott said each man was shot in the head.
Scott said the suspect stole Quinton Moore’s F150 truck and drove to the second crime scene, where he allegedly broke into the house and tried to sexually assault someone before killing the 7-year-old girl, whom the sheriff said identified as the suspect’s second cousin.
WTVA-TV reported that her family identified her as Mikiylia Guines.
The child’s mother and two other children were in the home. After the girl was killed, Moore allegedly put a gun to the head of another child, believed to be even younger, Scott said.
Scott said Moore then drove to a home on Siloam-Griffith Road, where investigators found the aluminum-colored truck hidden behind the house. That’s where they discovered the bodies of Barry Bradley and Samuel Bradley, who also apparently had been shot in the head. One of them was the pastor of an Apostolic church.

Scott said the family is experiencing overwhelming grief.
“For this family to lose this many family members in one setting is just hard to imagine,” Scott said.
Colom said that when the sheriff briefed him on what happened, “it really shook me. It’s the worst I’ve ever seen. Six people’s lives taken.”
Moore is scheduled for his first court appearance Monday in Clay County while investigators search for answers and the state Crime Lab begins running ballistics tests. 
“This guy has not been on our radar. We don’t know what was going through his mind,” Scott said.
He said gun violence is happening all across the country. This mass shooting comes less than three months after seven people were killed and many others were wounded in multiple shootings in Mississippi following high school and a college homecoming games.
Colom said the death penalty would have to be considered in this case. “If it’s eligible, you have to seek to seek the highest punishment under Mississippi law,” he said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/06100414/EddieScottDOYLE-26-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-10 20:57:08.875495

The marchers began at Powderhorn Park and passed by the site where Good was killed. The protest was part of over a 1,000 planned demonstrations against ICE across the nation this weekend.
Among the demonstrators was a group of Roosevelt High School students. Hours after ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good, Border Patrol agents arrived at the high school and deployed tear gas as students were being dismissed.
“I want to be able to go to work and school without worrying that we are going to be attacked,” said junior Maria Delong, who said she burst into tears watching a video of her favorite teachers being tackled by federal agents.

Fahad Mo, 26, is a Somali-American who grew up in Cedar-Riverside, which has a large Somali community. He’s part of the Cedar-Riverside Protection Alliance, a newly formed group working to protect the Somali community in the neighborhood from immigration officers.
“I want Trump to know Somali-Americans are always going to be here,” Mo said at the protest. “Immigrants are always going to be here.”
The Minnesota Somali community has been the focus of a targeted deportation campaign by the Trump administration since late November, even though the vast majority are citizens or legal residents.
Protests at the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, which federal immigration agents use as a base, has been more confrontational. Federal agents fired pepper balls at a small group of protesters at the Whipple Building at the same time as the much larger Powderhorn protest, CNN reported.
On Friday night, police arrested 30 people, who have since been released, for blocking streets and damaging property at a protest outside hotels in downtown Minneapolis where ICE agents are thought to be staying, the Star Tribune reported. The police said protesters caused about $6,000 in damage from broken windows and graffiti at the Depot Renaissance Hotel.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Protesters gathered around the downtown federal building in Nebraska’s capital city to demonstrate for justice after the shooting death of a Minnesota woman by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. 
Several hundred protesters gathered at Centennial Mall. Some chanted, “Immigrants are welcome here.” Others held anti-ICE signs as cars honked.  In addition to the protest in Lincoln, organizers said there was one demonstration in Omaha and three others across the state, part of national protests organized by Indivisible, a political and social organization that says it works to resist the Trump administration. 
The protests in Nebraska came after an ICE agent shot and killed a Minnesota woman and federal agents shot two people in Oregon this week.

Karen Burchard, a 53-year-old Lincoln resident, said she showed up to let people know that “we are living under authoritarian rule.”
“If [ICE] is bold enough to do that on the street, then what are they doing to our neighbors and friends that are detained?” Burchard asked. 
Another protester, a Lincoln resident who didn’t wish to disclose a name for fear of losing a job with the government, said people went to protest to “keep searching for the truth and accountability” from the Trump administration.
“I believe in this country,” the protester said. “I believe we’re going the wrong way.”

President Donald Trump and other federal officials have said the Minnesota agent had acted “in self-defense,” while Minnesota state officials have questioned federal accounts of the shooting as “propaganda” and blamed stepped-up immigration enforcement, expanded hiring and lax training. Minnesota investigators say they have been excluded from the investigation. 
A New York Times analysis of videos from three different angles shows the woman, 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, turning her SUV away from the ICE agent, who has been identified as Jonathan Ross, and that he was not in the path of her vehicle when he fired three shots at close range. 
Another video from the cellphone held by the agent who fatally shot Good appears to show him just to the side of the vehicle when he fires, according to footage published by Alpha News, a conservative news outlet. It was not immediately clear whether the SUV made contact with the officer or where the agent was standing when he fired the shots.

Another discussion point for protesters on Saturday was the shooting in Portland involving two people shot by federal agents a day after Good was shot and killed. 
Portland Police said the two people shot were tied to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. The Department of Homeland Security claimed Luis David Nico Moncada, one of the two people shot, “weaponized” the vehicle against officers who shot in self-defense. 
Nebraska saw protests against federal immigration agents last year after an ICE raid on Glenn Valley Foods in Omaha sent people to a North Platte jail. 
U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican serving Nebraska’s Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District, said this week that “it’s very important that we get the facts.” 
“We should take a deep breath,” Bacon told reporters. “Let’s investigate and let the judicial system work.”

The event was part of a nationwide wave of protests planned in the aftermath of the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis on Wednesday and a Border Patrol shooting in Portland on Thursday.
Organized by Indivisible Grand Junction, the “ICE Out For Good” protest drew hundreds of people to the Old County Courthouse in Grand Junction. It was billed as a silent protest to honor Good and remember others who have died in ICE custody under the Trump administration. Organizers listed the names of more than 30 people who have died while in ICE custody in 2025 and two, including Good, who have died this year.
Protesters demanded accountability for ICE and called for the agency to leave their communities.

Hundreds of people gathered at the Colorado Capitol in Denver on Friday night to protest Good’s killing. Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was from Colorado Springs and was living in Minneapolis.
Activists in Colorado Springs held a vigil for Good outside the El Paso County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday night, an event that the Colorado Springs Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression said was to condemn her killing and “honor her life in her hometown.”



“She went to the same schools that we went to … she lived in the same neighborhoods that we lived in,” said Brandon Rincon, the group’s founder, according to Colorado Springs TV station KRDO. “It just makes us want to fight for her more.”
The Trump administration last year implemented mass deportation efforts, which have prompted a series of protests as aggressive enforcement methods resulted in a spike in arrests, including of people with no criminal record or charges, and questions about due process.
An “ICE Out” protest is planned for 9 a.m., Sunday, at the ICE Denver Field Office in Centennial.

Those are among the outcomes so far of the neighborhood process and design review for a desperately needed affordable housing project in Jamaica Plain. They are emblematic of Boston’s broken land use process, through which neighbors assert parochial interests to stymie needed housing development or impose additional costs and delays. Even when that development advances the city’s purported goals – goals that city leaders appear unwilling to expend political capital to advance.
Founded in 1860, Rogerson Communities provides assisted living, memory care services, and independent living opportunities to older adults in the Commonwealth. In the summer of 2024, Rogerson began meeting with neighbors near its 3.2-acre site on the Jamaicaway and in August it filed a Letter of Intent with the Boston Planning Department, announcing plans to redevelop a surface parking lot and a vacant single-family home.  
The first phase of the initial proposal sought to replace the lot with below-grade parking and construct a new building that would replace existing memory care and day programs, and add 71 units of affordable senior housing. The building would be seven stories tall, exceeding the three-story maximum under the zoning code, but still one story less than the eight-story building next door. As initially presented, the project offered outdoor space for community use, used passive housing construction, and collected and reused rainwater for landscaping.
Although there was some support from neighbors, opposition coalesced early last year around the three-legged stool of NIMBYism — traffic, parking and “neighborhood character” — as well as height and shadows.  
A few insisted they weren’t against affordable housing, just this project. The one near, if not quite in, their backyard. Predictably, the result was a revised and smaller project, reduced first to 67 and then to 41 units of affordable housing. Fewer people housed. Higher per-unit costs. A neighborhood’s physical character preserved at the expense of the additional housing needed to preserve its social fabric. 
The reduction in the number of units at the Rogerson-Beaufort project is not an anomaly. It is the order of business in Boston — where excessive public processes, an outdated and outsized zoning code, and the influence of an unrepresentative set of residents combine to choke the supply of housing at every turn. 
Thirty units may seem inconsequential, but cumulatively such reductions, which happen over and over when development projects are reviewed, exacerbate our desperate housing shortage. The result is a city that talks about solving its housing crisis but whose actions – collectively and individually – ensure the problem persists.
Rogerson Communities’ proposal would seem to check all the boxes that city officials purport to care about. It replaced a surface parking lot with new community space, trees, and much-needed housing. It added a significant number of new parking spaces via a garage. The design was thoughtful, the building attractive, and the traffic impacts minimal. Most importantly, the project promised homes for low-income seniors in a city where older residents face escalating housing costs. 
The neighbors who oppose this and other projects reflect the natural tendency of what Dartmouth economist William Fischel famously termed “homevoters” – the homeowners who dominate local politics and discourage higher density development they perceive as a threat to their property values. This phenomenon can be found not just in smaller suburban communities, but also in urban areas. 
Our zoning system should not pit neighborhoods against one another in a desire to resist new development. In a functioning system, a city would plan and zone in a manner that permits as-of-right future development in response to growth and changes in demand.
A recent study found that 58 percent of parcels in Boston are nonconforming with respect to floor-area ratio. In other words, most buildings that exist would not be legal to build today.
We are not simply failing to zone in a manner that permits needs development. We are zoning in a manner so restrictive that our current city, the one so many are so eager to preserve in amber, would be impossible to build today.
Boston’s development review process, while perhaps intended to advance  thoughtful, democratic decision-making, in practice reflects an ad hoc system of neighborhood vetoes. Those who attend meetings and submit comments are overwhelmingly older and more likely to own homes, consistent with the experience in other communities. Allowing informal neighborhood groups and the unrepresentative collection of individuals with time and flexibility to show up on a Tuesday night to shape or halt projects undermines the rule of law.  
Rather than reflecting some sort of democratic ideal of local control, Boston’s process empowers those who already have housing to block housing for those who do not. 
Maintaining the status quo benefits those who already own property and possess the resources to wield political power. As Mayor Wu herself wrote in her 2019 report Fixing Boston’s Broken Development Process, “A system of special approvals driven by influence disadvantages those without resources.” Yet the mayor has, after one full term, done little to move the city away from this system.  
Modest attempts to upzone neighborhoods have moved slowly. Development still depends upon a system of discretionary relief. So Boston approves more than 1,000 variance applications each year, compared with single- and double-digit numbers in far larger cities. We patch together a city through ad hoc determinations in which local interests dictate the outcome. Efforts to modernize the process focus on maintaining this community review of individual projects. 
Fixing Boston’s land use system requires more than tinkering at the margins. It demands a wholesale rethinking of how the city regulates land and how it decides what gets built and where. Zoning should, as its earliest proponents recognized, allow for development in response to present and future needs. Only then will it serve the general welfare that provides the legal basis for its existence.  
The city must limit the ability of individual residents and neighborhood groups to delay or downsize projects, as a Boston Globe editorial recently recognized. Public participation is valuable at the level of crafting policy and developing zoning; it should not govern case-by-case determinations regarding individual projects. Elected officials responsive to their constituents should set the course of development rather than self-appointed neighborhood representatives.   
Perhaps the plot of land across the street from my home in Jamaica Plain was not the best place in the city for 30 additional units of affordable housing. However, in a system where discretionary review determines what can be built, rather than as-of-right zoning implemented through a citywide process, no one is considering the broader context and adequately weighing the general welfare.  
The housing crisis is not inevitable. It is the direct result of choices—choices made in hearing rooms and zoning meetings, choices to privilege trees over people and process over progress. If Boston wants to live up to its ideals, it must choose differently.

The weekly demonstration organized by the local chapter of Indivisible, the national protest group, usually draws 60-100 people. But the crowd swelled after Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was shot during a Wednesday raid on the city’s immigrant community.

“We are afraid and that is not fair. None of this is fair. We have laws, they don’t obey them. We have rights, they don’t observe them,” she said, imploring the crowd to be brave. “We are here together.” 
Many protesters held homemade signs denouncing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and President Donald Trump. Following similar deployments to Los Angeles, Chicago, and Portland, Oregon, the Trump administration sent more than 2,000 law enforcement officers to the Twin Cities in recent days. 
Part of that force was ICE agent Jonathan Ross, who Trump said was justified in shooting Good, contradicting video evidence of the encounter. Since the shooting, the administration said it is sending even more federal officers to the city.
ICE agents have also been spotted on the streets of Maine in recent weeks.
“Your ICE thugs can’t stop us. We’ll stand up side by side,” sang Cape Elizabeth resident Becky Bronson, adapting the lyrics of “All you fascists” by Woody Guthrie. “For everyone you’re hurting, for everyone who’s died. We’ll melt you down, get the f**k out of our town.”
Saturday’s rally is the second protest the city has seen since the Minneapolis shooting, echoing demonstrations across the country. On Thursday evening, hundreds gathered in downtown Portland for a vigil. Other rallies were planned elsewhere in Maine Saturday, including South Portland, Yarmouth, Bangor and Saco.
In a statement posted to her Senate campaign Facebook page Wednesday evening, Gov. Janet Mills called the shooting a “horrific tragedy” and said Trump “has weaponized ICE into an unaccountable, masked armed force deployed at his will to target those he opposes.”
“Maine cannot and will not turn a blind eye to ICE’s unacceptable actions,” she added, pointing to her recent announcement that she would allow legislation restricting local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement to become law. 
Molly Curren Rowles, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, said that the “level of brutality that we are seeing displayed by ICE is unprecedented.”
“I think when we see violations of law like this one, the extent of danger is really impalpable,” Curren Rowles said, adding that the demonstrations show that there’s “many people who realize, this is the time to speak up, and act up and get involved.”

Good was killed while acting as a legal observer, which Curren Rowles explained is a show “of solidarity for people who may not be personally affected to go and provide support and watch what’s happening and observe.”
Portland resident Kim Wells said, for her, Good represents “Americans who don’t necessarily have to come out and speak, protesting.” 
Wells, who stood on the roadside holding a homemade sign featuring a picture of Good, also pointed out that she isn’t the first person who has been killed by ICE. “Immigrants have been getting murdered for the last year, but it takes a middle class white woman for people to start uniting,” she said.
Asked how Mainers can keep themselves safe, Curren Rowles pointed to the ACLU’s many resources and said, “Knowing your rights is critically important.”
“We need to understand our rights in order to exercise them and also in order to make sure they don’t go away and advocate for them,” she said. “And this is the time to really do that.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/anti-ice-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-10 16:57:29.188735
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-10 21:01:29+00:00,CT Mirror,CT residents join ‘ICE Out for Good’ protests after fatal shooting of Renee Good,Reginald David and John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/10/ice-out-for-good-protests-ct-fairfield-fatal-shooting-renee-good/,Hundreds of people turned out to protest around CT on Saturday for the ICE Out for Good Weekend of Action.,"More than 100 people gathered outside the Home Depot on Grasmere Avenue in Fairfield late Saturday morning, filling the sidewalk with handmade signs, chants and the steady sound of car horns from drivers slowing down to show support.
For months, the big box store’s parking lot has been a familiar meeting spot. Since mid-October, a small but committed group of protesters has returned nearly every Saturday, standing near the main entrance with a large banner that reads, “Neighbors, Not ICE.”
“The first day it was just four of us, because that’s how many people it takes to hold the sign,” said Callie Heilmann, a co-director of Bridgeport Generation Now who has helped organize the protests since they began last fall.
That changed this week.
Following the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Heilmann said organizers put out a call on the organizing platform Mobilize, asking people to show up for an emergency protest as part of a nationwide “ICE Out For Good” Weekend of Action.
By Saturday morning, more than 100 people had signed up, roughly 10 times the typical turnout.
“This came together in 24 hours,” Heilmann said.

The protest began around 11 a.m., with demonstrators lining the sidewalk along Grasmere Avenue, holding signs that read “ICE Out for Good,” “Abolish ICE,” and “No Human Is Illegal.” As chants echoed across the parking lot, cars driving past honked repeatedly, some drivers raising fists or waving through open windows.
Organizers said the protest was part of a broader, grassroots response to what they describe as a pattern of unchecked violence and lack of accountability by federal immigration enforcement agencies.
On Wednesday, Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother, was killed during an encounter involving U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in Minneapolis. The shooting has sparked outrage across the country, with critics accusing the federal government of immediately defending the officers involved and failing to provide transparency or accountability.
Although there was a large turnout at the Fairfield event, the protest remained peaceful. The events were in contrast to a vigil two days earlier in Hartford in which a group of people confronted vehicles exiting a federal building on the other side of where a peaceful vigil was being held in reaction to Good’s death. 
The incident ended with one person being struck by a vehicle and at least half a dozen being pepper sprayed. Hartford officials said Friday they had a “strong suspicion” the people driving the vehicles involved in the encounter were federal employees.
Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam also said Friday that the events are being investigated by the local police and the Department of Homeland Security. He said the violence that occurred on Thursday night “is a direct result of the lawlessness and recklessness of the Trump administration that has occurred over the past year and that last night came here to the city of Hartford, that resulted earlier this week in the death of Renee Good in Minneapolis. That chaos that we saw last night didn’t come from the city of Hartford.”
Among those who answered the call to protest Saturday in Fairfield were Hillie McTernan, 38, and her friend Lisa Endo, 44, both of Fairfield.
McTernan said she and Endo have attended nearly a dozen “No Kings” events and other demonstrations opposing the Trump administration over the past year. Still, she said the response to the fatal shooting of Good felt different, and deeply alarming.
“It feels like it could happen to anyone now,” McTernan said. “The government response was just complete defense of the officers. That’s horrifying.”

Nearby, Karen Butler, an 81-year-old Norwalk resident, stood holding a sign that read “ICE Out for Good,” decorated with an illustration of a woman created by a Chicago-based artist. Butler described herself as a veteran of recent protests but said the moment felt darker than others she had experienced.
“My earlier signs were too kind,” Butler said. “I’m defending democracy. I never thought it would end up like this.”
Saturday’s rally was one of hundreds planned nationwide as part of the ICE Out for Good Weekend of Action. Organizers said protests were scheduled in cities and towns across the country, including roughly a dozen locations in Connecticut such as Brookfield, Torrington and New London.
For many who attended the Fairfield protest, Good’s death raised fears not just about immigration enforcement, but about public safety and the rule of law more broadly.
Sonya Huber, 54, of Stratford, said the incident sent a chilling message to communities already feeling vulnerable.
“I don’t know who among us is safe,” Huber said. “If we’re coming to a protest, I think it represents a complete disregard for the rule of law and the safety of residents and citizens.”
She added that the shooting has had a ripple effect far beyond Minnesota.
“It’s a major alarm bell among thousands,” Huber said. “It strikes fear in those who are willing to stand up for the most vulnerable.”
Mike Martinez, 26, a Shelton resident, said he came to the protest out of frustration and anger, describing the fatal shooting as part of a broader erosion of democratic norms.
“The slaughter of American citizens under this administration is just beyond incomprehensible,” Martinez said. “How we let this happen after Jan. 6, five years ago, is an indictment on us as a nation, and especially the 50% who voted.”
When asked what message he hoped the protest would send, Martinez said unity was central.
“That we’re going to stand united,” he said. “This is inhumane, and we’re not going to allow it. We’re not going to allow fascists to rule this country.”
He added that the size of the crowd was itself a statement.
“The half of the country that opposes this administration is louder than the half that supports it,” Martinez said.

Bridgeport resident Litzy Leon, 25, said she felt compelled to attend after learning more details about Good’s death.
“I just feel like it’s absurd that we’re allowing a murderer free only because he holds the title of ICE agent,” Leon said. “She wasn’t even doing anything wrong, she was just driving away. There was no attack on the agent.”
Leon said the incident also raised concerns about gun use and accountability within federal agencies.
“The gun control is just crazy,” she said.
When asked what kind of accountability protesters are calling for, Leon said the demands are basic, but urgent.
“At the very minimum, we need to see a trial,” she said. “An investigation needs to be held. A trial needs to happen. All respect towards Renee.”
Throughout the protest, speakers rotated through a megaphone, leading chants and urging passersby to learn more about immigration enforcement practices and how to support impacted communities. Organizers emphasized that the Fairfield demonstration was not just about one incident, but about sustained pressure.
Heilmann said the weekly protests will continue.
“This isn’t going away,” she said. “People are scared, they’re angry, and they’re paying attention. And they’re showing up.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0224-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-10 16:12:40.524275
