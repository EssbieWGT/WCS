The Missouri House on Monday advanced legislation that would reinstate state-run presidential preference primaries and extend the no-excuse absentee voting period from two to six weeks.


Supporters of House Bill 126 cited a widespread positive response to the recently enacted no-excuse voting period as a motivating factor. They also noted negative feedback on the 2024 party-run caucuses, which replaced the state-run primaries after they were eliminated as part of a law passed in 2022.


The no-excuse absentee voting period has been in effect since August 2022 and allows voters to cast their ballot in elections in person or by mail starting two weeks before Election Day.
Supporters of the bill said they hoped that extending the no-excuse voting period would further alleviate stress on election workers and encourage voters to cast their ballot.
The state of Missouri ran March presidential primaries from 2000 until 2020. A 2022 law signed by former Gov. Mike Parson eliminated them. In 2024, the Republican Party held in-person caucuses in Missouri to select their delegates, while Democrats opted for a hybrid caucus with in-person voting and a mail-in ballot.
Low participation in these caucuses, alongside vocal blowback from residents who preferred the state-run primaries, were cited as motivators for reinstating the primaries.
“I believe it’s a lot simpler for our residents of our state going to cast a ballot like they do it in every other way for their preference for the presidential primary,” said state Rep. Brad Banderman, a Republican St. Clair.
Under the bill primaries would be held on the first Tuesday of March during presidential election years. The estimated cost to the state for conducting the primaries is $8 million.
The bill’s supporters also noted that unlike previous years, where the primary results have not been binding to party delegates, both political parties have agreed to adhere to the results for the first ballot at their respective party conventions.
The House needs to approve the legislation one more time before it heads to the Senate.

Supreme Court will decide if the state overstepped its authority in taking over Paterson police in 2023 after a controversial killing.,"Paterson officials say no state law explicitly empowered Attorney General Matt Platkin to declare control of their 300-officer force in 2023. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Almost two years after the state took over the troubled Paterson Police Department, attorneys argued before the New Jersey Supreme Court Monday over whether it had the authority to do so.
Paterson officials, who sued the state seven months after the March 2023 takeover, have asserted that no state law explicitly empowered Attorney General Matt Platkin to declare control of the 300-officer force. Instead, under home rule, only municipalities have direct operational oversight of local police departments, said attorney Christopher Gramiccioni, who represents Paterson Mayor Andre Sayegh and other officials.
State officials, though, have cited several laws they say gave Platkin that authority. Deputy Solicitor General Michael Zuckerman insisted the takeover, which came after a controversial and deadly police encounter, lies squarely within Platkin’s duties to ensure both public confidence in law enforcement and the uniform, efficient application of criminal laws statewide.
While a state appeals panel sided with Paterson in December, the rapid-fire questions the Supreme Court justices showered on Gramiccioni, Zuckerman, and other attorneys over two hours of arguments Monday suggests the appellate ruling might not stand.
Dominating the discussion were two state laws both sides cited to make their case — the 1970 Criminal Justice Act, which designated the attorney general as the state’s chief law enforcement officer, and a 2023 law known as Chapter 94 that state legislators passed after the Paterson takeover to facilitate it.
Gramiccioni argued that state legislators never intended to empower the state attorney general to seize control of municipal police departments because neither law explicitly spells out such authority. The Criminal Justice Act allows county prosecutors to take over local agencies, but only with the agency’s consent, he added.
Zuckerman countered that the attorney general’s takeover power is “strongly implied, if it’s not expressly granted.”
“If the attorney general can supersede a county prosecutor, and the county prosecutor can supersede municipally, it follows that the attorney general can supersede municipal law enforcement directly,” he said.
Justice Fabiana Pierre-Louis pushed back on any claim that consent is needed.
“Where in the statutes does it tell us that there has to be consent in order for such supersession to occur?” she said.
Gramiccioni conceded consent isn’t expressly required by law.
The justices also zeroed in on Chapter 94, which authorized the attorney general, when superseding a law enforcement agency, to appoint an officer in charge who hasn’t completed training through the state Police Training Commission as long as the officer completes the training within one year of appointment. That became an issue when Platkin appointed Isa Abbassi, a New York Police Department veteran, to replace Paterson’s chief, Engelbert Ribeiro, after the takeover.
The law did not mention Paterson, but it might as well have, Justice Rachel Wainer Apter said. Under the law’s verbiage, it specifically applies to “a city of the first class having a population of less than 200,000 according to the federal 2020 decennial census,” she noted.
“It seems to say everything it could, aside from ‘the City of Paterson.’ How can you argue that this is actually not referring to this particular supersession, and is instead referring to some other possible supersession where it was consensual?” Wainer Apter said.
The justices noted as further proof of a Paterson link that while Gov. Phil Murphy signed the law in July 2023, legislators made it retroactive to March 1, 2023. Platkin announced his office’s takeover of Paterson on March 27, 2023.
Chief Justice Stuart Rabner also pointed to state funding allocated to effectuate the Paterson takeover.
“So the Legislature authorized $18 million for the attorney general’s takeover of the Paterson Police Department, but you view that as — how does one view that if not actual validation and support for what the attorney general has done?” Rabner said.
Zuckerman backed up that sentiment, saying: “If the Legislature had felt our reading was the wrong one, they would have told us to knock it off, and instead, they partnered with us and helped support this particular supersession.”
Gramiccioni exhorted justices to weigh only the statutory language rather than inferring legislative intent through “collective sources of law.”
“I would submit this: It’s the law that holds the supreme power, not a monarch who is basically creating this out of thin air, on a whim, on when he can go in and supersede a municipal police department,” Gramiccioni said.
But Zuckerman urged justices to regard Chapter 94 and the state funding as proof of legislative intent that the attorney general has the power to take over police departments in rare, warranted cases, such as Paterson, where police have a long history of brutality and civil rights violations that local officials have failed to stop.
“Our Legislature has provided unusually striking evidence, not only that it understood and intended for supersessions like this one to be lawful, but also that it was working with the executive branch to help this very supersession succeed,” Zuckerman said. “That is fatal to the challengers’ position.”
Henal Patel, an attorney for the New Jersey Institute of Social Justice who argued Monday in favor of the takeover, told justices that supersession is an important tool legislators gave the attorney general to restore trust when police have broken it. She pointed to the deaths of several residents at the hands of Paterson police, including Najee Seabrooks, a community activist who officers gunned down after he called 911 for help during a mental crisis.
“The legislative intent here was to provide the AG with broad powers to rebuild public trust, including supersession powers, and New Jersey’s AG properly exercised that power,” Patel said. “I want to emphasize the stakes here. If this court were to affirm the appellate division’s opinion, the people of Paterson, especially its Black and brown residents, will be left without justice, and public trust would remain broken.”
Attorney Vito A. Gagliardi Jr., representing the New Jersey State Association of Chiefs of Police, urged justices to set standards for supersession, saying police and municipal leaders deserve clarity on why the state would take over their force and advance notice when that occurs.
Zuckerman told the justices that while county prosecutors have taken over municipal police forces at least 17 times in recent decades, state takeovers of local police departments are historically rare in New Jersey. Besides Paterson, the attorney general’s office took over the embattled Camden police department in 1998, and that department disbanded altogether in 2013.
“This office has never done it other than those two times,” Zuckerman said. “So I think that tells you everything you need to know about how we view it as a break-the-glass kind of tool, as opposed to a just-do-it-because-you-feel-like-it kind of tool.”

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin’s spring election takes place Tuesday, with voters across the state weighing in on the races for state Supreme Court and superintendent of schools, a constitutional amendment and local offices.
Polls open at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m. Voters who are already in line to vote when polls close should remain in line and will still be able to cast their ballots. Absentee ballots must be returned by the time polls close and can be returned to a voter’s polling place or municipal clerk’s office. Information on polling places can be found at MyVote.WI.gov. 
Hundreds of thousands of Wisconsinites have already cast their ballots, surpassing the early vote turnout of the 2023 Supreme Court race when 1.8 million people voted. On the Monday before the election that year, more than 409,000 ballots had already been cast. This year, more than 644,000 votes have already been cast, with Dane and Milwaukee counties each seeing the most turnout. More than 100,000 votes have already been cast in both counties. 
While the lower turnout of spring elections means results usually come faster than in presidential elections, state law still doesn’t allow election officials to begin processing absentee ballots until polls open on Election Day. Last year, Republicans in the state Senate killed a bill that would have allowed absentee ballots to start being processed on the Monday before the election. This means that especially in Milwaukee, where all absentee ballots are processed and counted at one central count location, results may take longer to come in. 
Supreme Court race
The race for Wisconsin Supreme Court is the most consequential on the ballot on Tuesday, with the ideological balance of the body up for grabs. Liberal-backed Dane County Judge Susan Crawford is taking on conservative-backed Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel. The winner will replace retiring Justice Ann Walsh Bradley. 
Wisconsin is holding the first statewide election in the country since President Donald Trump was elected last November. That opportunity to test the voting public’s mood, and the $20 million that Trump adviser Elon Musk has pumped into the race to support Schimel, has turned the race into a referendum on the first months of the second Trump administration. 
Musk appeared at a rally in Green Bay on Sunday night to advocate for Schimel, give $1 million to two attendees and hype up his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has been making drastic cuts to federal agencies and programs. 
Schimel has said he is running to remove partisanship from the Court and that if elected he would  treat Trump like any other litigant in a case. But he also told a group of canvassers associated with Trump-aligned Turning Point USA that he’d be a “support network” for Trump on the Court and, the Washington Post reported, told a group of Republicans in Jefferson County that Trump was “screwed over” by the Court when it ruled against Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of  the 2020 election. 
Democrats and Crawford’s campaign have accused Musk of attempting to buy a seat on the state Supreme Court. They point to Musk’s current litigation in Wisconsin challenging a state law that prevents Tesla from selling cars directly to consumers. Democrats have held People v. Musk town halls across the state where attendees said they were worried about DOGE’s cuts to Social Security, Medicaid and education. 
At the only debate between the two candidates in March, Crawford called her opponent “Elon Schimel.” Crawford has said if elected she’ll be a justice who seeks to protect the rights of all Wisconsinites while Schimel has said he’s running to counter the alleged partisanship of the Court since liberals won a majority in 2023. 
The race for Supreme Court has set the record for most expensive judicial campaign in U.S. history. The race recently surpassed the $100 million mark, nearly doubling the record set by Wisconsin’s 2023 Supreme Court election when more than $50 million was spent in the race between Justice Janet Protasiewicz and former Justice Dan Kelly. 
While the race has been nationalized, the winner will hold a deciding vote in cases that could decide how Wisconsin’s congressional maps are drawn, how pollution is regulated, the collective bargaining rights of the state’s workers and if Wisconsin women have the right to access an abortion.
Superintendent of Schools
Also on the ballot on Tuesday is the race for superintendent of schools. The race is between incumbent Jill Underly, supported by the state Democratic party, and Brittany Kinser, an education consultant who’s been backed by the state Republican Party. 
The two candidates appeared together at just one virtual forum, with Underly declining to attend a number of proposed events. Kinser has criticized Underly’s effort to change the standards used to assess student progress and advocated for more support for the state’s “school choice” programs including taxpayer-funded private school vouchers. 
Underly is endorsed by the state’s teachers union and says she will defend  public schools against privatization efforts by school choice advocates such as Kinser. 
Voter ID amendment
Voters will also weigh in on a proposed constitutional amendment to codify the state’s voter ID law. The Republican-authored proposal would require that voters provide a photo ID to register to vote, which is already the law. Republicans say the amendment is necessary to prevent the state  Supreme Court from striking down the voter ID requirement. Republicans have increasingly used the constitutional amendment process in recent years as a way to shape state law, avoiding Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ veto.

Andrew Ireland, R-Indianapolis, introduces a bill barring public entities from funding 'obscene performances' on March 31, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A bill that left the Senate with near-universal support picked up a “barnacle in committee,” as one House Democrat put it last week, leaving the House on a 71-20 vote Monday.
The House additions widen the scope of the underlying bill beyond an effort to replace a criminal term throughout Indiana code to include a focus on obscene performances. 
As originally written, Senate Bill 326 would have replaced “child pornography” with “child sex abuse material,” acknowledging that children are being sexually abused in such images. But a House committee added a new provision: barring government entities from using public money to fund, organize or host “obscene performances.” 
‘Obscene performance’ ban added to child abuse bill, official misconduct expungements weighed

A House floor amendment, which moved largely along party lines, also added a method of enforcement by allowing people to sue Indiana entities for alleged incidents. 
“Language shapes the way we understand and confront these issues and the term child pornography is not only inaccurate, it minimizes the horror of the crimes committed. Pornography implies a level of consent and children cannot consent,” said House sponsor Rep. Andrew Ireland. “… we’re taking an important step to save our Hoosier children.” 
The Indianapolis Republican said the language regarding obscene performances would ensure “that public funds are never used to support the exploitation of children.”
Defining something as obscene has to meet a high bar, known as the “Miller Test.” That work must be based on an average person’s reaction and consider the entire work, not just an isolated portion. 
But critics maintained that such performances aren’t happening, noting there are already penalties regardless of someone’s government affiliation. 
“More and more this General Assembly is taking itself to an alternate reality where it legislates against problems that don’t exist,” said Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington. “We create a strawman and then we knock it down and ‘Look at us! We really solved that problem!’
“The problem never existed. But it appeals to somebody out there, so we do it now.” 
 Further discussion

Ireland didn’t cite specific instances of obscene performances using taxpayer dollars on Monday nor in his testimony last week when he introduced the penalty language. 
It also doesn’t limit such legal action to only Indiana residents, meaning that, according to Pierce, “any person in the universe can sue your local government when they’re offended by somebody and try to make an argument that it’s obscene.”
Pierce was one of the committee members to advance the bill, noting the high bar to meet the state’s obscenity standard, which he dubbed a “barnacle” on the House floor last week. In addition to the Miller test, a litigant would generally need to prove they have been harmed by obscene performances — a barrier meant to tamp down on frivolous lawsuits. 
  Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, speaks on a bill on March 31, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
But Pierce said the language eviscerates that and says “we don’t care if they’re harmed or not. We don’t care if they have a direct injury.”
Municipalities may still need to spend their dollars defending themselves from such accusations, which could include plays, poetry and drag shows. 
“Keep in mind, anybody involved in this supposed obscene performance that local government might be funding can already be arrested and imprisoned under our current (law),” Pierce continued. “I would think the fear of going to prison would keep local officials from going into the smut-peddling business.”
Ireland agreed with Pierce that such obscene performances “have never occurred and I hope never occur … in part, thanks to this bill.”
“This is nothing new under the sun,” concluded Ireland. 
The final vote tally split both parties, though only Ireland and Pierce spoke on the measure. It now goes to the Senate, which must vote to accept or reject the House amendments before the bill can advance.

(Courtesy image)OKLAHOMA CITY — The construction of a new inpatient mental health hospital is $124 million over budget, and House budget leaders do not want taxpayers to pick up the tab. 
The Donahue Behavioral Health Campus, located in Oklahoma City, was budgeted for $147 million and broke ground in March 2024. It would serve adults and adolescents with 330 beds when completed, an increase in capacity by 100 beds from the Griffin Memorial Hospital, in Norman, it is intended to replace. 
But in its budget request to the Legislature for the 2026 fiscal year, the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services asked for another $124 million to cover overrun costs. The House recommended not fulfilling this request. 
Rep. Trey Caldwell, R-Faxon, chair of the House Appropriations and Budget Committee, said House leaders believe the Donahue project is too costly and a cheaper alternative must be found. 
“The House position is we want to do something transformational when it comes to shortening that waitlist, especially when it comes to mental health issues,” he said. “The Donahue build-out, as it stands right now, not only has come in over budget, but also had hiccups along the lines of, they forgot to put bathrooms in. … There’s a facility out there that I think we can purchase for about 15% of what it would cost to build the Donahue, and we want to get that done.”
He said there’s no “firm commitment” from the governor, the Senate or the Mental Health Department on this recommendation, but the House is working to see this plan come to fruition. 
In December, Oklahoma Watch reported the budget shortfall and that the opening of the hospital could potentially be pushed to 2028, rather than the scheduled 2026 date, due to unexpected costs, changes in the layout and number of bathrooms, and inflation. 
Kelsey Davis, a spokesperson for the Mental Health Department, said there are no updates from the agency on their next steps or the reason for the cost overrun. 
The agency is actively working through what the future of the project will look like if the Legislature opts not to provide the extra funding, she said. 
Lawmakers committed $87 million in pandemic relief funds to the project. Oklahoma City leaders and county commissioners also contributed funding, with additional dollars expected to come from the sale of the Griffin Memorial Hospital land.

 Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne (Courtesy Indiana Senate Republicans)
But an amendment approved Monday by the House Judiciary Committee seeks to compromise by “streamlining the process” for courts to quickly seal some records — meaning renters would not have to file anything on their own.
That includes eviction cases in which a judge sides with a tenant, or when a judgment against the tenant is later reversed.
A state law passed in 2022 already opened the door for some eviction matters to be sealed, but it’s currently up to tenants to file for expungement.
Statehouse testimony on the latest bill draft was positive. The measure passed 10-1 — only Rep. J.D. Prescott, R-Union City, voted in opposition — and now heads to the full House.
“The idea is, let’s get those (evictions) expunged, because, as you know, that’s like a black mark, and it makes it difficult for (tenants) to find housing,” said bill author Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne. “The idea is now, with this amended bill, (tenants) are going to have skin in the game. If they really want that to be expunged, they’re going to have to go in and do that. But so many of these eviction proceedings have been resolved, and both sides on the claim are happy, and there was just no way for them to clear the name, and I think this is a good start.”
Changes to the bill
When first introduced, Brown’s bill would have required courts to automatically seal an eviction from a tenant’s record, as long as they have settled their debt, or the court ruled in their favor. Cases would qualify, too, if the eviction was dismissed by, overturned or vacated on appeal.
The original bill also sought to automatically seal all eviction cases after seven years.
The seven-year seal was removed by a Senate committee, however. Later, in the full chamber, a separate amendment further watered down the automatic sealing — shifting the burden back to renters to file expungement paperwork with their local court, which is how the process currently works.
Amendment author Sen. Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis, said he didn’t want to overburden the courts and additionally wants tenants to be held accountable for evictions.
Monday’s House committee amendment specifies that a court, “on its own motion,” can expunge eviction records as long as one of the following applies to the case:

the eviction action is dismissed by the court
a judgment in favor of the tenant is entered by the court
a judgment is entered by the court against the tenant, and the judgment is subsequently overturned or vacated on appeal

While not automatic, renters would further be able to seek expungement seven years after the conclusion of a case in which there was no money owed to the landlord.
There’s no waiting period, though, for tenants who have “satisfied” — paid back — a money judgment related to the eviction.
 Rep. Chris Jeter, R-Fishers (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Committee chairman Rep. Chris Jeter, R-Fishers, said courts typically don’t take action in a case until “somebody files a motion asking them to do something.” 
“I think there was a little concern about tasking the courts with sort of keeping track of where these evictions are at,” Jeter said. Evictions filed before 2021, for example, do not have case numbers to distinguish them from other small claims cases.
“I think one of the landing grounds we kind of came on is if it’s an order at the time when the judge (decides in favor of) the tenant, then they can seal (the eviction record) at that exact same time,” he continued. “But if it’s after, I think the thought is that we at least have the tenant take the proactive step of filing at least a one-page motion, or something, so the court can act.”
She emphasized that tenant-landlord bill are typically “difficult” and tough to pass out of legislative committees.
“The idea is there are good landlords, and there are good tenants. And frankly, when there is an eviction proceeding — whether it’s a judgment, or a question of security deposits or damages in the resolve — it’s not really the landlord’s responsibility anymore. Their claim has been resolved, and they’re fine. I don’t think they necessarily want that tenant to have that black mark on them … but that’s the case right now,” Brown said.
“This will make it seamless for the tenant,” she added. “They’re already in court — it will make it automatic. … And there’s no reason, if the landlord has not pursued the judgment in seven years, why that, on the motion of the tenant, can’t also get expunged.”
Housing advocates supportive
Housing advocates were supportive of the amended bill and maintained that eviction sealing is “very important” for tenants because landlords won’t be able to see past eviction cases when screening potential tenants. 
“Community stakeholders who are trying to create a new supply of housing and connect it with Hoosiers too often find that many Hoosiers don’t qualify for housing because they have that ‘Scarlet E’ of an eviction filing on their record,” said Andrew Bradley, with Prosperity Indiana. He pointed to data showing that 71,000 evictions were filed in the state over the last year.
“That’s a significant number of Hoosiers who now can qualify for safe, decent, affordable housing,” he said.

– Andrew Bradley, with Prosperity Indiana


Brown crafted the legislation with input from students at the University of Notre Dame’s Eviction Clinic, which helps Hoosiers clear an eviction off their record for free.
David Pruitt, director of the university’s Clinical Law Center, said a majority of the eviction clinic’s cases stem from just “one incident” in a renter’s life. 
“There’s a medical bill, or a loss of a job, or something comes up, and the margins are so thin for people that they get knocked off track, and it’s hard for them to come up,” Pruitt said. “There are going to be some people that, honestly, are over their skis and they just found a place that’s just too expensive — and those are tough cases. And then you’ve got mixes of landlords being problematic, tenants being problematic. … But I would say that for significantly more than half of the individuals, it’s a razor’s edge.”
Indiana Legal Services, the largest provider of free civil legal aid to low-income Hoosiers, additionally worked on more than 1,600 eviction sealing cases last year.
“That’s a testament for the need for eviction sealing and the assistance that folks currently need to kind of get through the system,” said Jennifer Terry, an attorney with the nonprofit law firm. “We do see this bill as a good next step in streamlining some of those processes.”

Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner.Madison School Board member Ali Muldrow said people who work in education know that the “worst day” is when children get hurt in school. 
“When the Abundant Life shooting happened, which was at a private Christian School very close to my home, it was just a really horrible day, and I think I realized it’s too late to talk about this,” Muldrow said. “It’s been too late and we can’t keep letting it be too late.”
A teacher and student were killed and six others were injured by a 15-year-old who brought a gun to Abundant Life Christian School, a private school in Madison, in December 2024. It is the deadliest school shooting on record in Wisconsin.
The shooting made national headlines, but it is just one example of children harmed by gun violence. According to the K-12 School Shooting Database, there were 332 school shootings in 2024. A 2024 report by Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions found firearms continue to be a leading cause of death for children and teens, and those who are Black are disproportionately the victims
Muldrow, who is running unopposed for another term on the Board this spring, said measures taken to try to prevent shooting deaths at school have not been enough. 
“All of the things that we’ve done to our students haven’t resolved this issue — whether it’s practicing and having drills or whether it’s making our schools harder places to get into,” Muldrow said. “None of that changes the reality that a 15-year-old went into their school, two guns, and killed multiple people, including themselves.”
Students from Madison Metropolitan School District walked out of class in December and marched to the state Capitol to demand something be done about gun violence. 
“They asked for two things,” Muldrow said. “They asked for laws related to gun storage and gun safety, and they asked for more mental health support within their education.”  
Muldrow said that adults should “honor” the demands of the students and build bridges across political divides to get the work done. She said having conversations is an important starting point. 
In the aftermath of the Madison school shooting, Muldrow said she wanted to organize an event to inspire people in the community to feel capable of making change. She turned to a group that tried to find solutions after a school shooting took place about two years ago and more than 620 miles away.
Tennesseans were left reeling in 2023 after a shooter killed three 9-year-olds and three adults at the private Christian Covenant elementary school. A nonprofit organization called Builders (formerly known as Starts With Us) that seeks to ease political polarization brought together a group of 11 Tennessee residents with a range of opinions on the issue of guns to discuss and come up with some solutions. 
Muldrow was part of a similar group in Wisconsin in 2024 that explored the debate on abortion. She saw a documentary about the Tennessee group and thought its approach could be a way for the community affected by the Abundant Life shooting to come together and find a way forward. 
Muldrow said that the point of the event she helped organize Sunday was not necessarily to “mirror or mimic what happened in Tennessee, but to learn from that collaborative attitude towards solutions.” 
More than 100 people attended the event at the Overture Center for the Arts in Madison, which included a screening of the documentary about the Tennesseeans’ journey and a panel discussion with two of the participants and a handful of Wisconsinites.

Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll noted during the panel that potential solutions to gun violence would look different for Wisconsin, given the difference in state laws and the general beliefs of residents in each state. A key point of disagreement among participants in the documentary centered on concealed carry permits and whether they should be mandated. Tennessee has allowed for permitless carry of handguns since 2021.
Wisconsin already requires a permit for concealed carry, however, and it’s mostly not a partisan debate, Franklin said. According to the most recent polling, about 65% of Wisconsinites support concealed carry, but only under certain circumstances. 
“We do have a concealed carry law that requires a permit. When the Legislature has considered concealed carry without a permit, we found only about 20% support for that, about 80% opposition,” Franklin said. “There is a distinction that the public makes… public opinion is quite opposed to that form of concealed carry, but solidly in favor of [concealed carry] with a permit.”
Franklin said he thought proposals that originate from and garner support among Second Amendment supporters should be celebrated. He noted that there is a Republican bill that’s been introduced in Wisconsin that would create a tax exemption for gun safes. 
“That’s a small, incremental matter of, what, 5 ½% on the cost of the safe, but on the other hand, when you think of children’s access to guns in the home, access to those guns by burglars or other circumstances,” it could be a significant step, Franklin said. 
Franklin said the idea that “if you don’t get everything you’ve got nothing” is a huge barrier to progress. 
“I would just stress that incremental improvements are still improvements,” Franklin said.
Steve D’Orazio, founder and president of the Oregon, Wis., gun shop and range Max Creek Outdoors said during the panel that his business works hard to educate people who acquire guns. He said he has been working with a doctor at the UW Health System to educate doctors on guns and have them talk with their patients about gun safety and awareness, including keeping guns locked away. 
“My goal is the safety of our children,” D’Orazio said. 
The solution to school shootings he emphasized the most was implementing metal detectors in all schools. 
“Every one of us here today walked through the front door of this building and we walked through a metal detector, but our schools don’t have metal detectors,” D’Orazio said. “I sell guns. That’s our business. There’s so much education that we do at our shop to make sure that the gun owner doesn’t get hurt and that they use it correctly…, but every school district should have a metal detector. That’s how you’re going to stop this stuff.” 
The documentary shows the Tennessee group taking and presenting their recommendations at the Tennessee State Capitol. Those recommendations included temporary removal of firearms based on risk of violence, developing tools to support responsible gun ownership, expanding the role of school resource officers, investing in community to reduce trauma and developing gun literacy resources for schools, communities and media. 
Tennessee leaders did pass a bill in 2024 requiring education in schools about guns, a policy similar to the recommendation of the group. Though the end result was not exactly as participants imagined it. 
Adam Luke, a Tennessee marriage and family counselor and conservative, spoke to how the “rush to be right” by lawmakers on the issue may diminish the effectiveness of the legislation.  
“People will not be able to opt out [of the curriculum]. Now, I would like to turn to conservative America and say, ‘If you did not have the ability to opt your child out of sex education would that bother you?’” Luke asked. “This is what happens when you have super majorities.” 
Luke said that the Tennessee Department of Education also doesn’t have the curriculum for teachers and just recently closed the public response period. He said lawmakers were so quick to want to get something done that they’ve created a policy that may not be effective.
“Let’s say that we did something, but guess what? We forgot to actually give you the resources to be successful with it,” Luke said. 
Political polarization was on display following the Madison school shooting. Muldrow said she has been “saddened” by the divide.
“It’s really hard to see our Legislature be so divided and in such a contentious relationship with our governor, and it’s a shame because all of these people represent us and there is an expectation that they work together,” Muldrow said.

Since the shooting, Gov. Tony Evers has launched the Office of Violence Prevention and has proposed adopting further gun safety policies including stricter background checks and red flag laws. Republican lawmakers were quick to criticize Evers’ proposals and have been developing their own proposals for addressing school shootings, including financial support for the Office of School Safety and allowing teachers to be armed. 
The Madison Common Council and the Dane County Board of Supervisors both passed resolutions urging the Legislature to take action and implement common-sense gun measures. 
Steven Olikara, a former candidate for Wisconsin Senate and founder of the nonpartisan organization the Future Caucus, said the actions of local leaders and Evers are a step forward, but the state needs to take bigger steps. 
“Those bigger steps will come from bringing Democrats and Republicans together in a real way and building trust,” Olikara said. “And I think conversations like this can help create that kind of momentum. [When people are at] each other’s throats, the kind of progress you make is very small and very incremental. When you have conversations like the one today, you can reach transformative change, and that’s really what we need.”
Tennessee educator Alyssa Pearman, who lost one of her students to gun violence, said the key is to keep showing up to have the conversations.
“You are going to be told no, and you are going to have people who have no interest in making a change and being a builder, but you keep showing up,” Pearman said. “You find people who want to do something, who want a better tomorrow, and you have conversations like these… This is the type of conversation that needs to be had, whether it’s in Wisconsin, whether it’s in Tennessee and whatever state where we have this crisis.”

These states want to make oil companies pay.,Alex Brown,,,,,https://michiganadvance.com/2025/04/01/climate-disasters-are-on-the-rise-these-states-want-to-make-oil-companies-pay/,"For many California residents, the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year were the latest and most searing example of the devastating effects of climate change. Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion. “We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat.

(Mario Tama/Getty Images)For many California residents, the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year were the latest and most searing example of the devastating effects of climate change. Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion.
“We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat. “It’s the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It’s not sustainable, it’s not right and it’s not ethical.”
Addis and Democratic lawmakers in nearly a dozen other states want to force the world’s largest fossil fuel companies to help pay for the recovery costs of climate-related disasters. Last year, Vermont became the first state to pass a “climate Superfund” law, followed soon after by New York.
This session, 10 states have seen similar proposals, several of which have advanced in key committees. Advocates point to legislation in Maryland that has drawn support in both chambers, as well as to strong grassroots support in California after the Los Angeles wildfires.
Lawmakers say the rapidly increasing cost of climate disasters — from wildfires to floods to sea level rise — is more than state budgets can bear.
“Climate Superfund is the ‘it girl’ policy of the [2025] session,” said Ava Gallo, climate and energy program manager with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “There’s a lot of popularity in the idea of holding polluters responsible.”
The momentum for these “polluter pays” bills is tied to the maturation of attribution science. That new field of research can help calculate fossil fuel companies’ contributions to historic emissions totals, as well as the role climate change played in causing or worsening natural disasters.
Vermont’s law was the first attempt to use that science to charge emitters for their role in causing devastating floods and other catastrophes.












We've had disaster after disaster after disaster. It's the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It's not sustainable, it's not right and it’s not ethical.


– California Democratic Assemblymember Dawn Addis




Fossil fuel companies and their allies have fought back hard. Late last year, the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging Vermont’s measure. The groups argue that emissions are governed by the federal Clean Air Act, precluding states from charging companies over global pollution.
Neither group responded to a Stateline interview request. The Independent Petroleum Association of America also declined an interview request.
A separate lawsuit, led by 22 Republican attorneys general, is challenging the New York law. And a conservative group has targeted Rachel Rothschild, an assistant professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, who helped draft the legal justification for climate Superfund policy. The group, Government Accountability and Oversight, has sought to subject Rothschild to a deposition, The New York Times reported, a move that some experts view as an intimidation tactic.
Meanwhile, oil and gas executives asked President Donald Trump during a White House meeting this month to direct the Justice Department to join the legal fight against climate Superfund laws, The Wall Street Journal reported. Industry leaders are also pushing Congress to shield them from more than 30 lawsuits brought by state and local governments that aim to make them pay for some of the results of climate change.
While experts expect a bruising legal battle over climate Superfund policies, the threat of lawsuits hasn’t deterred more lawmakers from backing the concept.
“States were a little bit wary; they wondered, ‘Is this some new radical plan?’” said Cassidy DiPaola, communications director with the Make Polluters Pay campaign, a coalition of groups backing such bills. “Then one of the littlest states passed it and this powerhouse, New York, passed it. That really set the ball rolling.”
Fossil fuel companies have cast doubt on attribution science. They also note that their production of oil and other products was done legally under U.S. and international regulations.
“Manufacturers will see this as a shakedown of any industry you don’t like at some point in the future, even though in the past they were licensed and operated under government regulation,” Brett Vassey, president and CEO of the Virginia Manufacturers Association, said during legislative testimony about a climate Superfund proposal in that state. “It will have a chilling effect on Virginia being able to grow its economy.”
Proponents of Superfund legislation point to legal settlements with large tobacco companies in the 1990s. Although those companies also sold their products legally, they were held responsible because they knew about the harmful effects of those products and deceived the public. Most climate Superfund proposals target companies for their emissions over the past 30 or so years, after leading experts had documented the dangers of greenhouse gases.
“There’s good documentation of how well the fossil fuel industry knew the probable long-term impacts of their product,” said Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat. “Should an industry that made such historic profits over a period of time and made so many representations that we had no problem not bear any of the costs?”
Golden and other lawmakers say it’s becoming impossible for taxpayers to cover the costs of recovery from wildfires and other catastrophes. In Rhode Island, sea level rise is causing massive damage for coastal communities, said Democratic state Rep. Jennifer Boylan, who has sponsored a climate Superfund bill to help the state adapt.
Some advocates also note that Trump’s return to the White House has cut off the possibility of federal climate relief.
“All the states are affected by the disappearance of this federal funding,” said Gallo, of the state lawmakers group. “States everywhere are going to be looking at some way to fill the gap.”
This session, climate Superfund bills have been introduced in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Virginia.
While the bills are structured differently, they all seek to target the largest polluters — often covering companies that produced 1 billion metric tons of emissions over the last 30 or so years. Lawmakers say that applies to roughly 100 companies.
The measures also take different approaches to assigning damages. Some direct state agencies to conduct complex studies to determine the costs of climate-caused disasters over a certain period, the approach pioneered by Vermont. Others set a fixed number that represents a conservative baseline for those damages. New York’s law set that figure at $75 billion over a 25-year period.
Many of the bills also require that significant amounts of the funding be directed to the communities hit hardest by pollution.
Advocates are particularly optimistic about the measures in California and Maryland.
Lawmakers in Maryland modified their bills to commission a study about the financial impacts of climate change. Those measures passed both the House and Senate, and legislators are working to reconcile the versions from each chamber. Figures produced by the study would be the backbone of a climate Superfund policy in a future session.
“From a legislative perspective, it’s a shot in the dark as to what the costs are,” said Democratic Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo, who sponsored one of the bills. “This will give us the factual data needed to make a more well-educated decision on policy.”
In New Jersey, an Assembly committee advanced a climate Superfund bill this month. State Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee and who sponsored the bill, said it will help to rebuild and fortify water treatment plants, schools and firehouses. He noted that Trump has called for the dismantling of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“The end of the world is coming; it’s kind of hard to ignore,” Smith said. “FEMA has been the backstop to help communities recover from disasters. If the handwriting isn’t on the wall to all the states that they’ve got to deal with this, shame on them.”
Lawmakers in many states have heard from mayors and other local government leaders that more climate recovery funding is essential.
“Municipal officials are getting behind [climate Superfund policies],” said Massachusetts state Sen. Jamie Eldridge, a Democrat who has sponsored similar legislation. “They’re facing the costs of flooding, of droughts, of heat waves, and really asking for relief.”

He was [&#8230;]","A montage created by the Montana Historical Society of people arrested and convicted of seditious speech during the World War I era. This photo is by no means exhaustive. Seventy-two Montanans were charged, tried and convicted for running afoul of the Montana Sedition Act. Early on the morning of April 13, 1918, a group of Billings residents surrounded the house of Herman Bausch, which happens to be right across the street from where I live now. Bausch was a German immigrant who had moved to Billings a few years earlier and started farming just outside of town. He was highly respected in Billings for being a bit of an innovator, one of the first locals to plant an orchard. 
But that morning, he was confronted by a mob because he had been included on a list of Billings residents that had not purchased Liberty bonds to help support America’s entry into World War I. Bausch had stated: “I am opposed to war…all war that is aggressive and oppressive. But if Wall Street plutocrats insist on further bloodshed, let them finance it. Voluntarily, I will not contribute financially to this world calamity.”
The mob pressed Bausch to change his mind and buy some Liberty bonds, and when he refused, they threatened to string him up in one of the apple trees in his yard. But instead they dragged him off to the local Elks Club, where a group of more than 50 people had gathered. This crowd spent several hours grilling Bausch, trying again to convince him to buy bonds, but he would not budge. So he was charged under the Montana Sedition Act, and sentenced to four years in prison. 
Teddy Roosevelt once said that patriotism means standing with one’s country, not standing with the president. But America has a checkered past when it comes to using patriotism as a cudgel to keep people from expressing themselves, and one of the most egregious examples of that started right here in Montana. 
When war broke out in Europe in 1914, Americans were almost universally opposed to becoming involved in the conflict. The overall sentiment was that the conflict was none of our business, but there was also a general feeling that it wouldn’t last long. But as the war dragged on, the allies—which included Great Britain, France, Russia, and China—pressed President Woodrow Wilson to change his mind. The longer it lasted, the more concerned they were about having the resources necessary to fight off the Axis, which consisted of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. 
Two major events played a huge role in swaying public sentiment. First, German U-boats sank the Lusitania, a British ocean liner, in 1915. The incident killed 1198 people, and 128 of them were American. 
The second event was the revelation in January 1917 that German Foreign Minister Arthur Zimmerman had carried out a secret diplomatic correspondence with the German Ambassador to Mexico, proposing that if Mexico joined forces with the Germans, Germany would help them regain control of Texas, Arizona and New Mexico. 
Although Wilson won reelection in 1916 on a platform of keeping Americans out of the war, it was just a few months after his inauguration that he declared war on Germany, and it was as if a switch had been flipped. A country that had been so firmly neutral suddenly developed a rabid form of nationalism.
Wilson established the Committee on Public Information, which distributed books and pamphlets, sent out speakers, and even made films, spreading strong opinions about German immigrants, and calling on everyone to buy Liberty bonds to support the war effort. In Montana, Gov. Sam Stewart got so caught up in this nationalist fervor that he called a special session of the Legislature just a few weeks after Wilson declared war, and convinced them to pass The Montana Sedition Act, which was an expansion of a previous bill called the Espionage Act. The Espionage Act was designed to pressure anyone who published works that undermined the war effort, but the Sedition Act took that sentiment one step further, encouraging local law enforcement to seek out people who simply spoke out against the war, or failed to show their support. During the next two years, 78 Montanans were convicted under the Sedition Act, most of whom were sentenced to 20 years. These people were not activists or troublemakers. They were farmers and salesman, and even housewives. 
One man, rancher Faye Rumsey, was sentenced to 20  years after a mob confronted him for not buying Liberty bonds, insisting that he kiss the American flag to show his loyalty. Another was convicted after saying that he wished the Kaiser would come over and straighten things out in his own county. 
Once the war ended, people came to their senses, and the Montana Sedition Act was repealed in 1921. The people serving sentences were released. But not before Herman Bausch lost his 2-year-old son and wasn’t allowed to travel from Deer Lodge to Billings for the funeral. And not before Faye Rumsey’s wife lost their ranch and had to give up all 12 of their children to the state. Many of these siblings never saw each other again. 
In 2006, Gov. Brian Schweitzer issued a pardon to everyone who had been convicted under the Sedition Act, and it was at that ceremony that several of Faye Rumsey’s grandchildren met for the first time. 
Herman Bausch was able to return to the house across the street from where I live and continue to farm, having more children. But extreme nationalism left its mark on his life, as it did on many innocent Montanans. As Bausch said when he was arrested, ‘If what I did was a crime, then there are thousands of other people in this country who are just as guilty as I am.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Montanans-Sedition-History.jpeg,,,2025-04-01 07:00:39.924254

The proposed legislation (HB910/SB861) by Sen. John Stevens of Huntingdon and Rep. Johnny Garrett of Goodlettsville, both Republicans, would transfer the nonpartisan commission’s responsibilities to the Office of the Attorney General in a newly-created Civil Rights Enforcement Division.
Democrats on the panel questioned the need to dismantle the 60-year-old, independent commission responsible for enforcing civil rights laws in employment, housing and public accommodations – including investigations into claims of discrimination made against the state of Tennessee — and shift its responsibilities to Jonathan Skrmetti, who, as attorney general, has aggressively used the power of his office to champion conservative causes.
  Rep. Johnny Garrett (Photo: John Partipilo)
“I do have a concern with this attorney general making political decisions rather than legal decisions and — to the extent that threatens the civil rights of the citizens of Tennessee — I think we need to take a very very careful look at that,” said Rep. John Ray Clemmons, a Nashville Democrat.
Garrett said the Human Rights Commission was currently doing a “fine job” but giving the power of civil rights enforcement to the attorney general may serve as a greater deterrent to those accused of discrimination.
“I think if someone receives a letter or an action that the attorney general is investigating their actions, I think that’s going to perk up some people,” he said.
The proposed legislation alters the scope of discrimination claims that may be pursued against educational institutions.
The bill creates a pathway for those denied admission to schools on the basis of “race, color or national origin” — or participation in clubs or activities — to file complaints with the Attorney General, a provision widely understood to give white students a basis to file claims against educational institutions that have diversity, equity and inclusion policies.
But in response to a question from Rep. G.A. Hardaway about whether the genesis of the proposed law is “somehow related to reverse discrimination,” Garrett responded that he “did not know how to respond” to the question.
The bill also excludes disability and religion from the list of discriminatory activities in educational institutions that the attorney general would be required to investigate. Garrett noted that there remain federal avenues for pursuing those claims.
Bill to abolish discrimination watchdog agency advances in Tennessee Legislature

The bill would eliminate the Human Rights Commission by July 1, transferring 30 of its employees to the offices of the attorney general, who would then have the option to utilize employees at his discretion.
About 1,000 pending discrimination complaints before the commission would be dismissed, forcing the individuals who brought them – and the employers and institutions who have spent time and money defending themselves — to start anew, Muriel Malone Nolen, the commission’s executive director testified last week.
Individuals who have filed complaints would have the option of restarting their complaint within 90 days of the law taking effect, but Nolen noted that some of those actions may then fall out of a 180-day statute of limitations and no longer be viable.

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)About a hundred people gathered in Springdale Monday in support of immigrant workers, a group that rallygoers said have been the target of recent policies at the state and federal levels. 
The event was organized by Venceremos, a worker-based organization with a mission to ensure the human rights of poultry workers. The organization, whose name is Spanish for “we will overcome,” is led by executive director Magaly Licolli, who told the Advocate Friday that immigrants who were honored as essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic are now being demonized. 
“Five years ago these workers were called essential workers, heroes, that without their jobs we wouldn’t have food on the table, and now they are being attacked and being called criminals,” Licolli said. 
President Donald Trump promised mass deportations on the campaign trail, and has followed through by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1789, supporting high-profile raids and revoking an extension of Temporary Protected Status for some immigrants, among other things. 
Trump’s policies have left immigrants living in fear as they’re being treated as “second-class citizens or no citizens at all,” Licolli said. 
While the national rhetoric started by targeting immigrants who were criminals, Licolli said the discussion has devolved into labeling all immigrants as criminals regardless of their immigration status. 
“We are seeing really that they are deporting anyone just because they are brown and being detained because they look brown until they prove they have the paperwork to stay in this country,” she said. “It is not fair that they are treating everybody as equal as criminals and without recognizing that criminals, murderers, all of these criminals can be [anyone] — it doesn’t matter the race.”

Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders tied Arkansas immigration policy to Trump when she announced legislation two weeks ago to impose harsher penalties on undocumented migrants who commit crimes in the state. 
“The Defense Against Criminal Illegals Act makes it clear: Arkansas will not tolerate violent, criminal illegals and will do our part to help the Trump administration keep our citizens safe,” Sanders said during a March 17 press conference. 
The Senate Judiciary Committee approved Senate Bill 426 Monday morning, but an amendment in the afternoon means the bill will need to be reheard by the committee.
Licolli told reporters Monday that when Sanders says it’s her job to protect citizens, she’s only referring to the white community. 
“We are also citizens, we are also humans,” Licolli said. “And she’s been enjoying the chicken that these immigrants are producing, so I wonder what she’s going to do with her chicken if they are targeting the immigrants. She enjoys the benefits from the labor of these immigrants, so it’s a hypocrisy and it’s very racist that she is condemning all of these people for feeding her family.”
Springdale is home to Tyson Foods, one the world’s largest food companies, and Licolli said poultry companies, like Tyson, should speak out for immigrants because they benefit from their labor. In addition to calling for better working conditions and for immigrants’ humanity to be respected, Licolli said they also deserve a path to citizenship for all they’ve done to support the economy. 
Protestors urge Arkansas’ Tyson to commit to child labor, worker safety protections

Vladimir Rivera Lopez, District 4 Justice of the Peace for the Washington County Quorum Court, said he became really interested in workers rights after reading Life and Death of the American Worker, a book by Alice Driver that shares the challenges faced by immigrant workers at Tyson.
Rivera Lopez, a Springdale Democrat that won his first-ever election by 10 votes in November, said that he will attend “any event that affirms the dignity of someone else in my community.”
“It’s very easy to exploit people who can’t vote, who don’t have that opportunity to represent themselves come November, but that doesn’t mean that these people don’t exist,” he said.
Rivera Lopez joined dozens of Northwest Arkansas residents at Monday’s rally, including Angela Hickman of Bella Vista, who decided to spend her day off marching to city hall dressed as Lady Liberty alongside her boyfriend and dog. 
Hickman said she’s taking every opportunity “to show support and fight back” because there’s a lot wrong with what’s happening in the country. 
“Letting our people that represent us know that we are not okay with what’s going on,” she said. “And Trump and [Elon] Musk need to not be where they are. They’re doing a lot of damage, and I can’t just sit idly by.”
Even when policies don’t directly affect her, Hickman, who teared up during her explanation, said that one day “it could be me.”
“I have children, they need a future, and I have to make that happen for them,” she said. “My grandmother did it, my mom did it, my aunt, it’s in the family all the way back to the Civil Rights Movement and everything in between. My grandmother can’t be here to do it, she is no longer with us, so I’m doing it for her.”

As a part of the collaboration, St. Luke’s emergency departments in Boise, Meridian, Mountain Home and McCall have more than 20 Naloxone distribution containers, or “barney boxes,” stocked with free overdose prevention supplies in their lobby entrance areas. 
The boxes contain free naloxone kits and are paid for with opioid settlement funds. The boxes can help save lives. Naloxone (Narcan) is a safe, effective, over-the-counter medication that reverses the effects of an opioid overdose. 
“Naloxone is designed to be easy for anyone to administer, even without medical training,” Courtney Boyce, the health district’s substance use and behavioral health program manager, said in a press release. “The nasal spray is very straightforward to use. Instructions are included on the naloxone box.”
Training is also available upon request, Boyce said. 
Ten boxes were placed in 2024, another 10 this year. Central District Health is aiming for 10 more in 2026, according to the press release. Participating agencies that house the boxes may choose to stock xylazine testing strips, fentanyl testing strips, rescue breath shields and other free items. 
Those interested in ordering a naloxone distribution box or interested in exploring other overdose prevention and rescue supplies provided by the health district can visit the district’s storefront. Supplies come with free shipping for Ada, Boise, Elmore, or Valley counties. Barney Box locations can be found here.

(Photo: Getty Images)Tennessee lawmakers are headed for a showdown over hemp legislation that, under a Senate version, could heavily restrict products containing intoxicating derivatives.
Both measures are to be considered Tuesday in House and Senate finance committees and could impact a regulated industry that nets the state tens of millions in revenue from an estimated $280 million to $560 million in yearly sales.
The biggest difference in the bills lies with THCA, a derivative that delivers a high similar to marijuana once it is heated or burned. The House version would allow THCA to continue to be sold in some stores while the Senate bill would restrict it.
Clint Palmer, a hemp industry attorney, said Tennessee could become the first state in the nation to regulate the THCA market, a move generally supported by the industry because it would enable sales to continue. 
Both versions of the bill would move the policing of hemp-derived products under the Alcoholic Beverage Commission from the Department of Agriculture and enact a wholesale tax of one cent per milligram on hemp products.
Originally, both versions would have prohibited THCA, but an amendment placed on the House bill was designed to keep hemp farmers from losing their businesses. 
Hemp industry fears slate of restrictive bills could gut industry

House Majority Leader William Lamberth, sponsor of the House version, confirmed Monday the biggest sticking point between the two versions is the level of delta-9 THC that would be allowed in products.
Hemp is distinguished from marijuana based on the concentration of a compound called delta-9 THC. Cannabis with less than 0.3% delta-9 THC is defined as legal hemp in Tennessee as well as federally. Cannabis with greater concentrations is classified as marijuana and is illegal to grow, sell or possess in the state.
Sen. Richard Briggs, sponsor of the Senate version, amended the bill late last week, to ensure the measure wouldn’t hurt the state financially. It’s expected to maintain a surplus of up to $14 million from fees and taxes on growers, wholesalers and sellers, he said.
Briggs, a Knoxville Republican, said the bill would ban marijuana but not hemp. He bases his view on a 2024 letter from the U.S. Department of Justice stating the Controlled Substances Act classifies THCA as “controlled.” Yet the act excludes hemp from the definition of marijuana as long as it has a THC concentration of no more than 0.3%.
“We’re not interested in recreational marijuana,” Briggs said.
If both measures move through their respective chambers unchanged, the bills could be resolved with a conference committee to work out differences as the legislature adjourns for the year.
The matter remains tied up in litigation after the state required new testing of hemp products last year for delta-9 THC. The Tennessee Growers Coalition and the Tennessee Healthy Alternatives Associations said rules set to take effect in late December 2024 amounted to state “overreach” that would lead to a ban on products.
Dispute also centers on a move by the liquor store industry to take over most of THC drink sales from convenience and grocery stores.
Those stores are trying to stay in business as the law allows, said Rob Ikard of the Tennessee Grocers and Convenience Store Association.
“Grocery stores and convenience stores who are already in this business under the current law do a really good job of age enforcement and regulation,” Ikard said.
Briggs said Monday he believes too many products on store shelves contain higher THC levels than the law allows. He believes the Alcoholic Beverage Commission should get involved in regulating the industry, and he added that the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation could play a role in enforcement.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Bishops from the Catholic dioceses of Bismarck and Fargo signed a joint letter Sunday urging parishioners across the state to contact their legislators and advocate for Education Savings Accounts.
Senate Bill 2400 and House Bill 1540 both passed their respective chambers during the first half of the legislative session and would allocate state tax dollars to student Education Savings Accounts that could be spent on a variety of services, including paying tuition for private schools.
The letter, signed by Bishop David Kagan of Bismarck and Bishop John Folda of Fargo, states the church teaches that parents are the primary educators for their children and they should have the freedom and resources to choose the best educational setting for their kids.
“They do not divert money from public schools, do not hurt rural schools and would be a great help to many families across the state of North Dakota,” the letter stated.
Bills look to expand North Dakota student opportunities through savings accounts

The letter was read from the pulpit at Catholic churches across the state, said David Tamisiea, executive director of the North Dakota Catholic Conference. 
“It should’ve been read by everybody,” Tamisiea said.
He said it is the job of bishops as teachers of the faith to educate the faithful.
“People of faith have a voice to be heard in the public sphere,” Tamisiea said. “It’s OK for our faith leaders to encourage the people to exercise that voice and that’s what they are doing.”
He also said public-private partnerships are a staple of state government in North Dakota and the education system should not be any different.
“There are all kinds of public-private partnerships where we use public funds to pay private organizations to carry out important tasks,” Tamisiea said.
The Catholic dioceses of Fargo and Bismarck encompass about 220 churches across North Dakota, according to their websites. The state also has more than 35 private Catholic schools, including pre-K.
Nick Archuleta, president of North Dakota United, which represents public school educators and opposes the bills, said the call to action by the Catholic diocese was not unexpected.
“What we are preparing for is to defeat these bills in each of the two chambers,” Archuleta said. “We’ve never been a fan of using public dollars to support private school tuition and we’re not going to start now.”
He added North Dakota United conducted polling in December that showed 68% of respondents were somewhat or strongly opposed to using tax dollars to pay for private tuition.
Both bills are scheduled for committee work on Tuesday in the Senate and House Education Committees, which are expected to make recommendations in the coming days.

In its first abortion case since President Donald Trump’s reelection, the Supreme Court will hear arguments next week about whether states can bar Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funds — which could further the administration’s goal of “defunding” the nation’s largest family planning provider.
Medina v. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic concerns an order from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, who in 2018 said any clinic that provided abortions could not participate in the state’s Medicaid program. Lower courts have blocked McMaster’s order from taking effect. But if implemented, the state policy could seriously undercut South Carolinians’ access to reproductive health care and create a template for other states to emulate.
Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans disproportionately serves Black and Latinx people. It does not cover abortions in most states, including in South Carolina, where just under 60% of beneficiaries are not White. Federal law dictates that people who receive Medicaid — more than a million in South Carolina, and about 400,000 of whom are women between the ages of 15 and 44 — are allowed to use it at any qualified health care provider that accepts the insurance plan.

This report was first published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of The 19th News Network.

Cutting Planned Parenthood from Medicaid could have big impacts: Planned Parenthood clinics provide other forms of medical care, such as testing for sexually transmitted infections, cancer screenings and birth control services, all of which Medicaid is supposed to cover. Medicaid is the most common source of insurance for patients who seek health care at Planned Parenthood clinics. Without Medicaid reimbursement, the clinics — which operate with thin financial margins — would likely either have to turn patients away or charge them.
The oral arguments — in which the federal government has joined the case as a friend of the court to argue alongside the state in defense of the policy — in this case come at a complex moment for the future of reproductive health care more broadly. Backed by anti-abortion activists, Trump has pushed an agenda of ending federal funding for Planned Parenthood, the vast majority of which comes from Medicaid.
Abortion opponents have called this policy “defunding,” even though it would not affect private money given to Planned Parenthood, and it would cut revenue sources that don’t actually pay for abortion. Still, it could inject new financial instability for Planned Parenthood and other similar health centers.
A report this week from The Wall Street Journal suggested that the Trump administration is considering freezing all funding to Title X, another federal program that supports family planning clinics services for low-income people. Planned Parenthood is the largest single Title X provider.
With the exception of medical emergencies, health facilities aren’t required to accept Medicaid, meaning that people covered through the program can struggle to find health care providers who take their insurance.
Research from George Washington University suggests that almost 40% of all counties in South Carolina are “contraceptive deserts” where there aren’t enough providers to serve all people in need.
But the impact would likely extend even beyond areas where reproductive health care is hard to attain, denying people in all parts of the country the right to choose who provides an intimate, essential form of health care, said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor emerita of health law and policy at George Washington University who co-authored a brief arguing that the Supreme Court should reject South Carolina’s policy.
“I don’t care if you’re in rural South Carolina or downtown St. Louis, Missouri. There are certain services where if it’s a good quality provider, and this is the provider you prefer, it’s very important to be able to see a trusted provider,” she said.
Public health professionals have warned that upholding South Carolina’s policy could open the door to states discriminating against other qualified medical providers, deciding arbitrarily that patients cannot use their Medicaid coverage at certain health clinics. That could include refusing to let Medicaid cover a certain home care provider because of its stance on unionization, Rosenbaum suggested, or because of employees participating in protests.
And it could influence other states with anti-abortion government leaders. Already, three other states — Arkansas, Missouri and Texas — are enforcing laws that disqualify Planned Parenthood from participating in Medicaid, even though abortion is illegal in two of those.
“If the Supreme Court decides that Medicaid recipients cannot fight back in court when the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services prevents them from freely choosing their health care provider, the effects could ripple far beyond South Carolina,” said Amy Friedrich-Karnik, director of federal policy for the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights but whose research is cited across the political spectrum.
A 2015 analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimated that eliminating all federal funding for Planned Parenthood would mean fewer Americans receiving family planning care — and more people having unplanned pregnancies — even if other health care providers tried to step in. The government analysis, conducted before the overturning of Roe v. Wade allowed states to ban abortion, found that eliminating federal funding would increase federal spending by $130 million over nine years.
“If you pull back Medicaid funding… then they become nonviable, which is the whole point,” Rosenbaum said. “The public health effects of all this are horrendous.”

AARP West Virginia backs this bill, estimating that it could help 250,000 caregivers who are helping family members in the state. 
But as Crossover Day is Wednesday — the day legislation must move out of their chamber of origin — the tax credit bill sits parked in the Senate Finance Committee. 
“Family caregivers often face significant out-of-pocket expenses, averaging over $7,200 annually, to ensure their loved ones receive the necessary care,” said Gaylene Miller, AARP West Virginia state director. “A caregiver tax credit would provide significant financial relief to family caregivers, promoting independence and safety for loved ones, and encouraging more individuals to take on caregiving roles.”
The measure, Senate Bill 697, is known as the “Caregiver Tax Credit Act.” It would establish a nonrefundable tax credit with a maximum of $2,000 for eligible family members 18 years of age and older for eligible expenditures incurred in their caregiving duties.
A fiscal note by the state Tax and Revenue Department estimates that the proposed legislation would result in a loss of General Revenue funds of $160 million to $260 million per year beginning in fiscal year 2028.
  Sen. Laura Wakim Chapman, R-Ohio
“While this tax credit will cost the state initially, I believe the savings will more than be made up for it because Medicaid will not have to pay for nursing home residential care,” said Sen. Laura Wakim Chapman, R-Ohio, who sponsored the bill. “Beyond the savings, our elderly deserve to remain in their homes surrounded by their loved ones for as long as possible.”
  Sen. Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell
Representatives from AARP West Virginia say their research shows 84% of Republican, Democratic and independent voters support a tax credit for caregivers.  
“The caregiver tax credit bill is a righteous investment in keeping disabled or elderly West Virginians out of institutional care,” said Sen. Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell, a co-sponsor of the measure. “This is the most ‘West Virginia’ bill I have seen in 11 sessions. We are our brothers’ keepers.”
The Senate Health Committee advanced the legislation March 19, sending the measure to the finance committee.
Senate Finance Chairman Jason Barrett was unavailable to comment for this story. 
U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., has introduced a bill on the federal level — the Credit for Caring Act — aimed at providing financial relief for family caregivers. The bipartisan legislation would offer a tax credit of up to $5,000 for eligible working family caregivers to help offset caregiving expenses.

That&#8217;s a finding in a report released last week by the Washington-based political reform group Issue One. And, in the context of the report, [&#8230;]","U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, talks with reporters after a meeting of the House Republican Conference in the U.S. Capitol Feb, 5. 2025. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)Among the powerful committee leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives, no one ships nearly as much campaign money to his party’s political caucus as Kentucky’s 2nd District Congressman Brett Guthrie.
That’s a finding in a report released last week by the Washington-based political reform group Issue One. And, in the context of the report, it’s not a flattering distinction.
The report is the latest of five that Issue One has released since 2017 that decry a system — employed by both parties — in which House members find themselves under “relentless fundraising pressure” to raise money for their party caucus committee if they want to be appointed to powerful and prestigious committees.
“A little-known fact about members of Congress is that they must constantly raise money not just for their own reelection bids but to help their respective political parties accumulate power,” the report says. “Both the Democratic and Republican parties lean on their most powerful legislators to boost their political war chests, under something called the ‘party dues’ system.” 
This forces members to devote vast amounts of time to fundraising — time sometimes spent pleading for money from wealthy interests that lobby Congress and appear before congressional committees, the report says.
The pressure comes from the Republican and Democratic leaders who control committee assignments of their members.
Last December Republican leaders of the U.S. House picked Guthrie to chair the important Committee on Energy and Commerce, the oldest continuous standing committee in the House and one with broad jurisdiction over the country’s health care, energy and environmental policies, telecommunications and technology innovation, and consumer safety.
  Issue One examined the contributions of 11 top Republicans and Democrats on four powerful House committees to their party’s caucus’ political fund since Jan. 1, 2023. Rep. Brett Guthrie topped the list, transferring $2.5 million from his campaign committee to the National Republican Congressional Committee during the period. (Source: Issue One analysis of Federal Elections Commission data)
GOP leaders have handed Guthrie and his committee a big assignment: cut $880 billion in spending, much of which will have to come from Medicaid, the federal-state program that pays for about 72 million Americans’ health care, including almost 1 in 3 Kentuckians. The savings are needed to reduce the federal budget by $2 trillion as Republicans seek to renew and make permanent $4.5 trillion in tax cuts from the first Trump administration. 
Issue One examined the contributions of top Republicans and Democrats on four powerful committees of the House since Jan. 1, 2023. The report found that about $1 of every $6 spent by the campaign committees of these 11 key committee leaders (seven Republicans, four Democrats) was in contributions to the party caucus’ political fund. (For Democrats, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee or DCCC; for Republicans, the National Republican Congressional Committee, or NRCC.)
Among the 11 committee leaders, the report shows Guthrie gave by far the most, transferring $2.5 million from his campaign committee to the NRCC during the period. That amounted to a bit more than half of all of the spending by Guthrie’s committee during the period. (None of the other 10 committee leaders whose campaign finances were examined transferred more than $1.5 million or more than 39% of their total spending during the period to their caucus political fund.)
  More than half of Guthrie’s campaign expenditures during the two-year period were to the National Republican Campaign Committee. (Source: Issue One from analysis of Federal Elections Commission data)
Guthrie’s Washington office referred questions from Kentucky Lantern last week to a Guthrie campaign spokeswoman who did not reply to an email from Kentucky Lantern.
Issue One reported that in his recent bid for chairmanship of Energy and Commerce, Guthrie was opposed by U.S. Rep. Bob Latta, an Ohio Republican. Online records of the Federal Election Commission show Latta’s campaign committee transferred nearly $1.3 million to the NRCC in 2023-24. That’s a large amount, but still far less than the $2.5 million transferred by Guthrie’s campaign committee during the same period.
“Fundraising prowess is one criteria that party leaders consider when deciding whom to elevate into important leadership roles … ,” said Michael Beckel, one of the authors of the Issue One report. “Rep. Guthrie’s massive fundraising for the NRCC ahead of the 2024 election certainly didn’t hurt him as he made a bid to become the next chairman of the coveted House Energy and Commerce Committee.”
Punchbowl News reported soon after last November’s elections that Guthrie appeared to be the favorite over Latta. While Latta had an advantage in experience, Punchbowl News reported Guthrie “leads the fundraising race this year by leaps and bounds.”
‘Profound conflicts of interest’
  Republican Rep. Thomas Massie, of Kentucky’s 4th Congressional District, says the party dues system is “extortion and should be illegal.” (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)
In 2016 USA Today reported that the process involves legislative leaders setting quotas for members. “Lawmakers are supposed to dip into their own reelection accounts to meet these fundraising quotas,” USA Today reported. “Those who make — or exceed — their dues are considered ‘team players,’ a label that lifts their chances of landing plum committee assignments.”
That same USA Today report said another Kentucky Republican, U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, refused to pay his dues. “They told us right off the bat as soon as we get here, ‘These committees all have prices and don’t pick an expensive one if you can’t make the payments,” Massie said. “That’s part of orientation.”
On Monday, Massie, in response to questions emailed him by Kentucky Lantern, said, “My opinion of the dues system is still the same: it’s extortion and should be illegal.”
As for how his refusal to participate in the system has affected his committee assignments, Massie said, “I’ve been able to maintain committee assignments to B and C committees without giving to the NRCC, but participation on an A committee is understood to be off the table, so I’ve never sought an A committee.”
Issue One CEO Nick Penniman said in last week’s report, “It’s a betrayal of public trust for legislative leaders in Congress to be constantly worried about fundraising and regularly soliciting wealthy and well-connected donors who have business before their committees. These fundraising demands lead to profound conflicts of interest.”
Guthrie, of Bowling Green, is a former state senator who first won election to Congress in 2008 by beating Democrat David Boswell in a competitive election for the right to succeed retiring Republican Congressman Ron Lewis.
Since then Guthrie has never been seriously threatened in eight reelections. This gives him the luxury of being able to transfer his campaign funds to the NRCC. Last November he won reelection with 73.1% of the vote despite transferring more than half of his campaign war chest during the two-year election cycle to the NRCC.
Beckel of Issue One described the organization as bipartisan and called it “the leading cross-partisan political reform group in Washington, D.C.”

(LRC Public Information)FRANKFORT — A former Democratic state lawmaker is no longer sitting on a powerful commission regulating utilities in Kentucky after the GOP-controlled Kentucky Senate took no action to confirm him before the 2025 regular session ended Friday. 
  John Will Stacy
Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear in September appointed John Will Stacy of West Liberty, a state representative from 1993 to 2015 who later served as the Morgan County judge-executive, to the three-member Kentucky Public Service Commission (PSC). 
Stacy sat on the commission and heard requests from utilities in the months after his appointment but needed confirmation by the Kentucky Senate to continue serving through the end of his term in 2028. No resolution to confirm Stacy had been introduced, confirmation hearing scheduled or vote taken on his appointment by the time lawmakers adjourned Friday.  
Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Mancester, told reporters Friday the reasons for not confirming Stacy included that the former lawmaker was drawing a pension from his previous time in government on top of a six-figure salary PSC commissioners make. 
Stivers also said he knew of Stacy’s business interests and local and government experience, but he considered Stacy to be unqualified for the role given the complexity of topics dealt with by the PSC.
“What is his background in energy?” Stivers said. “This is a highly technical field.”
The Republican Senate leader said he hoped Beshear would appoint a new PSC member who has experience in a range of utilities from electricity to drinking water given the technical nature of overseeing the “delivery of cheap, dispatchable energy to the consumer.” 
But the Senate is making it harder to recruit PSC candidates, Beshear spokesperson Crystal Staley told the Lantern on Monday.
“This is now the third Public Service Commissioner that the General Assembly has not confirmed. Each has been qualified, and the failure to confirm them has drastically reduced interest in the positions. The Senate continues to create new structures or take actions to pressure the commission on the outcome of or the reopening of cases.”
The PSC regulates the rates and services of more than 1,100 utilities, from large investor-owned electric providers such as Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities to small water districts providing drinking water to rural communities. 
The legislature last year created an 18-member commission, separate from the PSC, charged with examining and making recommendations on requests from utilities to retire fossil fuel-fired power plants. In 2023, the legislature passed a law making it harder for utilities to retire coal-fired power plants.
Stacy’s removal leaves two commissioners on the three-member board, PSC chair Angie Hatton and Mary Pat Regan. 
Stivers had introduced a bill in this year’s regular session to expand the membership of the PSC from three commissioners to five but ultimately tabled the legislation.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/stivers031425-1024x750.jpeg,,,2025-04-01 06:00:15.938269

(Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The push to clear the air inside Rhode Island’s two casinos won’t ignite at the shareholder level this year.
Enough Bally’s Corporation shareholders had backed a proposal to study a smoking ban from Michigan-based Trinity Health at the company’s 2024 annual meeting to qualify for resubmission at this year’s gathering tentatively scheduled for May 15. But Cathy Rowan, Trinity’s director of socially responsible investments, told Rhode Island Current that the nonprofit chose not to refile. 
She attributed the decision to last year’s buyout of Bally’s by the New York hedge fund owned by Soo Kim, the Providence-based casino giant’s largest shareholder and chairman of its Board of Directors.
Asked how the new structure would impact a new proposal to study a potential smoking ban, Rowan said it would “be difficult to achieve a vote result similar to what the resolution received last year.”
Trinity will still submit shareholder resolutions to go smoke-free with Boyd Gaming, Caesars Entertainment, Wynn Resorts and Penn Entertainment. 
Lauren Westerfield, a spokesperson for Bally’s corporate office, acknowledged a request for comment with an email saying that the company plans to release a proxy statement after April 4.
That leaves advocates’ ongoing battle to end the loophole that exempts the state’s two casinos from an indoor smoking ban solely with the General Assembly.
“We’ve always taken the position that this was going to take a legislative fix,” Rhode Island AFL-CIO president Patrick Crowley said in an interview. “And we’re trying to let as many legislators know where we stand.”
Crowley is also betting big that public opinion will make the difference. The AFL-CIO in February released a poll that found nearly 7 in 10 survey respondents “strongly” or “somewhat” supported a smoking ban at the state’s two casinos.
And momentum appears to be growing in the Rhode Island House of Representatives, where legislation filed by Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat, has been co-sponsored by Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi.
“I’m glad our legislature seems to be moving in the right direction,” Tanzi said in an interview. “I do believe that this will in fact pass on the House side this year.” 
Matt Dunham, president of Providence-based Table Game Dealers Laborers Local 711, said support in the House was always going to be a given after Shekarchi allowed a symbolic committee vote at the end of last year’s legislative session.
“It’s always come down to the Senate,” he said. “They’ve always been the ones we couldn’t get.”
Companion legislation sponsored by Sen. V. Susan Sosnowski, a South Kingstown Democrat, was initially referred to the Senate Committee on Finance but has since been transferred to the chamber’s Committee on Labor and Gaming, which is chaired by Sen. Frank Ciccone, a Providence Democrat who has been a staunch opponent against banning smoking.
Ciccone said in a recent interview that he met with union leaders and anti-smoking advocates on Feb. 26 to try and come up with a compromise to expand existing non-smoking areas in the casinos.
“We’re still working on it,” Ciccone said.
Crowley called the meeting “cordial.”
“And we agreed to continue talking and see where this goes over the next couple of weeks and months of the session,” Crowley said.
Ciccone said he understands advocates’ calls to end Bally’s exemption from the state’s indoor smoking ban, but argued that allowing smoking gives Rhode Island’s casinos a competitive edge over neighboring states with more dining and shopping options.
“If you go to Lincoln, why are the majority of the cars in the parking lot from out of state?” he said. “Is it because they like us? Or do they come to us because they smoke?”
Ciccone said a smoking ban could cut Bally’s bottom line by upward of 10%, which would result in 126 layoffs in Lincoln and Tiverton — projections company spokesperson Patti Doyle said were accurate.
“We intend to present information about the revenue and jobs impact of a potential smoking ban at our two Rhode Island venues when we testify on legislation introduced to do just that,” Doyle said in an emailed statement.
Tanzi and Susnowski’s bills have yet to be scheduled for a hearing. Tanzi said she expects her bill to go before the House Committee on Finance after legislators wrap up their ongoing budget hearings.
Dunham said he doesn’t believe the company’s argument over job cuts is valid.
“They run a barebones operation already,” he said. “The problem I see in the casino is they don’t hire enough.”
Bally’s has 40 job postings for its Lincoln casino and 18 at its Tiverton location as of Monday, according to its website.
As state lawmakers prepare for debate to return to Smith Hill, Dunham said the union plans to hold rallies and encourage workers and advocates to write to their legislators.
“We’re going to do the same thing we’ve always been doing,” he said.

Local food purchasing programs are some of the latest government programs summarily guillotined by the administration. These programs, managed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture via the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement and the Local Food for Schools & Child Care Agreement Program, would have appropriated $13.1 million to provide local food to food banks, students and food insecure populations. By supporting Colorado farmers and ranchers, local food procurement programs also promised to strengthen regional food systems.
The local food purchasing programs were true win-win initiatives for Colorado’s consumers and producers. From Pueblo to the Western Slope, food banks, schools, day cares, churches and veteran service centers used USDA dollars to buy local produce, beef, dairy, grains and other agricultural products from Colorado farms, ranches, dairies and more. Between May 2022 and June 2024, 220 food producers earned $6.7 million from local food purchasing programs. More than a million dollars funneled into the pockets of Western Slope farmers.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
For producers participating in the programs, the short-term outcomes were financial stability, new partnerships with large institutions, and the expansion of business operations. For the entire state, the long-term outcome could have been a thriving regional food system — so that in time, Coloradans could purchase local, sustainable, and highly nutritious food not just at farmer’s markets, but from grocery stores and restaurants.
Most of the food in Colorado grocery stores is produced and processed out of state or internationally then shipped to various warehouses across North America before being shelved in King Soopers, Trader Joe’s or elsewhere. This globalized and opaque system obscures food production from consumers, facilitating the concealment of environmental and humanitarian issues in American food supply chains (such as excessive pesticide use, child labor, deforestation). Regional food systems, or systems in which food is produced, processed and consumed all within the same region, offer an alternative paradigm for feeding Coloradans. Regional food systems reduce food waste, increase farmers’ profit margins, generate local jobs, and strengthen local economies. And by supporting small- and mid-sized farmers growing diverse crops, regional food systems protect biodiversity, improve soil quality, and reduce energy use.
The local food purchasing programs accomplished the non-controversial goals of stimulating local economies and feeding people in need — so what instigated the Trump administration’s ire?
Because the administration offered no explanation, the answer may only be conjectured: perhaps because these programs emphasize supporting socially disadvantaged food producers, and almost certainly because the Trump administration is determined to dismantle Biden-era initiatives, regardless of their merit. And on the surface, cutting local food purchasing programs aligns with the Trump administration’s efforts to rein in unnecessary spending (a subjective assessment) in the name of government efficiency.
Yet, these claims of government efficiency ring especially hollow and hypocritical considering that ongoing inefficient government spending is the reason these programs are necessary in the first place — $478 billion of subsidies benefitted the nation’s largest and wealthiest farms between 2015 and 2022, creating an uneven playing field for the country’s small- and mid-sized food producers. The approximately $1 billion budget for local food purchasing programs is a drop in the bucket compared to the subsidies lavished on farmers that don’t even grow food for people. Instead they farm corn, soy and other commodity crops to create ethanol, livestock feed, and other products.
Regardless of the justification and injustice driving the termination of the USDA’s local food purchasing programs, they leave a void that needs filling. The benefits of strong regional food systems are too great to neglect, and the programs were too successful to abandon. The state of Colorado must step up to support farmers, ranchers and food insecure people. And because the state is currently struggling with a $1 billion budget deficit, additional government spending requires more state income. To support regional food systems and food security, state legislators should look into creating an enterprise, or otherwise refer a small excise tax on soft drinks to the ballot for Coloradans to vote on.
Boulder, which adopted a soft drink excise tax in 2016, demonstrates the profitably of such taxes — so far, it has generated $29 million for health-related programs. If expanded throughout the entire state, an excise tax on soft drinks could provide a huge sum to fund regional food systems and other state priorities, like healthy meals for all public schools. According to an online calculator developed by the University of Connecticut Center for Food Policy and Health, a $0.02/ounce excise tax on soft drinks in Colorado would have generated between $227 million and $287 million in 2023 (depending on the tax pass through rate).
Colorado leaders face a difficult task: maintaining Coloradan’s quality of life and rights, as well as the state’s environmental and social prerogatives despite opposition at the federal level. An arsenal of state policies is necessary to combat perverse federal policy decisions, and policies to resuscitate local food purchasing programs should be a top priority — for the sake of food insecure Coloradans, local food producers, and the state’s regional food systems.

(Photo: Office of the Governor)The spectacle of politicians preaching one thing and doing another, and of criticizing others for action that they too might have taken in similar circumstances, is nothing particularly new. Sometimes, it’s just a reflection of the fact that it’s a lot easier to be an outsider in opposition than it is to be on the inside trying to govern. Other times, it’s a function of the old adage, “success has a thousand fathers and defeat is an orphan.”
That said, the hypocritical double standards at work on the modern political right these days in the era of Donald Trump are often enough to make your head spin.
Consider the recent “Signalgate” scandal in which Trump’s Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz included journalist Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic in a text chain that also included Director of National Intelligence Chief Tulsi Gabbard and Vice President JD Vance as they discussed a planned military operation.
As 82nd Airborne veteran Scott Peoples pointed out in a recent op-ed for NC Newsline, under many circumstances, soldiers guilty of divulging such sensitive operational plans could expect a dishonorable discharge and possible imprisonment. Unfortunately, the sound one hears thus far in response to the Trump team’s remarkable foul-up in most conservative circles is that of crickets chirping.
One can only imagine the deafening roar of complaints we’d be hearing from Fox News shouters and Republican politicians right now if it had been members of a Kamala Harris administration that had committed such an outrageous breach of national security. Demands to fire the responsible officials would be at a fever pitch, and U.S. House Republicans would probably already be scheduling presidential impeachment hearings.
And the same hypocrisy would undoubtedly play out closer to home as well. Consider the following scenario.
As has been well-documented in recent weeks, Trump, with the help of his unelected immigrant billionaire sidekick Elon Musk, has moved unilaterally to effect a massive and chaotic bloodletting of the federal government. From the attempted elimination of the U.S. Department of Education to the evisceration of several other key departments — including, amazingly enough, the National Weather Service and the Department of Veterans Affairs — Trump and Musk have moved, without legislative authorization, to end or dramatically reduce funding for a host of programs and initiatives that do not reflect their views and values.
But, of course, as is the case with the U.S. government and Trump, the state of North Carolina has long funded statewide and local programs and initiatives opposed by its current chief executive, Gov. Josh Stein.
Likely topping the list: the state’s massive private school voucher program. North Carolina Republican lawmakers have been funneling billions of public dollars to unaccountable and discriminatory private schools for years, even as they have consistently refused to adequately fund traditional public schools.
Or consider the legislature’s repeated allocation of millions of dollars to the black hole that is the state’s network of so-called “crisis pregnancy centers” — completely unaccountable propaganda shops that often masquerade as health providers and generally exist to promote and funnel money to anti-abortion advocacy.
Or how about any number of newly funded programs bestowed by GOP lawmakers on Republican Council of State members like, say, Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler?
Just imagine if Stein — who controls the state budget office, after all — tried to follow Trump’s example by issuing executive orders directing administration officials to simply cancel government programs he disliked.
Funding for school vouchers and crisis pregnancy centers: Gone. New employees at Council of State departments led by Republicans: Fired.
Suffice it so to say that Republican lawmakers and right-wing lobby groups loyal to Trump would be apoplectic.
Moves that, when taken by Dear Leader Trump, have been met with full-throated huzzahs (see, for example, North Carolina Fifth District Congresswoman Rep. Virginia Foxx’s recent embarrassing, kneejerk endorsement of Trump’s destructive and illegal scheme to eliminate the Department of Education), would attract guttural screams of outrage.
School privatization and anti-abortion groups would angrily accuse Stein of being a dictator out to steal their freedoms.
Meanwhile, GOP legislative leaders like Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger and House Speaker Destin Hall would beat a path from the Legislative Building over to Berger’s son and the other Republican denizens of the state Supreme Court building faster than you can say “legislative rubber stamp.”
Of course, the big and critical difference in such a scenario from the current situation at the national level is that Gov. Stein would never take such actions. Unlike both Trump and Musk, Stein is a smart and skilled attorney and an honest and responsible leader who actually believes in constitutional government and the rule of law. While he may disagree with numerous programs funded by the state government he leads, he understands his obligation to abide by the rules and that there are limits to his power.
Would that Trump and the hypocritical political puppets he controls were of the same admirable character.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Gov.-Stein-signs-relief-bill-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-01 06:00:15.938269

Mitch McConnell in a way that reminds people of what Judas did to Jesus for 30 pieces of silver.
Over the years, McConnell’s hard work almost single-handedly built the Republican Party of Kentucky into the state’s majority party. McConnell made it possible 15 years ago for a former government lawyer like Barr to even dream of running for Congress in Central Kentucky.  
Without McConnell, there would be no Congressman Barr, and for years Barr followed McConnell’s lead in voting to protect Social Security, veteran, and a strong military.  Sadly, Barr has gone weak and fainted into the arms of multi-billionaire government contractor Elon Musk.
As with Judas, there’s a reason for Barr’s radical reversal: he’s doing it for Elon’s money. If money is the root of all evil, Musk’s campaign contributions are certainly at the heart of Barr’s treachery toward McConnell.
Barr’s in frantic pursuit of McConnell’s Senate seat, so he’s ditching his long-time ally and desperately chasing Elon. In years to come, Barr’s lust for Musk’s money and his betrayal of McConnell will be remembered as one of the most despicable double crosses in Kentucky political history.

McConnell’s a constitutional conservative, and as the nation’s founders intended, he’s always stood up for the budget-making power of Congress, the branch of government closest to the people.  
In contrast, and for Elon’s money, Barr is cheerleading for Musk, an unelected rich guy who’s plundering tax dollars that were appropriated by law (with Barr’s votes) and trying to pull the plug on Social Security so it can be handed over to Wall Street bankers. 
Elon calls Social Security “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time” and Barr smiles and says: “Thank you sir, may I have another.” 
Musk is a South African native who dumped about $300 million into last year’s presidential campaign. That money bought him a big government job, and with Barr’s approval, Elon is using his position to decimate programs that support Kentucky veterans and the military, Social Security, Medicare, national parks, public schools, cancer research, and disaster aid for flood victims.  Musk can also use his position to steer billions of taxpayer dollars to his private businesses.
  U.S. Sen. Rand Paul (Photo by Eric Thayer/Getty Images)
For Elon’s money, and another slap in McConnell’s face, Barr is supporting tariffs that amount to a national sales tax. Tariffs will increase inflation, and cause chaos in the stock market and the retirement accounts of millions of Americans.
Both McConnell and Sen. Rand Paul are telling Barr — in Paul’s words — “Tariffs are simply taxes. Conservatives once united against new taxes. Taxing trade will mean less trade and higher prices.”
Contrary to Barr’s new position on tariffs, McConnell explained that they “could have long-term consequences (on Kentucky’s) 75,000 family farms that sell their crops around the globe, the hardworking Kentuckians who craft 95 percent of the world’s bourbon, (and) our auto industry that relies on global supply chains to support the livelihoods of thousands of workers in the commonwealth.”
Musk is threatening to spend campaign money against members of Congress who don’t support plans to devastate American families, so Barr is kneeling and kissing Musk’s ring.   
Although he’s trying hard to please Elon, Barr has a poor understanding of Kentucky politics if he thinks voters want a senator who licks the boots of an unelected oddball whose drug use and erratic behavior worry his closest associates.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Last summer, the city of Richmond made waves by announcing a $3 million dollar check for its residents to spend as they see fit. Now, the city is handing the reins over to its people, inviting everyone 14 years and older to vote on how that money should be allocated. From April 1 to 15, Richmonders can head to pop-up events around the city or log on to cast their votes for the projects they want to see funded in what the city has dubbed “The People’s Budget.”
Ideas on the table range from improvements to bus routes, tree plantings in underserved areas, and sidewalk enhancements for pedestrian safety, to more region-specific projects, like a “Welcome to Southside” sign at entry points to Richmond’s 8th City Council district, or better trail access to the James River in the 5th District. 
Instead of just picking one project, the process uses ranked choice voting, allowing participants to express preference for several initiatives. The People’s Budget initiative, which was led by former city councilor and mayoral candidate Andreas Addison, started with other pop-up events and online solicitation to gather input from residents across the city. 
As for the $3 million, it’s being divided across the city with a focus on equity. Isaac Samuels, lead organizer of the People’s Budget, explained that Districts 1, 2 and 4 will each get $200,000, while Districts 3, 5 and 7 will receive $300,000 each, and Districts 6, 8 and 9 will be allocated $500,000. The goal of this varied distribution is to direct funding to areas that have historically been underinvested in, ensuring that all of Richmond’s neighborhoods benefit.
Richmond’s Southside, home to many historically Black neighborhoods, has long faced challenges rooted in systemic inequality. Less tree canopy in these areas leads to higher ground temperatures during hot months, and a history of discriminatory housing policies has contributed to lower home values. 
In the 1930s, appraisers marked Black-populated neighborhoods nationwide in red, labeling them “hazardous” for home loans. The lasting impact of these racist practices is still evident today, with each negative appraisal continuing to affect future evaluations and resulting in less local government investment in public infrastructure.
“This is a big milestone for us,” Samuels said.
After months of outreach and community engagement, Samuels is thrilled to reach the voting phase, knowing the projects selected will soon become a reality. With voting ending on April 15, he expects the results to be available by April 21. 
From there, the implementation of winning proposals will vary based on which city  departments are involved and the procedural steps leading up to any development work. 
“We will be tracking it basically like a Domino’s Pizza Tracker on our website, noting every different step that we’re taking,” Samuels said.
 Ranked choice voting

Ranked choice voting gives Richmond residents a better shot at seeing their favorite projects come to life. If their top choice doesn’t get enough votes, their other picks may still make the cut, giving them a greater sense of influence over the outcome.
This voting method has gained traction in Virginia in recent years. Former state delegate Sally Hudson carried legislation that was signed into law in 2020, allowing localities to adopt ranked choice voting for city council and board of supervisor elections. Arlington was the first to use it in 2023, and Charlottesville is set to implement it this year. 
Richmond nearly became the first locality to adopt it in 2022, but city councilors were still unsure and ultimately voted it down. A major concern was that the law couldn’t be applied to school boards or citywide elections contests like Richmond’s mayor, who, unlike most Virginia localities, is separately elected instead of being a member of the city council. 
This year, a bill from Sen. Saddam Salim, D-Fairfax, aimed to expand ranked choice voting, but it was recently vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Youngkin, who used ranked choice voting to secure his victory in the 2021 Republican gubernatorial convention, explained in his veto that more data was needed before expanding the method. 
He said doing so at this stage “risks institutionalizing a system that has yet to prove its effectiveness in broader elections.”
However, Hudson, now executive director of Ranked Choice Virginia, argues that Youngkin is overlooking “the growing body of evidence” showing successful ranked choice voting trials. 
Arlington has already used it in several elections, and Falls Church and Loudoun county are also considering adopting it. Both Hudson and UpVote Virginia executive director Liz White have pointed to expanding use of ranked choice voting nationwide. 
“I definitely see an increase in just people being familiar with it. I think that that, for us, is the biggest measure of progress,” White said. “The more people use it, the more people know about it, the more they like it.”
While more local elections are still waiting for the ability to use this method, White is thrilled to see it applied in Richmond’s People’s Budget. 
“There’s more nuance to (residents’) votes and they can provide so much more information with their vote,” White said. “I think that’s really cool.”

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)This year’s General Assembly session notably failed to produce legislation addressing the widening gap between electricity demand and supply in Virginia. Legislators shied away from measures that would address the growing demand from data centers, but they also couldn’t bring themselves to improve the supply picture by supporting landowners who want to host solar facilities. By the time the session ended, a mere handful of bills had passed that could improve our ability to meet demand.  
Still, the initiatives that did pass offered positive steps forward on energy efficiency, distributed generation, interconnection of rooftop solar, energy storage, EV charging and utility planning. In addition, two data center-related bills passed requiring more planning and transparency during the local permitting process and tasking utilities with developing a demand response program to relieve some of the added burden on the grid.
Governor unleashes veto storm to drown progressive legislation

Sadly, however, Republican Gov. Glen Youngkin decided to use his powers of veto and amendment to water down or scuttle the limited (and mostly bipartisan) progress legislators made. The only two data center bills were effectively killed, as were most energy bills – some by veto, others by amendments that made them worse than no action at all. 
There’s nothing very subtle going on here. The governor loves data centers and isn’t about to limit their growth, regardless of the consequences to residential ratepayers and communities. He’s also stuck in a rut of attacking the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA), which prioritizes low-cost renewable energy over legacy fossil fuels. He won’t be in office when the chickens come home to roost in the form of an electricity shortfall and skyrocketing rates, but he’s setting up his party to cast blame on the liberal climate agenda.   
 Data centers

The General Assembly failed to pass legislation that would have shifted responsibility for sourcing clean energy onto the data center operators. The only bill to pass that even makes energy a consideration in the siting of data centers is HB 1601, sponsored by Del. Josh Thomas, D-Gainesville. In addition to site assessment provisions at the permitting stage, it requires the utility serving the facility to describe any new electric generating units, substations and transmission voltage that would be required.
Facing data center sprawl and an energy crisis, Virginia lawmakers leap into action. Just kidding.

Limited as these provisions are, the governor proposed amendments to further weaken the bill, then added a clause requiring that for the bill to take effect, it has to be passed all over again in 2026. That’s a veto by another name. 
SB 1047 from Sen. Danica Roem, D-Manassas, requires utilities to implement demand-response programs for customers with a power demand of more than 25 MW, a way of  relieving grid constraints during times of high demand. The governor vetoed the bill, deeming it unnecessary. 
The only data center-related bill that did get the governor’s approval is one of questionable utility. HB 2084 from Del. Irene Shin, D-Herndon, merely requires the SCC to use its existing authority during a regular proceeding sometime in the next couple of years to determine whether Dominion and Appalachian Power are using reasonable customer classifications in setting rates, and if not, whether new classifications are reasonable. The SCC seems to be doing this already anyway, but maybe this lets our leaders claim they are doing something to protect residential ratepayers. Plus, they can now call it a bipartisan effort!
 Utility reform

 With Virginia fixed on a collision course between growing demand for energy from data centers and our leaders’ refusal to support low-cost solar to provide the power, it is more important than ever that our utilities engage in transparent and comprehensive planning through the integrated resource plans (IRPs) filed with the State Corporation Commission. Over the course of last fall, the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation hammered out what I think is truly good legislation to ensure Dominion and APCo present the information the SCC and the public need to be sure our utilities are making the decisions that will improve our energy position and put the needs of ratepayers ahead of corporate profits. 
In vetoing SB 1021 from Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, and HB 2413 from Del. Candi Munyon-King, D-Dumfries, the governor offered this muddled statement: “The State Corporation Commission has the expertise and the authority to make requirements and changes to the integrated resource plan process. The Virginia Clean Economy Act is failing Virginia and those that champion it should stop trying to buttress this failing policy. But rather should be focused on procuring the dependable power needed to meet our growing demand through optimizing for reliability, affordability, and increasingly clean power generation.”
We get it: Johnny One-Note doesn’t like the VCEA. He said that already. But right now, APCo isn’t filing IRPs at all, and the SCC has been so frustrated with Dominion’s filings that it didn’t approve the last one, and demanded a supplement to the most recent one even before it was filed. Clearly the SCC could use a little help here.  
 Distributed energy sources

Advocates for small-scale solar were more successful this year than their colleagues who focus on utility-scale projects. Bipartisan majorities seemed to agree that if we can’t or won’t site large solar farms, at least we should make it easier to put solar on rooftops and other small sites close to users.
Utility regulator recommends suspension of Dominion’s rules for connecting new solar to grid

Sadly, however, only one bill survived the governor’s scrutiny relatively unscathed, though it’s an important one for customer-sited solar. HB 2266 from Del. Kathy Tran, D-Springfield, resolves the interconnection dispute that has stalled commercial solar projects in the 250 kW to 3 MW size range, which includes most rooftop solar on schools. Tran’s bill requires the SCC to approve upgrades to the distribution system that utilities say are needed to accommodate grid-connected solar, a safeguard that will prevent the utility from larding on costs. The utility must then spread the costs across all projects that benefit from the expanded capacity. 
Youngkin’s proposed amendment rearranges the language a bit and places it into a new section of code, but does not otherwise change it. He then adds a provision in the tax code to make grid upgrades tax-deductible. I would have thought they would be anyway, as business expenses, but it can only be helpful to spell it out.  
Unfortunately, that’s it for the good news. 
HB 1883 from Del. Katrina Callsen, D-Charlottesville, and SB 1040 from Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Richmond, contain several provisions aimed at increasing the amount of distributed solar in Virginia. Among other things, the legislation increases the percentage of Dominion’s renewable portfolio standard (RPS) obligation that must be met with renewable energy certificates (RECs) from behind-the-meter small solar projects, a change that would make rooftop and other distributed solar more profitable for homeowners and businesses. 
HB 1883 also increases to 3 MW from 1 MW the size of solar projects that could qualify for this favored category. Additionally, for the first time it would give all residential ratepayers the right to use power purchase agreements (PPAs) to install solar with no money down, and would increase the amount of electricity Dominion would build or buy from solar facilities on previously developed project sites. To give the market a chance to ramp up, Callsen’s bill excuses Dominion from having to meet its REC obligations from Virginia projects for an additional two years, pushing that date from this year to 2027. 
Among all those changes, the only one the governor liked is the idea of softening the requirements around REC purchases. His proposed amendment would make all REC compliance voluntary for four years. Effectively, Virginia would have no renewable energy requirements until 2028, undercutting solar development of any size. His preferred version scraps all of the provisions of Callsen’s bill, leaving no provisions to support solar development and replacing them with an open attack on the VCEA. 
I checked in with Callsen by email to get her reaction. She responded, “We sent the administration bipartisan legislation that protects ratepayers, gives Virginians more options for solar on our homes and businesses, and saves rural land. Rather than sign HB 1883 into law,” Callsen wrote, “the governor used this opportunity to attack the Clean Economy Act from 2020. Instead of looking at the past, our Administration should look around; we have a developing energy crisis and are reliant on importing energy to meet our needs.”
The governor also offered a destructive amendment to HB 2346 from Del. Phil Hernandez, D-Norfolk, and SB 1100 from Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, legislation establishing a pilot program in Dominion territory for virtual power plants (VPPs), which aggregate customer solar and storage resources and demand response capabilities. Although VPPs don’t by themselves add electricity on the grid, they allow time-shifting and other efficiencies that make it easier for utilities to meet peak demand without having to build new generation. The payments utilities make to customers for this service can justify customers’ investments in things like solar, battery storage and smart appliances.  
Instead of improving on the pilot program, however, the governor’s amendment scraps it and calls for the SCC to convene a proceeding to talk about VPPs. On the plus side, Youngkin suggests that the conversation include Appalachian Power as well as Dominion, and consider allowing the service to be provided by either the utilities or third-party aggregators, the latter being the favored approach of many industry members. Still, the amendment pushes off any hope of a program for at least another year, until the SCC has made its recommendations. Since it would have been feasible to both start a pilot program this year and have the SCC consider parameters for a broader program in the future, it’s hard to see the governor’s amendment as a step forward. 
When I asked her for a comment, Hashmi did not mince words, saying it was “incredibly disappointing” that Youngkin chose to offer a substitute instead of signing the legislation.
“This legislation was the result of several months of conversation among a variety of stakeholders, including our utility companies, energy partners, and environmental groups. The Virtual Power Plant has the promise of helping Virginia meet the goals of our increasing energy demands. The Governor’s substitute shows that he is not serious about responding to the growth of Virginia’s energy needs,” Hashmi wrote.
Other solar bills drew outright vetoes, including Munyon King’s HB 2356, establishing an apprenticeship program to help develop a clean energy workforce. The bill requires participants to be paid prevailing wages, a provision that was a certain veto magnet for Youngkin, whose veto statement reads, “This bill will increase the construction costs which will ultimately be passed along to ratepayers, raising costs for consumers.”
Another bill that drew an outright veto was HB 2037 from Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax. His bill would allow local governments to include in their land development ordinances a requirement that certain non-residential applicants install solar on a portion of a parking lot. 
The governor vetoed it because, he said, it would be expensive for developers, and if it weren’t, they would do it without having to be told. (It’s a strange objection. Does he not understand the whole concept of government acting in the public good? Well, maybe not; see the veto.)
Also vetoed was Shin’s HB 2090, changing the rules around multifamily solar. Admittedly I was not crazy about this bill; although it allows solar facilities to be placed on nearby commercial buildings instead of being restricted to the multifamily building itself, it also imports the requirement for minimum bills that has made other shared solar programs in Virginia unworkable for all but the low-income customers who are excused from the minimum bills. 
Maybe the trade-off would have opened new opportunities for apartment buildings serving low-income households, which would make it a plus on balance. But among his objections to HB2090, the governor noted that excusing low-income customers from high minimum bills would shift costs onto other customers. 
 Energy efficiency

The governor vetoed SB 1342 from Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Richmond, and HB 2744 from Del. Mark Sickles, D-Franconia, that would have pushed Dominion and APCo harder to provide energy efficiency upgrades to low-income homes, setting a target of 30% of qualifying households. 
He also vetoed SB 777 from Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, and HB 1935 from Del. Destiny LeVere Bolling, D-Richmond, which would have established a task force to address the needs of low-income customers for weatherization and efficiency upgrades. The governor said it isn’t needed. 
If you notice a pattern here when it comes to helping low-income households with their energy burden, you are not alone. 
Reached on maternity leave,  LeVere Bolling had this to say: “Across our Commonwealth, high utility bills are forcing Virginians to choose between essentials like groceries and medication and keeping their home at a safe temperature during hot summers and cold winters. Virginia has the 10th least affordable residential energy bills in the country. Over 75% of Virginia households have an energy burden higher than the 6% affordability threshold.” She added that the governor’s veto represents a “missed opportunity to address the pressing energy needs of Virginia’s most vulnerable communities.”
  Electric vehicles

The governor offered a substitute for a bill intended to support electric vehicle charging. As passed by the General Assembly, Shin’s HB 2087 requires Dominion and APCo to file detailed plans to “accelerate transportation electrification,” including for rural areas and economically disadvantaged communities. It also allows the utilities to file proposed tariffs with the SCC to supply the distribution infrastructure necessary for EV charging stations. 
The utilities are also authorized to develop their own fast-charging stations, but only at a distance from privately-owned charging stations, with the SCC determining the proper distance. This provision responds to the request of gas station chains like Sheetz that say they want to expand their EV charging options, but don’t want to face unfair competition from utilities that can rate-base their investments.
The governor’s amendment would prohibit Dominion and APCo from owning EV charging stations at all; in addition, it would allow retail providers of EV charging stations to buy electricity from any competitive service provider. However, the amendment repeals the section of code that allows the utilities to recover costs of investments in transportation electrification.  
According to Steve Banashek, EV legislative lead with the Virginia Sierra Club, that “negates the purpose of the enrolled bill.” The amendment, he told me in an email, “removes the requirement for utilities to file for tariffs to support implementation of EV charging and to plan for transportation electrification growth via the IRP process, which is critical for speeding up the transition to electric transportation.” 
As for the prohibition on the utilities owning charging stations, Banashek noted that there are areas of the state where private businesses aren’t likely to do it, including in those economically disadvantaged and rural communities. If we don’t want these areas left behind, either the utilities have to step up, or the state does.  
Apparently, however, Youngkin doesn’t intend for the state to do it either. Along with his amendments to Shin’s bill, the governor also vetoed HB 1791 from Sullivan, creating a fund to support EV charging in rural areas of the state.  
 Energy storage

The need for more energy storage seems like it would be one area of bipartisan consensus. Batteries and other forms of energy storage are critical to filling in the generation gaps for low-cost, intermittent forms of energy like wind and solar. 
But storage is also required to make full use of baseload sources like nuclear that either can’t be ramped down at times when there is a surplus of energy being produced, or where doing so makes it harder to recover the cost of building the generation. (The already-high projected cost of electricity from small modular nuclear reactors becomes even higher if you assume they don’t run when the power isn’t needed.) 
Sullivan’s HB 2537 increases the energy storage targets for Dominion and APCo, and includes new targets for long-duration energy storage. Unfortunately, Youngkin’s substitute language repeals the entire section of code that includes Virginia’s renewable portfolio standard as well as even the existing storage targets. It’s another bit of anti-VCEA flag-waving that won’t help anyone.  
Just in case you thought Youngkin might be adhering to conservative free market principles with some kind of consistency, I note that he signed HB 2540 and SB 1207 from two Republicans, Del. Danny Marshall of Danville and Sen. Tammy Brankley Mulchi of Clarksville, which provides a $60 million grant to a manufacturer of lithium-ion battery separators. 
I asked Sullivan for a comment on the governor’s action on his bill. He replied, “The Governor’s ridiculous ‘recommendation’ on HB 2537 was disappointing, but hardly surprising. This was not an amendment; he deleted everything – everything – having to do with energy storage, and turned it into a one-sentence bill which would repeal the entire Clean Economy Act.”
Moreover, wrote Sullivan, “HB 2537 was the most closely and extensively negotiated bill among stakeholders that I’ve been involved with since the VCEA. It had broad support – including from Dominion – and should have easily fit into the Governor’s ‘all of the above’ energy strategy and his economic development goals, since it would have brought all sorts of business, jobs, and companies to the Commonwealth.”  
Sullivan concluded, “Needless to say, we cannot agree to the amendment.  We’ll easily pass this bill next session, and I suspect Governor Spanberger will sign it.” 
Sullivan may be right that it will take a new administration before Virginia gets serious about meeting its energy challenges – if it does even then – but this session needn’t have ended in a partisan stalemate and near-zero progress. Most of the bills the governor vetoed or gutted were passed with the help of Republicans, making Youngkin’s actions less of a rebuke to Democrats than to the members of his own party who were simply trying to do their job. The results, sadly, are bad for everyone.

The issue of how best to provide services to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities is, admittedly, a challenging one.
Complex questions about the roles played by institutions and sheltered workshops, and the leeway given to families to chart their own courses in finding services, give rise to many competing and legitimate opinions.
That said, there’s one simple truth about IDD services in North Carolina that’s indisputable: they are inadequate.
Thanks to chronic underfunding by state legislators, the waiting list for coveted slots in the Innovations Waiver program is absurdly long. Indeed, there are more people waiting — over seventeen thousand — than there are people enrolled. It takes years to get through the waiting list and many people die before they ever do.
The bottom line: Several factors may feed into this scandalous situation but ultimately, they’re all rooted in the fact that our state’s cheapskate legislature refuses to appropriate the funds that would make it possible to attract and hire enough support workers. And until it does, thousands of families will continue to suffer.

Republicans looking to cut federal spending on Medicaid are eyeing work requirements as one possible option. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Under an emerging Republican plan to require some Medicaid recipients to work, between 4.6 million and 5.2 million adults ages 19 to 55 could lose their health care coverage, according to a new analysis.
The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of the 13.3 million adults in that age group who became eligible for Medicaid when their states expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act would lose coverage if Congress required states to impose work rules.
The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.
“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.
Holdout states consider expanding Medicaid — with work requirements

Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility.
U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.
Medicaid cuts could hurt older adults who rely on home care, nursing homes

The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.










Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face.


– Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families


Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”

Students donning black graduation robes held a mock funeral for the death of higher education after Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed a bill into law that will overhaul the state’s public universities. 
The Ohio Student Association organized the event, which took place Monday afternoon in the Statehouse Rotunda, days after DeWine signed Ohio Senate Bill 1. 
S.B. 1 will ban diversity efforts, prohibit faculty strikes, regulate classroom discussion of “controversial” topics, create post-tenure reviews, put diversity scholarships at risk, create a retrenchment provision that block unions from negotiating on tenure, shorten university board of trustees terms from nine years down to six years, and require students take an American history course, among other things. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
For classroom discussion, the bill will set rules around topics involving “controversial beliefs” such as climate policies, electoral politics, foreign policy, diversity and inclusion programs, immigration policy, marriage, or abortion. It prohibits professors from “indoctrination,” and while it doesn’t define that, it allows complaints to be filed against professors for review by the Chancellor of the Ohio Department of Higher Education. S.B. 1 will only affect Ohio’s public universities and community colleges. 
“It was really surprising, the quickness that it was signed,” said Ohio State University junior Brielle Shorter. “I think signing it at such a time was really interesting as well, but it was truly heartbreaking.”
DeWine got the bill Wednesday — the same day the Ohio Senate concurred with changes to the bill made by the Ohio House — and he signed it Friday. 
“As a Black student on campus, our spaces have already been slowly getting demolished,” Shorter said. “I believe that with this bill there’s going to be more changes like that.” 
Ohio State University is closing its Office of Diversity and Inclusion

Ohio State recently closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion and the Office of Student Life’s Center for Belonging and Social Change in response to the U.S. Department of Education’s Dear Colleague letter that threatened to rescind federal funds for schools that use race-conscious practices in admissions, programming, training, hiring, scholarships, and other aspects of student life.
Shorter said she has seen Ohio high school students post on social media how they are no longer interested in attending Ohio universities and instead plan to go to school out of state. 
Scott DiMauro, president of the Ohio Education Association, said it is unfortunate DeWine signed S.B. 1 into law.
“It’s disappointing to see that he did that, even though the overwhelming amount of opposition that was expressed on the bill from faculty and from students and from concerned citizens was strongly against it,” he said. “I think it’s unfortunate to see collective bargaining rights of people who work in higher education diminished.”
Pranav Jani, president of Ohio State’s American Association of University Professors chapter, said they will fight the impact of the bill as it becomes law. 
“We know that we stand with thousands of educators, students, and parents, who are disgusted by this naked display of governmental repression of higher education,” he said in a statement. 
State Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, introduced S.B. 1, which took just over two months to pass both chambers and be signed into law.

Some school boards have passed policies laying out an explicit mechanism to challenge books or other materials; others have much sparser language. 
This year, Republican lawmakers are seeking to make the process easier. The House and Senate are moving to require New Hampshire schools to allow parents to challenge books and other materials they deem obscene, and to create formal appeals processes for weighing those challenges.
“This bill is about materials that are harmful to minor children in schools and the ability for parents to object to them,” wrote Rep. Glenn Cordelli, a Tuftonboro Republican and the chairman of the House Education Policy and Administration Committee. 
But Democrats, public school advocates, and civil rights groups have strongly objected, arguing the new process could allow parents to target materials that tackle race and LGBTQ+ issues, and arguing that school districts should design their own policies.
A representative from Penguin Random House, the book publisher, submitted written testimony to the committee in early March objecting to the bill.
“HB 324 is problematic due to overly broad language, redundancy with existing laws, and potential intimidation of educators and librarians that will negatively affect book and material selection in New Hampshire’s schools and libraries,” wrote Skip Dye, the chairman of the publisher’s Intellectual Freedom Taskforce.
Dye continued: “Ultimately, it will deprive young readers access to literature that is crucial for their intellectual and emotional development. And without non-discrimination provisions, the lowered standard in this bill may be weaponized against minority voices.” 
The legislation echoes efforts by Republicans in past years. This year, lawmakers appear more likely to succeed. House Bill 324 passed the House on March 26, 183-148, along a near party line vote, while the Senate passed Senate Bill 33 on March 30 with a 16-8 vote. 
But the chambers don’t yet fully agree on key issues. The House-endorsed bill goes further than its Senate counterpart, including more appeals processes for parents and more potential penalties for schools. 
HB 324 would mandate that school boards pass policies that allow parents to complain that certain materials are harmful to minors and should be removed from the school district.
In order to be “harmful to minors,” the material must “predominantly appeal to the prurient, shameful, or morbid interest of minors”; must depict or describe nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, or sadomasochistic abuse; must be “patently offensive to prevailing standards” of what is offense to minors; must lack “serious” literary, scientific, medical, artistic, or political value; and must be inappropriate to the age group to which it is available, according to the bill.
The material must meet all of those conditions in order to qualify as harmful, according to the bill. The material could include books, magazines, movies, pamphlets, recordings, photos, figures, statues, plays, dances, and any other visual presentation, web-based content, and live performance.
Under the bill, school boards must pass policies that allow a parent or guardian to make a complaint alleging that a teaching material in that school district violates the law. At that point, the school’s principal or a designee would have 14 calendar days to make a decision whether the material was in violation and whether it should be removed.
If the principal decided the material did not violate the law, the parent could appeal the decision to the school board. 
SB 33 requires a similar complaint process. 
But HB 324 adds two additional provisions that have vexed opponents. 
First, if the school board also rules against the complaining parent, that parent can appeal a final time to the State Board of Education, HB 324 states. The State Board’s decision is final. 
Second, under HB 324, school districts and individual teachers can face consequences if a material is decided to be prohibited and the school continues to provide that material anyway. School districts can be sued by parents; teachers and other staff can face disciplinary sanctions by the State Board of Education for violating the educator code of conduct. 
It is not clear which version of the legislation might pass both the House and Senate. The chambers could enter “committee of conference” negotiations to find agreement in June.
Barrett Christina, executive director of the New Hampshire School Boards Association, says the association objects to HB 324 for two reasons: the potential liability it creates for school boards who are sued by parents, and the ability for the state board to override the school board’s authority over the materials.
“We think that the local school board should have the authority to determine what’s in their local libraries,” Christina said. He added: “The primary reason why we don’t think an appeal to the State Board of Education is appropriate is that it leaves voters without any local recourse. If the local school board chooses to keep a book in the library and the voters don’t like that decision, they can vote for new school board members at the next election.” 
Since 2004, the School Boards Association has had a model policy it has recommended that schools adopt that covers challenges to materials in school. And Christina says he understands the desire to standardize the process to reduce confusion, especially as book challenges have become more frequent in the past five years.
But to Christina, any policy passed by the Legislature should meet two criteria: There should be well-defined deadlines for parents and school officials, and there should be clear definitions for what type of material violates the statute. HB 324 doesn’t meet those criteria, he argued. 
Absent that clarity, the law could prompt school districts to agree to move more books than they should, he said. 
“Nobody wants to be sued and nobody wants to subject themselves to civil penalties,” Christina said. “So the potential is that it may create a chilling effect with respect to what books local school boards decide to keep in their libraries.” 
Speaking from the floor, Cordelli argued the state board should be included in the process. 
“HB 324 establishes a minimum process for which parents can bring what they consider inappropriate materials to their principal and the school board, and yes, if necessary, to the state board,” he said. “Because we have in statute a duty of the state board to hear complaints from parents.” 
Cordelli added: “This is not banning of books. It is about making sure that our children — your children — have books that are age-appropriate.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/librarybooks-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-04-01 06:00:15.938269

Dream Point can house as many as 40 people. (Photo: Bertie County Schools)Two bills filed in the North Carolina House in recent days would make it easier for local governments and developers to build, manage and maintain workforce housing.
House Bill 306 would authorize Blowing Rock, Boone, Watauga County and the Watauga County Board of Education to construct and provide affordable employee housing on property owned by the governmental units.
The bill comes as western North Carolina struggles to rebuild in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, which devastated the region a little more than six months ago. Approximately 73,700 homes in the region suffered damage and more than 8,800 homes had major damage or were destroyed. The price tag for housing assistance has been estimated at $15.4 billion.   
HB 306 was filed by Rep. Ray Pickett, a Blowing Rock Republican but has bipartisan support. Reps. Vernetta Alston and Zack Hawkins, both Durham Democrats, are among the bill’s cosponsors. Alston filed a bill last year to build allow workforce housing to be built in Durham.  The bill never got off the ground. Several previous attempts to get legislation passed to build workforce housing in Durham also failed to win support from Republican leader who control the General Assembly.
Under HB 306, the governmental units may provide workforce housing separately or through a partnership, joint venture, land trust or similar entity. It also authorizes them to contract to finance, construct or maintain affordable housing for local government employees and to rent or sell affordable housing for residential use exclusively to local government unit employees. Local governments may “charge below-market rates, offer below-market financing, and place reasonable restrictions and buyback provisions on the resale of housing units,” the bill states.
Workforce housing already exists in North Carolina and has been used by some counties to attract and retain teachers, particularly to rural regions where lower tax bases make it difficult to pay competitive local salary supplements. Local supplements are paid from local funds. It’s money teachers receive on top of state pay. Wealthier counties such as Durham, Orange and Wake can pay higher supplements.
Low wealth counties see workforce housing as a way to attract and retain teachers. Less than a year ago, Bertie County, one of the state’s low-wealth counties, opened a 24-unit, two-bedroom apartment complex it built to provide housing for as many as 40 teachers
“Rural communities like Bertie [County] often lose out attracting viable candidates to urban areas where there is shopping, great restaurants, entertainment and other amenities,” BCS Superintendent Otis Smallwood told Newsline last year. “In addition, Bertie County…is not able to pay teachers large local supplements like larger districts. Layer all of that with inadequate housing and you have a recipe for not being able to attract enough talent to educate the youth in our community. In many instances, we have to rely on recruiting international teachers.”
North Carolina already has several affordable housing projects for teachers. Duke TeachHouse in Durham, for example, is a living and learning community for early career teachers and graduates of Duke University’s teacher preparation programs. Others include Williams Baldwin Court in Asheville for teachers who work for Buncombe County Schools and Asheville City Schools, and Hertford Pointe in Ahoskie for Hertford County Schools’ teachers. The Dare County Education Foundation offers 24 housing units in Kill Devil Hills and 12 units in Hatteras for teachers employed by Dare County Schools.
Preconstruction loans for workforce housing
Another bill introduced in the House on Monday would create a revolving loan fund in the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency to provide short-term financing to support preconstruction costs of workforce housing projects.
House Bill 603 was filed by Democratic Leader Robert Reives. It would create the Workforce Housing Preconstruction Revolving Loan Program to make loans available to developers before they obtain permanent, private financing.
Eligible uses for loans would include land surveys, environmental due diligence and soil testing, utility connections, planning and permit fees and site clearing and grading. Loans would be capped at $1 million.
Under HB 603, 80% of projects would be reserved for counties designated as development Tier 1 and Tier 2 areas. Counties with those designations are among the state’s most economically distressed.  The remaining 20% would be reserved for projects in, wealthier Tier 3 areas.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Dream-Point-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-01 06:00:15.938269

(Photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Legislation touted by GOP leaders as making South Carolina’s tax code appear more competitive would require most tax filers to pay more initially, according to an analysis by state fiscal experts.
Collapsing South Carolina’s tax brackets into a single flat tax rate of 3.99% in 2026 would reduce state revenues by $216.6 million overall.
But that’s done by broadening and shifting the tax burden: 19.4% of filers would owe less in spring 2027, while a whopping 59.4% of filers would owe more; 21.2% would experience no change, according to the fiscal impact report by the state Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office released ahead of Tuesday’s first hearing on the bill.


An income tax shift
The bill proposes collapsing SC’s three tax brackets to a flat 3.99% in 2026. How that would shift the liability for tax filings due in spring 2027:

19.4% would see a collective decrease of $1.16 billion
21.2% of tax filers would see no change
59.5% would see a collective increase of $938.7 million

Source: S.C. Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office


The analysis cautions against generalizing: “The impact on individual taxpayers varies widely within each range depending on the specific tax situation of each tax filer,” reads the seven-page summary signed by the office’s director, Frank Rainwater.
Still, the report provides hard estimates on how many South Carolina taxpayers will pay more versus less — and the extent of the swings per taxpayers’ income levels after all applicable deductions, exemptions and tax credits are applied to reduce their reported earnings.
Of the nearly 1.7 million tax filers expected to pay more in state income taxes under the plan, their increase for calendar year 2026 will average $560, with hikes ranging from $98 on the low end of income levels to over $10,000 for taxpayers reporting more than $1 million in adjusted income.
That compares to about 550,000 tax filers who will see an average decrease of $2,110.
Thanks to a new personal income deduction for low-income earners, several hundred people at the bottom end of the pay scale would see an average decrease of $3,700, while tens of thousands of people reporting $30,000 to $50,000 of income would see a dip of less than $40.
On the top end of the scale, roughly 9,900 tax filers reporting more than $1 million would see their income tax liability plummet by an average of $31,000.
More people would be contributing to state coffers.
Under the proposal, 23% of tax filers would still pay zero in income taxes. But that compares to roughly 45% currently, according to the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office.
“Everybody has to pay something — a little something, at least — to be a part of this great state of South Carolina,” Gov. Henry McMaster said last week when the plan was announced.
The new personal adjustment would provide a $6,000 deduction for single filers making up to $30,000, then provide some relief up to $40,000 of income. Married couples filing jointly could deduct $12,000 for incomes up to $60,000, with the deduction phasing out at $80,000.
Republicans’ ‘historic’ tax-cut plan attempts to give SC competitive edge

Still, looking at South Carolinians reporting an adjusted gross income between zero and $40,000, nearly 714,400 tax filers will owe more, while fewer than 20,000 would pay less.
The plan accomplishes what Republicans have long wanted: a tax structure that looks to be among the nation’s lowest. Collapsing three tax brackets to 3.99% would make South Carolina’s flat tax rate the lowest in the Southeast, except for Florida and Tennessee, which don’t have a state income tax.
In 2022, the Legislature passed a law that phased in a tax cut of more than $1 billion, but it still left the top marginal rate as the highest in the Southeast this year at 6.2%. However, the effective rate — what tax filers actually pay — was among the nation’s lowest even before the 2022 law.
The bill promises to keep cutting the rate as revenue collections increase. For every year income tax projections rise by 5%, the bill would reduce revenue by another $200 million until the tax rate gets to 2.49%.
When and if that happens, then the bill would truly be a tax cut for the overwhelming majority of South Carolinians: More than 77% of tax filers would see a collective decrease in their income taxes of $2.5 billion, compared to tax year 2026; 23% would still see no change whatsoever, but no one would pay more.
How many years it would take to get to 2.49% would depend on the economy and income growth.
Advocates promise to make the Legislature’s ruling Republicans feel the pressure to pass the bill.
The state chapter of Americans for Prosperity announced last week plans to launch a “six figure campaign” urging legislators to approve the plan. The group’s marketing push will include mailings, as well as online and radio ads and an “unmatched grassroots presence” going door to door asking residents to call their legislators.

Period.
But now Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and some other Republican attorneys general are in court defending President Donald Trump’s executive order claiming that “birthright citizenship” doesn’t extend to children of the undocumented.
 Trump also claims the power to unilaterally deny citizenship to babies of those with “lawful but temporary” presence in the United States. 
The arguments made by Trump, Yost, and the other attorneys general are “just silly,” a Cleveland immigration attorney said. And she added that they further endanger some of the most vulnerable.
Trump issued the executive order on his first day in office. It claims that the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution doesn’t guarantee citizenship to babies born to undocumented immigrants or those with temporary status, such as holders of student or visitors’ visas.
The order directed federal agencies to stop issuing citizenship documents to those babies. The courts blocked enforcement of the order a few weeks later. Trump is appealing the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Trump wants Supreme Court to let him mostly carry out birthright citizenship order

On March 20, Yost took to X to defend the president’s stance.
“Birthright citizenship in the United States is limited by the Constitution to those persons who are ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof,'” he wrote. “Those words must mean something, and they mean *at least* this: it doesn’t include those who are here illegally.”
Unsettling
Yost is running in the 2026 governor’s race, and he’s shown sympathy with some of Trump’s extreme statements about immigrants as he has. 
Trump and now-Vice President J.D. Vance last summer repeated the lie that Haitian immigrants in Springfield were stealing neighbors’ pets and eating them. That prompted dozens of bomb threats to elementary schools and other public buildings in the small Ohio city, which Vance was then representing in the U.S. Senate. 
Yost, Ohio’s top law-enforcement officer, piled on, criticizing the news media for taking the word of the Springfield police chief over rumors as they assessed whether the racist claims were true.
Now Yost is backing Trump’s claims about birthright citizenship.
The right is embedded in the 14th Amendment, which was ratified 1868 in the wake of the Civil War. Its main purpose was to safeguard the rights of newly freed slaves and repudiate the 1857 Supreme Court decision Dred Scott v Sandford. 
That decision held that slaves and former slaves were not citizens and therefore could not sue in the federal courts. It is widely regarded as one of the worst Supreme Court decisions ever rendered — largely because it was rooted in racist dogma.
Blacks “had for more than a century before been regarded as beings of an inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race, either in social or political relations; and so far inferior, that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect; and that the negro might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit,” Chief Justice Roger Taney wrote in the decision.
The ruling was a key factor in provoking a civil war that killed more than 35,000 Ohioans. After it was over, the Constitution was amended to expand citizenship rights and ensure that the forces of racism could not trample them.
“All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside,” the first section of the amendment says. “No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”
“Some dumb campaign promise”
A century-and-a-half later, Trump is trying to narrow the application of those rights by presidential decree.
Yost and 16 other Republican attorneys general signed on with Iowa AG Brenna Bird in a friend-of-the-court brief supporting Trump’s executive order. While the 14th Amendment was intended to expand citizenship rights, the brief seeks to limit them.
“This case is not about whether birthright citizenship is guaranteed under our Constitution,” the brief says. “It is. Instead, the proper framing of this case asks where the limits of birthright citizenship end.”
Regardless of the merits of that claim, the brief ignores an even more fundamental issue — whether the president has the power to unilaterally declare the courts’ long-running interpretation of the U.S. Constitution null and void, said Heather Prendergast, a Cleveland immigration attorney.
“The whole thing seems so silly to me,” she said. “It’s a joke. (Trump) made some dumb campaign promise that he really doesn’t have the authority to produce. Then he says on day one, ‘Here’s an executive order doing something I can’t do, but I’ve convinced myself is possible.'”
She added, “This is not something the president has the authority to do via executive order. Our government has three branches. If they wanted to change the rules regarding birthright citizenship, it would require an act of Congress, a constitutional amendment. The president doesn’t make the laws. He executes the laws. He doesn’t just get to say, ‘Today this is how we’re going to interpret birthright citizenship.'” 
Third judge blocks Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship

In a January interview with Harvard Law Today, law school Professor Gerald Newman said much the same thing.
“The president of the United States has no authority to change citizenship rules at all,” he said.
Who is subject?
Yost’s office didn’t respond to a series of questions for this story other than to refer to the friend-of-the-court brief. 
In it, Yost and his colleagues don’t address one extreme aspect of Trump’s executive order — that the children of people legally here on temporary visas aren’t automatically citizens under the 14th Amendment. 
They instead argue that those rights don’t extend to the children of undocumented immigrants. To support this argument, they claim that undocumented immigrants are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States as required by the 14th Amendment.
“The Constitution never required every person who happened to be born on United States soil to be a citizen,” the Republican AGs’ brief says. “Nor is that the original meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment’s ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof.'”
Never mind that in 1868 the United States had open borders, so the concept of being undocumented would have been alien to those who wrote and ratified the 14th Amendment. 
Writing in January, Alex Nowrasteh of the libertarian Cato Institute said arguments such as the one in the AGs’ brief misstate what the 14th Amendment says. The concept of birthright citizenship predates it in U.S. jurisprudence, and even goes back to 17th century English common law, he said.
Nowrasteh quoted U.S. Sen. Jacob Howard of Michigan who introduced the 14th Amendment. In a statement defending it, Howard said birthright citizenship extended to everybody, but “will not, of course, include persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers” who have diplomatic immunity.
Trump and his supporters might try to torture that sentence into meaning undocumented immigrants and the babies of foreign diplomats are not entitled to birthright citizenship. But Nowrasteh said that goes against what Howard was plainly saying.
“Howard was describing the families of ambassadors as being foreigners and aliens,” Nowrasteh wrote.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Case in point
Even after Congress began restricting who could become a citizen merely by coming here, the Supreme Court ruled that being born in the United States made one a citizen with two exceptions — being born to a foreign diplomat or to a member of an invading force.
The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 placed a 10-year ban on Chinese immigration and prohibited Chinese who had already entered from getting citizenship. The legislation is considered highly racist because it singles out one ethnicity and it arose out of concern over the ethnic composition of the United States. Trump’s attempted Muslim bans have faced similar criticism.
Despite the Chinese Exclusion Act, the Supreme Court in 1898 ruled in U.S. v Wong Kim Ark that children born on U.S. soil to non-diplomat Chinese parents are citizens.
As a young man in 1895, Wong Kim Ark visited China and was denied reentry to the United States. He took the matter to court and three years later, the justices ruled 6-2 that the 14th Amendment made him a citizen.
“The Amendment, in clear words and in manifest intent, includes the children born, within the territory of the United States, of all other persons, of whatever race or color, domiciled within the United States,” Justice Horace Gray wrote for the majority. “Every citizen or subject of another country, while domiciled here, is within the allegiance and the protection, and consequently subject to the jurisdiction, of the United States.”
In their brief, Yost and his colleagues claim that immigration laws passed after the 14th Amendment was ratified limit its scope.
“… Wong Kim Ark repeatedly emphasized that its facts involved lawful, permanent United States residents... ” the brief says. “Even its holding stressed the importance of lawful residence: ‘so long as they are permitted by the United States to reside here’… Wong Kim Ark did not address children born to illegal immigrants or birth tourists.”
However, that statement seems to ignore the plain language of the Supreme Court ruling — that Congress can’t pass laws that shrink the rights provided by the 14th Amendment.
“The acts of Congress known as the Chinese Exclusion Acts, the earliest of which was passed some fourteen years after the adoption of the Constitutional Amendment, cannot control its meaning or impair its effect, but must be construed and executed in subordination to its provisions,” it said.
In other words, statutes passed by Congress can’t trump the Constitution.
“The 1898 Supreme Court decision of United States v. Wong Kim Ark established that the US-born children of immigrants were and remained citizens even if there were changes in law that would not have allowed them or their parents to legally immigrate here or naturalize,” wrote Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute.
Shaky justification
Prendergast, the Cleveland immigration lawyer, also questioned a key justification Yost and the Republican AGs gave in their attempt to limit birthright citizenship. 
The brief said it was important to remove incentives for undocumented people to come to the United States with the sole purpose of having citizen children. That implies that having citizen babies would make it easier for their parents to stay. And that ignores that it’s much, much harder than most people think for undocumented parents to get permanent residency, Prendergast said. 
“They act like somehow, birthright citizenship is a real draw; that people can come over here, have babies and somehow the babies themselves are going to acquire legal status for them,” Predergast said. “But a child can’t petition for their parents (to have permanent-resident status) until they’re 21 years old.”
She added that if the parents are in the United States without documents, they’re subject to more requirements when the child finally turns 21. In the vast majority of cases, they have to return to their home countries, go to a consulate, apply, and then wait 10 years.
Politicians’ talk of a border ‘invasion’ is speech that experts say has gotten people killed

“It’s a complicated process,” Predergast said.
The brief onto which Yost signed also echoes Trump’s claim that crossings at the southern border amount to an “invasion.” Despite their claims, Trump, Yost and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott have never shown that the typically peaceful southern border has been crossed in recent decades by hostile tanks or helicopters as part of a coordinated military force.
Yost’s office didn’t respond when asked if he was worried that such inflammatory rhetoric would result in another racist massacre like the one that happened in 2019. Spun up on racist rhetoric, 21-year-old Patrick Crusius, drove 600 miles from the Dallas area to an El Paso Walmart and started shooting every Hispanic-looking person he saw. In a manifesto he posted just before he murdered 23 and wounded 22, he wrote, “This attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.”
Prendergast said the friend-of-the-court brief the Ohio attorney general joined isn’t a serious legal effort — it’s just more toxic politics.
“I don’t think most people take it seriously,” she said. “It’s a chaos agent, meant to create fear and division.”

Federal funding has been frozen for New Hampshire farmers’ U.S. Department of Agriculture grants, like the rural energy programs designed to support farmers making efficiency improvements. Other programs that provide technical and financial assistance to those who prioritize soil health, wildlife habitat, and water and air quality in their agricultural practices or are transitioning to renewable energy systems are also facing stalled funding.
The New Hampshire Food Bank recently lost nearly $1 million in federal funding for its NH Feeding NH program, which purchases fresh produce in bulk from local farmers and assists partner agencies with buying culturally preferred foods for New Americans.
The U.S. House has also proposed $12 billion in cuts to school meal programs, affecting 12 million students in 24,000 schools nationwide. As Dorothy McAuliffe, the former first lady of Virginia, once lamented, “Kids can’t be hungry for knowledge if they’re just plain hungry.”
Drastic cuts in EPA funding have escalated the “forever chemical” crisis. Mark Ruffalo, actor and activist, has pleaded with Congress to stop PFAS at the source, knowing that exposure to the forever chemicals has been linked to health risks such as cancer, birth defects, reproductive and developmental disorders, and weakened immune systems.
In his testimony he cites Manchester as an example “where a wastewater treatment plant burns sewage sludge just steps from homes, an elementary school, a baseball field, and the Merrimack River.” This plant, he said, “is the only facility in the state with a sludge incinerator, and in 2018 alone, it burned more than 4,000 dry metric tons of it. That’s happening just two miles from neighborhoods already struggling with high levels of toxic air pollution.”
Ruffalo points to the solution: a Clean Water Act permit protecting waters from pollution,  specifically, renewing Manchester’s permit with stronger regulations to curb PFAS from entering the wastewater facility from upstream industries. Remarkably, Ruffalo notes, the current draft permit contains no such requirement. After “treatment” this toxic stew is spread as fertilizer over farmers’ fields where it leaches into the groundwater supply.
Pristine waterways will undoubtedly suffer severe environmental degradation as wetlands eventually lose their primary function to purify water, prevent flooding, and protect critical wildlife habitat. The EPA is currently ordered to scale back wetland regulations and oversight in favor of state and industry control. Tom Irwin of the Conservation Law Foundation (CLF) warns that newly filed bills in the New Hampshire Legislature supported by the fossil fuel industry would, if passed, greatly weaken renewable energy programs by boosting oil and gas production over solar and wind energy.
A recent “Saturday Night Live” spoof featured the character Debbie Downer complaining to actor Robert De Niro that “we’re all walking landfills.” De Niro replied that the world “is like living in a full diaper.” In the soil of this morass we’re growing “natural” seeds coated with EPA approved radioactive waste. Despite these odds a unique seed variety persists, immutable and treatment resistant, one honored by the contemporary poet Dinos Christianopoulos in his couplet, “what didn’t you do to bury me / but you forgot that I was a seed.”
His acknowledgement of resilience and resistance serves as a call to action. Just like borrowing a book, you can sign out seeds for your garden from your local library or join the Surfrider Foundation’s cleanups of New Hampshire beaches or become a citizen scientist conducting water monitoring tests for the Nashua River Watershed Association. You can join Sy Montgomery’s team of turtle rescuers and rehabilitators described in her book “Of Time and Turtles: Mending the World, Shell by Shattered Shell.”
You can even volunteer with UNH’s rescue program, Nature Groupie. As thousands of amphibians migrate each spring to vernal pools and other wetlands to breed, the group organizes salamander crossing brigades at amphibian road crossings to help move them by hand (and keep count) during one or more “Big Nights.”
Saving small creatures brings the following parable inspired by Loren Eiseley to mind. A man walking along a beach noticed a boy picking something up and gently throwing it into the ocean. When asked what he was doing, the boy replied, “Throwing starfish back into the ocean. The tide is going out and if I don’t throw them back, they’ll die.” The man replied, “Son, don’t you realize there’s miles and miles of beach and hundreds of starfish. You can’t possibly make a difference.” Bending down to throw another starfish into the surf, the boy said with a smile, “I made a difference for that one.”
Though we’re facing the erosion of environmental safeguards due to funding freezes, there are many ways we can remain steadfast, connected, and involved.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/elonmuskannp-1024x731.jpg,,,2025-04-01 04:59:38.706526

Local and state organizations such as the United Way of Central Ohio, Integrated Services for Behavioral Health, The Boys & Girls Clubs of Central Ohio, the Corporation for Ohio Appalachian Development, the Ohio Urban Community Action Network, and Lutheran Social Services of Central Ohio signed a letter asking that an expansion to publicly funded child care and the Child Care Choice Voucher Program be maintained, and for the child tax credit to move along with other measures to help Ohioans pay for and support their children.
Dozens of individuals also signed the letter, including Franklin County Commissioner Erica Crawley, a former Ohio lawmaker herself.
“These proposals from Governor (Mike) DeWine represent a critical step toward making life more affordable for families, and ensuring children have a strong start to life,” Crawley wrote in a statement announcing the letter. “And make no mistake, it will be good for businesses and our economy as well.”
The commissioner said there is a “direct link” between a productive workforce and affordable quality child care, care that is “out of reach for far too many families in our state.”
Danielle Sydnor, CEO of the RISE Together Innovation Institute, a group which signed the letter, opined about the struggles of Ohio families who are fighting just to afford “basic necessities like housing, child care and groceries.”
“We stand in coalition to show overwhelming support to lower the cost of child care and to provide tax relief for working families,” Sydnor wrote in a statement. “Together, we urge lawmakers to prioritize relief for families in state budget negotiations.”

The letter was centered around organizations and individuals in Franklin County, pleading with state legislators to consider the “future priorities of Central Ohio and our state.”
“Housing and child care costs have surged, wages haven’t kept pace, and too many working people find themselves forced to make impossible choices between rent, child care, health care, and groceries,” according to the letter.
The proposed child tax credit, which would give a maximum of $1,000 per child ages 0 to 6, would allow for financial relief, the groups and individuals who signed the letter said.
Along with that, expansions to child care in the state to bring the eligibility of both publicly funded child care and the Child Care Choice Voucher Program to 200% of the federal poverty line would “make life a little more affordable for working families.”
“The choices you and your colleagues make in this budget will shape the future of our region and our state,” the letter stated. “We urge you to stand with the people in Franklin County and across Ohio by passing a budget that provides some relief to families with young children.”
The letter cited recent research by child advocacy group (and letter supporter) Groundwork Ohio, who found in a poll of parents that 94% saw remedies to inflation and the cost of living as important concerns, and 84% of parents wanted to see reductions in the cost of child care.
A separate analysis of the child tax credit done in February by Scioto Analysis found that the tax credit, which would be paid for using an increase in the state tobacco tax, would benefit the state economy to the tune of more than $700 million.
Proposed Ohio child tax credit would produce $740M benefit to state economy, analysis finds

Democrats in the Ohio legislature are supportive of the tax credit (and think child care should be a priority), while Republicans have expressed hesitation in moving forward with the plan. Senate President Rob McColley seemed cautious when discussing raising taxes on cigarettes, saying it will be “a declining source of revenue.”
If passed, it could be the first time a GOP-controlled state implemented such a child tax credit, with Indiana also considering such a move.
On the side of child care, Republicans seemed to be more on board with the idea of improvements. Legislation to improve the child care sector has been introduced from both sides of the aisle, with the support of not only child care advocates but business groups and economic experts as well.
A bill to establish a cost-sharing model for child care called the Child Care Cred Program drew supporters to a House committee hearing on the bill this month. Businesses and the Ohio Chamber of Commerce urged support for the bill to help lift the parental load but also give the state workforce a boost. T
he legislation, and its companion bill in the Ohio Senate, are both led by GOP sponsors, making them more likely to succeed in a General Assembly over which Republicans hold a supermajority.

(Photo from Google Maps.)Ohio lawmakers plan to repeal the remaining aspects of scandal-tainted legislation, saving ratepayers money and eliminating FirstEnergy’s House Bill 6. As this happens, the utility company wants to increase consumers’ bills.
Like clockwork, energy costs go up in the winter.
“It’s been a long winter for us here in Ohio,” Clevelander John Makley said.
With a shaky economy and increasing FirstEnergy bills, Makley worries about his retirement.
“Do I have to manage to get to work and walk with a cane or a walker just to maintain a paycheck?” he asked.
FirstEnergy is now asking for even more money from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) for a $190 million increase in their charges.
“Instead of a $190 million distribution rate increase, the FirstEnergy utilities should be getting a haircut,” Agency Director of the Office of Consumers’ Counsel (OCC) Maureen Willis said. “Consumers electric utility bills are already packed with soaring transmission costs and rising energy prices. Affordability remains a key issue for Ohio families and businesses.”
The OCC estimates that Cleveland Illuminating Company consumers will see a $13 price increase per month, Ohio Edison will have a $3 spike, and Toledo Edison a $1.50 increase.
Makley is already frustrated by his current energy bill.
Taking a look at his charges, in the fine print, there is a subsidy that requires ratepayers to fund two Ohio Valley Electric Corporation coal plants — one in Southern Ohio and one in Indiana. The main beneficiaries for OVEC are American Electric Power Company (AEP), Duke Energy and AES Ohio. Still, FirstEnergy collects payment for it.
But thanks to the lawmakers, his energy costs may go down soon.
“They’re thinking about the people and working to right a wrong that was put into the legislation so long ago,” Makley said.
To find out which rider (a utility surcharge) on his bill benefited the plants — since it wasn’t on the bill — we had to search through the 150-page document on FirstEnergy’s website about tariffs.
Still, there was no mention of OVEC under any of the riders. We reached out to the company to find out where it was — turns out it falls under a rider on page 146 with the “Legacy Generation Resource Rider.”
This handout was part of House Bill 6, corrupt legislation that landed former House Speaker Larry Householder in federal prison for 20 years.
How we got here
Back in 2019, Householder funneled $61 million worth of bribes in exchange for legislation to give FirstEnergy a $1.3 billion bailout, named H.B. 6, at ratepayers’ expense.
In March 2023, a jury found that Householder and former GOP leader Matt Borges, beyond a reasonable doubt, participated in the racketeering scheme that left four men guilty. Neil Clark, a lobbyist accused of bribery, died by suicide after pleading not guilty in 2021.
In late June that year, federal judge Timothy Black sentenced Householder to 20 years in prison. Borges got five years. Two defendants — Jeff Longstreth and Juan Cespedes — took plea agreements early on, helping the FBI, and are still awaiting their sentencing. The feds are asking for zero to six months for them.
Former FirstEnergy CEO Chuck Jones, former FirstEnergy Senior Vice President Michael Dowling, and former PUCO Sam Randazzo were all hit with state bribery charges. Each pleaded not guilty during their joint arraignment in mid-February 2024. They are accused of masterminding the corruption scheme.
In April 2024, Randazzo would become the second defendant accused in the scandal to die by suicide.
Recently, Householder’s attorney said his team plans to use their connection to President Donald Trump to try to get out of prison.
OVEC
This past month, the Ohio House passed H.B. 15, and the Senate passed S.B. 2 — similar energy bills — but both repealed the subsidies for the unprofitable plants.
“If we leave this OVEC portion in place, it’s going to cost our taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars for a bill that was bought and paid for in the largest scandal in Ohio history,” state Rep. Josh Williams, R-Sylvania, said.
A study commissioned by the Ohio Manufacturers’ Association found that in 2024 alone, these subsidies cost ratepayers roughly $200 million. The company lost more than $100 million the same year, so consumers are paying for plants that aren’t profitable.
The subsidies may not seem like a lot every month, but they add up when inflation is high and people struggle.
You would be saving $1.30 and $1.50 per month, depending on your utility provider, according to the Energy News Network.
While the bill was passed overwhelmingly in each chamber, former House Speaker Jason Stephens, R-Kitts Hill, argued that it could cause people to lose jobs if the plants shut down.
“There are Ohioans who work at this plant for generations — their grandfathers worked there,” Stephens said.
The Ohio plant is in Stephens’s district, and the former leader prevented similar legislation from being heard in the last General Assembly.
He explained that in a previous G.A., part of H.B. 6 was repealed, but the lawmakers chose to keep the coal plant money. Then, in the 134th G.A., lawmakers passed H.B. 128 — which took out funding for nuclear power plants.
House Speaker Matt Huffman didn’t seem impressed by Stephens’s remarks.
“This money doesn’t go to Lawrence County to help that plant,” the speaker told reporters after the vote. “It goes in Duke’s checking account in Charlotte, North Carolina, and they decide over many states, not necessarily to spend any money.”
Only three lawmakers voted against it in the House — Stephens and state Reps. Don Jones, R-Freeport, and Latyna Humphrey, D-Columbus.
“I understand and respect your — the corruption that everyone wants to attach to House Bill 6,” Jones said. “I was here for House Bill 6 — it’s the lens in which you look at it through.”
He continued that his county has about 700 coal miners who rely on these plants.
“When Ohio makes a promise, whether we like the promise or not… We should honor that,” Stephens added.
“At whose expense?” Makley responded.
OVEC and the utility companies are lobbying for at least some grace period — a sliding ramp of two years for them to eliminate the subsidies.
“Ohio Valley Electric Company power plants have provided Ohioans with reliable power, helped make Ohio’s economic development possible and supported our nation’s security interests,” Scott Blake with OVEC and AEP said. “We continue to advocate for a reasonable timeline for transitioning the cost recovery for the OVEC plants and will work with policy makers as the legislative process continues.”
There is still a process before you could see your bills go down. Each chamber will have to agree on one policy, which is then sent to the governor.
Gov. Mike DeWine in January said, when asked, that he would support repeal.
Asked what it would take to earn his trust back on energy policy in Ohio, Makley said that’s a tough one.
“Transparency is really important,” he said. “We need to see what we’re paying for.”
The lawmakers who support it say they are hoping to close this dark chapter in state history.

(Getty Images)Millions of individuals in this country rely on Medicaid. Poor Medicaid: To me Medicaid is like a person who gets beat up on all the time. No one quite understands what to do with Medicaid, or what rules or laws to implement with it.
Hospitals rely heavily on Medicaid payments, and so do nursing homes. Doctors’ offices and mental health clinics such as Valeo rely on Medicaid as well. When Medicaid was privatized in Kansas and became known as KanCare, put into three for-profit companies, problems abounded. It became especially problematic for those with developmental and intellectual disabilities.
Now, in the U.S. Congress, there is debate about changes and cuts to Medicaid. It’s all very confusing, but the bottom line is all of it would harm the Medicaid program. The people who rely on Medicaid are not criminals. They are not entitled and trying to get something for nothing. These are people who truly can’t work and who may need Medicaid for the remainder of their lives.
With Medicaid, people can thrive in their communities and receive lifesaving care and support. Do we care about these folks? Do we care about preserving our hospitals like K.U. Medical Center and the nursing homes where our loved ones reside? Whenever I think of asking tough questions, I always go back to my own faith and ask the question: “What Would Jesus Do?”
Indeed, now is the time for Congress to ask this question and to search deep within their hearts for the answers to all of these pressing issues.
Valeo Behavioral Health Care has faced budget cuts due to changes and cuts in Medicaid funding. They work with the three managed care companies administering KanCare, and it has been and continues to be a tremendous challenge.
Families know what is best for their children. It’s easy to say, “Let’s have cuts and harmful cuts to Medicaid,” when one doesn’t have a disabled family member or friend or anyone they know who relies on Medicaid. Disabilities are not the enemy. Poverty shouldn’t be the enemy.
I think a lot of people are afraid of the needs of others. They feel overwhelmed and burdened by what they don’t understand. Let’s imagine if Jesus walked into the U.S. Congress and sat down with all the lawmakers. What would He say to them? Who would He advocate for?
Families are crying out for help and greater funding of Medicaid and not greater burdens. Let’s listen to their cries and not turn away. Let’s not create burdens for people who are already about to give up.
When I see people in need, I often feel overwhelmed, but I don’t ignore that person. Instead, I ask my deep faith what to do. My grandpa, who was a minister for 60 years, used to always end his phone calls with me by saying kindly: “Rebecca, stay on the road.”
With all the drama and trauma going on these days, I would implore Congressional leaders to not ignore these families with loved ones who need Medicaid. I would encourage them to imagine stepping into my grandpa’s summer kitchen — in the back of his old, huge, historic home in Americus, Georgia — and listen to him encourage them to stay on the road, to stick to their values no matter what.
Let’s not give up on the right thing to do. Let’s reach out during this time and dare to care. It’s the only thing to do.

I feared we were adapting to abnormal, becoming desensitized to appalling and shrugging off horrific. 
Like the metaphorical frogs in a pot of water on slow boil, we were simmering in the surreal, lulled into complacency as a coping mechanism. Now we’re sitting in a fully boiling cauldron clamped shut and I worry that the speed and scale of our impending fate doesn’t even register with many of us.
Democracy in Ohio is being boiled away by corruption, extremism, and attacks on voters

But there’s still time to escape the intense autocratic heat in America and reclaim our sovereignty. The first step to saving our right to self-determination is awareness. The authoritarian regime in Washington mirrors the authoritarian regime in Ohio. One-party rule in our state government ignores court orders, voter mandates and overwhelming public opposition to muddled, catastrophic policy. 
In our federal government, a convicted felon seizing unilateral control of everything under compliant one-party rule, ignores court orders on due process, congressional mandates and immense public outcry over reckless agency shutdowns, blanket firings, and unchecked data mining by an unelected billionaire.   
The DeWine administration replicated the bullying and financial extortion of universities and colleges in the Trump administration to crush academic independence and chill speech. 
Ohio’s profile-in-cowardice governor even mimicked Trump’s performative signings of executive orders by posing with his own signature on ruinous state legislation designed to own the libs and teach “woke” public universities and colleges a right-wing lesson on cancel culture and funding cuts.
When Gov. Mike DeWine made the fiercely opposed Ohio Senate Bill 1 law — prohibiting all diversity, equity and inclusion activities on campus and setting regulations around “controversial” issues — he also sanctioned SB1’s anti-union edict to rescind certain collective bargaining rights and tenure protections for faculty no longer allowed to strike. 
The state’s union-busting rule followed Trump’s executive order that abolished union rights at over two dozen federal agencies.
As the powerbrokers in Columbus and Washington sync their agendas to control and subjugate, they are laser focused on removing whatever stands in their way — chiefly, free, fair and accessible elections. 
Undermining them is a coordinated MAGA goal of the utmost priority before the 2026 midterms. To that end, Trump recently issued a sweeping executive order dictating the law of the land on federal elections — which he has no constitutional authority to do — that could stop millions of Americans from registering to vote in federal elections if they don’t have proof of citizenship (which many don’t or can’t easily access). 
Voters already attest to their citizenship under penalty of perjury. The added hurdle is purely to suppress votes, especially those that trend Democratic.
Trump’s directive severely limits voting by mail and gives more uncurbed power to Elon Musk’s DOGE to comb through sensitive state voter files. What could go wrong? 
Unrestrained voter purges. Database errors. Leaks. It’s all good if it keeps voters from holding unlawful leaders to account. 
Trump’s allies in Congress have teed up a nearly identical voter suppression scheme called the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act.
It could block more than 21 million eligible Americans from voting because they’re unable to supply a birth certificate or passport or enhanced driver’s license or jump through more gratuitous GOP hoops for permission to vote.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
U.S. House Republicans are expected to consider their massive barrier to voting this week. It would require everyone registering to vote or updating their registration to prove their citizenship. Mail, online, and voter registration drives would be functionally eliminated because of the new, in-person, show-us-your-papers requirements.
This is a full court press by GOP lawmakers on the federal and state level to stay in power by disenfranchising active voters with the Trumpian-fueled myth of rampant voter fraud. 
Ohio Republicans are quietly rolling out legislation now that would also reduce participation at the polls. As always, they justify their so-called anti-fraud measures as election “integrity” insurance — even as they boast of our “gold standard” election system and can’t produce evidence of a problem. Ever. 
A bill was just introduced in the Ohio Senate (SB 153) that would require proof of citizenship to vote in the state and ban ballot drop boxes altogether because why not?
State Sen. Theresa Gavarone, R-Bowling Green, obsessed with dreaming up new ways to solve a phantom dilemma (a post-election audit last November showed a perfect accuracy rate and no voter fraud in the presidential race in Ohio) touted SB 153 as “a simple fix that strengthens trust and integrity in our institutions.” 
She posted her enthusiasm for Trump’s sham executive order that attacks free and fair elections. “President Trump is right; we need to do everything to protect the integrity of our elections.” 
Poor thing must have amnesia about Trump’s lawless attempt to overturn a free and fair election, his blatant lies about a stolen election that wasn’t, and his incitement of a violent attack on the seat of our democracy to stay in power. 
We are in boiling hot water. The only way out is with eyes wide open. Then you have to decide whether you care enough to exercise your fundamental rights with resolve and not a minute to spare.

For many California residents, the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year were the latest and most searing example of the devastating effects of climate change. Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion.
“We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat. “It’s the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It’s not sustainable, it’s not right and it’s not ethical.”
Addis and Democratic lawmakers in nearly a dozen other states want to force the world’s largest fossil fuel companies to help pay for the recovery costs of climate-related disasters. Last year, Vermont became the first state to pass a “climate Superfund” law, followed soon after by New York.
This session, 10 states have seen similar proposals, several of which have advanced in key committees. Advocates point to legislation in Maryland that has drawn support in both chambers, as well as to strong grassroots support in California after the Los Angeles wildfires.
Lawmakers say the rapidly increasing cost of climate disasters — from wildfires to floods to sea level rise — is more than state budgets can bear.
“Climate Superfund is the ‘it girl’ policy of the [2025] session,” said Ava Gallo, climate and energy program manager with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “There’s a lot of popularity in the idea of holding polluters responsible.”
The momentum for these “polluter pays” bills is tied to the maturation of attribution science. That new field of research can help calculate fossil fuel companies’ contributions to historic emissions totals, as well as the role climate change played in causing or worsening natural disasters.
Vermont’s law was the first attempt to use that science to charge emitters for their role in causing devastating floods and other catastrophes.










We've had disaster after disaster after disaster. It's the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It's not sustainable, it's not right and it’s not ethical.


– California Democratic Assemblymember Dawn Addis


Fossil fuel companies and their allies have fought back hard. Late last year, the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging Vermont’s measure. The groups argue that emissions are governed by the federal Clean Air Act, precluding states from charging companies over global pollution.
Neither group responded to a Stateline interview request. The Independent Petroleum Association of America also declined an interview request.
A separate lawsuit, led by 22 Republican attorneys general, is challenging the New York law. And a conservative group has targeted Rachel Rothschild, an assistant professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, who helped draft the legal justification for climate Superfund policy. The group, Government Accountability and Oversight, has sought to subject Rothschild to a deposition, The New York Times reported, a move that some experts view as an intimidation tactic.
Meanwhile, oil and gas executives asked President Donald Trump during a White House meeting this month to direct the Justice Department to join the legal fight against climate Superfund laws, The Wall Street Journal reported. Industry leaders are also pushing Congress to shield them from more than 30 lawsuits brought by state and local governments that aim to make them pay for some of the results of climate change.
While experts expect a bruising legal battle over climate Superfund policies, the threat of lawsuits hasn’t deterred more lawmakers from backing the concept.
“States were a little bit wary; they wondered, ‘Is this some new radical plan?’” said Cassidy DiPaola, communications director with the Make Polluters Pay campaign, a coalition of groups backing such bills. “Then one of the littlest states passed it and this powerhouse, New York, passed it. That really set the ball rolling.”
Lawmakers hope to use this emerging climate science to charge oil companies for disasters

Fossil fuel companies have cast doubt on attribution science. They also note that their production of oil and other products was done legally under U.S. and international regulations.
“Manufacturers will see this as a shakedown of any industry you don’t like at some point in the future, even though in the past they were licensed and operated under government regulation,” Brett Vassey, president and CEO of the Virginia Manufacturers Association, said during legislative testimony about a climate Superfund proposal in that state. “It will have a chilling effect on Virginia being able to grow its economy.”
Proponents of Superfund legislation point to legal settlements with large tobacco companies in the 1990s. Although those companies also sold their products legally, they were held responsible because they knew about the harmful effects of those products and deceived the public. Most climate Superfund proposals target companies for their emissions over the past 30 or so years, after leading experts had documented the dangers of greenhouse gases.
“There’s good documentation of how well the fossil fuel industry knew the probable long-term impacts of their product,” said Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat. “Should an industry that made such historic profits over a period of time and made so many representations that we had no problem not bear any of the costs?”
Golden and other lawmakers say it’s becoming impossible for taxpayers to cover the costs of recovery from wildfires and other catastrophes. In Rhode Island, sea level rise is causing massive damage for coastal communities, said Democratic state Rep. Jennifer Boylan, who has sponsored a climate Superfund bill to help the state adapt.
Some advocates also note that Trump’s return to the White House has cut off the possibility of federal climate relief.
“All the states are affected by the disappearance of this federal funding,” said Gallo, of the state lawmakers group. “States everywhere are going to be looking at some way to fill the gap.”
This session, climate Superfund bills have been introduced in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Virginia.
After a long slog, climate change lawsuits will finally put Big Oil on trial

While the bills are structured differently, they all seek to target the largest polluters — often covering companies that produced 1 billion metric tons of emissions over the last 30 or so years. Lawmakers say that applies to roughly 100 companies.
The measures also take different approaches to assigning damages. Some direct state agencies to conduct complex studies to determine the costs of climate-caused disasters over a certain period, the approach pioneered by Vermont. Others set a fixed number that represents a conservative baseline for those damages. New York’s law set that figure at $75 billion over a 25-year period.
Many of the bills also require that significant amounts of the funding be directed to the communities hit hardest by pollution.
Advocates are particularly optimistic about the measures in California and Maryland.
Lawmakers in Maryland modified their bills to commission a study about the financial impacts of climate change. Those measures passed both the House and Senate, and legislators are working to reconcile the versions from each chamber. Figures produced by the study would be the backbone of a climate Superfund policy in a future session.

“From a legislative perspective, it’s a shot in the dark as to what the costs are,” said Democratic Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo, who sponsored one of the bills. “This will give us the factual data needed to make a more well-educated decision on policy.”
In New Jersey, an Assembly committee advanced a climate Superfund bill this month. State Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee and who sponsored the bill, said it will help to rebuild and fortify water treatment plants, schools and firehouses. He noted that Trump has called for the dismantling of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“The end of the world is coming; it’s kind of hard to ignore,” Smith said. “FEMA has been the backstop to help communities recover from disasters. If the handwriting isn’t on the wall to all the states that they’ve got to deal with this, shame on them.”
Lawmakers in many states have heard from mayors and other local government leaders that more climate recovery funding is essential.
“Municipal officials are getting behind [climate Superfund policies],” said Massachusetts state Sen. Jamie Eldridge, a Democrat who has sponsored similar legislation. “They’re facing the costs of flooding, of droughts, of heat waves, and really asking for relief.”

But that would change under a bill that is now sitting on Gov. Brian [&#8230;],"This undated photo shows the death chamber at the Georgia Diagnostic Prison in Jackson, Ga. Photo by Georgia Department of Corrections/Getty ImagesGeorgia is the only state with the death penalty that requires defendants to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they are intellectually disabled to be spared execution – a high legal standard that no one charged with intentional murder has cleared.
But that would change under a bill that is now sitting on Gov. Brian Kemp’s desk that would lower the standard of proof. 
Advocates have pushed for the change for two decades, but a south Georgia lawmaker, Glennville Republican state Rep. Bill Werkheiser, was able to convince his colleagues that the state’s law was incompatible with the constitution’s prohibition against executing people who are intellectually disabled.
Werkheiser often pointed to a 2021 Georgia Supreme Court case where a judge wrote in a dissenting opinion that using the highest possible burden of proof increases the risk that someone with an intellectual disability is executed.
House Bill 123 lowers the standard of proof for proving someone has an intellectual disability to a preponderance of the evidence, ending Georgia’s outlier status as the only state that requires beyond a reasonable doubt. 
The measure also creates a pre-trial hearing where a judge would focus only on the question of whether the defendant is intellectually disabled. Today, a jury is determining whether a defendant is intellectually disabled at the same time they are hearing grisly details about the alleged crime and deciding the person’s guilt or innocence.
The bill was changed in the Senate to require 60 days of information sharing between the prosecution and defense before the newly created pretrial hearing. Prosecutors had fought the pretrial hearing, arguing it was adding another step in an already lengthy legal process.
And it also now requires defendants who prove they are intellectually disabled but are found guilty will be sentenced to life in prison or life without the possibility of parole. Defense attorneys and others opposed adding life without the possibility of parole as an option. 
“A life sentence in Georgia must be served for a minimum 30 years before a person can even be considered for parole, and that’s considered, not necessarily released,” Mazie Lynn Guertin, executive director and policy advocate with the Georgia Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said to lawmakers last month.
The bill sailed through the Senate Monday and was finalized by the end of the day in the House. The proposal also drew support from Catholic groups and a tag-team advocacy effort from the Georgia Council on Developmental Disabilities and Georgians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty. 
The Southern Center for Human Rights, which has long advocated for changes to Georgia’s law, celebrated the bill’s passage Monday and is already planning the party. 
“This change will put Georgia in line with twenty-six other states that have protections for people with intellectual disability,” said Terrica Redfield Ganzy, the center’s executive director. “We are deeply grateful to Chairman Werkheiser for his compassion and leadership on this issue. It is our honor to partner with him on this effort.”
Werkheiser, who chairs the House Industry and Labor Committee, has developed a special interest in the state’s prison system and the people involved in it, recently visiting all the state’s prisons. He sponsored a version of the bill last year that went nowhere and spent the last year working to work through reservations about the changes. 
He thanked House leadership and the lawmakers in the committees who spent time this session getting the bill done.
“There were so many advocacy groups that joined along the way that were not only encouraging, but provided assistance in so many ways. It was a team effort from so many,” Werkheiser said Monday.

Ron Watson (D-Prince George’s) points to the disparity in the coach-to-teacher ratio between school systems as proof that it is.","Sen. Ron Waston (D-Prince George's) served as the floor leader Monday for the bill to alter the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's sweeping education reform plan. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)For anyone thinking the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future is no longer needed, Sen. Ron Watson (D-Prince George’s) points to the disparity in the coach-to-teacher ratio between school systems as proof that it is.
Where Baltimore City has 43 teachers for every one instructional coach in the school system, for example, Baltimore County’s rate is 68 to 1, while Prince George’s County ratio of teachers to coaches is a staggering 276 to one.
“That should tell you something,” Watson said during Senate debate Monday. “There is a significant disparity about the equitable distribution” of coaches in the state.
His comments came as the full Senate debated the Blueprint, the state’s 10-year, multibillion-dollar education reform effort now in is third year. The Senate gave preliminary approval to its version of the plan Monday, after rejecting a series of Republican amendments to the bill during about 30 minutes of debate.
The Senate also advanced the House version of the bill, which it amended to make identical to its own — changes the House is likely to reject, setting the stage for a conference committee later this week to work out differences before the session ends Monday.
The House approved its version of the Blueprint reform bill earlier this month, rejecting cuts in per pupil funding and a four-year pause on teacher collaborative time, both elements of the bill proposed by Gov. Wes Moore (D).
Senate Bill 429, and the conformed House version, agrees with the governor on the collaborative time and per pupil funding provisions.
Like the House, which rejected Republican amendments to the bill in a vote earlier this month, the Senate on Monday also rejected amendments from three GOP lawmakers.
Tbe House amendments were all rejected on a roll call, but in the Senate on Monday, the first two Republicans’ amendments were rejected with a loud “No!” by some Democrats that cascaded throughout the chamber.
Sen. Jack Bailey (R-Calvert and St. Mary’s) offered slightly more than three pages of amendments that included a freeze for all increases of per pupil funding, and for the Accountability and Implementation Board (AIB) to develop metrics to measure student outcomes directly related to programs in the Blueprint. The AIB is charged with overseeing the multiyear school reform plan.

Sen. Mary Beth Carozza (R-Lower Shore) introduced two amendments, which were similar to those she presented unsuccessfully last week before her Education, Energy, and the Environment Committee.
Her amendments would have required the state Department of Education, in collaboration with the AIB, to convene “a certain” work group to study the long-term sustainability of the Blueprint. She also proposed the department and AIB convene a work group to not only study the Blueprint “based on its mandates and costs,” but also analyze overall public school funding on items such as health services, school security and transportation.
Sen. Jason Gallion (R-Harford and Cecil) sought to eliminate a new Academic Excellence Program, which was first presented by Gov. Wes Moore (D) in the bill known as the “Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act.”
The estimated $17 million program for next fiscal year includes the hiring of instructional coaches, who would work with teachers and administrations at schools with low-proficiency rates and declining achievement results in recent years.
Education officials told the Education, Energy and Environment Committee last week that up to 200 coaches would be needed in the next five years. The state currently has about 800, but 63% of them are in only five of the state’s 24 school systems.
“I think that’s not fiscally responsible,” said Gallion, who serves on that committee. “It was brought out that these coaches would make, like, $120,000 each. By my quick math, that would be two teachers for every coach that we could pay for by this funding.”
But Watson, who served as the floor leader on the bill, summarized the coach-to-teacher ratio in five counties:

 54 teachers to one coach in Anne Arundel;
43-to-1 in Baltimore City;
68-to-1 in Baltimore County;
79-to-1 in Montgomery; and
276-to-1 in Prince George’s County.

“The AIB is going to continue to make these decisions to ensure the fair and equitable distribution of these things that are going to close the achievement gap and help all of our students achieve,” he said.
The House and Senate will need to agree and pass identical bills by Monday, the last day of the legislative session.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sen.-Ron-Watson-3-31-2025-scaled-light-1024x670.jpg,,,2025-04-01 04:59:38.706526

Sears/Maryland Matters)Maryland Senate Republicans scored a victory in Monday’s budget debate, winning an amendment that dedicates a new per tire fee to state highways and bridges.
It was a rare win for the minority party in floor debate, as the Senate gave preliminary approval to a $67 billion budget for fiscal 2026 that includes a tax and fee package that will raise and estimated $1 billion.
While Republicans protested the new tire fee — $5 per tire — they were able to convince Democrats to dedicate the money specifically to state highway projects instead of the Transportation Trust Fund, which goes to transit as well as roads.
  Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore). (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)
“I think that was an amendment that did make a lot of sense,” said Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore). “You know, the $5 tire tax is new. They talked about it going to the Transportation Trust Fund. We just wanted to make sure that it actually goes to roads and bridges.”
On Monday night, Budget and Taxation Chair Sen. Guy Guzzone (D-Howard) stepped in before the amendment could be rejected by budget subcommittee leaders.
“I can see the nexus on this one, so I’m going to suggest we support this one,” Guzzone said, as he quickly called for a roll call vote.
Republicans in the House proposed nearly two dozen budget amendments during debate last week, none of which passed. Senate Republicans offered about half that number of amendments Monday.
Hershey said he couldn’t remember the last time a Republican amendment was adopted. He chalked it up to the differences between the House and Senate and, in part, to Senate Republicans voting for the budget in each of the last 10 years, including two under Gov. Wes Moore (D).
“So when you talk about it from that perspective, you know, eight years of Gov. [Larry] Hogan, the first two with Gov. Moore, when we were in a better fiscal climate, I think we respected the budget process, and because it didn’t have the tax increases associated with them, I mean, you saw the amount of amendments that we had, and the vote count was probably not what people would have expected.”
Hershey also noted that some Democrats — from what would be considered more purple districts — joined Republicans on a number of amendments. Included on that list were Anne Arundel County Democratic Sens. Dawn Gile and Shaneka Henson, Katie Hester Fry (D-Montgomery and Howard), Carl Jackson (D-Baltimore County) and Mary-Dulany James (Harford).
The Senate could take up a final vote on the two-bill budget package as early as Tuesday. From there, it will head to a conference committee where the House and Senate will hammer out a final agreement.
There’s no guarantee the Senate Republican amendment will survive conference committee.
“That’s the tough part,” said Hershey.”It’s easy sometimes to get an amendment — not easy to get an amendment passed, but sometimes you get an amendment passed here, and it still has to survive that.”
Hershey said he was hopeful that since the tire fee originated in the Senate, as did the Republican amendment, that the Senate would have to ability to retain the dedicated funding.

It’s part of an amended budget that Guzzone said erases a $3 billion projected structural deficit for the coming year. He said it also reduces a similar sized deficit projected for fiscal 2027 to just $300 million.
“This is really, in my opinion, all about the structural flow for the future. That’s what this budget is defined by,” Guzzone said.
Guzzone added that “that the impact of what we have done today, or what we will do today, will have a lasting effect, not just for (fiscal) ’26 but clearly in (fiscal) ’27 in a big way.”
The expectation is that the two chambers will make short work of a conference committee agreement. The House and Senate reached agreement on the vast majority of issues two weeks ago.
Some of that agreement was on an end result, even if the two chambers disagreed on the path. The tire fee is an example.
The House and Senate broadly agreed to the need for about $420 million in additional funding for the flagging Transportation Trust Fund.
The House plan called for increasing the sales tax on car sales from 6% to 6.8%.
The Senate instead called for a 6.5% car sales tax, phased in over two years, with the tax rising to 6.35% in the first year. The it added the $5 per tire fee, which would be on top of the 6% sales tax and a $1 per tire recycling fee that goes to the state Department of the Environment.
The Senate on Monday also approved trigger provisions meant to adjust state spending if revenues decrease.
Of primary concern are ongoing reductions in federal agencies and employees and overall spending, as well as tariffs on products including vehicles that pass through the Port of Baltimore.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
As part of that effort, the Senate replaced a proposed trigger tied to federal Medicaid reimbursements with one tied to overall federal aid. The amendment requires the Department of Budget and Management to track reductions in federal aid: When the amount reaches $1 billion, the department is to report to the legislature with plans for dealing with the reductions.
The amendment has a two-fold effect.
The first is to give lawmakers more input on budget actions during the interim, and it avoids immediate, direct cuts to Medicaid. Currently, the Board of Public Works can cut up to 25% of the budget without legislative approval.
Additionally, the monitoring and reporting requirement will help lawmakers better gauge when and if a special session is needed. Lawmakers, including Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) have said for weeks that a special session may be necessary in September or October as the federal budget year begins and the state gets updated revenue projections.
The Senate also added a number of provisions that would slow the pace of funding for the landmark Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reforms if revenues fall.
The first would slow funding if the Board of Revenue Estimates lowers revenue expectations at its December meeting by $850 million — roughly 3.75% — from its March projection.
Another comes if overall federal funding to the state decreases by $750 million.
If neither reaches their respective thresholds, funding could still slow down if revenue and federal funding drop by roughly $600 million combined.

Maryland has already seen a $300 million hit in education spending. Federal officials in a Friday evening letter notified the state it was pulling out the funding that the state had already spent. Guzzone said the money would likely have to be repaid in full if an attempt to seek a waiver fails.
The two chambers are also expected to add a second supplemental budget into the spending plan during the conference committee process. That supplemental from the governor is expected to contain nearly $100 million in additional spending reductions.
The Senate budget debate was faster than the House debate last week by nearly three hours. It was also, with an early exception, a more civil affair.
The debate appeared to be headed into heated partisan territory early, when Sen. Jim Rosapepe (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) compared early GOP amendments to slash-and-burn reductions at the federal level.
“It’s very clear this is the down payment on the Musk-Trump administration agenda,” Rosapepe said, noting a Republican amendment went after state employees, education and health care.
“It’s clearly going to get worse in Washington, but I, for am, going to stand against the Musk-Trump administration and what they do nationally, and stand against the same policies here in Maryland,” Rosapepe said. “We need to fight back, not roll over.”
It was a moment that potentially could have sparked a bitter debate as happened in the House.

Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Lower Shore) questioned whether the debate conformed to the chamber’s rules of decorum.
“If I were to accuse someone of doing something for another reason, that’s impugning my motives,” Mautz said. “And I think that was sort of a statement that we just heard, and I was wondering if there was a rule about that.”
Ferguson, speaking from the rostrum, said he had not initially considered the comment in the same way Mautz described.

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)An Arkansas Senate committee approved a bill Monday that would impose harsher penalties on undocumented migrants who commit “serious felony” crimes “involving violence” in the state.
But Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester, primary sponsor of Senate Bill 426, or the Defense Against Criminal Illegals Act, will be considered a second time by the Senate Judiciary Committee after the Cave Springs Republican amended it later on Monday to change the schedule of penalties outlined in the bill.
Under the version of SB 426 that passed committee Monday, undocumented migrants with initial charges of Class Y felonies — the most serious — would have faced two to 10 extra years of prison time. Felony charges under the lower four classes would have been upgraded one class. Some felonies also are unclassified.
The amended bill would create the following penalties for people “illegally or unlawfully in the United States” at the time of an offense:

A person convicted of a Class D felony, or an unclassified felony with no more than six years of prison time, would get up to four years added to the sentence
A person convicted of a Class A, B or C felony, or an unclassified felony with a prison sentence between six and 30 years, would get up to 10 years added to the sentence
A person convicted of a Class Y felony, or an unclassified felony with a prison sentence of longer than 30 years or life, would get up to 20 years added to the sentence.


SB426-S2 
SB 426 includes a list of violent felonies that would precipitate enhanced penalties, including first-degree and second-degree murder, rape, arson, terroristic acts and threatening, first-degree battery and aggravated assault, among other things.
The bill would also mandate that Arkansas law enforcement agencies participate in a federal program that deputizes them to help U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the apprehension and deportation of undocumented migrants held in local jails and state prisons.
The 287(g) program, specifically the Warrant Service Officer Program, authorizes participating agencies to serve administrative warrants under federal immigration law.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas opposes the bill because it “would divert local resources from public safety to federal law enforcement” and “prevents cities and counties from determining what is best” for their residents, policy director Sarah Everett told the Senate Judiciary Committee.
“We don’t feel that bills like this really do anything to help public safety,” said Everett, one of two people to speak against the bill. “I don’t think most people are doing a whole lot of math when they’re thinking about committing a crime. What we really need to be focusing on is preventing crime in the first place.”
 ‘All these gangs’

The sheriff’s offices in Craighead and Benton counties already have 287(g) cooperation agreements, according to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcements webpage. U.S. House Republicans have been vocally supportive of the program.
Local law enforcement officers would not be required to participate in the program until after they have someone arrested and in custody, Hester said in response to questions from the committee.
“We do not want to make this a place where violent criminals come,” Hester said. “We do not want to be a place where we’re seeing all these gangs start to move to.”
President Donald Trump’s administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court last week to allow the deportations of Venezuelans accused of gang ties to continue. Cracking down on illegal immigration, including with “mass deportations,” was a primary talking point of Trump’s reelection campaign last year.
Even sanctuary policies can’t stop ICE arrests

Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who was Trump’s press secretary during part of his first term, held a press conference earlier this month expressing support for the Defense Against Criminal Illegals Act, which she previously named as a policy priority during her State of the State address.
The bill would also expand the state’s ban on sanctuary cities, which signify a lack of cooperation with federal immigration authorities, and prohibit all local governments from adopting such policies, even in unincorporated areas. The state would withhold discretionary grants or other funds from any “local government that adopts or enacts a sanctuary policy” until the policy is repealed.
Similarly, Trump signed an executive order Jan. 20, his first day back in the White House, saying the federal government must withhold funds from sanctuary jurisdictions.
Sanctuary policies are largely symbolic and do not enable local officials to prevent ICE arrests, Stateline reported in February.
The Senate Judiciary Committee passed SB 426 with no audible dissent. The committee’s sole Democrat, Sen. Clarke Tucker of Little Rock, was absent during the discussion and vote.
 Taxpayer money and due process

Increasing the length of criminals’ incarceration does not prevent crime, Everett said, and she questioned how much SB 426 would cost taxpayers since incarceration itself costs money.

The Senate is set to vote Tuesday on a $750 million appropriation to begin construction of a new 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County that has generated frustration from lawmakers and Arkansans. The Sanders administration has said the prison is needed to address overcrowding in county jails.
Everett said SB 426 will have “unintended consequences.” Judiciary Committee chairman Sen. Alan Clark, R-Lonsdale, said “not controlling the border” between the U.S. and Mexico also has “unintended consequences.”
No members of the public spoke for the bill. Besides Everett, the other opponent of SB 426 was criminal defense attorney Jeff Rosenzweig, who said the bill lacks a strong enough definition of what makes an immigrant “illegal.”
The Trump administration has recently been canceling the visas and green cards of legal immigrants, Rosenzweig noted, and he said SB 426 could be improved by requiring authorities to provide notice to individuals whose legal status was revoked.
“You can be lawful one day and unlawful the next, depending on what some ICE agent or some Cabinet official or someone in between said,” Rosenzweig said.
He also noted that everyone on U.S. soil, not just U.S. citizens, is subject to due process and a jury trial if they face criminal charges.
Sen. Blake Johnson, R-Corning, said he disagreed with Rosenzweig’s suggestion to add a notification requirement to SB 426.
“It’s their job [as immigrants] to know whether they’re here legally or not,” Johnson said.
The Senate Judiciary Committee’s next meeting is scheduled for 10 a.m. Wednesday.

Among the lineup of speakers was Blake Hodgen, a Madonna participant who stole the show by relaying his educational, music therapy and job-training experiences since second grade at Madonna, which he and others said helped prepare him for his long-time catering job with the University of Nebraska Medical Center.
Pillen told the group he took aim at shortening the list, known also as the Developmental Disabilities Registry, because it didn’t make sense. 
“You break the glass if that’s what you have to do,” Pillen said. “But when the most vulnerable Nebraskans’ needs weren’t being met for eight years, (it) popped my top off.”
Eliminating the wait list, Pillen said, requires a roughly $40 million annual investment, with the state footing about $19 million each year and federal funds covering the rest. He foresees Nebraska becoming a model for other states with long waits to access developmental disabilities services — though advocates say they see some flaws, and they are still evaluating the full impact of changes.
At one time, Green said, the Nebraska registry listed 4,500 names.
 More immediate support 

Clearing the wait, he said, means that all the families will have been offered at least some specialized support through a Medicaid waiver program that lets states to tap federal funding for accessing home- and community-based services intended to keep people out of institutions.

Key to the list shrinkage, said Green, is a new approach that “meets families where they’re at” — providing for a more immediate and targeted service, such as funding for child or respite care or vehicle modification. Family advocates have said a family support waiver was created, for instance, as an intermediary solution that provides up to $10,000 a year for such services.
In the old system, Green said a family would put their name on the registry and wait as long as eight years to get what is known as a “comprehensive” developmental waiver — which is more costly but provides access to a wider array of services, including full-time residential services outside the home, particularly for adults. 
Green said not all families require such a gamut, and state officials believe that the overall needs of the population are better met by providing more narrow services closer to when a family needs them. 
Also new and crucial, he and advocates said, is that the state now allows youths with disabilities access to medical care through Medicaid — even if their household income is beyond typical Medicaid limits.
Said Green: “What we’re working on now is a system that says, ‘What’s your need that’s being unmet?’ And we’ll figure out which waiver has the right service and supports for you. I would say it’s a continuum of care … It will be individualized to the family and child.”
 ‘Misses the mark’

Edison McDonald is executive director of The Arc of Nebraska, the state’s largest membership organization for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families. He said the state’s new approach takes positive steps, including the Medicaid expansion that helps ensure that kids with developmental disabilities get access to health care.

However, he cited drawbacks. For example, he said, the often lengthy wait used to be a pathway to guaranteed access to comprehensive services including the out-of-home residential services. That is no longer the case, McDonald said. 
“They call it innovation when really it is barring a lot of people from that access to residential services. In some cases, it misses the mark and can potentially be harmful,” he said.
McDonald said the comprehensive service option is still available, but for adults with the highest needs such as being homeless or being a danger to themself. He said advocates are still trying to grasp the breadth of the impact the changes will bring.

McDonald said what advocates thought was an “intermediary” solution — the family support waiver offering up to $10,000 of services annually — appears possibly to be more of a “destination.” He also said the state’s system includes what advocates view as an outdated rate schedule for service providers.
Alana Schriver, executive director of Nebraska Association of Service Providers, applauded the Pillen administration’s commitment overall. But she worries about the state rates allowed for service providers. Without better wages for more workers, she said, “this whole conversation is moot.”
“If there is nobody to serve the people, what are we doing?”

Board of Education President Joshua Michale, left, listens. (File photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The U.S. Department of Education told states Friday that it was canceling previous approvals to spend down remaining COVID-19 recovery funds, a change that could mean $418 million to the Maryland Department of Education.
The change was announced in a letter from U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon that was dated Friday at 5 p.m., and said the decision to cancel the pandemic funding was effective — Friday at 5 p.m.
“Shock does not begin to describe our reaction when we received the notification late Friday evening,” Maryland State Superintendent Carey Wright said Monday. “This jeopardizes over $400 million in funding.”
Wright called the federal agency’s decision “catastrophic,” nothing that the money has already been spent or at least committed to the state’s 24 school systems. She said the money is being used for tutoring, reading materials, after-school programming, even some construction projects such as repairs for heating and air conditioning units, among others.
State officials said about $305.2 million has already been spent but not reimbursed by the federal department. Another $112.8 million is in “encumbered” funds not paid out by the state, which means school systems must immediately stop any ongoing work on capital projects, or educational programs.
“It may be a tutoring program that’s going on right now in schools that was intended to go through this school year, or it might be an improvement to a health room in a school,” said state Board of Education President Joshua Michael. “There’s going to be significant disruption.”

Officials said it remains unclear if the state would need to cover costs for ongoing programs, or if the local school systems may have to return any money already spent.
“The federal government is breaking the trust that it has once held strong with states across America,” Michael said.
School officials said they are consulting with the Office of the Attorney General on the possibility of filing suit against the federal department.
“I think it’s fair to say that we are exploring all legal options at this time given the severity of this action,” Michael said.
He said the majority of the money comes from the American Rescue Plan’s Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief, or ARP ESSER, program.
The state last year requested and received approval for an extension on how it would draw down the ESSER funds it  had left over. Wright said the state sought extensions because of supply chain issues and construction delays.
The approval was given before a Jan. 28 deadline set by former President Joe Biden (D) before he left office that month. But in her letter Friday, McMahon dismissed the approvals by the previous administration.
“The extension approval was issued recently, so any reliance interests developed are minimal,” McMahon wrote. “Moreover, an agency may reconsider its prior decision. So you could not rely on the Department adhering to its original decision. That is especially true because the extension was a matter of administrative grace.”
She said that extending deadlines to allocate “COVID-related grants … years after the COVID pandemic ended is not consistent with the Department’s priorities and thus not a worthwhile exercise of its discretion.”
But McMahon also wrote the department would reconsider funding for states if the could explain “how a particular project’s extension is necessary to mitigate the effects of COVID on American students’ education, and why the Department should exercise its discretion to grant your request.”
Wright said ending the program at 5 p.m. Friday and offering to consider appeals from states “seemed to be contradictory,” but she said her department plans to send a letter to justify why money for Maryland is necessary.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
A U.S. department spokesperson said that specific projects would be assessed if funds are used directly to mitigate the effects of COVID-19.
“COVID is over. States and school districts can no longer claim they are spending their emergency pandemic funds on ‘COVID relief’ when there are numerous documented examples of misuse,” said Madi Biedermann in a statement Monday afternoon.
“The Biden Administration established an irresponsible precedent by extending the deadline for spending the COVID money far beyond the intended purpose of the funds, and it is past time for the money to be returned to the people’s bank account,” Biedermann’s statement said.
In part because of the Education Department’s decision, the Maryland Senate approved an amendment to a budget bill Monday that would require the governor’s budget team to track federal cuts and, if they hit $1 billion, recommend state spending cuts to the General Assembly’s Legislative Policy Committee.
“If we have a $1 billion problem from combined actions by the federal government, we would begin a process of review through our policy committee, and work with the governor to come up with solutions,” said Sen. Guy Guzzone (D-Howard), chair of the Budget and Taxation Committee. “We have to be wide-eyed open about what could be happening because it is happening.”
Sen. Chris West (R-Baltimore and Carroll) asked if any recommendations that may come from the policy committee would be for the legislature next year.

The decision by U.S. District Judge Susan Baxter is the latest in a series on Act 77, which gave voters the option of voting by mail without an excuse for not going to the polls in person for the first time in 2020. It’s also the second time Baxer has found the law impermissibly disenfranchises voters.
People who choose to vote by mail are required to complete a declaration including the date on the outside of the envelope provided to return their ballots. But voters often forget the date or write a date unrelated to the election, such as their birthdate. Such mistakes have caused tens of thousands of ballots to be disqualified even when they’re returned on time. They often form the basis to challenge mail ballots in close elections.
In a lawsuit by the national Democratic congressional and senate campaign committees and the American Federation of Teachers against Pennsylvania’s 67 county boards of elections, Baxter found the requirement serves no compelling government interest and doesn’t justify infringing on voters’ First Amendment rights.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
She found no evidence to support “nebulous” claims by Republican groups that intervened in the case that the date requirement bolsters voter confidence or preserves the solemnity of voting. While preventing voter fraud is less ambiguous, there’s also no evidence the date requirement serves that purpose, Baxter said.
“Since there is no evidence that the date requirement serves any state interest, even a slight burden on voting rights cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny,” she wrote. “Put another way, even the slightest burden that results from the enforcement of the date provision is too much when there is no counterbalance.”
Calls to attorneys for the Republican National Committee were not returned Monday. 
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Viet Shelton said the ruling was a “victory for free and fair elections, protecting Pennsylvanians’ constitutional right to participate in our democracy.”
“It’s also a reminder that while Republicans continue their efforts to disenfranchise voters across the country, Democrats are ready to fight everywhere to ensure every legal vote is counted,” Shelton said.
Last year, Baxter, who is a Trump appointee, ruled in a separate lawsuit the date requirement violated the Materiality Clause of the federal Civil Rights Act, which bans rules that prevent people from voting over meaningless errors on election paperwork. The U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Baxter’s decision, finding the provision applies only when the state is determining who may vote and not to “rules, like the date requirement, that govern how a voter must cast his ballot for it to be counted.”
The date requirement has also been the subject of a web of state court decisions that have, so far, failed to resolve whether the rule violates the Pennsylvania Constitution. In a case last October, the state Supreme Court declined to rule on the issue with the Nov. 5 presidential election less than 30 days away,citing the risk of confusion a change in the rules might cause.
In each of the prior cases, the evidence established that counties stamp ballots with the date and time they are received to document that they arrived before the Election Day deadline.
The Supreme Court in January agreed to hear an appeal in a case from Philadelphia challenging the disqualification of mail-in ballots in a special election for the state House. The lower Commonwealth Court ruled just before the Nov. 5 election that the date rule violates the state constitution.

In her decision, Baxter noted the right to free expression at issue was separate from the “core political speech” protected under the First Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court established a test to determine whether rules that infringe on political expression via the ballot are constitutional. That test balances whether the infringement is justified by an interest in orderly elections.
“The commonwealth has not identified what specific regulatory interest is furthered. Indeed, despite formal notification, the commonwealth has not defended the constitutionality of the dating requirement,” Baxter said, noting that most of the county boards of elections had not identified an interest in enforcing the date requirement.

(Photo by George Frey/Getty Images)The fallout from the Trump administration’s move to claw back about $11 billion in public health funding as part of federal budget cuts targeting COVID-19 response grants has hit Utah. 
Dozens of public health employees in Utah’s state and local health departments will lose their jobs after roughly $100 million in Utah grants were cut short — ending funding nearly two years earlier than expected. 
Last week, the Utah Department of Health and Human Services received “unexpected notification” from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that some COVID-related grants stemming from the American Rescue Plan Act had ended effective immediately, state health department officials said in a news release issued Friday. 
Across the Utah health department, six grants were cut short, totaling about $98 million that remained before the grant period that was supposed to have ended at the close of 2026. The grants, according to the department, funded “public health functions and behavioral health services.” 
Out of its roughly 6,000 employees, the Utah health department said it had 187 staff positions “funded partially or completely by the impacted funds.” Many of the positions were temporary, but on Friday state department officials announced more than three dozen state workers will lose their jobs. 
“Unfortunately, we had to announce today an early reduction of 37 staff in positions funded by these specific COVID-related grants,” the Utah Department of Health and Human Services said. “These staff positions will end April 11.”

Tracy Gruber, director of Utah’s health department, called those employees who were laid off “public health heroes.” 
“We are sorry to see these positions end early,” Gruber said in a statement. “We consider them all public health heroes, many of whom joined our department when we needed to ramp up operations to keep Utahns safe during the global pandemic. These staff came in to serve the public at an incredibly difficult time.” 
In an email sent to staff on Friday, department officials said the funds had allowed Utah to “perform critical functions during the pandemic, including purchasing vaccines, engaging in wastewater testing, and providing critical behavioral health services.” 
After the pandemic ended, the federal government extended the funds to “retain critical capacity in public health systems across the country and ameliorate the impacts of COVID-19,” the staff email continued. “Like other states, Utah continued utilizing these funds as we evaluated our long-term strategy to retain this critical capacity.” 
However, “the federal government terminated these funds early,” it continued. 
“This was not entirely unexpected, but the timing was,” state health department leaders said in the staff email. “The majority of this funding was set to be expended by the end of 2026 so the department was preparing for this funding to end.”
The “lack of warning” from the early cut off is “causing some challenges,” in the health department as it continues its work, the email said, “but we know the staff and our external partners bear the real stress and fear of the sudden decisions by our federal partners.”
“This sudden action is disappointing and not what we would expect from our partners,” the staff email added. 
State health officials added that in the days leading up to Friday’s announcement, they had been analyzing the impact and waiting to see if the decision would be reversed, but by the end of the week they said the funds were, in fact, being terminated. 
The state health department also warned that it continues to evaluate the impact of the cuts, and warned “it is possible we will need to make additional staff reductions. We anticipate making that decision in the very near future.” 
Impacts reach beyond COVID-19
When federal officials made the announcement last week, they characterized the grants as no longer needed and wasting taxpayer money.
“The COVID-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago,” the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement, the Associated Press reported. 
Carrie Butler, executive director at the Utah Public Health Association, said the impacts of the federal funds ran far deeper than COVID-19 — they helped “strengthen the public health infrastructure workforce” after years of being underfunded. 
“That is something that is really important and critical for people to understand, that a majority of (Utah’s public health funding) comes from federal grant money,” Butler said. 
She said the federal cuts will impact Utah’s public health system as a whole, including programs focused on proactive or preventative health programs meant to help keep the state’s population healthy and “resilient” ahead of the next public health disaster. 



Let us know what you think...


 


“When the pandemic hit, it hit at a time when we were underfunded (for) disease mitigation,” or programs meant to reduce preventable health issues, she said. “Then when the pandemic hit and we got all of these extra ARPA funds, we were able to build back a little bit of our infrastructure.” 
From immunization programs, to diabetes prevention and smoking cessation, Butler said Utah was able to make progress to help make its population healthier, but now with those federal funds drying up early, she said those efforts will become more difficult. 
“While we knew (the funds) were temporary, we also had planned them all out to create and finish the programs and infrastructure,” she said. But now, “there’s a significant amount of sunk cost.”  
Butler said the Utah Public Health Association also had to lay off one employee that was working on building a community health worker certification process. She said that the program was slated to be finished by June. Now, she said “we are going to try our best” to use volunteer hours to finish the program on time. 
“We’re going to try to get it done,” she said. “We are used to being scrappy. But it also means there are a lot of gaps that wouldn’t otherwise exist if we were adequately funded.” 
Butler added that public health workers are also dealing with continued anxiety over what could come next — including the likelihood there are more federal funds on the chopping block. 
“We’re all a little bit nervous about what this means for future funding and for public health infrastructure,” she said. “By no stretch of the imagination do any of us think that this is the end of the cuts.” 
More laid off from local health departments 
At least 32 workers have been laid off from some of Utah’s 13 local health departments — most of which come from Utah’s most populated county. 
The biggest number will come from Salt Lake County, whose health department will lay off 17 employees in epidemiology, nursing, community health and communications workers, according to the department’s spokesperson Nic Rupp. 
“It’s a devastating blow to our workforce,” Rupp said, adding that the news left some in the county’s offices “in tears” last week. “It’s not just folks who are losing their jobs, although of course they are the most impacted. But it’s everyone around them. It’s a work family.” 


Local health department layoffs
Salt Lake County Health Department: 17
Bear River Health Department (Box Elder, Cache and Rich County): 5 
Southwest Utah Health Department (Beaver, Garfield, Iron, Kane, Washington counties): 5 
Southeast Utah Health Department (Carbon, Emery, Grand counties): 2
Tooele County Health Department: 3 positions impacted, but will be kept on until December
Davis County Health Department: Still evaluating
Utah County Health Department: No layoffs 
Central Utah Public Health Department (Juab, Millard, Piute, Sevier, Wayne, Sanpete counties): No layoffs
Weber-Morgan Health Department: No layoffs 
Wasatch County Health Department: No layoffs
San Juan County: No layoffs
Summit County and the Tricounty Health Department (Uintah, Daggett, Duchesne counties): Did not immediately respond to a request for comment


Public health workers have “been through a lot together,” Rupp said, adding that “most of these folks have been with us for many years.”
“They genuinely care about their work. They genuinely care about Salt Lake County, and it’s really tragic that they’re not going to be able to continue doing what they love and what they’re good at,” Rupp said. 
He added the Salt Lake County Health Department will continue its work — just with fewer people.
“Collectively, it is a significant loss,” he said. “We in public health will continue to do what we need to to protect community and environmental health in Salt Lake County, but losing these 17 public health professionals doesn’t change the amount of work. … It just means there’s going to be the same amount of work spread across fewer experts.” 
Rupp said these Salt Lake County employees in many cases worked in public health for years. “They are investigating diseases. They’re immunizing children. They’re connecting community members to health resources. And they’re communicating about health topics to the public,” he said. 
While the COVID-19 grants were expected to eventually expire, “the fact that it was an immediate and early end to funds that had been promised to us for another year, in most cases, that is especially challenging,” Rupp said. 
Some of the Salt Lake County workers that will be laid off had expected to finalize certain projects on a defined timeline, “and this change upsets that plan,” Rupp said, though he added Salt Lake County is “working to pivot some additional funding so we can at least appropriately wrap up these projects.”
He also said county officials are working to at least give the 17 workers 30-days notice “so we can appropriately wind down projects, transfer responsibilities, (and) figure out the best way to respond to this.” 
Rupp said Salt Lake County lost roughly $6 million in grants. Later Monday, after county finance officials met to determine next steps, Rupp said county leaders are looking to use about $350,000 in funding from other grants in order to keep the 17 impacted county employees on for about two to 12 weeks, “depending on (their) position and how long we expect it will take to conclude the position’s projects.” 
The Bear River Health Department (which serves Box Elder, Cache and Rich Counties) laid off five people, and their last day was Friday, according to department spokesperson Estee Hunt. She said the layoffs included people working in epidemiology, front office staff, and community health workers. 
“Of course it’s sad,” Hunt said. “We hate to lose our colleagues. It didn’t decrease the amount of work that we have to do, it just meant that the work is going to be spread out among fewer public health professionals. So it’s definitely tricky.” 
The Southwest Utah Health Department (which covers Beaver, Garfield, Iron, Kane and Washington counties), also laid off five community health workers, according to spokesperson David Heaton. 
The Southeast Utah Health Department (which includes Carbon, Emery and Grand counties), laid off two community health workers. The department’s spokesperson, Brittany Garff, said they were given a “couple of weeks” notice. 
“We’re rural, we’re small,” Garff said, adding it will “definitely impact our entire department. We will of course make every effort to cover where they helped the community, but it definitely will be a difficult transition to lose them.”

The Tooele County Health Department said three staff members were impacted by the sudden cut off, impacting three staff members in the county’s Division of Population Health. However, county officials said in an email that “we identified alternative short-term funding to sustain the affected positions until the end of December 2025 and notified the staff members.” 
“This approach will give us time to seek more sustainable funding for the important work our Division of Population Health does around epidemiology, data analysis, community engagement, and health strategy in ways that support the whole health department and county,” Tooele County officials said, though they added, “We are mindful of other health departments throughout the state who have been impacted by these federal funding cuts.”
The Davis County Health Department is still evaluating its impacts, according to spokesperson Trevor Warner. 
“We knew that this funding was going to come to an end, but we didn’t expect it to be this quickly,” he told Utah News Dispatch in a text message. “At this time, we are still evaluating things. We expect an impact because of the funding cuts, but we just don’t know the scale yet.”
The Utah County Health Department won’t have any layoffs, according to spokesperson Aislynn Tolman-Hill, who noted that it had not used federal funding related to COVID-19 since early 2024. 
“Utah County Health Department stopped using all COVID-related funding at the beginning of 2024,” Tolman-Hill said in an email. “Utah County as a whole made a concerted effort not to rely on COVID funds moving forward from early 2024, and the health department followed suit.”
The Central Utah Public Health Department (which includes Juab, Millard, Piute, Sevier, Wayne, Sanpete counties), the Weber-Morgan, Wasatch, and the San Juan health departments all told Utah News Dispatch they have not implemented any layoffs at this time related to the federal cuts, though some job responsibilities had to be “realigned.” 
Officials at Summit County and the Tricounty Health Department (which covers Uintah, Daggett and Duchesne counties) did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch ) CEDAR RAPIDS  — A federal judge heard oral arguments Monday for a case that could overturn a decades-old statute tying wetland conservation to federal farm benefit eligibility. 
The plaintiff CTM Holdings, which owns and rents land to Iowa farmers, sued over the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s “swampbuster” law, alleging its implementation is unconstitutional, and that it takes land without any compensation to landowners.
The government defendants and intervening environmental groups argued against CTM and alleged the company had no standing as it had not suffered any injury from the statute.
Chief Judge C.J. Williams, for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa, questioned if the whole issue was a “failure to communicate” between the landowner and Natural Resources Conservation Service, which carries out the swampbuster rule. 
The case, CTM Holdings v. U.S. Department of Agriculture, pertains to a 9-acre portion of land in Delaware County which was designated a wetland by NRCS prior to the company’s purchase of the land.

The company wanted to cut down trees and remove stumps from the wetland area, which it alleges is dry land, for the purpose of farming. 
CTM Holdings, represented by the nonprofit litigation groups Liberty Justice Center and Pacific Legal Foundation, argue the Wetland Conservation Compliance provisions of the 1985 Farm Bill, often referred to as “swampbuster,” unconstitutionally puts conditions on a farmer’s ability to receive farm credits. Additionally, the group holds that farmers are not properly compensated for these wetland easements.  
Iowa Farmers Union, Dakota Rural Action, Food & Water Watch, and Iowa Environmental Council were approved as intervenors in the case, on behalf of USDA and NRCS, in December 2024. 
The groups argued that overturning the swampbuster rule would “threaten” their members and communities by removing wetland conservation practices from neighboring farmland. 
A miscommunication?
Loren Seehase on behalf of CTM Holdings argued the company requested a “redetermination” by NRCS of the wetland portion of the land in 2023, but that it’s “near impossible” to get the agency to reevaluate its ruling. 
The lawsuit holds NRCS “exceeds the statutory definition” by only considering a redetermination if a “natural event alters the topography or hydrology” of the land or if the agency agrees it made an error in its  initial determination. 
Brandon Gray, on behalf of USDA, former Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, NRCS and other government officials named in the complaint, said the company did not request a redetermination of the wetland. Gray said the action in 2023 dealt with a different portion of the 72-acre parcel that had not yet been determined, though he agreed the letters from NRCS were “confusing.”
Judge Williams wondered if this was just a misunderstanding between CTM and the regulating agency. 
Jim Conlan, owner of CTM Holdings, with over 1,000 acres of land in Iowa, said the opposing counsel was “very creative” with this argument and holds that he did apply for a redetermination of the wetland. 
Seehase, Conlan’s attorney, said it is “disingenuous” for the government to say NRCS did a “piecemeal” determination in 2023 rather than examining the whole property. 
Compensation
Seehase said CTM “has and will continue to suffer” under swampbuster because the 9 acres of the parcel cannot be rented.
The lawsuit also holds that the landowner should be compensated for the wetland acreage that cannot be farmed. Seehase said there should be a program for wetlands like the Conservation Reserve Program, which pays farmers to keep sensitive land in long-term vegetative covers. 
Dani Replogle, staff attorney with the environmental group Food & Water Watch, one of the intervenors, said this argument doesn’t “have a leg to stand on.” 
“The compensation is clearly the farm benefits that swampbuster provides access to,” Replogle said. 
These farm benefits include crop insurance and other important farming subsidies distributed by USDA.
Judge Williams asked if it was “coercive” on behalf of the government to condition these funds.
Gray, for USDA, said swampbuster does not stop property owners from doing what they want to the land. He said the fact that government subsidies are “a good deal” for farmers doesn’t mean it’s coercive. 
He said the conditions follow Congress’ directive to ensure government spending is for the “general welfare.”
Kathleen Garvey, on behalf of the intervenors, said there are also “myriad” exemptions from swampbuster, including a farmer’s ability to drain and farm over a wetland by purchasing a mitigation credit. 
Garvey said ruling in favor of the plaintiff would “radically curtail” Congress’ power and “drastically change” farm policy. 
She said CTM Holdings has not suffered injury from the issue, and said the company actually profited from a lower purchase price of the land, the sale of timber on the wetland portion and it has maintained consistent farming tenants.
Jeffery McCoy, with Pacific Legal Foundation on behalf of CTM Holdings, said the injury is in the government’s “ask” to “waive a constitutional right” to receive benefits. 
“Farmers need crop insurance,” McCoy said. 
Seehase said “it’s really not a choice” for a farmer to forgo their farm benefits. CTM Holdings is eligible for farm benefits, which Conlan said are passed on to his tenants in return for a higher lease price.
Plaintiffs also argued the NRCS definition of altering a wetland exceeds the statute set by Congress. 
The law holds that filling, draining, leveling, clearing woody vegetation or diverting run-off water are all actions considered to alter a wetland for the purpose of agriculture use. 
Gray, on behalf of the government, said just because the statute and the agency rules are different, does not automatically mean the intent is also different. 
Gray said it is the agency’s job to define a statute to make it applicable.  
Change in swampbuster would have lasting implications 
According to a study from the Union of Concerned Scientists, wetlands provide protection from residential flood damages that equal nearly $23 billion annually. Wetlands in Iowa alone have the potential to mitigate $477 million, annually, in flood damage according to the study. 
The same study approximates there are more than 640,000 acres of wetlands in Iowa, though the Iowa Department of Natural Resources estimates the state has lost 95% of what were once wetlands, the majority of which were drained for agricultural uses. 
Defendants of swampbuster feel that without the law, wetlands across the country would be drained. 
“The impacts of us losing the case would be that federal farm benefits would be open to any farmer or holding company or corporate landowner that wanted to just destroy all the ecosystems on their property and farm every acre,” Replogle, one of the intervening attorneys, said.
Replogle said the lawsuit would have implications on quite a few federal farm credit programs that have eligibility requirements, especially on a similar statute, known as “sodbuster” which protects highly erodible land from being farmed. 
Replogle said there is “no limiting principle” in CTM Holdings’ case that would prevent sodbuster from being ruled unconstitutional along with swampbuster. 
Judge Williams said he will take the oral arguments into advisory and issue judgment at a later date. 
Both parties said they would appeal the case if the judge rules against them.

State Republican leaders say the fire early Sunday morning was politically motivated arson. According to Albuquerque Fire Rescue, the blaze occurred a little before 6 a.m., causing damage to the front entryway and smoke damage throughout the building. No one was injured and the fire was extinguished within five minutes, according to AFR. 
The cause is being investigated, AFR and Republican leaders said. 
The FBI and ATF are investigating, according to AFR and Republican officials. As of Monday afternoon, no search warrants had been filed, according to a Source New Mexico review of federal court records.
Along with the fire damage, someone stenciled “ICE=KKK” in red spray paint on the side of the building. The stencil was partially covered with plywood before the news conference Monday afternoon. 
The news conference came after a day of sniping between Democrats and Republicans over who is to blame for the deterioration of political discourse here. 
Republicans cited a Santa Fe town hall meeting Saturday when U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-N.M.) called on attendees to “agitate” as part of a strategy to combat President Donald Trump’s agenda, along with “legislate” and “litigate.” The party also circulated a fundraising appeal with the headline “They tried to silence us.”
The Democratic Party of New Mexico condemned the alleged arson but said Republicans were “maliciously and falsely” claiming the congresswoman’s call for political organizing amounted to incitement of violence.

“Nothing could be further from the truth,” Chair Jessica Velasquez said in a statement. 
The New Mexico Democrats statement also cited the recent conviction of Solomon Peña, a failed Republican state House candidate, for shooting up the homes of prominent Democratic lawmakers. (No one was injured.)
Asked Monday afternoon whether the Republican party overreacted by blaming Leger Fernandez’s town hall meeting, Sen. Bill Sharer (R-Farmington), the New Mexico Senate minority leader, said he wished to take the temperature down. 
“What I’m looking for right now is to tone down the rhetoric by everybody. Calm down,” he said. “Because somebody’s going to get hurt.”
Multiple speakers sought to link the alleged arson to what they say is out-of-control crime, adding it to a list with the March 21 mass shooting in Las Cruces, plus murders and carjackings. 
“This attack is a symptom of something far larger,” said Amy Barela, chair of the Republican Party of New Mexico. “A growing wave of emboldened, unchecked crime across our state.”
A report last summer by the Legislative Finance Committee found that violent crime in Bernalillo County has plateaued since 2017. 
Right after the final gavel of the 60-day legislative session, Republican leaders called on Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to call lawmakers back for a special session focused on increasing criminal penalties.

Two teachers and two students were killed and multiple students were injured. Megan Varner/Getty ImagesA bill that sets up new security protocols that are intended to prevent another school shooting in Georgia is now in the governor’s hands.
The 57-page proposal is a priority for House Speaker Jon Burns this year. When the measure came back to the House for a final vote Monday, it was missing some key elements from an earlier version such as a student database meant to help school districts communicate but that raised concerns that it would stigmatize students and hurt their future opportunities.
Burns, along with Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, issued a joint statement Monday celebrating the bill’s passage. In September, a 14-year-old accused gunman killed two students and two teachers at Apalachee High School in Barrow County and injured nine others.
The bill, sponsored by Winder Republican Rep. Holt Persinger, attempts to address what is seen as a communication lapse that preceded the shooting. The year before the shooting, Colt Gray was interviewed by law enforcement regarding threatening social media posts targeting another school in Jackson County – information that did not follow Gray to Barrow County. 
The measure would require districts to transfer a student’s records to a new district within five days, and it would set up a statewide alert system about potential threats to schools. 
Cowsert said the bill also attempts to target the common denominator of many of the school shootings nationwide: mental health. The proposal creates “qualified student advocacy specialists” who will focus on identifying troubled students and connecting them with mental health services, and it requires students to participate in training for suicide awareness and youth violence prevention.
The Senate also added another bill that would require all public schools to install a panic button system. Apalachee High School had issued panic buttons to its teachers a week before the shooting and that is credited with helping law enforcement respond quickly to the campus.
The bill also increases penalties for terroristic acts, and it would treat children between ages 13 to 17 as adults when they face charges for terroristic acts at school, attempted murder and aggregate aggravated assault if committed with a firearm. 
“That is beyond just school safety,” said Sen. RaShaun Kemp, an Atlanta Democrat who voted against the bill. “So, this could capture, for example, a kid who has been wrapped up in a gang, and their lives could be drastically changed as a result of this.” 
Democrats have pressed for legislation requiring safe gun storage in the wake of the shooting. But a House bill that was originally designed to encourage safe gun storage is now limited to firearm training and includes a controversial tax break on firearm purchases. 
Sen. Elena Parent, an Atlanta Democrat who has filed a bill requiring safe firearm storage, floated an amendment Monday that called for distributing information on gun safety through the school systems. Parent withdrew the proposal after Cowsert said he would join forces with her to do that as a separate measure. 
Parent said her proposal takes a cue from Texas, although lawmakers there mandated safe storage after the Robb Elementary School shooting in 2022.
“It’s simply an education piece,” Parent said of her proposal. “It’s not unlike the violence and suicide prevention pieces of (House Bill 268). I view it as a no-downside way to try to make our kids and our schools a bit safer.”

(Photo by Kevin Winter / Getty Images)A New Mexico judge on Monday blocked access to public records clearly showing the bodies of actor Gene Hackman or his wife classical pianist Betsy Arakawa-Hackman, who were found dead in their home outside Santa Fe in February, but is allowing the release of many other investigative documents.
Julia Peters, who handles the Hackmans’ estates, on March 11 asked the court to block the county and state Office of the Medical Investigator from releasing “any and all photographic evidence, video evidence, and body cam footage” they gathered in investigating their deaths, along with any autopsy reports and death investigation reports. 
The court on March 17 temporarily shielded those records from publication while the parties prepared for Monday’s hearing.
Attorney Kurt Sommer on Monday argued on Peters’ behalf that the Hackmans would not want their privacy invaded by having their tragic deaths “exploited by the press.” He also said their right to control their names and likeness didn’t go away when they died, that disclosing the records would violate their right to privacy under the U.S. Constitution, and that it would run the risk of allowing potential burglars to more easily steal from the home.
“The disclosure of the videos is simply another way of circumventing the control the estate should retain as the Hackmans did during their lifetime,” Sommer said. “The request for the video cam is nothing more than a backdoor exposure of the Hackmans’ lifestyle that could not be attained by the press during their lifetime.”
County Attorney Walker Boyd argued that the Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA) did not give the county government “any discretion” to deny requests to inspect the public records created when sheriff’s deputies searched the Hackmans’ home.
“The court’s recognition of a potential privacy right to preclude disclosure of these records creates not only administrative difficulty for the county,” Boyd said. “How does the county comply with that right going forward?”
First Judicial District Court Judge Matthew Wilson, however, allowed the release of videos depicting the Hackmans’ bodies, so long as they are blurred. He also allowed the release of autopsy reports, and any photos or videos showing the inside of the Hackmans’ home or of their dead dogs.

Scot Sauder, deputy university counsel for the University of New Mexico that houses the Office of the Medical Investigator, said that while autopsy photos are public records, “the OMI has long believed that those autopsy photographs are incredibly invasive, are very much disturbing and can be quite traumatic and embarrassing to family and their kin.”
Wilson also allowed release of any audio containing descriptions of their bodies.
Criminal defense attorney Dan Cron, who testified as an expert witness for the Hackman estate, said lapel cameras record audio and while he hasn’t reviewed the records in this case, he would expect them to contain an audio description of what the deputies were experiencing as they searched the Hackmans’ home.
Gregory MacKenzie, the attorney for Christopher, Elizabeth and Leslie Allen Hackman, said the Hackman children’s primary concern was the release of video or audio describing their father’s dead body.
“There’s no limit to the trauma that could cause my clients for years to come,” he said.
The New Mexico Legislature in 2023 amended the state Inspection of Public Records Act to allow the government to redact otherwise public records if they depict dead bodies or great bodily harm, unless a police officer is suspected of having caused the harm.
Wilson allowed CBS News and the Associated Press to intervene in the case. Gregory Williams, attorney for the media outlets, argued that New Mexico law says that a person’s right to privacy ends at their death.
“No such right exists in New Mexico in a way that trumps IPRA, and if it did, the entities before the court don’t possess privacy rights necessary to overcome that,” Williams said.
Wilson ruled that Hackman’s children and Arakawa-Hackman’s mother have a right to privacy over images depicting their loved ones’ death scenes, found in the 14th amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
Wilson relied on prior court rulings in California and Washington that the publication of any death scene photographs would violate a family’s due process rights, and said permanently blocking Santa Fe County from publishing them in this case is a reasonable way to prevent that happening to the Hackmans.
Wilson ruled from the bench on Monday afternoon after a three-hour hearing.
Hackman won numerous Academy awards during an acting career that spanned decades. Susan Madore, Hackman’s publicist for the last 27 years, testified via Zoom that he moved to Santa Fe because it offered relative anonymity compared to Los Angeles.
The Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office found the Hackmans’ bodies in their home outside of Santa Fe on Feb. 26. Investigators found Arakawa-Hackman, 65, died from the rodent-borne hantavirus pulmonary syndrome on Feb. 11, and Hackman, 95, died from heart disease with Alzheimer’s disease as a contributing factor on Feb. 18.

The bills bear striking resemblance to others being considered and passed by legislators in three other states, as well as controversial laws passed in Utah in 2020. PacifiCorp, owner of Pacific Power in Oregon, contributed to all of the bills and the Utah law.
Each of those bills confers upon utilities some version of state-sanctioned approval for “acting reasonably” to prevent wildfires, if they get wildfire mitigation plans approved annually or every few years by the state. Cooperative and private investor-owned utilities such as PacifiCorp say they need this to ensure that they are making smart investments in wildfire prevention and grid reliability, and to ensure they don’t go bankrupt.
That’s the argument being used by Oregon’s bill sponsors, too. But trial lawyers across the West, who represent victims of utility-caused wildfires, say the bills are meant to shift the costs of utility-caused wildfire damages from companies to customers.
Oregon’s House Bill 3666 would grant utilities a state “wildfire safety certificate” for having annual wildfire mitigation plans approved by the Oregon Public Utility Commission, while House Bill 3917 would set up a catastrophic wildfire fund that utilities pay into.
Victims of utility-caused fires could collect from the fund 80% of “allowable damages,” as long as they agree not to sue the utility that caused the fire. The utilities would be allowed to raise customer rates to pay for the fund.
Reps. Pam Marsh, D-Ashland and Kevin Mannix, R-Salem, are sponsoring both bills, which could be voted out of the House Judiciary Committee as early as Tuesday.
Marsh contends Oregon’s bills do not in any way infringe on wildfire victims’ ability to sue utilities for maximum damages for causing wildfires. She said in an email that legislative attorneys assured her House Bill 3666, offering utilities state certificates for having approved wildfire plans, would not provide immunity or limit liability to utilities.
Trial lawyers do not agree.
“This sort of regulatory compliance defense is a standard thing that corporations across the country are always asking for. This is what they would love,” said Daniel Hinkle, a lawyer and senior state affairs counsel for the American Association for Justice. “They would love to check a box and get it rubber-stamped by an agency without opposing counsel, without anybody there to sort of push back on it, and then be able to use that prior certification as a complete, total defense against any claims for accountability later on.”
The Washington, D.C.-based association made up of trial lawyers has been tracking bills across the country that were introduced this year to limit utility-caused wildfire liabilities, including in Oregon.
“The overall goal, as I see it across a lot of these bills, is to shift the cost of this (utility-caused wildfires) onto ratepayers,” Hinkle said.

Insurers, as well as timber, farm and ranchland owners have come out against the bills in Idaho and Wyoming and expressed concerns about Oregon’s bills.
Kenton Brine, president of the NW Insurance Council, said in an email Oregon’s bills would likely impact policy holders and insurance companies. The group has not taken a formal stance on them yet.
“The impact for property owners of bills that limit or grant immunity from liability is significant,” he said in an email.
He said he shares concerns with the trial lawyers over Oregon’s approach, and that legislation as proposed is “likely to impose a new burden of proof on a property owner seeking recovery after a utility-ignited wildfire.”
 PacifiCorp involvement

In Oregon, PacifiCorp lobbyist Annette Price and lawyer Jennifer Hudson participated in Marsh’s work group on the bills, along with representatives of Oregon’s cooperative and public utilities and lobbyists for the two other electricity monopolies operating in the state, Portland General Electric and Idaho Power.
Combined, the three monopoly utilities control 75% of Oregon’s electricity market.
Omar Granados, a PacifiCorp spokesperson, said in an email that the company’s work on bills such as Marsh’s are business as usual.
“Consistent with our long-standing practice to provide information to lawmakers who are considering energy policy legislation that could impact the utility and our customers, we provide comments, answer questions and participate on a number of proposed energy policy bills in the states we serve, which include Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho and Wyoming,” he wrote.
Marsh has said in public hearings that she started working on House Bill 3666 and House Bill 3917 after hearing from constituents about lackluster wildfire prevention work being done by Pacific Power, her area’s monopoly utility, and to ensure utilities operating in the state don’t go bankrupt. She said House Bill 3666 “will hold utilities to a high standard of performance through implementation of a safety certification.”
Marsh said House Bill 3917, establishing the catastrophic wildfire fund, is needed so wildfire victims have options.
“Without the fund, individuals have these paths: 1) Those with insurance can use their coverage. 2) Those without insurance will, most likely, struggle to cover basic needs with savings, government assistance, or friends and family. 3) All affected individuals can choose to take the utility to court,” she wrote in an email.
About 2,300 homes burned up in her southern Oregon district during the 2020 Labor Day Fires. Because no cause of the fires in that area were identified, her constituents weren’t able to collect any damages from an at-fault party and those without insurance have been left with nothing.
She added that she sees the bill as a starting point.
“If people agree that a fund of some kind could be useful, we will need to discuss questions around structure and operations, including coverage, administration, the mix of fund contributions, and so forth.”
Cody Berne, a governor at large for the Oregon Trial Lawyers Association and an attorney at Portland-based law firm Stoll Berne, said Oregon’s catastrophic wildfire fund as proposed would likely encourage low-income fire survivors and those without insurance to forgo collecting maximum damages in a lawsuit against a utility in a powerline-ignited fire and instead settle for less from the fund — a fund seeded with victims’ own money, collected through rate increases by utilities.
“This bill would charge customers to create a fund and also make them pay the next time Berkshire Hathaway burns down an Oregon town,” Berne said.
Berne is representing survivors of the historic 2020 Labor Day fires that killed 11 and destroyed more than 4,000 homes. Some of those fires were found to have been started by PacifiCorp equipment. PacifiCorp is owned by the multinational conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway.
A jury in 2023 found the company guilty for negligence and recklessness. A recent report from the Oregon Department of Forestry concluded that PacifiCorp did not start fires it was previously found to have started in the Santiam Canyon, refuting statements from first responders from the U.S. Forest Service and trial testimony.
PacifiCorp executives estimate the 2020 Labor Day Fires and 2022 wildfires caused by the company’s equipment in Oregon cost them nearly $2.7 billion. Berkshire Hathaway estimates it could face up to $8 billion in claims related to lawsuits over California and Oregon wildfires since 2020. That’s a bit more than half of Berkshire’s 2024 revenue — a record $14.5 billion.
“Most people — including fire victims — have to live with the justice system as it is. But when the justice system holds billionaires and their trillion-dollar corporations accountable, they think they can change the rules,” Berne said.
 Starting with Utah

PacifiCorp had its first success in contributing to legislation that limited its liability and the damages wildfire victims can collect in a powerline-ignited fire in 2020.
PacifiCorp lobbyists provided comments and answered questions for lawmakers working on Utah’s House Bill 66, according to spokesperson Granados. Granados did not answer questions about whether the lobbyists or company lawyers participated in bill workgroups or helped with the bills in the drafting stage.
“This was an effort by a broad coalition,” he said.
The Utah law offers electric utilities statutory protection from negligence charges in powerline-ignited wildfires if the utilities have an approved wildfire mitigation plan. It also limits damages that survivors of wildfire can collect in suits against utilities as the lesser of either the cost to rebuild, or the difference of the fair market value of the home before the fire and the fair market value of the property after the fire. That means if it costs $300,000 to rebuild a burned home, but the fair market value of the home before the fire was $100,000 and the fair market value of the scorched property after the fire is $20,000 a victim only gets to claim $80,000 in damages.
In the years since Utah’s law passed, PacifiCorp attempted to pass liability limits via states’ utility commissions. In Idaho in 2024 the company asked the state’s commission to include language that would have made its electric utility Rocky Mountain Power liable only for “actual economic damages” in a powerline-ignited fire, excluding noneconomic, punitive and incidental damages.
It made nearly identical requests to commissions in Washington, Oregon, California and Wyoming, according to reporting from Boise State Public Radio.
Idaho’s commission declined to approve the changes, so the company went to the Idaho Legislature. Other state legislatures followed.
 Reasonable and prudent

Oregon’s bills share similarities to that original 2020 Utah law. House Bill 3197, establishing a catastrophic wildfire fund, also limits recoverable damages from the fund to the lesser of either the cost of repairs or the difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and immediately after a catastrophic wildfire.
“The goal has been in a lot of these bills to restrict the recovery to the loss of fair market value, which is always going to be less than the cost of repair,” said Geoffrey Louden, a lawyer with the American Association for Justice.
All of the bills requiring approval or certification for wildfire mitigation plans that PacifiCorp has weighed in on in the West include language that describe the utilities as having acted “reasonably” and “prudently” to prevent fire in securing state approval.
Trial lawyers take the greatest issue with those words, as they are often used to establish a statutory presumption that an entity has not acted in a negligent, grossly negligent or reckless manner in cases of civil wrongdoing.
Hinkle, of the American Association for Justice, said getting laws passed with language like this is “standard corporate behavior 101.”
Marsh recently amended House Bill 3666 to remove language that previously said a wildfire safety certificate from the state “establishes that an applicant is acting reasonably with regard to wildfire safety practices,” to instead say a certificate indicates the utility was “consistent with the commission’s wildfire safety standards,” and cut off a provision making the certificate valid for 12 months. She said she worked with trial lawyers on the amendment.
But Berne of the Oregon Trial Lawyers Association and large landowners say this is not enough.
“If the goal is safety, this bill won’t accomplish it,” Berne said in an email. “It recycles fire safety rules that are already in place. There are no resources to investigate and make sure that investor-owned power companies are following the rules. The bill just gives the appearance of safety.”
Betsy Earls, a lobbyist for timber giant Weyerhaeuser, said issuing safety certifications to the utilities could have unintended consequences for companies like Weyerhaeuser even with Marsh’s amendment.
“It will amount to perhaps a thumb on the scale when juries are deciding and people are thinking about what’s being introduced and proven in court,” she told lawmakers at a March 18 public hearing for House Bill 3666.
The company’s 1.5 million acres in Oregon are prohibitively expensive to insure, she said, and though it deals every year with all kinds of fires and losses, sometimes the fires are caused by utility equipment, and the only recompense the company has for its losses is to sue the utility.
“We have no other way to recoup losses that are due to others’ negligence unless we go to court,” Earls said.



How are California’s utility and wildfire damage bills different?
In 2019, California passed laws creating a wildfire safety certification program for utilities as well as a catastrophic wildfire fund. But the policies in California are far different than those being proposed in Oregon and other states in the West, according to Berne of the Oregon Trial Lawyers Association. Wildfire safety certificates in California cannot by law be used to limit utilities’ liability in lawsuits because monopoly utilities in California are considered “strictly liable” for any fires they start. Having an approved plan and certificate from the California Public Utility Commission means the utility is allowed to raise rates to pay for wildfire prevention work and to participate in California’s catastrophic wildfire fund. The fund is available for qualifying utilities to recoup costs after they’ve paid fire victims damages. The fund does not send money directly to victims, who are never forced to give up their lawsuits, and who face no artificial caps on what they can collect in damages from utilities. PacifiCorp did not contribute to California’s legislation, according to Omar Granados, a company spokesperson.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A bill banning lab-grown meat from Nebraska advanced Monday to a second round in the statehouse after a two-hour debate. Legislative Bill 246 advanced 33-1. 
Nebraska would join a handful of states that have introduced legislation banning cell-derived meat. The bill was introduced at the request of Gov. Jim Pillen, who owns a major hog operation based in Columbus. Several lawmakers expressed concerns over the safety of lab-grown meat, while others called the bill a waste of time. 
 The proposed law doesn’t ban alternative-meat products like Impossible Burger, which is made entirely from plants. The cell-derived meat it targets is produced from animal cells, enabling the cells to multiply and differentiate into muscle, fat, and connective tissue without slaughtering animals. The bill would ban the production, import, distribution, promotion, display or sale of any cultivated-protein food in the state. 
If passed, Nebraska would be the fourth state to implement a ban on lab-grown meat; Mississippi is expected to be the third once its Governor signs it into law. Florida and Alabama have banned cultivating and selling meat grown in laboratories in recent years 
Bill author State Sen. Barry DeKay of Niobrara, said the bill aims to protect the Nebraska meat industry and consumers from “adulterated food’s effects.”
“Our goal is not to throw people in jail or impose heavy monetary penalties,” DeKay said. “It’s just to keep the product off the shelves.” 
Mississippi’s ban punishes anyone growing or selling lab-grown meat with a $500 fine and up to three months in jail. Lab-grown meat has been a subject of culture war politics, as some national Republicans say a ban is an attempt to stop the “elitist” class from promoting unnatural foods. State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman said she had leaned toward voting no before researching the topic. On Monday, Storer said not banning lab-grown meat is “sending a message to the people of Nebraska that we believe it’s safe.” 
“I cannot look someone in the eye right now and tell them that self-cultivated meat is safe,” Storer said. 
Nebraska is the second-largest cattle-producing state in the U.S., behind only Texas. Cattle and other livestock production are among Nebraska’s largest industries, bringing nearly $31.6 billion to the state, according to the Nebraska Department of Agriculture. 
The Food and Drug Administration approved lab-grown meat for human consumption in 2022. DeKay alluded to a ban in France and other European countries as proof that his concerns over the safety of lab-grown meat are valid.  
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln said lab-grown meat is a non-issue, because the product is not yet in stores and is just an issue that gives the governor “a win.” Conrad added that there are other solutions, such as labeling the meat as lab-grown. 
“I think it’s beneath the Legislature…it’s out of touch with what most Nebraskans want,” Conrad said.
The Nebraska Farm Bureau supported legislation that would label lab-grown meat but not ban it outright. 
Pillen has said he supported the bill as a way for the state to protect consumers and defend agriculture because it’s the lifeblood of Nebraska’s economy. After the vote, the governor said, “The creation of this bioreactor meat is simply a dishonest attack on producers in our state,” on X. 
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair said the state has bigger issues to deal with. 
“Beer and bugs, tackling the important matters that matter to Nebraskans,”  Hansen said sarcastically. “I’m hoping we’ll get to property taxes.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)COLFAX– As U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins toured Iowa agricultural facilities Monday, she said the U.S. Department of Agriculture is prepared to support farmers while tariffs go into place.
President Donald Trump announced plans Sunday to impose “reciprocal tariffs” on countries that have their own tariffs set on U.S. products, set to officially roll out April 2. While earlier statements from members of the Trump administration said the tariffs focus on 10 to 15 countries with large trade imbalances, the president said Sunday the tariffs will encompass all countries that charge fees for U.S. exports.
Iowans in agriculture have expressed concerns about Trump’s original plan — later delayed — to enact 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada. Some farmers said the move could hurt Iowa, as the state’s pork and corn industries are heavily tied to the countries. A spokesperson for the White House has confirmed that the tariffs will not contain exemptions for farmers.

Speaking with reports at Beck’s Hybrids, a retail seed company in Colfax, Rollins tried to assuage concerns about the tariffs’ impact on agriculture. She said the Trump administration and USDA plan to aid farmers from potential economic fallout using similar strategies as in 2018, when a U.S.-China trade war during Trump’s first term led to an estimated $27 billion in U.S. agricultural export losses.
“Hopefully our farmers and our ag community won’t be hurt by — at least in the short term — by these decisions,” Rollins said. “But if they are, the president’s commitment is the same today as it was five or six years ago. And we at USDA and our partners across Congress and in Washington will work around the clock to ensure that we have the programs in place to do what we did the last time with the (Commodity Credit Corporation), and we fully expect to do the same this time, but to be determined based on what happens in the next weeks and month.”
The USDA provided farmers more than $23 billion in federal subsidies during Trump’s first term to help offset the economic impacts of tariffs. While Rollins said at an earlier stop in Waukee that “we don’t have quite the funds we had back then,” according to the Des Moines Register, she also said there was other work being done by the Trump administration to expand U.S. agriculture’s international market presence.
U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, who joined Rollins alongside Gov. Kim Reynolds and Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig in Colfax, said she and other Iowa officials were “very pleased” by Rollins’ commitment to go on trade missions in coming months.
“We have not seen that the past four years,” Miller-Meeks said, comparing Rollins’ approach to efforts under the Biden administration. “Six countries and six months, I think it is — because we know we need to open up more markets.”
Rollins plans to visit Vietnam, Japan, India, Peru, Brazil, and the United Kingdom in 2025.
While the agriculture secretary said tariffs are one part of Trump’s “tool kit to realign the American economy,” another component was the reduction in force happening across the federal government — including roughly 6,000 at the USDA. Rollins said she supported the effort as a way to make government more efficient and put more economic focus on “expanding the private sector, on lifting up free enterprise, on reshoring American jobs.”
“The vision isn’t that we’re putting a lot of people out of work,” Rollins said. “The vision is that we’re realigning our entire economy, where the private sector and free enterprise is driving those jobs, rather than bigger and bigger government.”

,DC,2025-03-31 23:51:11+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Federal judge pauses Trump DHS effort to strip protections for Venezuelans,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-judge-pauses-trump-dhs-effort-strip-protections-venezuelans,,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge in California on Monday blocked the U.S. Department of Homeland Security from terminating the temporary protected status of more than 350,000 Venezuelans next week.The group was set to lose deportation protections by April 7 after DHS Security Kristi Noem, in her first week in office, vacated an extension of  protections put in place by the Biden administration.The order does not apply to a separate group of 250,000 Venezuelans who are set to lose their status in September.U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of the Northern District of California said the groups that brought the suit against the Trump administration are likely to succeed in their claims. He noted that Noem’s decision to vacate the temporary protected status for Venezuelans was not only arbitrary and capricious, but would harm the TPS holders, cost the U.S. billions in economic loss and harm public health and safety in U.S. communities.DHS did not immediately respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.Program for immigrants in dangerTPS allows nationals from countries deemed too dangerous to return to remain in the U.S. Those with the status have deportation protections and are allowed to work and live in the U.S. for 18 months, unless extended by the DHS secretary.Under Biden administration orders, protections were extended until October 2026 for two groups of Venezuelans, one initially assigned temporary protected status in 2021 and another in 2023.Chen’s order applies only to the group who first gained status in 2023. The 2021 group is also challenging the Trump administration’s revocation of their status, but that group’s status is in place until September.Chen noted that the Trump administration “failed to identify any real countervailing harm in continuing TPS for Venezuelan beneficiaries.”Chen was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2011.Gang activity citedThe groups who brought the suit against Noem represent TPS holders from Venezuela.The groups argued that Noem’s decisions to vacate the 2023 protections and end TPS for Venezuelans were arbitrary and capricious.They also argued that the Trump administration violated the Constitution’s equal protection clause, arguing that the decisions to vacate the extension and terminate protections “were motivated, at least in part, by intentional discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or national origin.”Noem cited gang activity as her reason for not extending TPS for the 2023 group of Venezuelans.The Trump administration has invoked the Alien Enemies Act to quickly deport any Venezuelan national 14 years or older who is suspected of having ties to the Tren de Aragua gang. A federal judge has placed a temporary restraining order on use of the wartime law.‘Classic example of racism’In his order, Chen said that while attorneys on behalf of the Trump administration argued that there is the threat of the Tren de Aragua gang, “it has made no showing that any Venezuelans TPS holders are members of the gang or otherwise have ties to the gang.”Chen also rejected the Trump administration’s argument that Noem had the legal authority to vacate the extension of protections.“The unprecedented action of vacating existing TPS (a step never taken by any previous administration in the 35 years of the TPS program), initiated just three days after Secretary Noem took office, reverses actions taken by the Biden administration to extend temporary protection of Venezuelan nationals that have been in place since 2021,” he wrote.In granting the nationwide pause, Chen noted the groups had a strong claim under the equal protection clause because Noem has “made sweeping negative generalizations about Venezuelan TPS beneficiaries.”“This is evident not only in what she said, but also in the fact that she decided to take en masse actions against all Venezuelan TPS beneficiaries, who number in the hundreds of thousands,” he said. “Acting on the basis of a negative group stereotype and generalizing such stereotype to the entire group is the classic example of racism.”This is not the first time the Trump administration has tried to end TPS designation for certain nationals. During Trump’s first term, DHS tried to end TPS for Haiti, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Sudan, but the courts blocked those attempts in 2018.Noem has also moved to end TPS for nationals from Haiti, which there are currently legal suits against that decision.",,,,2025-03-31 20:03:07.136649

That was just one finding of an audit that cited payroll, procurement and human resources issues.","Prince George's County Schools Superintendent Millard House II holds a media briefing in a 2023 file photo from Upper Marlboro. (File photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)A Prince George’s County substitute teacher was paid more than $7 million in 2022 — and two months passed before the school system recouped the funds.
That was the most remarkable finding in a new legislative audit of the county school system, which described a number of ongoing issues with the system’s payroll, procurement and human resources procedures.
The Maryland Department of Legislative Services audit also found that the school system failed to consistently complete a screening process for employees who have contact with children, and that it failed to investigate 9,376 missing items identified in a 2023 inventory, which were valued at about $6.3 million.
School system contracts also came under the microscope, and auditors concluded that the school district’s “procurement policies were not sufficiently comprehensive and were not consistently used when obtaining goods and services.” The school system did not always prepare written justifications, or seek school board approval for expenses, according to the audit.
The audit, dated March 25 and sent to the legislature’s Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee, said the 2022 overpayment for the substitute teacher occurred when a school system employee mistakenly entered the teacher’s identification number in the “hours” field. That led to the teacher being paid for approximately 73,000 work days, rather than three.
School system officials didn’t realize the overpayment had occurred until more than 50 days later. They recovered the funds within a few days, the audit said.

Payroll problems at the state’s second-largest school system have been persistent, the latest audit said. “Similar conditions regarding the human resource and payroll supervisory reviews were commented upon in our two preceding audit reports,” the audit said.
The school system did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the audit Monday. But in its written response to the audit findings, the system said it has “implemented several preventive measures to improve payroll accuracy and efficiency,” including hiring two new staffers, enhancing training and setting new limits on payroll data entries.
“Any staff member will be held accountable for overpayments that were caused by their inaccurate entries,” the school system added.
In 2019, a new Maryland law took effect requiring school systems to conduct special screenings for employees who would have contact with minors. But auditors checked 10 employees who had been hired in Prince George’s after the law’s effective date, and only three had been screened, even though they had been working with the system for six months or more, according to the audit.
As part of the screenings, school systems must send forms to an applicants’ prior employers, certifying that the person was never the subject of of a child sexual abuse or sexual misconduct investigation by any employer that resulted in a finding.
In Prince George’s County, the process was monitored by an employee “who did not send forms to prior employers, and/or failed to follow up with those employers that did not return a completed form,” the school system said in its response to the audit.
But the school system maintained that three of the 10 applicants didn’t need forms on file, because they did not have prior jobs wherein they had contact with children. One of the 10 applicants had a foreign employer, to which a form was not sent.
The system said it has since debuted an electronic signature program to expedite the screening forms, and it pledged to follow up with the state about “instances where prior employers do not return the required form.”

In evaluating the school system’s procurement procedures, state auditors raised the red flag on two purchases in particular.
Auditors found fault with a contract for cameras aboard school buses because it wasn’t put out for a competitive bid, and auditors questioned higher-than-average fees paid per bus. In response, the county pledged to ensure that future procurements comply with state law, and to document the reasoning for fee amounts.
In addition, the county paid two nonpublic schools $61.3 million for special education services between 2020 and 2023, but there was no written contract, and no board approval, according to the state audit. The county pledged to require written contracts “with each non-public school where we place a student,” and to submit an annual report to the Board about the placements and expenditures.
Prince George’s school officials also failed to follow the system’s policy for equipment tracking, which requires full inventories of any items over $1,500 in value to be conducted every three years.
The school system conducted an inventory in 2019, but then skipped 2022’s inventory, citing concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2023, the district completed a partial audit, but did not follow up on the findings, which indicated more than $6 million worth of equipment was not accounted for.
In its response, the school system said it initiated a new inventory in spring 2024, beginning with students’ electronic devices in each school. This spring, the school system will conduct an inventory of other classroom technology. The school system is also finalizing a plan to complete inventories every three years, which “will be implemented beginning January 2026 with an estimated completion of January 2029.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Millard-House-II-7-11-2023-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-31 20:03:07.136649

Jon Eubanks, R-Paris, attends a House Judiciary Committee meeting on Jan. 28, 2025. (Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas House of Representatives passed a bill Monday that would clarify state public meetings law by specifying what members of city councils, quorum courts or school boards can discuss outside of a public meeting.
Senate Bill 227, sponsored by Sen. Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock, and Rep. Jon Eubanks, R-Paris, would also allow a court to nullify any decisions made by a public body if it was in violation of open meetings laws, would add a cybersecurity breach as a reason to meet in executive session, and would regulate remote meeting attendance.
Under current state law, the number of people needed for a meeting to qualify as public is not defined, but has generally been interpreted to mean a meeting where at least two members of a governing body meet. Tucker’s bill would make that more explicit.
The legislation passed with 87 out of the 99 members present voting for the bill; five voted against it and five voted present. Two lawmakers abstained and Rep. Stephen Magie, D-Conway, was absent.
The bill, which already passed the Senate once, was amended to add co-sponsors after it was sent to the House, so it will be returned to the Senate for another vote.
While the measure passed with broad margins in the House, Rep. Jim Wooten, R-Beebe, stood to urge colleagues to vote it down.
“We’re starting down a slippery slope when we start fooling around with the Freedom of Information Act as it relates to the public knowledge and transparency in government,” Wooten warned. 
Wooten expressed concerns that the language of the bill would allow board members to discuss their positions on public business, and then pressure other members behind the scenes. A separate bill, SB 376, would define a public meeting as one where more than two members of a government entity met. That bill is awaiting a hearing in the House State Agencies and Governmental Affairs Committee, and has been opposed by government transparency advocates.
Eubanks said that provisions included in the bill would prohibit that kind of behavior while providing needed clarity to local officials alongside transparency.
“I spent 10 years on a school board, and I can assure you I did not know what the rules were, and I don’t think anybody else did either,” Eubanks said. “I think this is important, and it’s going to allow school board associations, counties, Municipal League to have clear understanding of what is allowed so that they can give the proper training to the members of those boards.”
The Arkansas Freedom of Information Act of 1967 gives Arkansans the right to obtain government records, such as emails. However, vague definitions of what exactly constituted a public meeting has led to litigation as local government bodies ran afoul of sunshine provisions.
Tucker’s bill has garnered support from state FOIA advocates, including the Arkansas Press Association. The association’s president, Andrew Bagley, called Tucker’s bill “a very good piece of legislation” during a committee meeting March 12.

(Moe Clark/Colorado Newsline)Colorado legislators introduced two bills Friday that would add new legal protections for transgender people and expand insurance coverage for gender-affirming health care. 
House Bill 25-1309 prohibits health insurance plans from denying or limiting medically necessary gender-affirming health care services. Care is considered medically necessary under the bill if a health care provider determines it to be so. The bill also exempts testosterone from state prescription drug use monitoring program tracking requirements.
Gender-affirming care, endorsed by both the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, can range from non-medical interventions, such as haircuts and name changes, to services such as hormone therapy and surgery to support the patient’s gender identity. The bill focuses on medical care, including psychiatric, surgical or therapeutic supplies and services. It would also include coverage for cosmetic and reconstructive surgeries.

“HB25-1309 demonstrates Colorado’s commitment to fairness, equity, and the right to make our own decisions about our bodies,” Nadine Bridges, executive director of LGBTQ+ advocacy organization One Colorado, said in a statement. “No one should have to fight for the health care they need. This bill ensures our community has the protection and stability we all deserve.”
Colorado’s Prescription Drug Monitoring Program operates under the Department of Regulatory Agencies and is meant to help reduce drug misuse. Pharmacies upload information on who is prescribed controlled substances, which can then be accessed by DORA, law enforcement, other practitioners and pharmacists, and patients themselves. HB-1309 would block archived reports of testosterone prescriptions from view to protect the privacy of people who take it for gender-affirming care. 
The bill is sponsored by Rep. Brianna Titone, an Arvada Democrat, Rep. Kyle Brown, a Boulder Democrat, Sen. Lisa Cutter, a Wheat Ridge Democrat, and Sen. Julie Gonzales, a Denver Democrat. It was assigned to the House Health and Human Services Committee, where it will go through its first bill hearing. 
School policies
House Bill 25-1312, dubbed the Kelly Loving Act in honor of a transgender woman killed during the 2022 Club Q shooting in Colorado Springs, adds various new legal protections for transgender people in education, family legal matters, and public accommodation. 
Colorado courts would be prohibited from complying with orders or laws from other states that threaten to take children away from parents or caregivers who allowed the child access to gender-affirming care. When a judge is hearing a child custody case, the court would have to consider deadnaming, misgendering or threatening to publish information related to an individual or child’s gender-affirming care as a form of “coercive control.” Deadnaming — when someone calls a transgender person by their previous name — and misgendering would also be defined as discriminatory acts in the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act.
The bill would require that schools, if they establish policies related to chosen names, must include all reasons that a student might choose to use a name that’s different from their legal name. Dress code policies must also not include any rules based on gender, and each student must be permitted to abide by any variation of the dress code based on gender. 
Any form administered by a public entity that requires an individual to disclose their name would have to include the option to provide a legal name and a chosen name. If someone’s chosen name differs from their legal name, the public entity would have to use the chosen name on all subsequent forms. 
The Kelly Loving Act is sponsored by Rep. Lorena García, an Adams County Democrat, Rep. Rebekah Stewart, a Lakewood Democrat, Sen. Faith Winter, a Westminster Democrat, and Sen. Chris Kolker, a Littleton Democrat. The bill was assigned to the House Judiciary Committee, where it will get its first hearing.

This year’s International Transgender Day of Visibility comes amid a political environment in which trans people have been targeted by new proposed federal and state restrictions. Wisconsin Republican lawmakers spent significant time in March on a slate of bills focused on transgender kids and would have limited their ability to play sports, access gender affirming medical care and change their names and pronouns in school. The bills are among more than 800 anti-trans bills that have been introduced nationwide this year.
Participants in the Madison celebrations said the point of the day was not to focus on the negative and harmful actions being taken, however, but to focus instead on the positive experiences of being transgender.

Melissa Ratcliff (D-Cottage Grove), co-chair of the Transgender Parent and Nonbinary Advocacy Caucus, said during a press conference that the purpose of the day is to “elevate the voices of our trans and non-binary communities, emphasize the joy of living life as your authentic self and to visualize the world in which all our trans and non-binary children, co-workers, neighbors, parents and elected officials throughout Wisconsin and the world are loved, accepted and safe.”
Democrats holding the press conference proposed a handful of bills. One would extend Wisconsin’s nondiscrimination laws to include transgender and nonbinary people by prohibiting discrimination on the basis of gender identity or gender expression.
Another bill would create an exception to current law for those seeking a name change for gender identity reasons. Under the current state statute people seeking a name change petition must publish notice of their petition in a local newspaper, including in the area where the petition will be heard, once per week for three consecutive weeks before they may petition the court.
A third bill would declare March 31, 2025 as Transgender Day of Visibility in Wisconsin and recognizes the achievements of several transgender people and organizations who have made contributions to Wisconsin.
In addition to the bills, Gov. Tony Evers, who has committed to vetoing any anti-trans legislation that makes it to his desk, signed a proclamation declaring Monday Transgender Day of Visibility.
Rep. Christian Phelps (D-Eau Claire) said the bills are important because lawmakers need to send a positive message to young Wisconsinites who may be paying attention. He said that when he was young he remembers feeling discouraged as a gay teen when the state passed a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. 
“Thirteen-year-olds across Wisconsin are listening to political actions and messages that are being sent out of the Capitol,” Phelps said, adding that children should know there are elected officials and allies and leaders who are fighting for transgender, non-binary and gender-expansive people of all ages across Wisconsin.
“That’s the message that we want people to take out of the Capitol and into their communities and to see [protections] passed in the state law as well,” Phelps said. 
When asked about plans to discuss the legislation with Republicans and the potential for garnering support across the aisle to pass any of the bills, the lawmakers sounded doubtful. Republicans hold majorities in the Assembly and Senate and support from them would be necessary for any of the Democratic legislation to be taken up.
“I don’t think they will sign on to this legislation. I certainly wish that they would take a look at it and hear our voices here today and see the love and support of so many community members,” Sen. Melissa Ratcliff (D-Cottage Grove) said. 
Clancy called it a “valid question” that Democrats get every time they hold a press conference. 
“Will Republicans sign on to this? And every time the answer is somewhat the same…,” Clancy said. “Republicans, two weeks ago, sat on the floor of the Assembly just feet from here for hours. They said that trans people should not exist, should not have basic rights. They have had the opportunity to weigh in on this, and I would welcome any of them moving across the aisle, breaking ranks from their, frankly, hateful leadership and joining in on these things.” 
The city of Madison also recognized Transgender Visibility Day by raising the transgender pride flag outside of the city municipal building.
Mayor Satya Rhodes Conway said the city was raising the flag to celebrate trans people, because the city respects individual rights and “rejects hate.” 
“The safety and the livelihoods of trans people are being threatened, and the issue of the fact of trans people is being used to divide our country in a hateful and really disappointing way, but here in Madison, we refuse to go backwards, and we refuse to let hate divide.” 
Asked about communicating the message of acceptance to those who disagree, Rhodes-Conway said that she thinks it’s important people recognize that diversity makes the Madison community stronger and invited people to “learn about the things that maybe make them nervous or scared and to be a part of the incredible diversity.” 
Rhodes-Conway also urged people to educate themselves.
“Folks can educate themselves and each other and a lot of the fear and resistance comes from lack of knowing, and so I just encourage people — there’s a lot of resources,” Rhodes-Conway said. “Please don’t ask the trans people in your lives to educate you. There’s a lot of resources out there and our libraries, our fantastic resources, and people can educate themselves about the history.”
Dina Nina Martinez-Rutherford, the first out transgender member of the Madison Common Council, said that transgender people are all “part of an unbroken legacy of resilience” and “authenticity.” 
Martinez-Rutherford said that she never expected to feel “so much love and community” when first elected in 2023 and never expected when she first started transitioning in 2007 to be in a position to advocate for people. 
“We raise the transgender flag today for it to be a symbol that Madison is welcoming and that you belong here,” Martinez-Rutherford said. “Let it be a beacon of hope, a reminder that we will not be erased.”

Ron DeSantis visited Montana urging lawmakers to pass a resolution asking for a Constitutional Convention in order to craft a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution, Montana Senators shot down the proposal.
Senate Joint Resolution 4 sought a convention of the states for the “sole purpose” of proposing the balanced budget amendment. The resolution saw a 5-4 vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee in January, but was indefinitely postponed on the Senate Floor on March 27 after failing to pass the chamber 23-27.
The Senate spent more than an hour debating the measure on the floor before voting it down.
“I rise in support of SJ 4 because it represents the only chance the Montana Legislature has to take action in the fight to prevent Congress from bankrupting America,” Sen. Mark Noland, R-Bigfork, said, introducing the measure on the floor. “There are good people on both sides of this debate, but the other side offers no solution, only their opposition.”
Making an impassioned speech about the need to reign in Congressional spending and the national debt, Noland said it wouldn’t be long before the country’s “interest payments will spiral out of control, until we enter what we call a doom loop.”
Some opponents spoke about their worry that calling a convention of the states specifically to propose a single amendment wasn’t possible — it could open a can of worms and allow any proposed changes to the Constitution to be debated, including stripping out existing rights.
“We control our delegates, maybe, but we can’t control the delegates from the other 49 states,” Sen. Bob Phalen, R-Glendive, said. “There are too many enemies of our country, and of our Constitution, that would be the delegates. Their goal will not be the same as ours.”
But proponents pushed back by reminding lawmakers that any proposed changes to the Constitution would still have to be ratified by a super-majority of state legislatures.
“If they come in there and want to do a little monkey business and strip out the Second Amendment, or other amendments, it still needs 38 states to ratify what they’ve done,” Sen. Greg Hertz, R-Polson, said. “And if they can, then our country is really, really in trouble if we got 38 states that really want to throw out most of our Constitution.”
Despite the impassioned pleas from many Republican legislators, proponents were unable to swing a majority of lawmakers in favor of the legislation.
DeSantis and Gov. Gianforte had held a lunchtime discussion with lawmakers and a joint press conference a few days before, touting the need to reign in spending in Washington, D.C., and pointing out that 49 of the 50 states are required to balance their budgets.
“In Washington, they’ve been spending like drunken sailors, and that’s not what our founding fathers envisioned,” Gianforte said during the press conference. “We need to change — and fast — to prevent our children and grandchildren from inheriting this mess that they’ve created. As you know, there is no constitutional limit on congressional borrowing. It’s up to Congress to police itself.”
DeSantis said that 27 states, including Florida, had already passed resolutions calling for a balanced budget amendment, with 34 needed to enact the convention.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/balancethebudget-1024x700.jpg,,,2025-03-31 20:03:07.136649

Competing bills introduced by Republican and Democrat legislators have swirled through both chambers, but lawmakers have had difficulty reaching a compromise or consensus on how best to deliver tax relief to Montanans, many who have seen significant increases in property values, and their tax bills, in recent years — a trend that is expected to continue unless the Legislature acts.
But on Monday, the Senate voted unanimously for a Sen. Wylie Galt’s “Plan C” bill, to deliver $400 rebates to primary property owners across the state, similar to rebates that went out in 2023.
“We’re getting close at the end of the session. We haven’t had any property tax across the finish line yet, so this is a backup plan,” said Galt, R-Martinsdale, on the Senate floor. “If nothing else comes, we at least have something that we can give out to the people of Montana until we keep trying to figure out the long term sustainable property tax cuts.”
Senate Bill 434  would allow homeowners to collect a one-time rebate of “$400 or the amount of total property taxes paid, whichever is less,” on a property they lived in for at least seven consecutive months in 2024. Eligible homeowners would be able to submit their claims between August 15 and Oct. 1 of 2025.
“Montanans have faced ever-increasing property taxes, and my bill will provide needed relief in the form of rebates as permanent, comprehensive solutions are discussed,” Galt said in a statement after the vote.
SB 434 will have a hearing before the Senate Finance and Claims Committee before receiving a final vote in the Senate, and moving on to the lower chamber.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-1154736495-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-03-31 20:03:07.136649

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) A bill to create tax incentives for oil drilling outside of North Dakota’s primary production areas passed the Senate on Monday, along with a possible study of the rising number of low-producing wells and their tax status. 
The Senate Finance and Taxation Committee amended House Bill 1483 to increase the amount of oil that could be produced under the tax break and lengthen the time period that the break would be in effect. 
Most of North Dakota’s oil comes from the Bakken and Three Forks formations. The bill would encourage development in other geologic formations. 
Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, previously testified that North Dakota has 10 other formations with oil production potential. 
The first 300,000 barrels of oil produced during the first 36 months after a well is completed outside the Bakken and Three Forks formations would be taxed at a lower rate — 2% of the gross value of the oil. The typical oil extraction tax rate is 5%. 
North Dakota sees uptick in oil wells that qualify for tax exemption

Rep. Chuck Walen, R-New Town, said the wells would still produce tax revenue in other ways, such as sales taxes. 
In addition, the wells would still be subject to the 5% gross production tax, which is paid in lieu of property taxes. 
The tax break does not apply to wells within a reservation unless the tribe opts in, under the amended bill.
The bill also says Legislative Management shall consider a study of low-producing wells, known as stripper wells. Low-producing Bakken and Three Forks wells become exempt from the extraction tax after 12 consecutive months of producing no more than 35 barrels per day. 
The interim legislative study would examine the fiscal impact of the exemption and alternative tax policies for stripper wells. Some lawmakers have questioned whether it’s good tax policy to allow wells to be classified as stripper wells forever, even if their production increases in the future with enhanced oil recovery. Nearly half of all North Dakota oil wells now qualify for the stripper well tax exemption.
The Senate changes will need to be adopted by the House or differences can be resolved in a conference committee.

Brad Little for consideration.
Idaho also needs federal approval for the proposed ban.
House Bill 109 would require the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to seek federal approval to exclude candy and soda from foods eligible for coverage by the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.

Idaho’s bill is part of the national movement coined “Make America Healthy Again,” or MAHA, promoted by U.S. health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the bill’s cosponsor Rep. Jordan Redman, R-Coeur d’Alene has told lawmakers.
And, he said, soda is the “number one commodity spent on SNAP.”
Business industry representatives oppose the bill. Arguing the bill wouldn’t be workable, Idaho House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, has said it would cause grocery stores to stop accepting SNAP.
But bill cosponsor Senate Majority Caucus Chair Ben Toews, R-Coeur d’Alene, says he’s skeptical the bill would be hard on retailers. He said the bill’s candy definition is used in 24 other states’ sales tax laws.
The Idaho House passed the bill on a 48-20 vote on Monday, after the chamber had already narrowly approved the bill. It came back to the House after the Senate amended the bill to tweak the candy definition. The Idaho Senate passed an amended version of the bill on a 25-10 vote last week.
Idaho Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, critiqued the bill as another way to control poor people.
Sen. Camille Blaylock, R-Caldwell, suggested it isn’t likely Idaho would make the change alone. Idaho’s waiver, she argued, would join other states’ requests, applying pressure for a nationwide change.
When the bill is transmitted to the governor, he has five days, excluding Sundays, to decide on it. He has three options: sign it into law, allow it to become law without his signature, or veto it.
If passed into law, the bill would take effect July 1.
Bill’s candy definition is broad, and would ban granola and power bars, critics say
Pushback has largely focused on the bill’s broad candy definition, which critics say would also ban granola bars and power bars.
The bill defines candy as “a preparation of sugar, honey, or other natural or artificial sweeteners combined with chocolate, fruit, nuts or other ingredients or flavorings” in several forms.
Under the bill, candy would not include items that contain flour or need refrigeration. The Senate amended the bill to tweak the candy definition, removing an exemption for items with more than 10% flour by weight.
The bill’s soda definition also appears to be broad.
Under the bill, soda includes nonalcoholic beverages with sweeteners, artificial or natural. But the bill doesn’t consider soda to be drinks with more than 50% juice, contain milk or milk substitutes, or that need preparation, such as powders or concentrates.
About 132,000 Idahoans are enrolled in SNAP, according to Idaho Department of Health and Welfare figures, receiving an average of $177 in monthly program benefits.
If the federal U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, doesn’t grant Idaho’s candy/soda SNAP ban waiver, the bill says Health and Welfare “shall request such a waiver annually until such a waiver is granted.”
The bill’s fiscal note estimates it would not have a fiscal impact.
Republican legislators in Arizona, Kansas, Utah and Wyoming introduced similar bills, Stateline reported.

Michelle Lujan Grisham has signed two bills into law that will give local governments more ways to access money to aid in disaster recovery and emergency response.
One will allow the use of property tax bonds to fix infrastructure damaged by floodwaters, and the other will change a funding mechanism to help cities and towns purchase ambulances. Lujan Grisham signed them both Friday.
“These bills provide critical tools for our municipalities to recover from devastating floods and strengthen our emergency medical services across the state,” the Democratic governor Lujan Grisham said in a written statement Monday.
The first law, Senate Bill 383, expands the use of revenue bonds to include “rebuilding, repairing, replacing, and hardening of municipal property damaged by a flood,” and allows local governments including cities and counties to implement a 0.327% gross tax to help pay for the bonds.
Previously, the law only allowed municipalities to enact the tax on property or services bought within the area.
Sen. Candy Spence Ezzell (R-Roswell) the sponsor of SB 383, said she was “beyond thrilled,” about the signing when reached by phone on Monday. The new law  will allow Roswell to raise funds to apply for federal dollars after devastating floods ripped through the community in October, killing two people.
“It will help Roswell get matching funds where they can apply for the FEMA money to help with getting everything back,” Ezzell said. “The bill also gives other towns and counties the opportunity to do the same thing in case they are faced with some other natural disaster as well.”
In order to enact the tax, local governments will have to adopt bonds and send them to the voters for approval. SB383 contains an emergency clause, which enacts the bill into law immediately.
Senate Bill 197 allows municipalities to purchase ambulances using bonds and allows the state to move money from the Emergency Medical Services Fund to the Department of Finance and Administration to pledge in repaying the loans, similar to the process to buy fire trucks.
Ambulances are often too expensive for small local governments to purchase outright, said New Mexico Municipal League, which lobbies on behalf of cities, in an analysis of the bill. A single ambulance often costs over $200,000.
SB197 goes into effect July 1.

(Provided by S.C. Nuclear Advisory Council)Large utility companies and technology giants are among those that have shown interest in a proposal to restart a pair of failed nuclear reactors in South Carolina. But questions remain regarding if or how the state might ultimately get such a deal done.
It’s been roughly six months since a state nuclear advisory group first floated the idea of restarting construction on the partially built reactors at the V.C. Summer nuclear plant in Fairfield County. Since then, South Carolina’s state-owned power company received applications of interest from nearly 80 interested parties.
About half of those have the financial wherewithal to be considered viable bidders, said Steve Nance, Santee Cooper’s director of nuclear development and technical training.
“To say this thing went viral would be an understatement,” he told members of the governor’s Nuclear Advisory Council on Monday.
Federal money could supercharge state efforts to preserve nuclear power

Nance did not name specific companies but said five of the so-called “Magnificent 7” — influential tech companies that have shaped the stock market in recent years — are among respondents. Those companies include Google parent company Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook parent company Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla.
The calls to study a potential V.C. Summer restart came amid what members of the advisory council have said is a nuclear resurgence in the country.
The poster child for this has been the remaining unit at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island, where a second unit suffered its notorious partial meltdown in 1979. The facility’s owner has started the federal permitting process for a restart to power a Microsoft data center.
“I never in my life thought we would be using nuclear reactors like a portable generator,” Nance said, but that appears to be what is happening as tech companies seek to power a surge in new artificial intelligence data centers.
Nance said his team at Santee Cooper has “gussied up” the V.C. Summer reactor sites as best they can since opening it up to bids in January. The company has cut the grass, removed abandoned scrap iron, and pumped standing water out of tanks so visitors can get a better look.
Items such as control room panels have been safely stored but other parts remain exposed to the elements: “Trays, piping, some of that stuff left outside for eight years is junk and will have to be replaced,” he said.

Nance said eight groups have so far gone out on tours of the site.
Groups have until May 5 to formally express their interest in the project. After that, those still interested after getting a look at Santee Cooper’s books will submit a more detailed proposal.
Nance said the initial thought is that Santee Cooper would sell the reactors outright in a cash sale to a buyer.
“But it’s not 100% that’s going to be the case,” he said.
Nance also said there are several groups that initially expressed interest but then backed out after learning more about the scope of work necessary.
Revival will not be without its challenges.
While more than 80% of the parts necessary to complete the reactors — one of which is about half built, the other about a quarter — are on site, some of it is already under sales contracts.
For example, some of the nuclear reactor components are promised to projects in the Ukraine, though the buyer has yet to pick up the pieces, and those contracts could expire if no move is made by the buyers to have them shipped out.
“The more questions that were asked, the less clear it became to me about what the next steps are,” said Tom Clements, a long-time critic of the V.C. Summer expansion who has warned against a potential reboot.
Here’s how much SC power customers are still paying for a failed nuclear project

Santee Cooper has not yet publicly provided a cost estimate for a restart. Nor have federal regulators set guidelines for what it will take to re-establish that the unused parts are qualified for nuclear use, Clements said.
“They did not present anything that would make the project more viable,” Clements said. “This is going to be a very heavy left. There may be excitement about this but I’m still very skeptical.”
Sen. Tom Young, who sits on the advisory council, had questions about what criteria Santee Cooper planned to use to assess bidders and how the state would ensure any deal provides relief to utility customers who have been paying for billions in debt from the failed nuclear project on their monthly power bill.
“There are a lot of details that are going to have to be worked out,” the Aiken Republican told the SC Daily Gazette. “At the end of day, there’s going to have to be real scrutiny of any proposal.”

State Superintendent Ryan Walters’ administration developed the standards, which dictate what public schools must teach in social studies classes, along with committees of Oklahoma teachers and a group of national right-wing media personalities and policy advocates. The proposed standards would require education on the Bible, Jesus and alleged “discrepancies” in the 2020 presidential election.
Rejecting the proposed standards in full would send them back to the Oklahoma State Board of Education, which approved them on Feb. 27, for revisions. The Republican supermajority in the House and Senate would have to agree to the denial.
Leaders of the minority party said the process that produced the new standards was riddled with political interference.

Rep. Melissa Provenzano, D-Tulsa, said lawmakers and the state Board of Education should take a slow, methodical approach “where everyone has their questions answered and parents feel comfortable” with the results.
“We need to slow down and take time and get this right,” Provenzano said.
One newly appointed state Board of Education member, Ryan Deatherage, said during the board’s Feb. 27 meeting that he didn’t have enough time to read through the standards before voting on them. 
It later came to light that the Oklahoma State Department of Education made changes to the proposed standards without revealing them publicly, including the addition of language questioning the results of the 2020 presidential election.
Walters responded to the Democrats on Monday by accusing them of promoting “radical gender ideologies and anti-American agendas” instead of supporting “the core truths of America’s history and values.”

“We’re not surprised that Democrats are relentlessly undermining our children’s education,” he said in a statement. 
The state Legislature has 30 legislative days after the state board submits the academic standards to approve, amend or reject them, according to Oklahoma law. 
Legislative staff determined the 30-day deadline is May 1, said Jennifer Monies, a spokesperson for the House Speaker’s Office.
If lawmakers take no action by the deadline, the proposed standards would take effect as written, according to state law. If the Legislature rejects the standards, then Oklahoma’s current standards, which were established in 2019, would remain in place until the new version is approved.
Republican leaders in both chambers have yet to take a stance on Walters’ proposal. 
Walters met with House Republicans in a caucus meeting Monday, the Speakers’ Office confirmed.

House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said last week he invited Walters to the closed-door meeting to discuss the social studies standards. Hilbert said House Republicans then would deliberate as a caucus and with the Senate on what action, if any, is necessary.
The state reviews and enacts new academic standards for school subjects every six years. Hilbert said the state Legislature has never changed or rejected academic standards before.

Larry Rhoden speaks to reporters during a press conference on March 31, 2025, at the state Capitol in Pierre. (Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — South Dakota Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden unveiled a proposal Monday that would give counties the option to implement a half-percent sales tax to fund property tax reductions for homeowners.
Rhoden said the plan could save hundreds of dollars annually for typical homeowners in some areas. Counties that opt-in to the plan would shift some of their residential property tax burden to consumers, he said, including tourists from elsewhere making purchases while they pass through.
“Realistically, it’s a tax decrease for the citizens of the state,” Rhoden said.
The plan would alter longstanding taxation policy that reserves sales tax revenue for the state and cities. The state imposes a 4.2% sales tax that’s scheduled to increase to 4.5% in 2027, and cities may impose up to an additional 2% local rate, plus another 1% on hospitality-related items such as alcoholic beverages, restaurant meals, lodging accommodations and various types of events.
Rhoden signs property tax relief bill with eye toward another solution

The governor said he’ll send his proposal to a summer legislative committee studying property taxes, and he doesn’t anticipate action on the plan until next winter’s annual legislative session.
It’s the second property tax relief idea Rhoden has proposed since becoming governor in January, after the departure of Kristi Noem to serve in President Donald Trump’s Cabinet.
The first idea, already signed into law, is a multifaceted effort that includes a five-year, countywide 3% cap on growth in owner-occupied home assessments, plus other provisions such as an eligibility expansion for an assessment freeze program for elderly and disabled people. 
As described by the governor, the new plan would allow county commissions to impose the sales tax. County citizens could refer the commission decision to local ballots, or petition the tax increase onto the ballot themselves.
Revenue from the sales tax would have to be used to offset the county’s portion of property taxes on owner-occupied homes. Once that’s fully achieved, any remaining revenue would have to be used to offset taxes for commercial and agricultural property. The sales tax would be limited to a five-year term, with the possibility of renewal.
The plan would not affect school districts, which also receive property tax revenue.
The governor said that in Minnehaha and Pennington counties, the proposal would reduce annual property taxes by $967 and $917, respectively, on a home valued at $325,000. Those are the two most-populated counties in the state, home to Sioux Falls and Rapid City.

Rhoden said counties that attract lots of tourists are also some of the counties most affected by property tax increases, in part due to growth from incoming residents willing to pay higher prices for the limited number of houses on the market. Thus, Rhoden said, those counties are particularly well-suited for his plan.
He said the lack of county-specific targeting was a problem with many of the property tax relief proposals that failed during the legislative session.
“They were proposing a statewide solution to a five-county problem,” Rhoden said.
Asked whether the plan might place a greater burden on low-income residents who pay sales taxes but rent their homes and do not directly benefit from property tax reductions, Rhoden acknowledged the concern. But he said the ultimate decision would rest with local officials and voters.
“Every county has different circumstances,” he said.
Rep. Mike Derby, R-Rapid City, who co-chairs the Legislature’s main budget committee, said lawmakers are excited to see the governor put a proposal on the table. 
“Around here in the Legislature, you have to start with an idea,” Derby said. “And it’s a lot easier to poke holes in an idea or try and fix it or make it better when you have a starting point. Governor Rhoden has done that.”
The plan would result in the following estimated annual property tax savings on a $325,000 home in cities within selected counties, according to the Governor’s Office: 

Minnehaha (Sioux Falls): $967
Pennington (Rapid City): $917
Custer (Custer): $431
Hughes (Pierre): $873
Lawrence (Spearfish): $845
Lincoln (Tea): $613

Wes Moore stands behind LGBTQIA+ Commission Chair Lee Blinder, who said the state has not done enough to support the transgender community during the 2025 session. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)What started as a day to recognize the state’s transgender community spun into pointed criticism of the Moore administration’s and state lawmakers’ failure to protect against Trump administration actions that affect the day-t0-day lives of transgender individuals.
The topic of transgender issues later spilled out into a debate on the House floor, reflecting a tumultuous time for transgender people even in the so-called “safe haven” that is Maryland.
The tension began Monday morning at an International Transgender Day of Visibility event hosted by Gov. Wes Moore (D) in the State House. During his remarks, he promised that transgender Marylanders will continue to be protected in the even as President Donald Trump (R) signals hostility towards the community.
“We are proud to be a safe haven for people of all backgrounds and identities, and I want to be very clear, this is a reputation that we intend on keeping,” he said, highlighting policies in recent years that help support LGBTQ+ veterans and grant better access to gender-affirming care.

But to Lee Blinder — a nonbinary official who chairs the Maryland Commission on LGBTQIA+ Affairs in the Governor’s Office — those promises have fallen flat.
“We know who you, Governor Moore, can be for us,” Blinder said as Moore stood nearby, “and I am here begging you to do it.
“It will not get easier to support trans people. It will not get easier to commit to this community, it will only get harder in the days that come,” Blinder said.
Blinder criticized what they called the administration’s lack of support to protect the community amid federal measures to diminish the presence of transgender people in day-to-day life.
Blinder noted that bills impacting the LGBTQ+ community are not moving this session — including Senate Bill 314, the Birth Certificate Modernization Act, which would make it easier for transgender people to make changes to their birth certificates, among other measures.
They also said more state dollars should be going towards the transgender community, even as lawmakers discuss billions in cuts to state programs and more than $1 billion in new revenue increases to address a fiscal 2026 budget shortfall.
“We’re facing one of the most dangerous threats to trans lives across the country, and the trans community is nowhere to be found in here with this budget, so now I must beg,” Blinder said. “I’ll beg in private; I’ll beg in public. I’ll do absolutely whatever it takes to get my community what we need.”
Moore did not directly respond to the criticism at the event and did not take questions from press. He wrapped up by declaring March 31 Transgender Day of Visibility in the state, has he as done each year during his term.
The governor’s office later reiterated Moore’s commitment to be a safe haven for the transgender community, pointing to policies that include increased funding for hate crime prevention in fiscal 2026 and providing Medicaid access to gender-affirming health care resources.
Legislation boosts Maryland’s rating with LGBTQ+ policy tracking think tank

“We are proud of our work so far, but our administration knows we have so much more to do – and we will do it together in partners,” the statement said.
Following the morning event, Blinder said that the governor’s compassion for the transgender community is “not in question.” But Blinder felt a duty to speak up.
“This is a desperate time, and we are in a state of emergency,” they said. “This community is in crisis, and they are relying on me. So, I have to do a difficult thing and share an honest report with the governor, we really deserve and need that protection.”
Delegates face off on trans issues
The fight over transgender issues continued onto the House floor later Monday.
Del. Kathy Szeliga (R-Baltimore County) stood to recognize National Woman’s History Month by speaking in support of Riley Gaines, a former University of Kentucky swimmer who tied with transgender University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas in the NCAA championship in 2022.
Gaines’ experience is cited by those pushing for policies that ban transgender women from women’s sports, arguing that they have inherent strengths and unfair advantages against cisgender women.
“Women accomplish in sports and they stand on their own. As women, we are competitive and resilient and determined. We were created with unique strengths, very different from men, and we should never be able to blur those truths,” Szeliga said to applause and whistles of approval. “Riley Gaines has inspired many other girls and women to speak up. She has faced threats, violence and hatred … but she keeps showing up for girls in sports.”
International Transgender Day of Visibility always falls on March 31, which also happens to be the last day of National Women’s History Month. Del. Kris Fair (D-Frederick) shot back against Szeliga’s “unfortunate” comments and brought the conversation back to Transgender Day of Visibility.

“It’s a day to celebrate the lives and contributions that trans people bring to every single region of this country, every single region to this state,” he said. “Trans women are women – they deserve the same respect, kindness and compassion as every other woman in this country.”
He said transgender individuals “are veterans, they are hardworking employees, they are people who contribute to our society, they sit on the boards of our non-profits, they work in our schools, they help our families, and they support their own families. And they have to suffer through the indignity of having to sit here and be erased on this floor. I will not stand for it.”
“I say to all the trans people out there in Maryland listening to us right now – Happy Trans Day of Visibility. We love you, we see you, we affirm you,” Fair concluded, as many of the Democratic members stood to applaud.
After the floor session, Fair said he wanted to “correct the record” and affirm “that trans people are very important to our society.”
“Unfortunately, one of my colleagues felt it necessary to use today as a political football, and then trash transgender people, disrespect them on the floor,” he said.
As to Blinder’s comments, Fair agreed that the House is struggling to pass some of the LGBTQ+ bills this session, but he said Maryland is still “light years ahead of other states” in supporting transgender and the LGBTQ+ population.
“I hear the chair’s comments. And I agree we can always be doing more, always … Maryland is at the upper echelon of protections for transgender people and for LGBTQ+ people,” he said, “but that never means that we’ve done enough, there’s more to do.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025_march31_blindermoore_transvis-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-31 19:04:36.436742

He said that Trump is using transgender people as scapegoats.“In (an) even more despicable move, he's chosen to scapegoat kids, trans kids,"" he said. “The reason you can't pay your rent, you can't afford health care, the reason that you have to fear gun violence, the reason that you can't afford your grocery has nothing to do with trans people and everything to do with the billionaires and corrupt corporations that have been giving us crumbs for generations.”Interfaith groups, trans advocacy groupsInterfaith groups and transgender advocacy groups also joined lawmakers for the event organized by the Christopher Street Project, a nonprofit that aims to elect pro-trans Democratic members of Congress.“My religion has taught me that every human being is the divine image,” Rabbi Abby Stein said. “When the people in (Congress) or the White House try to take away our rights, try to legislate us out of existence, what you are doing… is an affront not just to humanity but to divinity and to any version of spirituality or creed.”Democratic members in attendance included Whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Reps.

But most voters likely wouldn’t know that just by reading the drafted ballot language. 
The Republican-backed amendment, if passed out of the legislature and approved by voters, would outlaw abortion with limited exceptions for medical emergencies and survivors of rape and incest prior to 12 weeks gestation.
The amendment seeks to overturn an abortion-rights amendment approved by voters in November that legalize abortions up until the point of fetal viability. This made Missouri the first state to overturn an abortion ban after lawmakers enacted a trigger law in 2022 that banned the procedure with exceptions only for medical emergencies. 
While the proposed ballot language would ask voters if they want to repeal Article I, Section 36 of the constitution —the current abortion-rights amendment — it does not directly ask voters if they want to ban or outlaw most abortions.
Instead, it would ask voters if they want to “guarantee access to care for medical emergencies, ectopic pregnancies, and miscarriages,” a right that is already guaranteed under the current constitutional amendment. 
Missourians would also be asked if they want to “ensure women’s safety during abortion,” “ensure parental consent for minors,” allow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape and incest” and “protect children from gender transitions.”
If approved by both the House and Senate, Missourians could be asked to weigh in on reinstating an abortion ban as soon as a special election the governor could call this year, or during the 2026 midterm election. 
The legislation approved by a House committee Monday, is the second iteration of legislation filed by state Rep. Melanie Stinnett, a Republican from Springfield. 
Stinnett’s initial language included a criticized police reporting requirement for survivors of sexual violence. Two out of every three sexual assaults are not reported to police, according to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. 
That requirement was removed in Monday’s version. 
Missouri health department rejects Planned Parenthood plan to start medication abortions

On Thursday, House Speaker Jon Patterson, a Republican from Lee’s Summit, said while he anticipates the GOP will continue to refine the exact language to put before voters, he doesn’t foresee the rape and incest exceptions being cut out in later debate. 
“That’s something that the people spoke on,” Patterson said. “That’s something that all the legislators recognize is something that we have to keep.”
The new legislation, like its predecessor, proposes a ban on gender-affirming health care for minors. It also seeks to reinstate state regulations on abortion providers and facilities, including admitting privileges at a local hospital, licensing requirements and inspections. 
The amendment would allow abortions in cases of fetal anomaly, which the legislation defines as “a structural or functional abnormality in the unborn child’s gestational development that would make life outside the womb impossible.” 
The bill specifies that this would include ectopic pregnancies but exclude a fetal diagnosis of a disability. 
State Rep. Raychel Proudie, a Democrat from Ferguson, raised concerns with this language on Monday. She questioned how the amendment would apply to a fetal diagnosis where a newborn could survive birth, but would die shortly after, including in cases of anencephaly, a fetal birth defect in which part of the brain or skull don’t develop properly. 
The new proposal also looks to require that any legal challenges to the state law around reproductive health care be heard in Cole County. 
After the abortion-rights amendment passed in November, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri sued the state, arguing several abortion regulations on the books were now unconstitutional. That case is being tried in Jackson County, where one of the state’s several Planned Parenthood clinics is located. 
Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey has been unable to convince the judge to move the case to Cole County, where a judge last year attempted to remove the abortion-rights amendment from the ballot.
During Monday’s hearing, state Rep. Pattie Mansur, a Democrat from Kansas City, said she found it noteworthy that in Missouri, a 17-year-old girl could be legally married but would still need permission from her parents for an abortion. 
The House Committee on Children and Families previously spent four hours debating the initial bill, including testimony from Missourians who accused lawmakers of attempting to overturn the will of the people.
Republicans have continued to defend their decision to spend much of the legislative session on an abortion amendment by arguing that Missourians were misinformed on what they were voting on in November — a reasoning that continues to draw fury from abortion-right supporters both in the legislature and in their districts. 
“The most disappointing piece of that is the Republican’s consistent insistence on defying the will of the voters in this state,” House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Democrat from Kansas City, told reporters last week. “Whether it’s on abortion or paid sick leave and minimum wage, the first order of business this year has been to undo what Missourians went to the ballot box to vote for.”
Aune also took notice of how late into session the proposed amendment was making its way out of committee. 
“It seems to me that the reason this has been slow rolled is that there simply is not consensus on the other side of the aisle on what language to end up with, how far to go or not, what they think that they can get passed by the voters or not,” Aune said Thursday. “That is likely causing a lot of contention in their caucus right now, and I’m not mad about that.”
But there didn’t seem to be much disagreement come Monday between GOP members of the House Committee on Children and Families who passed the revised language after just a few minutes of discussion. 
“It was time to get this moving,” state Rep. Holly Jones, a Republican from Eureka who chairs the committee, told her colleagues Monday. 
The Senate version of the legislation, sponsored by state Sen. Adam Schnelting, a Republican from St Charles, passed out of committee in early March but has yet to be heard on the Senate floor. 
Abortion within the state remains out of reach for many Missourians, despite voters in November codifying the right to reproductive health care in the state constitution. 
This includes the most common type of abortion. Medication abortions remain inaccessible through Planned Parenthood in Missouri after the state rejected complication plans submitted by the clinics outlining continued care for patients in the case they had any adverse effects from the medication. 
The rejection notice sent by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services was based on criteria set in an emergency rule published Thursday by the Missouri Secretary of State’s Office that included a requirement that clinics must provide the names of any physicians who prescribe abortion medication. 
In response, Planned Parenthood on Friday filed a motion asking that a Jackson County judge block the state statute that requires the clinics submit an abortion medication plan. As of Monday, three Planned Parenthood clinics — in Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis — had started seeing some patients for procedural abortions again.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The town of Johnston’s attempt to seize 31 acres of land is no longer being considered in state court after both parties requested the matter get tossed.
Providence County Superior Court Judge Christopher Smith dismissed the town’s condemnation action, leaving the case solely in U.S. District Court, where the landowners are suing Johnston officials over what their attorneys call a “sham taking” of the property.
“We shouldn’t have had to go through this to begin with,” Providence attorney Kelley Morris Salvatore said in an interview while leaving the Licht Judicial Complex. “And now the case is going to proceed where it always should have.”
SCLS Realty, LLC, and Sixty Three Johnston, LLC, had plans to build a 252-unit affordable housing complex on the site. But Johnston Mayor Joseph Polisena Jr. wants to build a new public safety complex and town hall on the site.
Polisena said he remains confident the town will come out on top in its bid to take the land.
“We continue to believe the town has acted correctly on behalf of the taxpayers of Johnston and now we look forward to addressing the matter solely in federal court,” he said in a statement.
Earlier this month, Johnston’s Town Council authorized Polisena to legally seize the property off George Waterman Road by eminent domain. Under Rhode Island General Law, eminent domain can be used to remove hazardous buildings, revitalize abandoned lots, and clarify land ownership. Municipalities typically reserve the legal tool for road projects.
Attorneys representing the property’s owners argue that the seizure was pretextual, claiming Polisena decided to use eminent domain only after making multiple public declarations against the project.
Two days after developers filed their federal lawsuit, the town briefly gained ownership of the land after filing a petition and depositing $775,000 into the court’s registry, the assessed value of the site. But the town was ordered to change the land records back to developers Ralph Santoro and Salvatore Compagnone, who said the seizure was done without notice to them or their lawyers.
That same afternoon as the initial ruling, U.S. District Judge Melissa DuBose issued a temporary restraining order pausing the town’s efforts to seize the land for 30 days.
With the case no longer in state court, the $775,000 deposited by the town will return to its account pending the final outcome of the federal court case, Polisena’s Deputy Chief of Staff Dominique Turner said in an email Monday.
A status conference in the federal lawsuit is scheduled to be held in the next four to six weeks, according to online records.

Jennifer Bradley in a committee meeting on March 31, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Four months after Florida Supreme Court Justice Carlos Muñiz blasted the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) for not providing enough information to justify a public utility rate increase, the chairman of the PSC attempted to defend his agency before a Senate committee on Monday.
The PSC is a five-member board appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate that is responsible for facilitating safe and reliable utility services at fair prices. According to its own website, the commission “must balance the needs of a utility and its shareholders with the needs of consumers.”
Mike La Rosa, the sitting PSC Chair who was initially appointed to serve on the Commission by Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2021, came before the Senate Ethics & Election Committee seeking conformation to another four-year term.
Northeast GOP Sen. Jennifer Bradley asked him to respond to the thrust of Muñiz comments, expressed in December as the court heard arguments in an appeal of a 2023 PSC order approving rates for Florida City Gas. The Chief Justice criticized the PSC for not providing nearly enough information to justify a rate increase, after the PSC’s own staff recommended that they not approve the increase.
‘Black Box’
“The PSC is a black box,” Muñiz said in comments reported by the News Service of Florida.
“That is my problem with these cases. It’s a black box. And administrative procedure is not supposed to be [a black box]. It’s supposed to be the opposite of a black box. That’s the only justification for this whole mousetrap is to have reasoned explanations for fact-based decisions. And, instead, we get a regurgitation of the evidence and then like, ‘Oh, because so-and-so said this, we think that this is appropriate. We’re done.’ That is literally every order that we see from the PSC.”
“That is an alarming statement for me as a legislator to hear from our chief justice of our Florida Supreme Court,” Bradley said Monday.
La Rosa replied that while he couldn’t explain why the PSC didn’t provide more information in their orders in the past, that began changing in 2023 (he began serving as chair of the commission that November).
“Our chairman at the time, I think, guided us down the right path to make sure that our legal staff responded in a way that satisfied and frankly provided a better product of what the Supreme Court is looking for,” La Rosa said. 
He added that commission orders have been of a higher quality ever since. But he said he could not defend why earlier orders were written the way they were. He also said that since that time the commissioners have stepped up their public comments from the dais during rate hike hearings, as well.
Broward County Democratic Sen. Mack Bernard asked why the PSC wasn’t providing the Supreme Court with meaningful information. La Rosa said he couldn’t really provide an “answer that’s satisfactory.” He added “that they should always have had the backup and the history and the depth of knowledge that we currently have.”
Committee Chairman Don Gates quoted another part of Muñiz’s comments, that “the Public Service Commission appeared to rely largely on what utilities told them, ‘as opposed to any facts and evidence.'” Gaetz asked whether La Rosa could give two or three examples of the last time his commission turned down a utility rate increase.
La Rosa countered that there wasn’t a single case he could remember when the PSC approved what the utility was exactly asking for.
“There are elements what the company is asking for that we do approve, but there are certain modifications that we make after we litigate and after we make the case,” he said, adding that he couldn’t remember the last time a public utility made a request that the PSC granted exactly.
Gaetz cited criticism that he has heard that utilities start out by asking for extraordinarily high rate increases that they expect won’t be approved, but use as leverage to bargain to get the rate increase that they really coveted.
“That might be what the company is asking for, but it also may not be,” La Rosa responded.
Gaetz is sponsoring a bill this session (SB 354) to tighten PSC requirements for deciding the return on equity levels to which utilities are entitled. Miami-Dade County Republican Bryan Avila asked La Rosa whether the commission factors in potential compensation, benefits, or bonuses for utility  executives.
“Probably every single time,” La Rosa said.
The committee ultimately unanimously approved La Rosa’s confirmation to serve on the PSC for another four years, but not before both Bradley and Gaetz both got a last word in.
“This was a situation that really was a black eye and I want to make sure that going forward that’s not the case,” Bradley said. “That, going forward, things are different.”
PSC put on notice
Gaetz added that next year the PSC and the public will likely see legislation similar to what he proposed this year regarding how much investor-owned public utilities can earn. “If you see it, it will be based on the commission’s performance between now and next year. And if the commission was a little troubled by the legislation this year, you ain’t seen nothin’ yet.”
Last December wasn’t the first time the Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice has bashed the PSC for what he said were inadequate orders. In 2023, he questioned whether the commission had adequately justified the approval of a 2021 legal settlement that increased base electric rates for Florida Power & Light.
“There’s no explanation whatsoever for the PSC’s thinking on how it got to approving this,” Muñiz said at the time.
“From a judicial review perspective and from a matter of the PSC complying with its obligations, how can the order not address the major issues that are in dispute in a way that allows us to kind of have a window into what the rational process was that led to the finding that it was in the public interest?”

Rhode Island’s state health department lost roughly $31.2 million in unspent federal grants after President Donald Trump’s administration initiated a sweeping removal of pandemic-era subsidies last week.  
Rhode Island’s Congressional Delegation is not too happy about the cuts, which affect four health department programs in the Ocean State. While the grants funding these programs originated in the COVID-19 pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) enlarged the grants’ purpose over time, and the money supported state efforts centered around vaccination, pandemic readiness and infectious disease surveillance. 
“This funding was critical to saving lives and keeping the health care system afloat in unprecedented circumstances,” the state’s congressional delegates wrote in a letter released Friday. “It would be pennywise and pound-foolish to claw back the federal investment in this work.” 
U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and U.S. Reps. Seth Magaziner and Gabe Amo signed the letter imploring U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., whose agency is responsible for the CDC, to undo the cuts.
The letter came three days after the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) learned that, like many other states, it would lose grant funding related to COVID-era programs. Joseph Wendelken, a health department spokesperson, said via email Monday that there was no news from the federal government since last week. 
Wendelken said the cuts would affect four programs funded by CDC grants:

Rhode Island Immunization and Vaccines for Children, set to end on June 30. 
Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity work, set to end on July 31, 2026.
Rhode Island Initiative to Address COVID-19 Health Disparities, set to end on May 31. 
Rhode Island Community Health Workers for COVID Response and Resilient Communities, set to end on Aug. 30.

Some of the money from these programs has already been spent, so the $31 million represents the remaining unspent balance. These programs, Wendelken wrote, help constitute “the public health infrastructure that surrounds vaccination in Rhode Island,” including services like vaccination clinics, monitoring and outbreak responses for contagious diseases and foodborne illnesses, and core laboratory functions at state health department laboratories.   
The office of Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee is also concerned about the funds being yanked away.
“The clawback of funds that had already been allocated to Rhode Island is very concerning,” Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for the governor, said in a statement. “Our legal team is digging into this matter further and working with both RIDOH and the Attorney General’s Office to discuss the State’s options.”
  Dr. Jerome ‘Jerry’ Larkin, director of the Rhode Island Department of Health, testifies before a subcommittee of the Rhode Island House Committee on Finance during a routine, annual hearing on the department’s budget on March 25, 2025. Larkin was confirmed as the agency’s head less than a year ago. ‘We certainly live in interesting times. In the last two months, we’ve had a period of great flux,’ Larkin told lawmakers.

Job losses, lower immunization rates predicted
The bad news first arrived to state lawmakers during a presentation at the Rhode Island State House last week. Each year, the House Committee on Finance holds hearings on the many sections of the governor’s proposed budget, with Finance subcommittees listening to testimony from each state agency and department about its needs for the upcoming fiscal year.   
But the health department did not have good news to relay to state representatives to the finance subcommittee on Human Services on March 25. Chantale Sarrasin, principal legislative budget analyst for the House Fiscal Advisory Staff, was the bearer of bad news.
“The department was notified today that remaining COVID-19 grant funds are targeted for federal recapture,” Sarrasin told the subcommittee during her presentation on the governor’s proposed $292 million budget for the department in the upcoming fiscal year. 
The state health department has received about $410 million in CDC grants since the pandemic began in 2020, Sarrasin said, and the unspent COVID money is equivalent to about 10% of the department’s overall budget. 
But the subcommittee Chair and Democratic Rep. Teresa Tanzi of South Kingstown was most curious about the term “recaptured,” making air quotes when she repeated the phrase back to Sarrasin.   
“That’s a new word for me,” Tanzi said, asking about how that money comprised 10% of the department budget.
Sarrasin deferred to Dr. Jerome ‘Jerry’ Larkin, the health department’s director, who then took his seat before the subcommittee to testify. 
“I would not say ‘recaptured,’” Larkin said, then chuckled. “That’s their term, I think this has to be properly understood as planning for the future. It is not really related to COVID in terms of a direct response to the pandemic. It is related to COVID because we are preparing for the next pandemic with this money. So I think a recapture or looting of this money really represents a misguided attempt at getting money back and stopping us from doing what we are supposed to be doing.”
Tanzi asked what the loss of money would affect, and Larkin said there would be a direct impact on staffing, with up to 57 employees and their jobs possibly affected. The same could also be said for contractors and community partners who work with the state, Larkin added.
But the department was still unclear as to the true extent. “We’re working to understand the implications of all this,” Larkin said. 

The doctor was more willing to make a prediction when Tanzi asked if the cuts could drive immunization rates lower.
“It would certainly probably drive immunization rates lower,” Larkin said. “It’s hard to understand exactly how much lower…It’s not going to make anything better.”
The Senate confirmed Larkin as head of the health department last May, and he told the House subcommittee that he watched the budget hearings from last year to get a sense of how budget initiatives did — or didn’t — work out.  
“I guess now I know, I’ll keep that to myself for now,” Larkin told lawmakers. “This has certainly been one of the more complex positions I’ve ever held, and it certainly is a position I’m holding in a very complex time.”
Larkin returned to the State House two days after the finance subcommittee, this time to speak with the Senate Committee on Finance. He brought with him a new presentation that included slides on the cancelled grants announced two days earlier. Rhode Island’s high vaccination rates, he told senators, could be harmed by the lost funding. He also said the state and its congressional delegates are communicating with grant managers at CDC and HHS, as well as the leaders of health departments in other states who are going through the same process.    
Sen. Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat, asked Larkin how the feds communicated their selection of which grants to cancel. 
 The justification, Larkin explained, was technical. 
“In the grants, there’s this wild card term that says that the grant can be terminated for cause. The cause they invoked was that the pandemic was over,” Larkin said.  “It’s not really COVID money. It’s COVID response money. It’s a response to a situation.”

“We got a lot of change coming up, and I’m being forthright and honest with you about that, but at the end of the day, it’s putting the veteran first and making sure you get the care that you’ve earned and the care and the benefits that you have,” Collins said, during a visit to American Legion Post 141 alongside U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) on Monday.

“As they always say, motion causes friction. There’s going to be a lot of friction. There’s a lot of invested parties in keeping the VA, just like it is, the only investment I have is in you to make it better,” Collins said. 
During his visit, Collins told reporters that despite added funding and personnel, the department hadn’t improved in providing services to veterans.
As it looks to reduce its workforce, Collins said they were looking at areas that did not deal directly with veterans’ benefits or healthcare. The Department is currently assessing its agencies to determine whether its agents are performing well, where they need help and what they do not need, he said. 
The Department has added more than 80,000 employees since the 2019 fiscal year, including tens of thousands of employees hired to address claims under the 2022 PACT ACT claims, which expanded benefits to veterans exposed to burn pits. However, Collins told the crowd nobody could tell him how many employees were hired in support of the law. 
“We were hiring interior designers. We’re hiring laborers. We were hiring publicists,” Collins said. 
“We have a lot of employees in the VA that are not seeing patients. They’re not doing disability claims. They’re not doing that. They’re moving paperwork. And so we’re gonna see if someone would like to be reintroduced to a clinic and actually help patients on their daily basis,” Collins said.

However, that reduction of 80,000 positions is a goal, Collins said. While they may not get there, Collins said he made “very much of a commitment.” 
While the Department aims to cut tens of thousands of employees by August, Democrats, veterans and unions have raised concerns about how they will impact veterans, protesting nearby the Lieutenant Colonel Charles S. Kettles Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Ann Arbor.
According to a report from the Detroit Free Press, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist U.S. Reps. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) and state Rep. Joe Tate (D-Detroit) on Saturday pushed back on the Trump Administration’s cuts and the president’s move to invalidate bargaining agreements with the American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing VA employees. 
“This commitment to cut 80,000 people out of the Veterans Administration means veterans’ health care can be cut, veterans’ access to services and benefits are going to be cut,” Gilchrist told the Free Press. “The fundamental promise of being a servicewoman or a serviceman, that’s being broken.”
Earlier this month, Barrett sent a letter to Collins calling on the VA to “review and reconsider their workforce reduction process to ensure only those who have truly underperformed are relieved of duty.”
When asked if his concerns had been addressed, Barrett deflected, telling reporters he was excited the secretary had come to visit his district and was committed to his mission of improving the VA. 
“I think you heard from his remarks today the commitment that he has, and I’m excited to be working with him in that effort to make sure that we continue, as he said. The purpose of this is to deliver the benefits that our veterans have earned, and to do that respectfully. And that’s the mission that I’m committed to as well. And look forward to working with him in that effort,” Barrett said.
Collins similarly deflected when asked how many employees had been fired and rehired as after two federal judges ordered the White House to reinstate more than 24,000 probationary employees let go across 18 government agencies. 

“We’re following the courts’ orders,” he said.

More than two months later, uncertainty still hangs over the 147-turbine wind farm. Which is why SouthCoast Wind and utility companies in Rhode Island and Massachusetts announced Monday a three-month extension to finish contract negotiations — the same day final contracts were set to be executed.
“The multi-state negotiations have been complex and ambitious; now they must also tackle uncertainty presented by federal policy,” Rebecca Ullman, a SouthCoast Wind spokesperson, said in an emailed statement on Monday. SouthCoast Wind is grateful for the continued collaboration with our Massachusetts and Rhode Island partners.” 
The new June 30 deadline marks the third delay since Rhode Island and Massachusetts jointly unveiled plans in September to buy power from SouthCoast Wind following a competitive, tri-state solicitation that included Connecticut. The bulk of the power from SouthCoast’s 1,287 megawatts of “nameplate capacity” — 1,087 megawatts — would go to Massachusetts under tentative contracts with its utility companies. Rhode Island Energy was set to buy the remaining 200 megawatts of wind-powered electricity to deliver to the Ocean State’s electric grid.
The contracts lock in these commitments, and also set the price per-megawatt hour that utility companies agree to pay to the developer.  
Supply chain snafus and inflationary pressures have driven up developer costs, prompting some companies, including SouthCoast, to renege on existing pricing agreements in hopes of a more lucrative deal. That, in turn, has put more pressure on utility companies — and ratepayers — to cover their rising expenses. 
A prior attempt by Rhode Island Energy in 2023 to buy more offshore wind power was canceled after the only submission, from Danish wind giant Ørsted A/S, was deemed too expensive relative to environmental and economic benefits. 
Rough seas worsened after the November election, with Trump’s vocal anti-wind sentiment creating alarm for states that already set mandates to bring in offshore wind power.

SouthCoast parent company was ready for delays 
Ocean Winds, the European parent company of SouthCoast Wind, told investors last month it was slashing the value of its North American portfolio by €267 million (equal to $275 million) to account for delays in its three U.S. wind farms, including SouthCoast.
Company executives stressed that the writedown was a “precautionary measure” tied to federal uncertainty under the Trump administration. At most, they projected a four-year delay in completion of the SouthCoast Wind project.
Construction on SouthCoast Wind was originally slated to begin in 2026, delivering power to the electric grid by the end of the decade. The project has already received its requisite environmental and construction plan federal approvals under the Biden administration.
Lauren Diggin, a spokesperson for the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources, alluded to federal political headwinds slowing contract negotiations in a statement Monday.
“The utilities and developers continue their hard work to negotiate and memorialize the bids in binding contracts,” Diggin said in an emailed response Monday. “Federal policy is an important factor in these projects and the parties are working to gain greater certainty before finalizing the contracts.”
Robert Beadle, a spokesperson for Rhode Island’s Office of Energy Resources, declined to comment about Trump’s executive order, but said the agency “remains in communication” regarding the SouthCoast Wind contract.
Gov. Dan McKee’s office did not immediately return inquiries for comment on Monday.










The multi-state negotiations have been complex and ambitious; now they must also tackle uncertainty presented by federal policy.


– Rebecca Ullman, a SouthCoast Wind spokesperson


Rep. Michelle McGaw, a Portsmouth Democrat whose district includes the proposed underwater cable route for SouthCoast Wind, hoped the latest contract extension would bring more clarity to how federal policy affects already permitted wind projects.
“It’s hard to make concrete decisions in an environment where there’s so much uncertainty,” McGaw said in an interview Monday. “If this was a new application, we know exactly where this would lie, but because they are so far along in the process, there is more of a question.”
Rhode Island’s economic and environmental future hinges on its stake in the wind industry. Offshore wind is critical to meeting the state’s decarbonization mandates under the Act on Climate Law. A single offshore wind project like the 704-megawatt Revolution Wind project under construction south of Block Island, can offset over 1 million metric tons of carbon emissions each year — just shy of 10% of the gross greenhouse gas emissions tracked from Rhode Island in 2022. 
“The long-term benefits of offshore wind remain critical to our region, and we must recognize that the current economic and market uncertainty presents a challenge to the industry,” said Amanda Barker, clean energy program coordinator at Green Energy Consumers Alliance and the Rhode Island state lead for New England for Offshore Wind. “While patience is critical in navigating today’s landscape, we know that the states and developers are dedicated to our shared climate, economic, and energy independence goals and we need to find a way to get these projects over the finish line as soon as feasible.”
Wind power offers a more stable supply of electricity compared with natural gas too — top-of-mind for McGaw on the heels of another winter plagued by volatile spikes in electricity bills for Rhode Islanders.
“We’ve been reading and hearing so much from constituents who are frustrated with their utility bills,” McGaw said. “So much of that is related to an unstable fossil fuel market.”
Yet public perception of offshore wind remains divided.
Nearly 6 in 10 Rhode Islanders surveyed as part of a 2024 Rhode Island Current poll conducted by MassInc Polling Group supported offshore wind, compared with 34% of those who disapproved. But among the state’s registered Democrats, support grew to a decisive 68%, while 6 in 10 registered Republicans disapproved.

Nantucket challenges federal review 
On Thursday, the town of Nantucked filed a federal lawsuit in U.S. District Court in D.C. against the federal agencies that approved the SouthCoast Wind project, contending that the yearslong environmental review of the project was flawed.
Matt Fee, vice chair of the Nantucket Select Board, said in a statement that the lawsuit was about protecting the island’s economy, which depends on “heritage tourism.”
“This is not about protecting rich people’s views,” Fee said.
However, Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island chapter of AFL-CIO and co-chair of Climate Jobs Rhode Island, disagreed.
“Nantucket is not known for its embracing of working-class culture,” Crowley said in an interview. “It’s the playground of the rich and famous.”
Ocean Winds’ Brown defended the federal review of its project in a statement Monday.
“BOEM conducted a rigorous environmental and historic preservation review process, which began in 2021,” Brown said. “Nantucket and its representatives were active participants throughout the entire process. We remain very confident in the thoroughness of the federal review and will continue to monitor the situation closely.” Crowley remains a vocal supporter of offshore wind because of the opportunities it presents for union workers who can help build and service wind projects across the region. He wasn’t troubled by delays in SouthCoast Wind contract negotiations, nor the looming threat of the Trump administration.
“As long as it gets built, and it gets built using my members, that’s the important thing,” Crowley said.
Assuming Rhode Island Energy completes contract negotiations by June 30, the proposed pricing agreement and estimated revenue would be submitted to the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission by Aug. 25, according to an updated timeline on the state’s wind procurement website. Utility regulators have final authority over long-term renewable energy contracts under state law.

(Photo courtesy of Washington State Department of Transportation)Washington state senators revealed a proposal Monday to raise billions of dollars to pay for the court-ordered removal of culverts blocking the migration of salmon and other fish. 
The plan included in the Senate’s capital budget would bond up to $5 billion over the next 15 years and repay the debt with revenue from an existing tax on electrical utilities.
That’s at least how much lawmakers believe the state still needs to fully fund culvert removals in light of a decades-spanning court case in which a federal judge ruled in 2013 that the state had violated tribes’ treaty fishing rights. 
The judge ordered an injunction forcing the state to pay to correct its barriers that impede salmon and steelhead migration in western Washington. In a tied vote in 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ruling. 
The goal has been to open up 90% of the habitat that culverts have long blocked by 2030. 
But last year, state officials told the judge overseeing the case they couldn’t meet that target, as projects have ballooned in cost and new culverts have been discovered. The one project that has gotten perhaps the most scrutiny could require buying a motel in Port Angeles to tear out the culvert beneath, to the tune of $100 million.
The agency estimates needing to deal with another 300 barriers to hit the 90% benchmark. The most expensive remaining culvert projects range from $80 million to $240 million, a transportation department spokesperson said Monday.
“We hope to be able to deliver those projects in different ways,” Sen. Marko Liias, the chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, told reporters last week. “Maybe there’s some other way to deliver a repair up there that doesn’t lead to tearing down that motel.”
The tribes and the state entered confidential mediation this month in the court case to discuss a new path that recognizes the state’s limited resources.
“The state’s about to walk into mediation with the tribes with nothing,” said Sen. Yasmin Trudeau, a Democrat from Tacoma and the Senate’s lead capital budget writer. “We have an obligation by the state of Washington to tribes that we’re not meeting and unable to meet.”

In 2023, the latest year for which data is available, the state’s transportation department completed 32 fish barrier projects covered by the injunction that impacted over 67 miles of upstream habitat. In total, as of last June, transportation officials said they had restored 571 miles of habitat in work related to the court order.
State money for culvert projects has previously come through the separate transportation budget, but its balance sheet is facing a billion-dollar shortfall over the next two years and growing. So senators turned to the capital budget. 
The transportation budget from House Democrats unveiled last week did not include such a funding switch, instead earmarking more than $3.1 billion over the next three budget cycles to pay for barrier elimination.
How to bridge the chambers’ diverging approaches, will be a “leadership call at the end of the day,” Trudeau said.
The Senate’s transportation budget, which passed off the floor Saturday, does still touch on culverts, aiming to expedite the permit review process for removals.
The Senate plan
A little over half of the state tax on electrical utilities, redirected to the Federal Injunction Salmon Habitat (or FISH, for short) account, would back the bonds proposed under Senate Bill 5804. 
Trudeau said the plan won’t impact ratepayers.
That tax revenue usually goes toward grants and loans for local public works departments. Senators propose backfilling that with $150 million of other bonds.
Going into this legislative session, the expectation was that lawmakers would sweep that public works funding to pay for other things given the state’s budget shortfall, Trudeau said.
“We’re not decimating public works, which is what I think everybody anticipated out of this session,” she said. “But in fact, we’ve added more money.”
Republican lawmakers have pushed to use income from the state’s carbon auctions to pay for culvert removals, but Democrats haven’t budged on their belief that the money must go specifically to decarbonization efforts.
The approach announced Monday has bipartisan support, with two Republican senators signed on as cosponsors.
The bill is set for a public hearing Tuesday afternoon in the Ways and Means Committee. A vote on the Senate floor could come as soon as Saturday. 
The legislative session is scheduled to end April 27. The next biennial budget begins July 1.

A judge last week placed a preliminary injunction against part of Senate File 496. The law, which the Iowa Legislature passed in 2023, prohibits school libraries from providing books deemed not age appropriate and primarily focuses on any book that includes “sex acts.”
Christy Hickman, general counsel for the Iowa State Education Association and representing ISEA as a plaintiff, said she was “incredibly relieved for our members.” Those members include educators at all levels. Teachers now “wouldn’t have to be concerned about their employment or their licensure being in jeopardy in the event they didn’t interpret this incredibly vague law incorrectly,” she said.

Some school districts, however, won’t be quick to change internal guidance on the law. “Given the number of injunctions and appeals, Southeast Polk is not taking any additional action with books at this time,” Jeannie Christenson, community relations coordinator at Southeast Polk Community School District, said. “We have not yet returned any of the removed titles to shelves, and we will continue to monitor legal developments.”
Federal District Judge Stephen Locher, in the Southern District of Iowa, had placed an injunction on SF 496 before, but the State of Iowa appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit. The appeals court ruled Locher had not performed the correct “analysis” on the case and sent it back to Locher’s court. This time, Locher’s analysis weighed the unconstitutional applications of the law against the constitutional ones, which in his ruling he admitted is “hard to do” for this case.
Still, Locher ruled “the law has been unconstitutionally applied in dozens (if not hundreds) of situations and constitutionally applied in one.”
Locher wrote in his ruling that the law “places the burden on local school districts and school officials to determine whether a book is permitted” and that “this is the whole point of the law’s penalty provisions: local officials and districts are subject to punishment if they get it wrong.”
The law put educators in a “precarious state … by passing this bill and not giving them a lot of direction about how to carry it out,” Hickman said. “I don’t even know where I would start to explain the heaviness of that.”
A student plaintiff in the lawsuit calls the injunction a “huge step in the right direction.” Grace Van Gundy, a senior at Urbandale High School, and the only student in the lawsuit, said she wants her fellow students “to feel reassured about the injunction and remember that there are still government officials looking out for our best interests—even if it doesn’t always feel like it.”
She said the decision “solidifies the importance of education and that proves we will not tolerate attempts at censorship.”
Despite the ruling, Van Gundy believes that “there is still work to do. The fight is not over.”
Locher’s preliminary injunction could once again be appealed to the Eighth Circuit based on the new analysis of the law. Hickman said she expects the state will appeal.
If that’s the case, she said the appeals court will have “a very, very extensive decision with analysis of multiple different (legal) tests, so the Eighth Circuit will have a very fair record to make a final determination,” Hickman said.
Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird in a statement alluded to the state taking this case further and wrote in part, “This common sense law makes certain that the books kids have access to in school classrooms and libraries are age-appropriate.

SF 496 also prohibits the instruction of sexual orientation and gender identity in K-6 curriculum. Iowa Safe Schools has filed a lawsuit against that part of the law. Locher is expected to also rule on that case.

Maggie Nurrenbern, right, listens as Clay County Presiding Commissioner Jerry Nolte speaks Monday in favor of her bill authorizing a Clay County sports and convention center authority. (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent)Two identical bills to give state backing for a new sports and convention center in Clay County are not an attempt to poach the Kansas City Chiefs or Royals from Jackson County, legislators were told Monday during a Senate committee hearing.
Instead, the bill sponsors said, the intent is to provide another location for new facilities for one or both of the teams in order to ensure they stay in Missouri .
“This has never been about pitting Jackson against Clay County,” said state Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Democrat from the Clay County portion of Kansas City. “This is making sure that the teams have all the options on the table to find a spot that will work well for them.”
Nurrenbern, who represents about two-thirds of Clay County, was joined by state Sen. Kurtis Gregory, a Republican from Marshall whose district has the remainder of Clay County.
As he ran for the Senate last year, Gregory said, he was asked repeatedly what could be done to keep the teams in Missouri. 
“If they go to another state, we’re looking at easily another 50, 60, 70 years, before we’ve got a shot to get them back,” he said.
With only seven weeks to go in the session, Gregory said after the hearing that he and Nurrenbern will be looking for a bill that can be amended to carry the legislation.
The bills would authorize a new Clay County Sports Complex Authority, modeled on the Jackson County organization that owns the Truman Sports Complex in eastern Kansas City where the Chiefs play home games in Arrowhead Stadium and the Royals play next door in Kauffman Stadium. The stadiums were built in the 1960s and leases for both teams run through the end of the 2030 season.
The bill would authorize a state payment of up to $3 million annually to support the authority if it leases its facility to a team in the NFL, NBA, NHL or Major League Baseball. The payment would only be made if lawmakers approve it in annual appropriation bills and only in an amount equal to the support from local governments.
The likelihood one or both teams will move is high after Kansas lawmakers last year passed several incentives intended to lure them across the state line.
The Royals first announced an intention to leave Kauffman Stadium in November 2022. The move would allow the Chiefs to remain in Arrowhead, demolish Kauffman and build a covered entertainment center.
In the spring of 2023, Clay County leaders announced interest in building a stadium in North Kansas City that could become the Royals new home.
Campaign committee controlled by KC mayor requested poll he denied involvement in

Soon after Clay County entered the conversation, a poll was leaked to the media widely seen as an effort to discredit the offer. It showed 70% of Clay County voters opposed a new sales tax to fund a stadium in North Kansas City. 
No one took responsibility for the poll at the time. It wasn’t until more than a year later that documents provided to The Independent revealed it was a political action committee formed to support Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas that paid for the Clay County polling.
The effort to relocate the Royals to a new downtown stadium stalled when voters last year rejected a proposal to extend a 3/8-cent sales tax to help finance a downtown Kansas City baseball stadium and upgrades to Arrowhead Stadium.
Clay County is angling for both the Royals’ new home and for a new Chiefs training facility.
Clay County officials testifying Monday said their top priority is to find a solution to team facility needs that keeps both teams in Missouri.
“We have worked with local businesses, and we have worked with the local municipalities to make sure that we are all speaking with one voice, and it would be our pleasure to be able to add our voice to that of the state of Missouri,” Clay County Presiding Commissioner Jerry Nolte said.
But if the teams stay put at the Truman Sports Complex, move downtown or cross the state line, having the authority structure will help Clay County compete for other business, Clay County Associate Commissioner Scott Wagner said.
“This tool,” Wagner said, “can be helpful to us in the future for other sorts of teams, other sorts of opportunities that could potentially come to Clay County.”

If it receives Gov. Brian Kemp’s signature, Senate Bill 1 will require all schools from elementary through college to designate teams as male, female and co-ed based on sex at birth and ban those assigned male at birth from playing on female teams. It also restricts access to facilities like restrooms, locker rooms and sleeping quarters during athletic events.
“This legislation does not target individuals, it targets inequities,” said Homer Republican Rep. Chris Erwin, who chairs the House Education Committee. “It safeguards the decades of progress made in women’s athletics by reaffirming the state’s interest in promoting equal opportunity and preventing unfair advantages.”
“This bill speaks to the heart of athletic integrity,” he added. “It is about ensuring that every child, regardless of gender, has a chance to compete safely and fairly.”
  Rep. Karen Lupton. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Three House Democrats joined Republicans in supporting the bill: Augusta Rep. Lynn Heffner, Macon Rep. Tangie Herring and Valdosta Rep. Dexter Sharper. Another 13 House Democrats did not vote on the bill.
In the Senate, Dawson Sen. Freddie Powell Sims was the only Democrat to join all Senate Republicans to vote in support of the bill.
Chamblee Democratic Rep. Karen Lupton characterized the bill as hateful and useless.

“If this is a shield for girls in sports, you’d think that there’d be lots of coaches, lots of schools that run sports programs, lots of athletes coming up, storming the castle, and saying, ‘oh my gosh, we need this now,’” Lupton said. “Instead, the people who spoke to the bill were athletes who are currently competing with and against transgender athletes. We had clergy speak against SB1. We had parents of transgender children speak against SB1. Not a single coach. Not a single athletic organization.”
Lilburn Democratic Rep. Jasmine Clark said the bill will harm transgender people and could sweep up transgender and cisgender women and girls into invasive gender checks.
Clark gave examples of people who have been adversely affected by anti-trans laws in other states, including cisgender women who were followed into the ladies’ room by male police and a transgender male wrestler who won a women’s championship after not being allowed to compete against boys.
“We have created a bill that is a license to harass, a license to bully, a license to harm, and these actual athletes do not want this,” she said.” They did not ask for this. And I think that that is a problem.”

Fayetteville Republican Rep. Josh Bonner, who carried the bill in the House, ended debate with the story of a friend of his daughter who he said got beat up by “a boy pretending to be a girl.”
“Biological males have an inherent physiological advantage. Allowing that advantage on the field places females up at risk,” he said.
“A yes vote provides a necessary protection for my daughter and thousands of other female athletes in Georgia,” he added.
Gov. Brian Kemp has indicated support for a transgender sports ban. After the session ends on Friday, he will have 40 days to sign it into law or to allow it to become law without his signature.

The panel also sent five other bills to the Senate floor dealing with topics ranging from national guard scholarships to attendance policies. The anti-bullying legislation was the only bill that did not receive unanimous support during the meeting.
House File 865 would redefine “harassment” and “bullying” as “repeated and targeted” actions. The bill removes from current law a list of 17 traits or characteristics of a targeted student that would fall under bullying, including gender identity, sexuality, race, political belief and familial status.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Sen. Sandy Salmon, R-Janesville, said schools have used the current list of possible traits and characteristics to say their hands are tied when instances of bullying have not fallen under what is in Iowa code, leading to confusion and unequal treatment of students.
“These changes to the law ensure that all students are protected no matter what their particular traits or characteristics are,” Salmon said. “This removes any confusion schools may have about what constitutes bullying, and simplifies and clarifies the issue.”
Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, voiced two concerns over the legislation, the first with changing the definitions of bullying and harassment.
“That’s a problem for me, because we should have a zero tolerance policy on bullying of any kind in our schools,” Trone Garriott said. “That’s the concern I hear from parents, is that schools are not taking bullying seriously and they’re not reporting it.”
Trone Garriott also took issue with removing the list of characteristics for schools to look toward for reporting bullying. She said the list is broad and not limiting for schools, and being able to identify specifically what the bullying is about is helpful for school response and for research into larger trends.
While Sen. Mike Zimmer, D-DeWitt, agreed with Trone Garriott’s point about specified characteristics being a good resource for schools, he said defining bullying as being targeted and repeated would be helpful in allowing school staff to take the direction of their interventions with students that makes the most sense for the situation.
The bill passed with a vote of 11-5.
This was the committee’s first meeting since the week of the first “funnel” deadline in the Iowa Legislature on March 7, with the second funnel only days away. Most policy bills have to receive approval from one chamber and a committee in the opposite chamber to remain eligible for debate after this week. Budget and tax bills are exempt from the funnel and bills that do not make the deadline could be revived as amendments to other bills.
More education action
Most of the bills passed out of the committee Monday saw no dissent from members.
Bills passed unanimously without discussion included House File 117, which would establish a new scholarship program for National Guard members earning certification rather than a degree and House File 392, allowing public and nonpublic schools grades K-12 to apply for a year-round academic calendar.
Zimmer expressed his support for House File 393, also passed unanimously, which would change how performance grades for attendance centers are calculated by no longer counting instances where a student has dropped out then came back to school more than once.
Trone Garriott also raised concerns about House File 870, but voted for it alongside the rest of the members. She said she worried the legislation, which would change Iowa’s compulsory attendance law to include exemptions for students attending religious instruction, is duplicative as there are already religious exemptions for teaching in Iowa code.
Several bills deferred
Sen. Lynn Evans, chair of the education committee, said three bills were deferred and would likely be brought up again at the committee’s Thursday meeting.
Senate File 269, passed out of subcommittee just hours before, would bar state universities from requiring diversity, equity and inclusion or critical race theory content in academic courses. House File 703 would change information provided to students by state loan programs and financial aid advisors and House File 189 would set requirements for public school districts with nonpublic school students wishing to participate in extracurricular athletics.

(Courtesy of Dakota Scout)A South Dakota lawsuit against the NCAA will stay in state court rather than move to federal court, a judge has decided.
The NCAA is the governing body for the highest level of collegiate athletics. State Attorney General Marty Jackley and the South Dakota Board of Regents sued the NCAA last year, alleging that a proposed $2.8 billion settlement meant to compensate college athletes would disproportionately burden smaller colleges, including schools like South Dakota State University and the University of South Dakota.
The NCAA filed a motion to move the case into federal court, saying the settlement’s provisions and implications stretch across state lines.
U.S. District Judge Karen Schreier signed an order Friday denying the NCAA’s request to move the lawsuit out of state court. Jackley praised the decision in a Monday news release.
Dates for further state court proceedings in Brookings County have not been scheduled.
The proposed $2.8 billion nationwide settlement for college athletes that motivated the lawsuit is an outgrowth of a 2021 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that the NCAA’s previous practice of banning payments for student athletes violated antitrust laws. The settlement would require NCAA member schools to contribute to the settlement fund over the course of a decade.
Jackley said South Dakota wants a court order requiring an NCAA vote on how it intends to have schools pay for the settlement. That would allow South Dakota’s and other states’ universities to have a voice in the settlement that the NCAA has so far denied them, Jackley said.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)The U.S. Department of Education is putting Virginia schools on notice, warning they could lose federal funding and face further investigation if they fail to comply with parental rights laws.
On Friday, the department directed Virginia and other states to submit documentation proving compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA), specifically regarding key “priority concerns” by April 30.
These concerns include parental rights to inspect and review education records, student safety, annual notification of rights, military recruiter access, and overall compliance. 
The directive follows reports that state educational agencies and school divisions are hiding critical information from parents, such as details about a child’s gender transition, or their mental and physical wellbeing.
The Virginia Department of Education did not respond to an inquiry for comment.
Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon directed the SPPO to investigate California and Maine for similar violations, accusing the states of enacting policies that prevent parents from accessing records related to their child’s gender transition.
The federal agency emphasized that laws like FERPA and PPRA override state policies.
“Parents are the most natural protectors of their children. Yet many states and school districts have enacted policies that imply students need protection from their parents,” McMahon said in a March 28 statement.
The department is accusing states and school districts of turning “the concept of privacy on its head” by prioritizing government officials’ concerns over those of parents and families. McMahon noted that moving forward, the correct application of FERPA will be to “empower all parents to protect their children from the radical ideologies that have taken over many schools.” 
In Virginia, Gov. Glenn Youngkin has consistently made parental rights a cornerstone of his administration. Along with his Republican colleagues, Youngkin has leaned on a state law asserting that “a parent has a fundamental right to make decisions concerning the upbringing, education, and care of the parent’s child.”
His administration has enacted several measures to reinforce these rights, including executive orders that require parents to be notified about drug overdoses and make mask-wearing optional. 
The governor also adopted legislation mandating that parents be informed about sexually explicit instructional materials in school libraries. Additionally, a proposal was put forward to require schools to notify parents if a student wishes to change their name, nickname or pronouns as listed in official records.
However, last week, Youngkin proposed an amendment to a bill backed by Democrats, which mandates school boards to send annual notifications to parents regarding the safe storage of prescription drugs and firearms. 
His amendment could derail the proposal, as it would require schools to notify at least one parent if a student seeks help from a social worker regarding their gender identity, and gain parental permission before any further action is taken.
The General Assembly is set to take up the amendment during Wednesday’s reconvened session.

Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer.Hundreds rallied at the Minnesota Capitol on Monday to celebrate transgender visibility, praising Minnesota’s protections for trans people while confronting the Trump administration’s hostility toward trans Americans.
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult to love a country that doesn’t really seem to want to love me back,” said Vanessa Sheridan, a transgender Air Force veteran, told attendees of the Minnesota Capitol rally. “The anti-trans forces in Washington are writing executive orders and laws that limit the civil rights of transgender American citizens. But do not be deceived. This is only a first step. Their ultimate goal is to eliminate us all together.”
Monday was the first national Transgender Day of Visibility in President Donald Trump’s second administration. Trump has signed numerous anti-trans executive orders, including restricting gender-affirming care for youth; directing the Department of Defense to create a new policy excluding transgender people from service; and another banning trans women and girls from participating in female sports.
Minnesota is an outlier among Midwestern states, with laws that protect people seeking or providing gender-affirming care.
Gov. Tim Walz, who signed trans-friendly bills in 2023, spoke at the rally, telling attendees that Minnesota will always be a welcoming place for transgender people. Walz said that Republicans are putting trans people’s lives at risk for political gain.
“They’ve chosen to demonize a marginalized community for their own selfish reasons,” Walz said. “Now is the time to stand up. We don’t need to recalibrate to think we can win elections by throwing some group of people under the damn bus. This battle has gone on for a long time, and it will continue to go on.”
Since the 2024 election, Democrats nationally have been grappling with how to handle transgender policies. Some Democrats have grown weary and wary of defending positions like allowing trans girls to play school sports, when a majority of Americans side with Republicans on the issue.
Kat Rohn, executive director of the LGBTQ advocacy organization OutFront Minnesota, said it’s important to celebrate wins for trans people whenever they come, like when House Democrats recently voted down a House Republican bill banning trans girls from participating in female sports in Minnesota.
“These are important wins and ones we should rightly celebrate, even in a moment that feels hard, and they didn’t just materialize out of nowhere,” Rohn said. “They were the product of our state’s long history of LGBTQ organizing, the product of trans voices and trans leaders at the heart of conversations around our communities, lives and needs. They were the product of a state that fundamentally believes we all belong.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2181-1024x528.jpg,,,2025-03-31 18:06:02.220908

At the very least, he’s added a new wrinkle to an emerging confrontation between Gov. Ron DeSantis and House Speaker Daniel Perez that could complicate negotiations over a state budget for the 2025-26 fiscal year.

  Daniel Perez via Florida House
In a letter to members of the Senate, Ben Albritton acknowledged DeSantis’s call to eliminate property taxes next year and, prior to that, to provide an average $1,000 rebate to the 5.1 million homesteaded properties across Florida this year as well as Perez’s call to permanently roll back the state’s sales tax.
Perez’s proposal would reduce the state’s coffers by about $5 billion annually and DeSantis’s proposal by at least that amount.
“These are both significant ideas, worthy of our thought and consideration,” Albritton wrote. “However, at this point, I believe it is prudent that a final tax cut package of this size be predominantly nonrecurring, while permanent tax cuts are explored during the interim.”
Nonrecurring means one-time tax cuts that would have to be renewed if the Legislature wants to do that next year. The Legislature routinely passes large tax packages but most of the reductions aren’t permanent. For instance, lawmakers passed a $1.14 billion tax plan last year but just $110 million represented continuing spending.
Albritton advised senators to keep an open mind but added:
“Cutting taxes now does little good if they have to be raised two years from now to address budget shortfalls. No one wants a repeat of the Great Recession, and we’ve done our best to avoid that by [reining] in spending, paying down debt, and setting aside significant reserves,” Albritton wrote. 
“There are cumulative impacts to every tax cut. We need to do our due diligence and understand those impacts, combined with the projected budget shortfalls already on the horizon. 
“Florida is not Washington, D.C., California, or New York. We take great pride in our balanced budget, low taxes, and responsible fiscal planning that have made our state the envy of the nation.”
DeSantis that very morning reiterated his call for property tax cuts, which would require ratification by the voters through a state constitutional amendment, possibly on the 2026 general election ballot. If the Legislature doesn’t say yes to that this year, or to a sales tax cut from 6% to 5.25%, as Perez proposes, it would have time to act during next year’s legislative session.
Regressive
The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy has judged Florida’s sale tax the most regressive in the country, meaning that it falls most heavily on those who can least afford it, in terms of its bite into household income. On the other hand, collections benefit from spending by tourists and winter residents.
DeSantis, for his part, argues property taxes mean “ponying up money to the government just for the courtesy of using your own property.”
Albritton observed that the Legislature is near the half-way point of its 2025 session.
“At the end of the day, I’m not comfortable passing a budget that is balanced for this year, but likely creates major shortfalls down the road,” he wrote. 
“Cutting waste and inefficiency plays an important role in responsible spending; however, there is a cost associated with maintaining our transportation, clean water, and health care infrastructure, ensuring universal school choice for every family, hurricane response and recovery, and of course public safety. We owe it to taxpayers to get this right.”
The tax rift is likely to make it more difficult for the Legislature to complete the one thing it is required to do every annual session: Pass a state budget.
The House and Senate released early iterations of proposed spending plans for state fiscal year 2025-2026 that would spend $112.95 billion and $117.36 billion, respectively.
That means there’s a $4.4 billion difference between the proposals that must be negotiated and settled before the chambers can begin fine tuning how to spend the money.
The spending difference climbs to $4.6 billion if the $200 million appropriation in the Rural Renaissance initiative championed by Albritton is taken into consideration.
Both proposed budgets are less than the existing spending of $118.6 billion.

“Donald Trump and Elon Musk are stiffing our farmers and processors — taking away resources these folks were guaranteed, threatening small businesses’ ability to stay open and people’s livelihoods,” said Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin), one of 17 cosponsors.
In addition to 15 Democrats, two independent senators who caucus with them, Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine, signed on to the bill.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has stopped reimbursing farmers and farm organizations for money they’ve spent, despite contracts they have already signed with the agency. The contracts call for farmers to be reimbursed for expenses they incur under the contracts.
Honor Farmer Contracts Act, introduced by Sen. Cory Booker (D-New Jersey), would require USDA “to release illegally withheld funding for all contracts and agreements previously entered into by the U.S. Department of Agriculture,” Baldwin’s office said in a statement announcing the legislation.
Under President Donald Trump, “USDA has refused to make reimbursement payments to fulfill signed contracts, without any indication of when or whether farmers will be paid the money they paid out and are owed,” Baldwin’s office said.
Farmers and organizations serving them contract with the USDA for various programs to connect with local markets and improve their productivity. The department then pays farmers back for the expenses they incur under those contracts. The department’s failure to pay strains finances both for the individual farmers and for the organizations that work with them under the programs, Baldwin’s office said.
The legislation would require USDA to unfreeze all signed agreements and make all past due payments as quickly as possible. It would also bar the department from canceling agreements or contracts unless there has been a failure to comply with their terms and conditions.
The bill would prohibit the department from closing county offices, field offices or centers of the Farm Service Agency, the Natural Resources Conservation Service or the Rural Development Service without notification at least 60 days in advance and justifying the closing to Congress.
On March 7, Baldwin said the USDA had resumed another previously stalled stream of funding, $6.5 million in grants for dairy businesses to diversify and market their products.
Baldwin has also demanded the Trump administration to reverse its cancellation in March of a program connecting farmers to local food banks.

Democrat-drafted proposals in the two chambers are demonstrably different in how much is spent on special education, what grant programs are cut and when state funds are distributed to school districts.
And it’s unclear what Democrats will do if new taxes they are counting on for billions of dollars for education are not approved.
Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal noted this week that the share of the operating budget going to public schools would be about the same in the Senate plan, while in the House proposal it would continue to shrink. 
“We’re trying to figure out how much of each budget relies on the revenue,” he added.
The current budget, which runs through June 30, spends roughly $31.2 billion of the general fund — the cache of state tax dollars used to fund day-to-day operations — on public schools. That works out to roughly 43%, down from the high-water mark of over 50% in 2019.
The Senate is proposing a two-year $78.5 billion budget, of which $34.3 billion of the general fund – 43.7% – would go to public schools. The House drew up a $77.8 billion plan, of which $33.2 billion, or 43%, is penciled in for education.
The Senate approved its operating budget on Saturday with only Democratic support.  The House is expected to vote on its package Monday. Once passed, authors will begin negotiating to reconcile differences as they work to get a deal ahead of April 27, the last scheduled day of the session.
Tackling the cost drivers
In dollars and cents, the single largest difference between the two budgets is funding of special education in the state’s 295 public school districts.
The Senate plan contains a $1 billion increase in the next biennium compared to $188.9 million in the House. 
The state distributes an amount of money for each student enrolled in a school, plus additional dollars for each special education student under a formula known as the multiplier.
What is in the Senate budget intends to cover the cost of lifting a cap on state funding for special education programs, covering these services for those up to age 22, and increasing the multiplier to drive more dollars to districts. Most of the House dollars cover expenses from a higher multiplier.
Another financial challenge for school districts is the surge in prices for materials, supplies and general operating costs, including insurance premiums, natural gas rates and utility charges. Reykdal had pushed for $350 million more in the next budget. 
The Senate wrote in an additional $175 million for the coming two years; the House has no increased funding.
But the House wants to increase Local Effort Assistance funding by $200 a student in 2026 and $300 a student in 2027. That adds up to an added $217 million for property-poor districts,  funding they can use for programs and activities not funded by the state.
There is a catch. Those additional dollars are tied to a proposed House bill to raise the cap on annual property tax collections. The legislation has yet to be voted on.
The Senate made no changes in the Local Effort Assistance funding formula.

Big cuts 
One of the single largest reductions in each budget concerns nearly three-dozen academic enrichment and technical education programs paid for with grants.
The House logs $138 million in savings by eliminating funding for all but one dealing with financial education. In the Senate proposal, $48.9 million is trimmed, ensuring partial or full funding of many of the undertakings.
Affected programs range from instruction in aerospace and advanced manufacturing to civics education and science and technology fields, according to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction.
Both budgets count on saving roughly $75 million by funding enrollment in the Transition to Kindergarten program at its current level and not paying for expanded enrollment as planned. The program, created two years ago, provides children under 5 years old with additional help in preparing for kindergarten. It’s been popular and enrollment has been projected to grow.
And each budget is targeting the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction for cuts.
The Senate wants Reykdal to shave $4.3 million in administrative costs, plus another $3 million collectively from an array of statewide programs. These include preventing youth suicide and bullying and improving students’ math skills and reading literacy. The agency needs to cut $1.8 million in administrative expenses in the House budget, but the statewide programs are unscathed.
Making the numbers work
State funds are paid out monthly to school districts through what’s known as apportionment. Both chambers employ a similar gimmick with this process to reduce spending in the next budget and balance out their ledgers.
The House adjusts the percentage of monthly payouts to be lower in the months before July, when new fiscal years begin, and higher in August. By doing so, Democrats shift $396.7 million of spending out of the 2025-27 budget cycle and into the next one. The Senate moves $386.2 million of apportionment spending into the next budget.
“It’s a math game,” Reykdal said, adding there would likely be a reserve established in case a district ran into an urgent cash flow problem. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
No debate here
There’s money in both budgets to bump up what the state provides districts for teachers, administrators and staff.
For a certificated instructor, the minimum allocation statewide will rise from $78,209 to $80,164 in the next fiscal year and $82,248 in the second year of the biennium. It will be $59,000 for staff and $122,000 for administrators in the biennium. Most districts use locally generated tax dollars to pay teachers, office workers, principals and superintendents above those levels.
And both budgets fully fund bonuses for teachers who earn certification from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. Former Gov. Jay Inslee proposed pausing the bonuses entirely to save $151 million in the next budget and Gov. Bob Ferguson has endorsed the idea, too.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/classroom-students-raising-hands.jpg,,,2025-03-31 18:06:02.220908

(Photo by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)A bill that would regulate foreign-influenced political activity on behalf of certain countries received its first committee hearing of the legislative session on Monday.
The measure by Tampa Bay Area-Republican Danny Burgess (SB 766) would require an individual registered to work an an agent of a ‘foreign country of concern’ to register with the Division of Elections within 10 days and disclose identity, affiliations, foreign transactions, and political activities and expenditures from the past year.
Florida law defines a foreign country of concern as the People’s Republic of China, the Russian Federation, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the Republic of Cuba, the Venezuelan government of Nicolás Maduro, and the Syrian Arab Republic.
Florida law already bans foreign nationals from directly or indirectly making campaign contributions. Burgess said his legislation mirrors part of the Federal Agents Registration Act (FARA), a 1938 law that requires certain agents of foreign principals who are engaged in political activities to make periodic public disclosure of those relationships, as well as activities, receipts, and disbursements in support of those activities.
There has been a recent surge in cases being prosecuted in the past few years, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.
Several states, including California, New York, Illinois, and Georgia have introduced FARA-like legislation over the past year, but none has yet made it into law.
Those found in violation of the proposed law would face an initial fine of $500. Any repeated violation would be subject to a $2,000 fine. Any repeated violation would subject the individual to a fine up to $10,000 and either temporary or permanent ban from future registration.
Burgess’ original bill was much broader, requiring any and all agents of a foreign principal and foreign-supported political organization to register with the Division of Elections.
But he said that after “significant feedback from the stakeholders and trying to balance the actual ability to implement this legislation, we wanted to take that significant step to accomplish a notable goal and a meritorious part of what this legislation was trying to get at.”
A companion measure sponsored by Hillsborough Republican Michael Owen (HB 583) has already passed through its first committee.
Burgess’ proposal was unanimously approved by the Senate Ethics & Elections Committee, with no debate taking place.

Greg Gianforte espouses his income tax cut plan on the steps of the Montana Capitol on March 28, 2025. Courtesy photo. Gov. Greg Gianforte made another public pronouncement last week that his administration would deliver the largest tax cut in Montana history — to the tune of $850 million, according to his office. 
But opponents to plans to cut income taxes say the governor’s approach would disproportionately benefit the state’s wealthiest earners, while low- and middle-income Montanans would see just double-digit cuts. 
“We’re here today because we believe in a simple truth– you know how to spend your money better than the government does,” Gianforte said during a rally on the steps of the Montana Capitol on March 28. “Every day you wake up, you go to work. You provide for yourself and for your family. You budget carefully and you save where you can. But too often, when you get a paycheck, you look at it and you wonder, ‘Where did it go?’ We know the answer — taxes.”
Earlier that day, the governor’s preferred plan to cut taxes received its first hearing before the Legislature. 
Carried by Sen. Josh Kassmier, R-Fort Benton, Senate Bill 323 would lower the top income tax rate — paid by Montanans earning more than $21,000 as single filers — from 5.9% to 5.4% in 2026 and down to 4.9% in 2027. The bill also cuts the long-term capital gains tax from 4.1% to 3.9% and expands the Earned Income Tax Credit from 10% to 15%. 
Montana currently has two income tax brackets — one at 4.7% and one at 5.9% — which split at roughly $21,000 for an individual filer or $41,000 for married filers. The state used to have a six-bracket marginal tax system until 2021.
Calling it the “third installment” of the governor’s long-term plan to get to a single, flat tax rate for the state, Mark Blasdel, director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development and former Senate President, pointed out Montana has the highest tax rate of mountain region states. However, many of the states surrounding Montana also have a statewide sales tax. 
“Montana is also currently the 17th highest tax rate in the nation. So we believe this is an incredible opportunity to bring this down another 1%,” Blasdel told the Senate Taxation Committee. “We think this is a great way to continue that downward trend of the collection of taxes. It makes it so that we continue to be able to put pressure so that the budget does not continue to grow at a higher grade than inflation, and it continues to keep more money in the pockets of hard working Montanans.”
But opponents decried the across-the-board cutting of the top tax bracket, saying it doesn’t offer meaningful relief to middle-income earners. 
An analysis by the Montana Budget and Policy Center indicates that the wealthiest 1% of Montanans would see roughly $10,000 in tax breaks under the policy, while individuals making $50,000 or less would receive less than $100.  
“The problem with structuring an income tax reform in this way … is that for every dollar you have, you get that cut. So if you have a lot of dollars, a huge bucket of dollars, you get that cut on every single dollar in that bucket,” Rose Bender, Director of Research for the Budget and Policy Center, told the committee. “And if you just have a couple dollars you get that cut on just those couple dollars. So it’s really impossible to reform income tax in this way while not disproportionately benefiting the wealthy.”
But Kassmier pushed back and said that giving Montanans their money back, no matter how much, was a goal that everyone should want to get behind. 
“These income tax dollars are the people’s dollars. We have an opportunity here in the session to give our the people’s money back, and if it’s only going to give somebody $50 back or $100 back, I’m telling you that that means a lot to the people that are out there working,” Kassmier said. 
At previous press conferences, Gianforte has said his plan is the only comprehensive plan that addresses all income levels, with the expansion of the earned income tax credit helping out the lowest earners. 
In addition, the reduction in capital gains tax rate was lauded by supporters of the bill as helping farmers and ranchers. 
“A lot of people think of (capital gains) as just stocks and bonds and those types of things that would come into play here, but for farmers and ranchers, capital gains comes into play on sale of property and also on certain livestock and equipment sales,” said Nicole Rolf, with the Montana Farm Bureau Federation. 
SB 323 was also supported by Montana Taxpayers Association, the Montana Stockgrowers Association, and the Montana Chamber of Commerce. The Montana Federation of Public Employees, Montana Nonprofit Association and a former Democratic legislator, Margie McDonald, spoke against the bill. 
The governor on Friday said that while there are several proposals aimed at reforming incomes taxes, his plan is the “only fool-proof conservative plan.”
“Cut. The. Rate,” Gianforte said.

[subhead]Majority support for middle class cuts [/subhead]
A competing proposal, sold as a “middle-class millenium” bill, passed the Senate with support from all but three Senators on Monday. 
Sen. Mike Yakawich, R-Billings, carried Senate Bill 203 with support from both majority and minority leadership as cosponsors.
Rather than cut the top tax bracket rate, SB 203 would expand the lower bracket to comprise individuals making up to $100,000 — covering up to the 90th percentile of earners, according to Yakawich. For married couples filing jointly the bracket delineation would be at $200,000.
The bill “provides income tax relief for thousands of middle-class Montanans by expanding the number of people eligible for the state’s lower (4.7%) tax rate,” Yakawich said. “This bill is tailored to the middle-class Montana taxpayers.”
Yakawich used his five millennial-aged children as examples — they have good jobs and families, but still struggle to make ends meet with rising costs of living in Montana. 
“It’s that middle 60 to 90 percentile. We really want to love them up. We want to thank them,” he said. “That money that they save … might help them come back into the community, come back into our state.”
SB 203 also changes the long-term capital gains tax, against expanding the eligibility for the lowest tax rate to an individual’s first $100,000, from the current $20,500. 
The measure passed the Senate 47-3 and will next be heard by the Senate Finance and Claims Committee.
“Residents across the state repeatedly told us that tax relief is a top priority for them,” Senate President Matt Regier said in a statement following the vote. “SB 203 is a historic step to limit government and help all Montana income tax payers prosper.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/apf-rally.png,,,2025-03-31 17:04:46.000675

A group of professors at the University of Florida, Florida State University, and Florida International University are seeking a preliminary injunction against SB 266, a 2023 law that slashed the number of general education courses offered at Florida institutions and prohibits spending on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, a move academics argue harms their academic ambitions. 
Attorneys representing the state defended against the preliminary injunction in front of U.S. District Chief Judge Mark Walker in Tallahassee. 
The plaintiffs allege viewpoint discrimination under the First Amendment, that the law is over-broad, and that it violates Florida’s Campus Free Expression Act.
SB 266 prohibits general education courses that “distort significant historical events or include curriculum that teaches identity politics,” and some professors have argued the law is not clear enough. 
Although omission from the general education course list may not violate the Constitution, the professors argue, they are being injured by chilling their speech and fear repercussions in post-tenure review. 
No more ‘indoctrinating concepts’ in Florida’s general education courses, chancellor says

The professors argue the law undermines the exchange of ideas by restricting or eliminating courses, cutting funding for DEI initiatives, impeding academic research, and stifling student voices. 
“We’re just free to starve out any viewpoint we don’t like, I get it,” Walker told attorneys for the state, pointing out that his ruling would be on constitutionality, not whether the law is appropriate. 
Funding denial
The suit was filed in part by UF political science professor Sharon Austin, who complains she was denied funding to present at a 2024 conference hosted by Diversity Abroad, which the school had paid for her to present at in 2023. The school specifically cited SB 266 in refusing to pay for her to appear subsequently, the suit alleges.
Hala Sandridge, an attorney for the state, argued that the UF denial of funding for Austin did not prohibit her attendance, and if a lack of funding inhibited the ability to travel, she could have presented virtually. Sandridge argued Austin’s denial of funding is “not a wholesale denial” for all DEI-related conferences. 
The lawsuit argues that the state funds the Hamilton Center, a UF academic center “devoted to research and teaching on Western civilization.” Plaintiffs argue that the topics at the Hamilton Center “fall within the State’s preferred view of the Western Canon and related speech … although they also arguably fall within ‘political or social activism’ but have not been targeted.”
‘Vague and overbroad’
As part of regulations created by the Florida Board of Governors, courses like “Principles of Sociology” and “Politics of Race” no longer satisfy the general education requirement. The plaintiffs complains that reduces enrollment in the courses, causing departments to lose enrollment-based funding. 
“Given the vague and overbroad prohibitions in S.B. 266, professors at Florida’s colleges and universities fear how their ordinary conduct, potentially violative of S.B. 266, may impact their ability to retain their jobs at all,” the lawsuit asserts. They added that professors now may lose tenure during a new system of post-tenure review, another action taken by the Board of Governors.
Plaintiff attorneys said they were not aware of any professor who had been dismissed because of SB 266.
Walker said he would rule on the request for a preliminary injunction in the coming weeks.

The Michigan Family Protection Act will go into effect April 1, officially repealing a ban that made Michigan the only state in the nation to criminalize surrogacy contracts, with supporters of the legislation saying it also provides long overdue legal safeguards for families formed through assisted reproduction.
Among them is Ginanne Brownell, the communications and research director for the Michigan Fertility Alliance, which advocated for the nine-bill package that also strengthens the rights of children born through surrogacy in arenas such as inheritance and access to their own birth certificates.
“I think it’s really important that we change the narrative around surrogacy,” Brownell told the Michigan Advance. “I think the problem is that for such a long time we’ve talked about these misconceptions of who surrogates are in the U.S.”
Brownell, who has unexplained infertility, said when she decided to utilize surrogacy, she was surprised to find that there were no agencies willing to work with her in Michigan because of the 1988 Surrogate Parenting Act, which prohibited compensated surrogate parentage contracts. 
After finding a surrogate in Illinois who delivered her twins in 2018, Brownell started researching the history Michigan has played in surrogacy. 

“Michigan was pivotal to surrogacy across the globe for many, many reasons. The first compensated surrogacy contract in the world was signed in Dearborn in 1976. Noel Keane was the lawyer in that,” Brownell said.
In 1986, she said Keane helped arrange a contract for a New Jersey couple whose embryos were implanted in a surrogate, resulting in the world’s first child born through a gestational surrogate in Ypsilanti.
However, that same year a child born through a surrogacy contract arranged by Keane made international headlines when the surrogate mother refused to honor the contract and fled to Florida with the child, sparking a legal battle that spotlighted the ethical implications of surrogacy. The so-called Baby M case resulted in the 1988 ban on compensated surrogacy in Michigan.
“And that’s where the law stayed for almost 40 years,” Brownell said, adding that she was introduced to Stephanie Jones, the founder of the Michigan Fertility Alliance while she was working on her book, “Elusive Mommyhood: An Investigative Reporter’s Personal Journey into IVF and Surrogacy”.
“She had her daughter born through surrogacy as well. We both realized we were really passionate about this, and so we both kind of decided, ‘Hey, let’s try and change the law’, Brownell said.
After her twins were born in 2018, Brownell, who works in London while maintaining her residency in Michigan, told the Advance she had an opportunity to interview Gretchen Whitmer as she campaigned for governor.
“Because my kids had just been born, I was back in Michigan for several months waiting for their passports to be issued,” Brownell said. “And so I was explaining this to her and she said, ‘Why is that? That’s so weird,’and so we both spoke about it briefly and she said, ‘Well, that’s something that should be changed’ and I was like, ‘Yeah, it should be.’”
Brownell said she reflected on that conversation when Whitmer signed the legislation into law, which she was present for.
“It felt like it came full circle that we’d had this conversation about changing the law and here we were in the same room where she signed it into law and I had been a part of that,” Brownell said.
The process to get the law changed included testimony from parents across Michigan who related their stories of infertility and frustration at the barriers Michigan had enacted to starting their families.
Among those testifying was state Rep. Samantha Steckloff (D-Farmington Hills), sponsor of the main bill in the package, who said that as a breast cancer survivor, she was unable to conceive naturally due to the chemotherapy treatments she underwent.
“But I was lucky I was able to put off chemo by one month in order to go through IVF [in vitro fertilization] and egg harvesting so that one day I might be able to have a family of my own,” Steckloff said during testimony last year.
Steckloff’s bill, HB 5207, established the Assisted Reproduction and Surrogacy Parentage Act, which sets standards for creating a surrogacy contract including that a surrogate be 21 or older, have previously given birth to a child, completed a medical and mental health consultation and have independent legal representation of their choice, all paid for by the intended parents.
Although Whitmer signed the Michigan Family Protection Act into law in April 2024, Republicans in the Legislature actively opposed the measure and refused to give it immediate effect, making it unable to officially begin until 90 days after December 31, when the 102nd Legislature adjourned its session, which will be April 1.

That opposition, supported by the Michigan Catholic Conference and Right to Life of Michigan, was based on concerns that legalized surrogacy contracts can exploit vulnerable women. Among them was state Sen. Thomas Albert (R-Lowell), who urged his colleagues to vote no on the legislation that he contended puts “vulnerable women at risk of exploitation” and “fundamentally redefines family.”
Meanwhile, Brownell says the Michigan Fertility Alliance is now launching a new grassroots coalition called State Strong, which will be advocating for surrogacy and fertility access nationwide.
“In a lot of these states they might just have one or two advocates that, for example, they’re seeing that there’s like really bad IVF legislation in say Nebraska. So they would kind of reach out to us and say, what should we do with the messaging on this? Do you have any legislation that’s happened that you can share with us? Because a lot of these people are just kind of like us, volunteers, people who have never really worked on legislation advocacy before. And so State Strong is continuing that fight on a national level now as well,” Brownell said.
While those issues will also get more attention later this month during National Infertility Awareness Week from April 20-26, Brownell says when it comes to the children who are created through surrogacy, the details of how they came to be are not nearly as important as their very existence.
“We need to start asking them how they feel about it. And I think that you have hundreds of thousands of children who are born through surrogacy, the majority of whom are still under the age of 18, but as they start coming of age, they can tell their stories,” Brownell said, pointing to a University of Cambridge 20-year longitudinal study of third-party assisted reproduction which found positive family relationships and child adjustment from childhood to adult life. 
“It found that children born through surrogacy, how did they feel about it? They didn’t care. It was just like ‘Whatever. Why do I care how I was born?’”

(Wisconsin Examiner photo)Journalists at Wisconsin Watch — a nonprofit news organization that includes the Milwaukee Neighborhood News Service — have ratified their first union contract.
The agreement, signed on Friday, March 28, includes minimum salary guarantees and annual cost-of-living increases along with layoff restrictions, severance pay and benefits as well as “just cause” protections against arbitrary terminations, according to the Wisconsin Watch Union. The contract also includes provisions for medical, parental, caregiver and bereavement leave.
The union is a subunit of Milwaukee NewsGuild Local 34051, which also represents newsroom employees at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
“I’m really proud of the outcome,” said Jack Kelly, a Wisconsin Watch reporter and union bargaining team member. Staffers represented by the union were active in advocating for their priorities during contract negotiations, giving personal testimony about issues important to them, he said.
“They put some faces and names to the numbers we were asking for,” Kelly said in an interview Monday.  “I think the contract is going to make Wisconsin Watch and Neighborhood News Service better places to work.”
Kelly also commended Wisconsin Watch management’s handling of the bargaining process.
“We certainly had meetings that were long and stressful, but I think in general we were able to engage a collegial approach to bargaining,” Kelly said.
“We’ll continue to do great journalism knowing our workplace is more structured, secure and protected,” said Phoebe Petrovic, a Wisconsin Watch investigative reporter who was among those who initiated the union organizing effort, in a statement released by the union.
Wisconsin Watch journalists announced their union organizing campaign in October 2023, and the organization’s board subsequently agreed to voluntarily recognize the union. Protection against arbitrary firings was among the goals employees cited.
Wisconsin Watch was founded in 2009 as the Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism, still its legal name. The Milwaukee Neighborhood News Service became part of Wisconsin Watch in July 2024 and its employees became part of the bargaining unit.
Devin Blake, a Milwaukee Neighborhood News Service reporter who joined the bargaining team, said that in addition to tangible gains the union brought him closer to coworkers. “I have such a clearer sense of what matters to their lives and work,” Blake said in the union’s statement.
Digital news outlets and nonprofit news organizations have seen growing union representation in the last several years, with outlets including ProPublica and The Marshall Project joining the ranks of unionized newsrooms.

Senate Bill 14 sets in [&#8230;]","Gov. Laura Kelly delivers the State of the State address on Jan. 15, 2025. Kelly announced she was vetoing two bills, including one that would have rolled the budget over if the Legislature failed to pass one. (Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly on Monday vetoed a bill that would roll over the previous year’s state budget if the Legislature failed to pass one, pointing out that every legislative body since the state’s founding had managed to pass a budget and she expects nothing less of today’s legislators.
Senate Bill 14 sets in place a continuous budget that would change only if amended, lapsed or eliminated by the Legislature. Kelly sharply rebuked the idea that such a bill is necessary.

“If this Legislature cannot do what every previous Legislature has been able to do since our founding — through periods of war, famine, pandemic, recession, the Dust Bowl, and even the Great Depression — then they will have to do it over my veto because I will not sanction it, nor will the people of Kansas,” Kelly said in a news release.

In a joint statement, Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, and House Speaker Dan Hawkins, R-Wichita, said SB14 prevents government shutdowns at the state level by providing for continuing appropriations.
“Kansans are tired of watching the government shutdown drama at the federal level, where politicians use people’s livelihoods as leverage to get their way,” the two legislative leaders said. “Sadly, the governor decided that she prefers the ways of Washington over ensuring state government, including our schools, is always open and operating. We stand ready to override her veto when we return.”
The Legislature is scheduled to return April 10-11 to consider the governor’s vetoes and pass any last-minute legislation before adjourning for the year.

Along with SB 14, Kelly vetoed Senate Bill 5, which restricts the use of federal funds for elections and election-related activities without legislative approval.
Addressing concerns voiced by a few legislators about voter fraud and foreign interference, Kelly said election officials would be more capable of addressing such threats if they received Congressional funding.
“It doesn’t make sense to turn down these resources that make our local elections in Kansas safe, secure and accurate,” she said. “Given that the Legislature only convenes for three months each year, how can we expect them to approve funding when they are not available year-round? Instead of obstructing our electoral process, lawmakers should concentrate on the real issues impacting Kansans, rather than complicating the management of election funds.”
Masterson and Hawkins also promised an override on this veto. SB 5, they said, is about ensuring the integrity of elections.

“Federal taxpayer money flowing into our elections threatens the integrity and opens the door to nefarious actors who might want to tip the scale in favor of partisan politics,” their statement said. “SB5 simply ensures that election officials cannot accept outside funds unless it’s allowed by law. It’s disappointing the governor chose to side with those who want to undermine our elections or give the appearance of mischief. We side with common sense and election security, and that’s why we’re committed to overriding her veto.”


 Three bills pass scrutiny


Kelly allowed three bills to become law without her signature.
House Bill 2106 bans contributions from foreign nationals for the support or defeat of a proposed amendment to the Kansas constitution. Kelly said she supports stopping foreign influence on elections in Kansas, and said federal law prohibits foreign nationals from contributing to federal, state or local elections.
She chose not to sign the bill because she believes it goes “too far.”
“I cannot sign a bill that takes away the ability of Kansans and Kansas businesses to support elections if they accept money from overseas for any purpose, not just those related to elections,” she said. “Forcing Kansans to choose between accepting financial support for any reason or surrendering their voice in the political process is wrong.”
Kelly said HB 2106 potentially opens the opportunity for litigation because of limitations on speech and association, as well as potential violations of First Amendment protections in the U.S. Constitution.


House Bill 2027, which reorganizes sections of the public assistance law, became law without Kelly’s signature because she refused to be associated with the HOPE Act, which passed in 2015 and restricted Kansans’ ability to access social service programs.
“The HOPE Act was wrong then, and it remains wrong now,” Kelly said. “Legislators are only trying to put lipstick on a pig, and I refuse to associate myself with the HOPE Act. Now, more than ever, the Legislature should look for ways to support working Kansas families rather than further shredding the safety net that gives Kansans a bridge back to self-sufficiency.”
Kelly called Senate Bill 105 a “partisan power grab by the Legislature.” This bill allows the Legislature to have a say in the appointment process for filling vacancies for U.S. senator, state treasurer, and insurance commissioner.


Kelly critiqued the process laid out in the bill as “overly bureaucratic.”


“Had the Legislature passed a simpler method for modifying the appointment process for these offices, I would’ve signed it into law,” she said. “However, given my concerns about the messy process this bill creates, the bill will become law without my signature.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Kelly-SOS-2-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-03-31 17:04:46.000675

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)Four years ago, Bridgette Whiteman said she was dying on the floor of her parents’ basement, an alcoholic “drinking away.”
One in four people who are transgender suffer from alcohol use disorder, she said, and Whiteman kept quiet about her problem, but she’s sober now, besides the occasional celebratory drink.
Whiteman said two years ago, she was homeless in Missoula while finishing her degree, among 19 transgender, nonbinary and Two Spirit people who were reported as unhoused by the Missoula Organization of Realtors at the time — “I can think of at least one that they missed.”
And one year ago, Whiteman was crying and telling her boyfriend she had been raped, and she said two-in-five people who are trans, nonbinary and Two Spirit have experienced sexual violence.
Whiteman said when Rep. Zooey Zephyr, D-Missoula, a transgender woman, won her first election, she told Zephyr she wanted to join her at the Capitol.

Monday, Whiteman made good on that promise as part of Transgender Day of Visibility at the Capitol, celebrated with colorful banners, chalk art and chants.
“Visibility matters,” said Whiteman, with TransVisible Montana. “Build support in your community.
“Support your neighbors. Uplift the marginalized in society. We all belong in Montana.”
At the microphone, Julia Maxon, with Catalyst Montana, said the national day commemorating people who are transgender was founded in 2009.
Unlike the day of remembrance in the fall that honors people who are lost to transphobia, Maxon said Trans Day of Visibility is meant to celebrate transgender people who are living.
To a crowd of a few dozen that rallied shortly after a light spring snow, they also said it’s important to acknowledge Indigenous people, whose land is occupied by settlers.
“We want to acknowledge the trans community has always been part of this land in the form of Two Spirit people since time immemorial,” Maxon said.

A banner draped across the steps of the Capitol read, “Trans people belong in Montana.” Other signs of support read, “Trans people cannot be erased,” and “Protect Trans Kids.”
The crowd booed House Bill 121 and House Bill 300, both signed last week by Gov. Greg Gianforte and among a multitude of bills that Maxon said would harm people who are transgender, nonbinary or intersex.
Participants cheered the ACLU of Montana for filing a lawsuit against HB 121, which took effect immediately. The national ACLU and Legal Voice also joined in the lawsuit.
HB 121 requires public restrooms and changing areas exclusively for males or females based on “external genitalia present at birth.”
It applies to public schools, correctional centers, domestic violence shelters, and public buildings such as libraries.
HB 300 restricts the ability of transgender women from participating in female sports. Sponsor Rep. Kerri Seekins-Crowe, R-Billings, earlier said it would protect the ability of women to receive scholarships, medals and leadership opportunities.
In a statement last week, Gianforte, a Republican, said the legislation was about safeguarding privacy for women and girls and ensuring separate facilities for them.
The bills passed on partisan lines.

“We think it’s pretty simple. A man shouldn’t be in a women’s restroom. Shouldn’t be in a women’s shower room. And shouldn’t be housed in a women’s prison,” Gianforte said.
At the rally, Maxon described the bills as evidence of increasing fascism in the country, threatening people’s bodily autonomy and safety.
“Despite the ongoing state of oppression and violence we are experiencing, we will not be silenced,” Maxon said. “Like all Montanans, we deserve safety, dignity and respect.”
Morgan Syring, with Forward Montana, led the group in a chant and call back.
“What do we do when our bodily autonomy is under attack?” Syring said.
“Stand up. Fight back,” the crowd yelled.

Larry Keefe, who’s been on the job for a month, said he’s pitched the idea to the Trump administration. Other states could involve their emergency management agencies in immigration enforcement, too, if the federal government approves, Keefe said during the first meeting of the State Immigration Enforcement Council, composed of four sheriffs and four police chiefs.

“We have the world-class, absolute best in Kevin Guthrie, the director of the Division of Emergency Management, and he is really good about safely moving people and stuff around in high-stress, high-pressure emergency situations, including soft-sided facilities, hard-sided facilities — whatever the state of the art is and in the planet Earth on how to house people and move people and feed people, and treat people safely and well, he knows it,” Keefe said during the meeting at the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office.
Keefe, who organized Gov. Ron DeSantis’ migrant flight from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard in 2022, pressed for military judicial officials within the Florida National Guard to secure authorization to act as immigration judges under the U.S. Department of Justice. DeSantis and Keefe met with border czar Tom Homan on March 20, Keefe said.
Orlando Democratic Rep. Anna Eskamani criticized the idea.
“FDEM should be focused on responding to hurricanes and natural disasters — not engaging in immigration enforcement,” Eskamani said. “I will also add that the main beneficiary of this concept will be the for-profit private prison industry, who will receive our tax dollars to hold individuals without due process.”
Council faces reality of logistics in deportations
Questions about where Florida will house immigrants rounded up by local and state law enforcement took center stage during the four-hour meeting.
Florida law enforcement entities are signing up officers with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to question and detain people they suspect are in the country without authorization, which requires a 40-hour online training, as part of the federal 287(g) program. As of Monday, Florida agreements with ICE make up 45% of the existing 287(g) agreements in the country, according to ICE’s database.
  Bob Gualtieri via Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office.
So far, only highway patrol troopers are completing the training, but Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said he doesn’t know how enforcement will work considering the inadequate number of beds in immigration detention centers.
“We absolutely have to give guidance to the cops on the street,” Gualtieri said. “We have to give them some framework within which to work. You can’t just give them these credentials and say, ‘Here, go do something.’ This is not gonna work.”
Gualtieri, Senate President Ben Albritton’s council pick, said ICE has rejected a proposal to have sheriffs transport immigrants to ICE offices after holding them for 48 hours in county jails.
“We were going to get them out of these county jails within that 48-hour period, coordinate with ICE, get them to an ICE sub-office,” the sheriff said. “ICE could then do the processing, and they could get them into the ICE system, but ICE wouldn’t approve the plan, so it’s dead. So, I don’t know what’s going to happen.”
Meanwhile, Gov. Ron DeSantis and Attorney General James Uthmeier, his former chief of staff, are pressuring cities to enter into agreements with ICE, threatening city councilmembers in Fort Myers with removal from office after they took a 3-3 vote blocking the agreement. The council reversed its decision days later.
The council also wants the federal government to lower its standards to allow use of state and county detention facilities, the council’s chair, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, said. He offered the suggestion after hundreds protested overcrowding and a lack of beds, food, and access to medicine at ICE’s Krome Detention Center in Miami, according to the Miami Herald.

After the governor vetoed a bill containing the requirement last week, the state Senate sustained the veto Monday at the Capitol in Pierre. The House voted earlier Monday to override the veto, but agreement from both chambers is required to overturn the governor’s action.
Michael Rohl, R-Aberdeen, was among the senators who opposed the bill and supported the veto. While the bill’s sponsors said it would force more inclusion of rural areas in the political process, Rohl said the bill could harm rural voters.
“It gives every district veto power,” Rohl said. “That means that we, as a small community, don’t have a voice unless we get Sioux Falls to agree.”
Governor vetoes effort to restrict constitutional amendment process with geographic rule

The legislation, House Bill 1169, would have required constitutional amendment petitions to have signatures from registered voters in each of the 35 Senate districts spread across the state. Petitions would have needed a number of signatures from each district equal to 5% of the total votes cast for governor in that district during the last general election.
That would have been an addition to the existing requirement that petitions have a total number of signatures — from anywhere in the state — equal to at least 10% of the votes cast statewide for governor in the last general election.
House Bill 1169’s main sponsor, Rep. Rebecca Reimer, R-Chamberlain, said Monday she’s willing to work on the legislation’s language and bring it back next year.
Reimer and other lawmakers who wanted to override the veto said voters are tired of the number of constitutional amendments showing up on their ballots, that the state constitution should be reserved for matters pertaining to the structure and powers of government and not for specific policies, and that the constitution should be harder to amend. Multiple lawmakers referenced an amendment last year, rejected by voters, that would have inserted abortion rights into the constitution.
Legislators considered numerous bills this year to restrict citizen lawmaking. Among those that passed into law were a bill to move the deadline for submitting petition signatures for citizen-initiated ballot measures from May to February, which will shorten the signature-gathering window by three months. Legislators also sent a measure to the 2026 ballot that will ask voters to raise the approval threshold for constitutional amendment ballot questions from a simple majority to 60%.
Monday was the last day of this year’s legislative session, set aside to consider any remaining vetoes from Gov. Larry Rhoden. Earlier this month, legislators sustained Rhoden’s only other veto, which would have offered additional child care tuition assistance to child care workers for their own children.

Maggie Hassan speaks during an event in Tilton on Friday, March 28, 2025. (Photo by William Skipworth)U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan, while visiting Tilton on Friday, railed against President Donald Trump’s national security team for the controversial leak of military plans to a journalist, stood behind her vote to confirm the president’s pick for Food and Drug Administration commissioner, and discussed her efforts to get more information about the Nashua German-American detained by immigration officials.
In late March, The Atlantic published a story revealing that National Security Adviser Mike Waltz accidentally added Jeffrey Goldberg, the news magazine’s editor in chief, to a group chat on the messaging app Signal. That group chat also included Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President J.D. Vance, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and over a dozen other high-level military and administration officials. In the chat, the officials discussed extremely sensitive details about a series of military airstrikes in Yemen. The leak was immediately lambasted by critics who said the officials were being careless with confidential information and skirting record-keeping laws.
“The Signalgate scandal — and it is a scandal — reflects how reckless and careless this administration is,” Hassan said. “They put our servicemen and women at risk by casually discussing war plans, literally the timing of air strikes on a Signal chain. It’s unacceptable, and as I have said before, it’s one thing to misidentify somebody in a Signal chat when you’re making dinner plans. It’s another thing to do it when you’re planning an airstrike.”
Hassan was one of 20 Democrats who voted to confirm Ratcliffe in January; 24 Democrats voted against him. (One independent, Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with the Democrats, voted for him, and another, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who also caucuses with Democrats, voted against him. Democratic Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania did not vote.)
Hassan wouldn’t say whether the Signal scandal was giving her pause about her vote.
Additionally, Hassan was one of three Democrats (Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire’s other U.S. senator, was another) who voted to confirm Martin Makary, a Johns Hopkins University surgeon and outspoken health care commentator, to his role as commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.
“Dr. Makary has a very strong record of fighting the opioid epidemic and of holding FDA and past FDA administrators and commissioners to account for their role in fueling the opioid epidemic,” Hassan said. “And I think it was very important to have somebody at the FDA who will continue to work to fight the opioid epidemic as strongly and effectively as he can.”
However, Makary has received criticism from some of Hassan’s fellow Democrats who, in questioning leading up to the vote, couldn’t get the doctor to rule out tightening restrictions on the abortion pill mifepristone and were alarmed by his tepid responses on vaccines — which he said he supported but he wanted the FDA to reevaluate how it gathers input from vaccine experts.
Makary previously garnered attention during the COVID-19 pandemic as an outspoken opponent of vaccine mandates, though he supported voluntary vaccinations and other public health measures like shutdowns early in the pandemic and masking. He was also the author of a 2021 Wall Street Journal op-ed that incorrectly predicted the virus would “be mostly gone by April.”
Hassan also discussed the detainment of the German national Fabian Schmidt, who holds a green card and lives in Nashua.
Schmidt was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (a division within the Department of Homeland Security) officials at Boston’s Logan Airport in early March and taken to a detention center in Rhode Island. It is unclear why Schmidt, a 34-year-old man whose parents say he’s lived in the U.S. since he was a teenager, is being detained, but he has a court date set in June.
“We are in contact with the Department of Homeland Security about that,” she said, adding that her and Shaheen’s teams are collaborating. “We have made it clear that DHS needs to follow the law, and we are waiting to get more information from legal representatives of the detainee, but it is very concerning.”
Hassan said she did not know the justification for Schmidt’s detainment.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/maggiemakary-1024x774.jpg,,,2025-03-31 17:04:46.000675

House leaders pulled the bill, saying they received word that the federal government will not change its match. (Rafael Barker | West Virginia Women's Alliance)West Virginia lawmakers on Monday walked back a measure that would have put more than 165,000 residents at risk of losing their health care coverage through Medicaid expansion. 
House Bill 3518 would have put in place a trigger so that if the federal government lowered the rate at which it pays for the Medicaid expansion program, West Virginia residents on the program would be disenrolled and the expansion program would be eliminated. 
The House of Delegates Rules committee moved the bill to the inactive calendar Monday because of strong assurances from the federal government that it will not change its share of the cost, said Deputy House Speaker Del. Matthew Rohrbach, R-Cabell.
“That bill was, in effect, a message to Washington, and it got communicated back to me Saturday from someone dealing with the negotiations in Washington: they’ve heard us loud and clear. These changes to Medicaid don’t appear as though now they are going to occur,” he told reporters.
Medicaid is a joint health care program between the state and the federal government. 
Under the Affordable Care Act, 41 states, including West Virginia, have expanded their Medicaid programs to cover families who make up to 138% of the federal poverty line. West Virginia expanded its program in 2014. 
The federal government currently matches coverage of those in expanded Medicaid at a 90/10 match. As the federal government considers cuts to Medicaid, at least 12 states have enacted trigger laws like House Bill 3518 in case the federal government decides to lower the rate at which they fund the expansion portion of the program. 
House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, R-Clay, said leaders are in communication almost daily with the state’s federal delegation.
“We got some very fairly encouraging news over the weekend that the most recent version of what the president and some of the leadership of the current Congress is pursuing doesn’t implicate that bill in the way that we were originally told that it would,” Hanshaw said. “So we didn’t feel a need to move forward at this time.”
Rohrback said he feels confident that the federal government will not change the federal matching rate for the program. 
“I was told Saturday by the congressional people that they have heard a firestorm over this from red states, blue states and purple states,” Rohrbach said. “We are all saying that the federal government made a deal. You’ve got to stay with it if we’re going to have to stay with it. That’s only fair, because the states just cannot absorb that kind of a new budget request.”
The bill originated in the House Finance Committee last week and was advanced to the floor, where it would have been on first reading Monday. 
House Democrats have criticized saying that it would take health care from 160,000 West Virginians, including children, people with disabilities and the elderly.
“This is not what we were sent here to do, but unfortunately after 45 days of doing nothing, the Republicans have tipped their hand as to what their priority is, and that’s to take health care away from nearly 10% of our state,” Del. John Williams, D-Monongalia County, said in a post on social media.  
If the federal government dropped its Medicaid expansion match from 90% to 73%, the rate at which it funds the rest of the program, that would cost the state about $170 million in addition to the $100 million it already pays for Medicaid expansion, officials say. In West Virginia, 166,000 West Virginians are covered under Medicaid expansion. 
Before the bill was pulled, health care advocates and Medicaid recipients gathered outside the House chambers Monday morning to urge lawmakers not to pass it.  
South Charleston resident Paula Lepp and her family would lose health care if Medicaid expansion were to be eliminated in the state. Lepp and her husband, a full-time storyteller, have qualified for Medicaid for a few years since the COVID-19 pandemic led to them losing nearly 80% of their income. Lepp was diagnosed with breast cancer last fall. She’s had several surgeries since then and is scheduled for another on April 18. Now, she worries she won’t have health insurance by then. 
“I’m sitting here worried, stressed out about what that is going to look like for our family,” Lepp said. “What does that look like for my recovery, if we have to choose between finding the money for my surgery and finding the money to continue helping [my daughter] pay for college, or having her go into massive amounts of debt. 
“What a horrible choice that we’re going to have to make,” she said. 
Rich Sutphin, executive director of the West Virginia Rural Health Association, said that cutting Medicaid expansion would be devastating to the state’s rural hospitals, five of which are already at immediate risk of closure. 
“A cut like this to our health care delivery system would be catastrophic for those five hospitals,” he said. “So we’re advocating for the House of Delegates to vote no on House Bill 3918.”
According to the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, Medicaid expansion contributes about a billion every year to the state’s health care economy. 
“[Ending Medicaid expansion] would more than double the state’s uninsured rate, harm health, put hospitals at risk of closure, and likely result in a significant loss of health care jobs throughout the state,” the organization wrote in a post. 
Dan Hager, executive director Ebenizer Medical Outreach, a free and charitable clinic in Huntington that provides care to people without health care and on Medicaid, also spoke against the bill. 
“When we talk about how 166,000 of our friends and neighbors could lose their coverage, I know what that looks like,” Hager said. “That looks like someone you know, someone you go to church with, someone in your family, someone you work with, walking into the pharmacy to pick up their diabetes medicine, to pick up their blood pressure medicine, and finding out they can no longer afford it because they got disenrolled by their insurance coverage and they didn’t even realize. It means someone you know going to the infusion center to get their chemo delivered and be told that they’re not going to be able to get their treatment that day because they no longer have their Medicaid coverage.”

Ron DeSantis administration has pushed.
As the House and Senate begin work on the General Appropriations Act, the one must-pass bill of the year, neither chamber has agreed to an effort by the administration to redirect hundreds of millions in cancer funding away from four National Cancer Institute-designated Florida hospitals to other cancer providers.
The Senate Appropriations Committee will consider legislation (SB 7028) Tuesday that would maintain the existing funding formula for the four NCI-designated hospitals and modify the Florida Cancer Connect Collaborative, an initiative promoted by First Lady Casey DeSantis and which  the Legislature agreed to codify into law. 
The Collaborative is located within the Department of Health and is charged with developing a “holistic approach to the state’s efforts to fund cancer research, cancer facilities and treatments for cancer patients.”
The collaborative also plays a role in advising the DOH on the distribution of $60 million in so-called “cancer innovation funds” which are awarded annually.
The details
The Senate bill would place into statute criteria applicants must meet to receive grant funding. They include that hospitals:

Be licensed as a rural hospital or that at least 30% of its cancer patients reside in rural or underserved areas; 
Be licensed as a children’s specialty hospital that provides cancer care; or 
Provides cancer screening services at no cost or a minimal cost to patients.

The Senate bill also requires the DOH to appoint peer review panels of “independent and scientifically qualified individuals” to review the grant applications, to ensure that all proposals for grant funding are “evaluated fairly on the basis of scientific merit.” 
The review panels are required to establish priority scores to be forwarded to members of the collaborative, who must consider the scores in recommending applicants to receive grants.
The Senate bill would create a five-year “incubator” for pediatric cancer research programs that’s overseen by the Florida Cancer Connect Collaborative. Children’s specialty hospitals that provide cancer treatment to patients 18 and younger could qualify for the funds. Similar to the innovation grants, the cancer incubator grants would be awarded to applicants that meet the statutory criteria. 
The House bill (HB 5301) is a broad-reaching budget-conforming measure that includes funding-related issues but not specific provisions related to cancer funding. The bill does make changes to the Florida Cancer Connect Collaborative, including requiring the collaborative to submit an annual report to the Legislature and governor and to include recommendations for funding for cancer research at specialty hospitals for children. HB 5301 has been referred to the House Budget Committee.
Cancer and Florida
Cancer has been the second-leading cause of death in Florida since 2014. Florida has the third largest population in the country but the second-highest cancer burden, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Each year, more than 130,000 new cancer cases are reported to the statewide cancer registry at the Florida Department of Health.
Florida has four NCI–designated research and treatment centers that annually receive $127.5 million in state funds to help them recruit the best and brightest medical minds to advance cancer research. 
This pot of money has been renamed “Casey DeSantis Research Funds” by the Florida Legislature in honor of Ms. DeSantis, who underwent successful treatment for breast cancer. The money goes to Moffitt Cancer Center; University of Florida Health Cancer Center; Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine; and Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center.
The administration’s long-range plan recommends the $127.5 not be given exclusively to those four providers.
“By expanding access to cancer funding to a broader range of cancer facilities, this transformative process offers the possibility of creating a stronger, broader cancer care network with access for people in rural areas and one that includes pediatric cancer facilities.” the report notes.

[&#8230;]","Iowa Workforce Development manages unemployment claims filed on behalf of Iowans. (Photo by Getty Images, logo courtesy the State of Iowa)An Iowa nurse who was fired for an alleged pattern of patient neglect is not entitled to unemployment benefits, a judge has ruled.
State records indicate Ashley K. Brooks worked as a registered nurse for Mercy Health Services, which operates four hospital divisions in Iowa, from April 2022 through her termination in early January 2025.
The final incident leading up to her firing occurred on Dec. 30, 2024, when a doctor ordered a urine analysis for a patient shortly after 8 a.m. Brooks allegedly failed to collect the urine sample for several hours, during which time the patient’s husband informed the staff that his wife had become nonverbal.
According to her employer, Brooks was to have checked on the woman multiple times during her shift but either failed to notice the change in the patient’s condition or did not act on it. Brooks collected the sample at 2:45 p.m., after which the patient was taken to the emergency room for a severe urinary tract infection.
Mercy Health Services also alleged Brooks had failed to provide adequate care to patients on several other occasions.
On Dec. 28, 2024, one of Brooks’ patients complained of chest pain and was in need of an EKG and a blood draw before they could be being sent to the emergency room for evaluation. Brooks allegedly sat at the nurse’s desk, scrolling through her phone while three other staff members performed the tasks, although the patient was specifically assigned to Brooks, Mercy Health Services alleged.
On two other occasions, Brooks allegedly failed to take patients’ blood pressure — including one instance in which an aide took the patient’s blood pressure, which registered as 26 over 13 — a level so low it was almost incompatible with life. Although the nurse aide was concerned, Brooks allegedly advised her only to have the patient drink fluids.
Brooks was also accused of falsifying records by indicating she had completed certain tasks that she hadn’t actually performed, and other nurses alleged she regularly failed to perform wound care for diabetic patients, increasing the risk that the patients would lose a limb.
After she was fired, Brooks applied for unemployment benefits, which led to a hearing before Administrative Law Judge Stephanie Adkisson.
Recently, Adkisson ruled Brooks was not entitled to jobless benefits, finding that Mercy Health Services had presented credible evidence that Brooks “failed to provide proper care to patients — including ignoring dangerously low blood pressure, chest pains, and wound care. As a registered nurse, (Brooks) was aware of the reasonable standards of care. (Her) conduct was clearly against the best interest of the employer and its patients.”
State records indicate that Brooks’ Iowa license remains active and unencumbered, with no history of disciplinary action by the Iowa Board of Nursing.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IWD-UNEMPLOYMENT-ART.jpg,,,2025-03-31 17:04:46.000675

Free.,Democrats ask congressional watchdog agency to probe Trump’s funding freezes,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/democrats-ask-congressional-watchdog-agency-probe-trumps-funding-freezes,,"WASHINGTON — Top Democrats in Congress are asking the Government Accountability Office to open an investigation into whether the Trump administration violated federal law by freezing funding for several programs.Pennsylvania Rep. Brendan Boyle and Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, ranking members on the House and Senate Budget committees, wrote in a two-page letter sent Monday to the government watchdog organization that certain actions appear to have violated the Impoundment Control Act.“Unilaterally impounding funds is illegal, and Donald Trump and Russ Vought are trying to gut the federal government piece by piece,” Merkley wrote in a statement accompanying the letter. “GAO must get to the bottom of this and reiterate to the administration that Congress has the power of the purse, not Trump and Vought.”The Senate voted along party lines earlier this year to confirm Vought as director of the Office of Management and Budget, which has wide-reaching authority over decisions within the executive branchA Government Accountability Office spokesperson told States Newsroom the agency is working through its process to determine whether it will launch an investigation based on the letter.GAO, the spokesperson said, also has ongoing work related to the ICA.OMB authorityBoyle wrote in a statement that the Constitution gives Congress the authority to determine when and where the federal government spends money.“The administration’s withholding of critical investments harms American communities that rely on these funds for jobs, economic stability, and essential infrastructure,” Boyle wrote. “Robust congressional oversight, alongside litigation, is vital to protecting the interests of the American people.”The Impoundment Control Act, enacted in the 1970s, bars presidents from not spending the money that Congress has appropriated. Vought has said repeatedly he believes the law is unconstitutional and that presidents have this authority.Several lawsuits have been filed over the Trump administration opting not to spend federal money, some of which have blocked the actions from taking effect while the cases proceed through the federal courts. The Boyle-Merkley letter alleges the Trump administration has run afoul of the law on several occasions, including on his first day in office when he ordered a pause on foreign development assistance as well as funding in the Inflation Reduction Act and the bipartisan infrastructure law.The two ask GAO to also look into the Trump administration’s decision to halt military aid to Ukraine for about a week in March, writing they are “concerned this pause may have been an illegal impoundment with negative foreign policy and national security implications.”“The Constitution grants the President no unilateral authority to withhold funds from obligation,” Boyle and Merkley wrote in the letter. “Instead, Congress has vested the President with strictly circumscribed authority to impound or withhold budget authority only in limited circumstances as expressly provided in the Impoundment Control Act.“The executive branch may withhold amounts from obligation only if the President transmits a special message to Congress that includes the amount of budget authority proposed for withholding and the reason for the proposal (2 U.S.C. §§ 683–684).”What can GAO do?During the first Trump administration, the GAO found the Office of Management and Budget violated the Impoundment Control Act  when it halted assistance to Ukraine.“Faithful execution of the law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law,” GAO wrote in the report. “OMB withheld funds for a policy reason, which is not permitted under the Impoundment Control Act (ICA). The withholding was not a programmatic delay. Therefore, we conclude that OMB violated the ICA.”The GAO writes on its website that the ICA “authorizes the head of GAO, known as the Comptroller General, to file a lawsuit if the President illegally impounds funds.”Comptroller General Gene Dodaro testified before Congress earlier this year that he plans to do just that if the independent agency finds violations of the ICA.“We’re going to make these decisions as fast as possible,” Dodaro said, according to a news report. “I fully intend to carry out our responsibilities under the Impoundment Control Act expeditiously and thoroughly . . . I’ll do it as quickly as I can, but we need to be careful and thorough, because the next step for us is to go to court ourselves. If we say there’s been impoundment and money isn’t released in a certain period of time, we have to go to court.”",,,,2025-03-31 17:04:46.000675

Idaho also needs federal approval for the proposed ban.

Idaho’s bill is part of the national movement coined “Make America Healthy Again,” or MAHA, promoted by U.S. health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the bill’s cosponsor Rep. Jordan Redman, R-Coeur d’Alene has told lawmakers. 
And, he said, soda is the “number one commodity spent on SNAP.”
Business industry representatives oppose the bill. Arguing the bill wouldn’t be workable, Idaho House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, has said it would cause grocery stores to stop accepting SNAP.
But bill cosponsor Senate Majority Caucus Chair Ben Toews, R-Coeur d’Alene, says he’s skeptical the bill would be hard on retailers. He said the bill’s candy definition is used in 24 other states’ sales tax laws. 
The Idaho House passed the bill on a 48-20 vote on Monday, after the chamber had already narrowly approved the bill. It came back to the House after the Senate amended the bill to tweak the candy definition. The Idaho Senate passed an amended version of the bill on a 25-10 vote last week.
Idaho Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, critiqued the bill as another way to control poor people. 
Sen. Camille Blaylock, R-Caldwell, suggested it isn’t likely Idaho would make the change alone. Idaho’s waiver, she argued, would join other states’ requests, applying pressure for a nationwide change. 
When the bill is transmitted to the governor, he has five days, excluding Sundays, to decide on it. He has three options: sign it into law, allow it to become law without his signature, or veto it.
If passed into law, the bill would take effect July 1.

 Bill’s candy definition is broad, and would ban granola and power bars, critics say

Pushback has largely focused on the bill’s broad candy definition, which critics say would also ban granola bars and power bars.
The bill defines candy as “a preparation of sugar, honey, or other natural or artificial sweeteners combined with chocolate, fruit, nuts or other ingredients or flavorings” in several forms.
Under the bill, candy would not include items that contain flour or need refrigeration. The Senate amended the bill to tweak the candy definition, removing an exemption for items with more than 10% flour by weight. 
The bill’s soda definition also appears to be broad.
Under the bill, soda includes nonalcoholic beverages with sweeteners, artificial or natural. But the bill doesn’t consider soda to be drinks with more than 50% juice, contain milk or milk substitutes, or that need preparation, such as powders or concentrates.
About 132,000 Idahoans are enrolled in SNAP, according to Idaho Department of Health and Welfare figures, receiving an average of $177 in monthly program benefits.
If the federal U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, doesn’t grant Idaho’s candy/soda SNAP ban waiver, the bill says Health and Welfare “shall request such a waiver annually until such a waiver is granted.”
The bill’s fiscal note estimates it would not have a fiscal impact.
Republican legislators in Arizona, Kansas, Utah and Wyoming introduced similar bills, Stateline reported.

Sophie Warren believes that the transition to clean energy needs to prioritize such economic justice issues to ensure no one is left behind in the state’s efforts to address climate change.  Last session, the Scarborough Democrat introduced a bill that [&#8230;]","A worker installs a heat pump, which have been a key feature of Maine's transition to cleaner energy. (Photo via Oregon Department of Energy)While the struggle for low-income residents to afford their power bill is not new, Rep. Sophie Warren believes that the transition to clean energy needs to prioritize such economic justice issues to ensure no one is left behind in the state’s efforts to address climate change. 
Last session, the Scarborough Democrat introduced a bill that sought to bolster support for low-income residents to access energy efficiency and weatherization programs. 
Although that bill died, part of what Warren had hoped to achieve eventually came to fruition when the Maine Climate Council for the first time included in updated Climate Action Plan strategies to lower the energy burden on Maine residents. 
Though Warren applauds that work, she introduced LD 1037 to go a step further by requiring the climate council to include in its annual report to lawmakers specific recommendations for how to reduce the portion of Mainers’ income that is being spent on electricity and home heating fuels.
During a public hearing for the proposal Monday, Warren told members of the Legislature’s Environment and Natural Resources Committee that she wants to ensure the work continues into the future, regardless of who sits on the council or serves in the executive branch.
“As a small, rural state with higher-than-average rates of poverty and some of the highest comparative, I both believe it is a moral imperative we fight poverty alongside climate change but also that to do so is economical in the long run,” Warren said. 
For low-income households in Maine, the average energy burden is 14% based on 2018-2022 data, according to the Maine Energy Plan published in January. That is nearly three times higher than the statewide average across all income levels. 
The Maine State Chamber of Commerce supports Warren’s bill, encouraging what they described as a “thoughtful” shift to clean energy that doesn’t inadvertently increase costs for Maine businesses, said Maine Chamber Government Relations Specialist Ashley Luszczki.
For example, she pointed to energy intensive businesses, such as manufacturers and food processors, that rely on cost-effective, reliable energy to stay competitive. Despite the state’s current statutory goal of using 80% renewable energy by 2030 and 100% by 2050, renewable sources don’t provide the affordable and consistent baseload power large-scale industrial operations need, Luszczki said.
In 2023, Gov. Janet Mills called for those timelines to be moved up, asking instead for the state to strive for 100% clean energy by 2040. The chamber sees Warren’s bill as a way to meet climate goals while lowering energy costs. 
“A strong economy and a sustainable environmental future must go hand in hand,” Luszczki said.
The Office of Public Advocate, which advocates for Maine utility ratepayers, also supports this bill, saying that the affordability of energy must be taken into account when considering new climate policy. 
While the Governor’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future — which manages the Maine Climate Council — agrees with the goal of the legislation, it is opposed to the proposal. Current law already requires the council to consider household energy burden and affordability, argued Senior Advisor Brian Hubbell. 
Additionally, the most recent climate action plan from November 2024 includes multiple strategies and recommendations in those areas, including one to “comprehensively analyze household energy burden in Maine in 2025, including all energy sources, and set a target for reducing the energy burden for low-income residents by January 2026.”
Even with those recommendations already spelled out, Warren said her proposal is still necessary because it would commit in statute the prioritization of considering poverty in climate efforts. 
“I see formalizing this additional consideration of energy burden within the Council’s framework and ensuring it remains in statute as its own distinct priority is key to achieving the long-term commitment,” Warren said.
If there is a need for a more detailed analysis of energy burden and how to reduce it, Hubbell said it would be more appropriate for the Governor’s Energy Office to complete that work and include it in its biennial energy plan.  
The most recent iteration of that plan published in January also already includes recommendations for reducing the energy burden on low- and moderate-income households. These include conducting regular analyses of household energy costs, increasing awareness of assistance programs and expanding education on weatherization and other energy efficiency measures.

March 3, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The new commissioners set to regulate medical cannabis in Nebraska, as well as the ballot sponsors of the successful effort to legalize it in 2024, blasted an ongoing lawsuit against them as “meritless” and seeking to create a “false conflict.”
In briefs filed Friday, attorneys for the 11 defendants named in the John Kuehn v. Gov. Jim Pillen case explained why they are seeking to dismiss the case. 
Kuehn, a former state senator, former State Board of Health member and longtime marijuana opponent, filed the case in December. It sought to declare the voter-approved legalization and regulation of medical cannabis unconstitutional. He expanded the case in January to encompass more state officials.
The lawsuit’s main argument is that the Nebraska laws are unlawful, or preempted, because of the federal Controlled Substances Act.


The legal filings so far
John Kuehn initial lawsuit (filed Dec. 10)
John Kuehn amended lawsuit (filed Jan. 10)
State officials brief in support of motion to dismiss (filed March 28)
Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission brief in support of motion to dismiss (filed March 28)
Ballot sponsors brief in support of motion to dismiss (filed March 28)


Typically, cases can only move forward if the party suing can prove direct harm because of the laws, known as “standing.”
Kuehn has conceded he can’t prove standing directly, so to get his foot in the door, he is arguing that his case has standing on behalf of the “taxpayer” or “great public interest,” narrow paths for certain cases to proceed. The first standard regards the spending of public dollars, while the second argues the matter should be taken up because it is of a “great public interest” to Nebraskans.
The lawyers for five state officials, the three commissioners on the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission and the three ballot sponsors said neither type of standing applies to Kuehn.
“There is no ‘great public interest’ in invalidating a law approved by a massive supermajority of Nebraska voters which will be susceptible to challenge by many,” the attorney wrote for Bruce Bailey of Lincoln, Harry Hoch, Jr. of Omaha and Kim Lowe of Kearney of the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission.
Kuehn’s legal team had no immediate comment on the new filings. His team has until late April to file a response under a briefing order by Lancaster County District Judge Susan Strong. Strong, who ruled against Kuehn in an earlier marijuana-related case, has scheduled an in-person hearing on the motions to dismiss the preemption case for May 20.
The role of Congress
The sponsors of the medical cannabis ballot measure criticized Kuehn’s lawsuit as an attempt “to flip federalism on its head.” They said Kuehn “supports an expansive federal government and a weakened state government at the expense of Nebraska voters who just passed two laws by huge margins.”
Voters overwhelmingly approved the measure to legalize up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis with a physician’s recommendation with 71% support. It secured majority support in all of Nebraska’s 49 legislative districts. A second measure to regulate medical cannabis through the newly created commission passed with 67% support, including majority support in 46 legislative districts.

Campaign attorneys said the federal government — under presidents from former President Bill Clinton to President Donald Trump earlier this year — has never taken the preemption position.
The federal government still lists marijuana as a Schedule I drug, which is defined as having no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse, though the Trump and Biden administrations have taken steps toward reclassifying the drug.
The U.S. Department of Justice has also not prosecuted violations of federal cannabis law in states that have legalized marijuana, the ballot sponsors’ attorneys wrote. Congress has also annually prohibited the Justice Department from spending funds to prevent states from implementing medical cannabis laws.
“Congress’s purpose is the ultimate touchstone in every preemption case, and here, Congress has decided to allow states to enact their own medical cannabis laws,” the ballot sponsors said.
Protecting ‘state sovereignty’
Attorney Jason Grams of Omaha, for the commissioners, said that while it is true that marijuana possession, manufacture and distribution are federally illegal, “that is far from the end of the analysis.”
Grams said preemption in this case, as Congress has designed it in the Controlled Substances Act, is implicated when it is “physically impossible” for a state law to coexist with federal law.
In the 39 states that have legalized medical cannabis, including Nebraska last fall, none has been thrown out on federal preemption standards, the commissioners said.
“We simply hold state sovereignty in greater regard than that,” Grams wrote.
Lawmakers, advocates mull medical cannabis regs to prevent ‘Wild West’ in Nebraska

Grams represented the Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana campaign in 2020 against a lawsuit brought by Lancaster County Sheriff Terry Wagner. The Nebraska Supreme Court ruled against the campaign and removed the measure off the ballot. 
The campaign tried again in 2022 and 2024 before succeeding at the ballot box.
Ballot sponsors have similarly pointed to the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which states: “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”
The AG’s Office did not address federal preemption in its motion to dismiss other than to say that “Kuehn may be correct on the merits of his substantive challenges.” 
Pillen and Hilgers have both hinted at questions regarding marijuana under federal law.

The ballot sponsors said Kuehn is in an “odd position” of being a Nebraska taxpayer suing “not to vindicate the rights of his fellow taxpayers but to secure the rights of the federal government.”
“Unlike most taxpayer lawsuits, success for Kuehn would not save taxpayers money — to the contrary, Kuehn’s success would decrease tax revenue, thereby increasing the per capita tax burden and harming taxpayers,” the brief states. “The federal government, not a resident taxpayer, is the interested party.”
No taxpayer dollars, yet
Another challenge in taking up Kuehn’s case now, Grams added, is pending legislation being considered by the Nebraska Legislature, which could render “moot” the statutes that Kuehn is challenging. He said Kuehn’s arguments against the commissioners “are aiming at a moving target.”
The main proposal, Legislative Bill 677 from State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, has not yet advanced from the General Affairs Committee. A vote on whether to advance the bill could come this week.
The commission also has no public dollars set aside to carry out its duties — no state funds, no donations, no fee revenue, no office, no address, no contact information, no equipment, no staff.
“No ability to carry out any duties set forth in the NMRCA [Nebraska Medical Cannabis Regulation Act],” the brief continues.

Up until Friday, with a “complete lack of resources,” the commissioners have:

Executed no contracts.
Held no meetings.
Advertised for no meetings.
Carried on no deliberations.
Held no votes.
Issued no regulations.
Commenced no work on regulations.
Sought no office or meeting space.
Sought to hire no employees.
Began no work on the criteria for licensure.
Retained no law enforcement resources.

As approved by voters, commissioners must craft regulations for licensure by July 1, which is three months away. Licensing is supposed to begin by Oct. 1. Under a pending bill, those deadlines could be extended and the commission could receive appropriations.
Members of the new Medical Cannabis Commission said the argument that the potential use of future taxpayer dollars is enough to move the case forward is “bunkum,” or nonsense.
The ballot sponsors’ attorneys said allowing the case to proceed could implicate the “incidental expenditures” of any state law and could allow any challenge to any law. They said allowing Kuehn to move forward on “taxpayer standing” grounds “would effectively swallow the rule — contrary to the Supreme Court’s instruction to apply the exception narrowly.”
If Kuehn is seeking to prevent someone from appropriating funds, the commissioners said, then Kuehn “has sued the wrong parties” and instead “must address his claim to the Legislature.”
Regulations in limbo
There’s also a technical fight for the commissioners, with Grams arguing that none of the commissioners was properly served as part of the case. 
Kuehn’s mostly out-of-state attorneys sent “legal threat” letters on Jan. 9, one day before the commissioners were added to the lawsuit, telling them not to enforce the laws.

However, the letter was sent to email addresses that Kuehn “guessed at” but that the commissioners don’t have access to, was mailed to the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission where the commissioners have dual roles at (but is separate) and was left with a woman in the AG’s Office, but not with the commissioners.
None of the commissioners had seen the legal threat telling the commissioners not to act until “long after” Jan. 10, the brief states, and Kuehn didn’t give “even a day to consider his demand, if he gave them a chance to review it at all.”
A pledged future challenge
In addition to Pillen, the AG’s Office is also defending Secretary of State Bob Evnen, CEO Steve Corsi of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, State Treasurer Tom Briese and Tax Commissioner Jim Kamm.
The AG’s Office said Evnen can’t be sued in a duplicative case on the topic. Kuehn continues to appeal his defeated lawsuit against Evnen and the campaign from last September.

Kuehn included Corsi arguing that DHHS would need to discipline doctors who recommend cannabis to patients. While DHHS has not issued guidance to physicians as part of the laws, the AG’s Office said recommending cannabis would open up Nebraska doctors to discipline.
The lawsuit argues that Briese and Kamm could violate money laundering laws if they collect tax revenue from medical marijuana sales, but all three attorney groups said courts have long upheld the collection of such taxes, including on illegal activity.
Rather than Kuehn, the AG’s Office argued, there is another person who would be better suited to challenge the laws: Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers.
Acting Deputy Solicitor General Zachary Pohlman, joining Hilgers in defending the state officials, appeared before the Legislature earlier this month. 
Pohlman then and again in the latest brief pledged — or in the view of some lawmakers, threatened — to challenge the constitutionality of the laws if the commission licensed medical cannabis establishments. The brief said that a lawsuit was but “one example” of future action.
“Expanding taxpayer standing to allow a private plaintiff to sue public officials to invalidate statutes that do not harm the plaintiff when the attorney general has pledged to do so himself not only stretches the judiciary’s jurisdiction beyond its proper scope,” the brief states. “It also tramples upon the authority of Nebraska’s chief law enforcement officer.”

(Robert Zullo/States Newsroom)The Oregon Legislature is expected to advance two bills this week that could provide electric utilities with a financial safety net and some level of protection from bankruptcy-inducing lawsuits if their equipment starts a catastrophic fire.
The bills bear striking resemblance to others being considered and passed by legislators in three other states, as well as controversial laws passed in Utah in 2020. PacifiCorp, owner of Pacific Power in Oregon, contributed to all of the bills and the Utah law.
Each of those bills confers upon utilities some version of state-sanctioned approval for “acting reasonably” to prevent wildfires, if they get wildfire mitigation plans approved annually or every few years by the state. Cooperative and private investor-owned utilities such as PacifiCorp say they need this to ensure that they are making smart investments in wildfire prevention and grid reliability, and to ensure they don’t go bankrupt.
That’s the argument being used by Oregon’s bill sponsors, too. But trial lawyers across the West, who represent victims of utility-caused wildfires, say the bills are meant to shift the costs of utility-caused wildfire damages from companies to customers.
 Oregon Legislature considers two bills related to wildfire, utilities

Oregon’s House Bill 3666 would grant utilities a state “wildfire safety certificate” for having annual wildfire mitigation plans approved by the Oregon Public Utility Commission, while House Bill 3917 would set up a catastrophic wildfire fund that utilities pay into.
Victims of utility-caused fires could collect from the fund 80% of “allowable damages,” as long as they agree not to sue the utility that caused the fire. The utilities would be allowed to raise customer rates to pay for the fund.
Reps. Pam Marsh, D-Ashland, and Kevin Mannix, R-Salem, are sponsoring both bills, which could be voted out of the House Judiciary Committee as early as Tuesday.
Marsh contends Oregon’s bills do not in any way infringe on wildfire victims’ ability to sue utilities for maximum damages for causing wildfires. She said in an email that legislative attorneys assured her House Bill 3666, offering utilities state certificates for having approved wildfire plans, would not provide immunity or limit liability to utilities.
Trial lawyers do not agree.
“This sort of regulatory compliance defense is a standard thing that corporations across the country are always asking for. This is what they would love,” said Daniel Hinkle, a lawyer and senior state affairs counsel for the American Association for Justice. “They would love to check a box and get it rubber-stamped by an agency without opposing counsel, without anybody there to sort of push back on it, and then be able to use that prior certification as a complete, total defense against any claims for accountability later on.”
The Washington, D.C.-based association made up of trial lawyers has been tracking bills across the country that were introduced this year to limit utility-caused wildfire liabilities, including in Oregon.
“The overall goal, as I see it across a lot of these bills, is to shift the cost of this (utility-caused wildfires) onto ratepayers,” Hinkle said.

Insurers, as well as timber, farm and ranchland owners have come out against the bills in Idaho and Wyoming and expressed concerns about Oregon’s bills.
Kenton Brine, president of the NW Insurance Council, said in an email Oregon’s bills would likely impact policy holders and insurance companies. The group has not taken a formal stance on them yet.
“The impact for property owners of bills that limit or grant immunity from liability is significant,” he said in an email.
He said he shares concerns with the trial lawyers over Oregon’s approach, and that legislation as proposed is “likely to impose a new burden of proof on a property owner seeking recovery after a utility-ignited wildfire.”
 PacifiCorp’s involvement on Oregon bills

In Oregon, PacifiCorp lobbyist Annette Price and lawyer Jennifer Hudson participated in Marsh’s work group on the bills, along with representatives of Oregon’s cooperative and public utilities and lobbyists for the two other electricity monopolies operating in the state, Portland General Electric and Idaho Power.
Combined, the three monopoly utilities control 75% of Oregon’s electricity market.
Omar Granados, a PacifiCorp spokesperson, said in an email that the company’s work on bills such as Marsh’s are business as usual.
“Consistent with our long-standing practice to provide information to lawmakers who are considering energy policy legislation that could impact the utility and our customers, we provide comments, answer questions and participate on a number of proposed energy policy bills in the states we serve, which include Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho and Wyoming,” he wrote.

Marsh has said in public hearings that she started working on House Bill 3666 and House Bill 3917 after hearing from constituents about lackluster wildfire prevention work being done by Pacific Power, her area’s monopoly utility, and to ensure utilities operating in the state don’t go bankrupt. She said House Bill 3666 “will hold utilities to a high standard of performance through implementation of a safety certification.”
Marsh said House Bill 3917, establishing the catastrophic wildfire fund, is needed so wildfire victims have options.
“Without the fund, individuals have these paths: 1) Those with insurance can use their coverage. 2) Those without insurance will, most likely, struggle to cover basic needs with savings, government assistance, or friends and family. 3) All affected individuals can choose to take the utility to court,” she wrote in an email.
About 2,300 homes burned up in her southern Oregon district during the 2020 Labor Day Fires. Because no cause of the fires in that area were identified, her constituents weren’t able to collect any damages from an at-fault party and those without insurance have been left with nothing.
She added that she sees the bill as a starting point.
“If people agree that a fund of some kind could be useful, we will need to discuss questions around structure and operations, including coverage, administration, the mix of fund contributions, and so forth.”
Cody Berne, a governor at large for the Oregon Trial Lawyers Association and an attorney at Portland-based law firm Stoll Berne, said Oregon’s catastrophic wildfire fund as proposed would likely encourage low-income fire survivors and those without insurance to forgo collecting maximum damages in a lawsuit against a utility in a powerline-ignited fire and instead settle for less from the fund — a fund seeded with victims’ own money, collected through rate increases by utilities.
“This bill would charge customers to create a fund and also make them pay the next time Berkshire Hathaway burns down an Oregon town,” Berne said.
Berne is representing survivors of the historic 2020 Labor Day fires that killed 11 and destroyed more than 4,000 homes. Some of those fires were found to have been started by PacifiCorp equipment. PacifiCorp is owned by the multinational conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway.
A jury in 2023 found the company guilty for negligence and recklessness. A recent report from the Oregon Department of Forestry concluded that PacifiCorp did not start fires it was previously found to have started in the Santiam Canyon, refuting statements from first responders from the U.S. Forest Service and trial testimony.
PacifiCorp executives estimate the 2020 Labor Day Fires and 2022 wildfires caused by the company’s equipment in Oregon cost them nearly $2.7 billion. Berkshire Hathaway estimates it could face up to $8 billion in claims related to lawsuits over California and Oregon wildfires since 2020. That’s a bit more than half of Berkshire’s 2024 revenue — a record $14.5 billion.
“Most people — including fire victims — have to live with the justice system as it is. But when the justice system holds billionaires and their trillion-dollar corporations accountable, they think they can change the rules,” Berne said.
 Starting with Utah legislation

PacifiCorp had its first success in contributing to legislation that limited its liability and the damages wildfire victims can collect in a powerline-ignited fire in 2020.
PacifiCorp lobbyists provided comments and answered questions for lawmakers working on Utah’s House Bill 66, according to spokesperson Granados. Granados did not answer questions about whether the lobbyists or company lawyers participated in bill workgroups or helped with the bills in the drafting stage.
“This was an effort by a broad coalition,” he said.
The Utah law offers electric utilities statutory protection from negligence charges in powerline-ignited wildfires if the utilities have an approved wildfire mitigation plan. It also limits damages that survivors of wildfire can collect in suits against utilities as the lesser of either the cost to rebuild, or the difference of the fair market value of the home before the fire and the fair market value of the property after the fire. That means if it costs $300,000 to rebuild a burned home, but the fair market value of the home before the fire was $100,000 and the fair market value of the scorched property after the fire is $20,000 a victim only gets to claim $80,000 in damages.
In the years since Utah’s law passed, PacifiCorp attempted to pass liability limits via states’ utility commissions. In Idaho in 2024 the company asked the state’s commission to include language that would have made its electric utility Rocky Mountain Power liable only for “actual economic damages” in a powerline-ignited fire, excluding noneconomic, punitive and incidental damages.
It made nearly identical requests to commissions in Washington, Oregon, California and Wyoming, according to reporting from Boise State Public Radio.
Idaho’s commission declined to approve the changes, so the company went to the Idaho Legislature. Other state legislatures followed.
 Reasonable and prudent

Oregon’s bills share similarities to that original 2020 Utah law. House Bill 3197, establishing a catastrophic wildfire fund, also limits recoverable damages from the fund to the lesser of either the cost of repairs or the difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and immediately after a catastrophic wildfire.
“The goal has been in a lot of these bills to restrict the recovery to the loss of fair market value, which is always going to be less than the cost of repair,” said Geoffrey Louden, a lawyer with the American Association for Justice.
All of the bills requiring approval or certification for wildfire mitigation plans that PacifiCorp has weighed in on in the West include language that describe the utilities as having acted “reasonably” and “prudently” to prevent fire in securing state approval.
Trial lawyers take the greatest issue with those words, as they are often used to establish a statutory presumption that an entity has not acted in a negligent, grossly negligent or reckless manner in cases of civil wrongdoing.
Hinkle, of the American Association for Justice, said getting laws passed with language like this is “standard corporate behavior 101.”
Marsh recently amended House Bill 3666 to remove language that previously said a wildfire safety certificate from the state “establishes that an applicant is acting reasonably with regard to wildfire safety practices,” to instead say a certificate indicates the utility was “consistent with the commission’s wildfire safety standards,” and cut off a provision making the certificate valid for 12 months. She said she worked with trial lawyers on the amendment.
But Berne of the Oregon Trial Lawyers Association and large landowners say this is not enough.
“If the goal is safety, this bill won’t accomplish it,” Berne said in an email. “It recycles fire safety rules that are already in place. There are no resources to investigate and make sure that investor-owned power companies are following the rules. The bill just gives the appearance of safety.”
Betsy Earls, a lobbyist for timber giant Weyerhaeuser, said issuing safety certifications to the utilities could have unintended consequences for companies like Weyerhaeuser even with Marsh’s amendment.
“It will amount to perhaps a thumb on the scale when juries are deciding and people are thinking about what’s being introduced and proven in court,” she told lawmakers at a March 18 public hearing for House Bill 3666.
The company’s 1.5 million acres in Oregon are prohibitively expensive to insure, she said, and though it deals every year with all kinds of fires and losses, sometimes the fires are caused by utility equipment, and the only recompense the company has for its losses is to sue the utility.
“We have no other way to recoup losses that are due to others’ negligence unless we go to court,” Earls said.



 How are California’s utility and wildfire damage bills different?

In 2019, California passed laws creating a wildfire safety certification program for utilities as well as a catastrophic wildfire fund. But the policies in California are far different than those being proposed in Oregon and other states in the West, according to Berne of the Oregon Trial Lawyers Association.
Wildfire safety certificates in California cannot by law be used to limit utilities’ liability in lawsuits because monopoly utilities in California are considered “strictly liable” for any fires they start. Having an approved plan and certificate from the California Public Utility Commission means the utility is allowed to raise rates to pay for wildfire prevention work and to participate in California’s catastrophic wildfire fund.
The fund is available for qualifying utilities to recoup costs after they’ve paid fire victims damages. The fund does not send money directly to victims, who are never forced to give up their lawsuits, and who face no artificial caps on what they can collect in damages from utilities.
PacifiCorp did not contribute to California’s legislation, according to Omar Granados, a company spokesperson.

Minnesota’s increasing costs are outpacing revenues and could cause a projected $6 billion budget deficit in the two years beginning in July 2027.
Democratic and Republican leaders, who share power in the 67-67 House, negotiated a compromise that would leave $1.6 billion on the bottom line over the next two years and would reduce the projected budget deficit to $1.3 billion in the following biennium.
Inflation is expected to create another $1.1 billion in expenses for the state in the upcoming budget, but lawmakers say they won’t be providing inflation adjustments to agency budgets except where required by law.
That means cuts will be more widespread and deeper than reflected in the targets, as agencies will face rising costs without money appropriated to cover them. State workers — whose compensation typically comprises the bulk of many agency budgets — are sure to demand pay raises that keep up with inflation, for instance. Overall, the House’s budget framework would cut $3.7 billion from the state’s budget over the next four years.
Senate Democrats released their budget targets on Friday and also didn’t account for inflation.
Budget targets are guidelines for legislative committees, which will then add specificity to agency budgets. Targets are subject to change, and often do, as lawmakers create their biennial budget in the remaining weeks of session. The Legislature must pass a budget by June 30, though the Legislature is scheduled to adjourn May 19.
Spending on Medical Assistance, Minnesota’s Medicaid program, makes up nearly 30% of the state’s budget. The use of disability waivers, which provide services to the elderly and disabled, is rapidly increasing, as is the per-person cost of providing care. 
Budget officials estimate that if the state continues on its current trajectory, spending on Medical Assistance and DHS programs will grow from around $22 billion in the current budget to more than $27 billion by the 2028-29 budget.
Gov. Tim Walz, House leaders and the Senate DFL are all in agreement that the state should target DHS spending in order to avert a deficit. State law requires DHS to adjust disability waiver payouts for inflation every two years; Walz wants to cap the inflation adjustments at 2% per year, likely below the real inflation rate. 
That would save an estimated $1.3 billion over the next four years — the same as the House budget targets — though House leaders would not confirm that Walz’s proposal was included in the targets.
The cost of Medical Assistance is shared with the federal government, but if President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress want to pass their planned tax cuts, they’ll almost certainly have to cut federal Medicaid spending. That means Minnesota would have to spend more to maintain current levels of service, or cut services.
The House targets include spending cuts on health and human services, environment and a mandate that the House Taxes Committee reduce tax subsidies and/or the Local Government Aid program, or increase taxes, which Republicans oppose.
“We’re holding strong against tax increases. We know that Minnesotans are overtaxed, and we can’t put more burden onto Minnesotans at this point,” said House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring.
Demuth said the “targets are an absolute win” and praised the spending reductions.
House Ways and Means co-chair Rep. Zack Stephenson, DFL-Coon Rapids, said the House could have avoided cuts in the health and human services, which will affect the most vulnerable Minnesotans, if Republicans were willing to adopt tax increases.
“These budget targets represent a compromise between Democrats and Republicans, and if Democrats were setting targets on our own, these targets would look very different. We would have asked the wealthy and large corporations to pay their fair share in order to make additional needed investments in public education and affordable health care,” said DFL House leader Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park, at a Capitol press conference Monday.
With the bipartisan House agreement, the Legislature is well-positioned to finish a budget by the May 19 adjournment deadline.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2099-1024x732.jpg,,,2025-03-31 16:04:35.747665

(Main photo by Clark Kauffman/Iowa Capital Dispatch. Inset photo of company policy is from U.S. District Court records)Casey’s General Store is being sued for allegedly exploiting its workers through the discriminatory practice of imposing a tobacco-use surcharge for health insurance coverage.
The surcharge, which is alleged to be $35 per pay period, amounts to an illegal “cash grab” by Casey’s that is masquerading as a wellness program, the lawsuit claims.
Filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, the lawsuit seeks class-action status but is currently filed on behalf of one Casey’s employee, Elizabeth Blalock of Carroll County, Missouri.
Attorneys for Blalock allege that all Casey’s workers are automatically assumed to use tobacco unless they submit to a process in which they provide a sworn affidavit stating they do not. Any worker who fails to complete that process by a specified deadline is then required to pay “tobacco surcharge” for the entire calendar year, even if they do not use tobacco, the lawsuit claims.
In addition, Casey’s allegedly fails to provide the federally required options that would allow employees to avoid the surcharge. “The surcharge is structured as a penalty rather than a legitimate wellness incentive,” the lawsuit claims, since the workers “who miss the enrollment deadline are penalized for the entire year without any opportunity to later demonstrate compliance or avoid the surcharge.”
The lawsuit is based on the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. ERISA allows employers to deduct from workers’ pay a tobacco-use surcharge, but only in connection with wellness programs that meet specific federal guidelines established in 2014. Those regulations state they are intended to ensure corporate wellness programs actually promote health as opposed to being a “subterfuge for discriminating based on a health factor.”
The lawsuit alleges Casey’s is illegally shifting the costs associated with less healthy workers from the company back to those same workers “who end up subsidizing their healthier colleagues.”
ERISA bars any health insurer or medical plan from discriminating against participants by charging premiums based on a “health-related factor,” including tobacco use. It does, however, allow group health plans to establish premium discounts or rebates” in return for adherence to programs that promote wellness and disease prevention.
Casey’s, the lawsuit claims, does not meet that standard.
“There is no smoking-cessation program, waiver, or alternative route for tobacco users” to avoid the surcharge, the lawsuit alleges. “The only avenue for smokers to avoid the surcharge is to quit smoking and then submit that change in status to the benefits department. Thus, tobacco users are penalized based solely on their status as smokers, which violates ERISA’s nondiscrimination provisions.”
The lawsuit goes on to allege that “allowing companies like Casey’s to exploit their participants and unlawfully extract millions from them under the guise of a wellness program that is, in reality, a cash grab, directly contradicts ERISA’s purpose of protecting workers from health-based discrimination. If unchecked, this practice would permit employers to manipulate wellness programs as revenue generating schemes rather than genuine health initiatives.”
According to the lawsuit, Blalock has forfeited to Casey’s $35 in earnings per pay period — roughly $910 per year — in order to maintain health coverage through the company.
Casey’s, which is headquartered in Ankeny, is one of the nation’s largest convenience store chains, with more than 2,600 locations in 16 states. There are more than 18,000 employees enrolled in the company’s health plan, according to court records.
In seeking class-action status for their lawsuit, the plaintiff’s attorneys argue the amount of money at issue exceeds $5 million, and the number of Casey’s workers who might potentially join the case is more than 1,000.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for unlawful imposition of a discriminatory tobacco surcharge and breach of fiduciary duty. Casey’s has yet to file a response to the lawsuit. The company did not immediately respond Monday to requests for comment.
The plaintiff is represented by attorney Adam J. Wachal of the Koley Jessen law firm in Omaha.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Days before Wisconsinites go to the polls to decide which candidate will win an open seat on the state Supreme Court, the richest man in the world, Elon Musk, gave oversized $1 million checks to two Wisconsin voters.
Appearing on stage in front of more than 1,000 people and wearing a cheesehead hat, Musk, who has spent more than $20 million supporting the candidacy of conservative-backed Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel, gave out the money at a rally in Green Bay Sunday night. From the stage, Musk  said the race, which will decide the ideological balance of the Court, could “affect the entire destiny of humanity.” 
Aside from the two checks he gave out on Sunday, America PAC, the political action committee Musk has used to funnel money into the race, offered Wisconsin voters $100 each to fill out a petition against “activist judges” and provide contact information. Musk’s money has also been used to hire people from out-of-state to knock on doors on behalf of Schimel and blanket the state in ads. 
Democrats and Schimel’s opponent, Dane County Judge Susan Crawford, have accused Musk of trying to buy a seat on the Court, pointing out that Musk’s company, Tesla, is currently fighting a lawsuit against the state of Wisconsin over its law that prevents car manufacturers from selling directly to consumers. 
Musk said the $1 million giveaway was a strategy to get attention on the race. 
“We need to get attention,” he said. “Somewhat inevitably, when I do these things, it causes the legacy media to kind of lose their minds.”
Wisconsin state law includes provisions that make it illegal to offer people money in exchange for voting. In an initial post on his social media site, X, Musk said that the winners of the money would need to prove they had voted. He later deleted that post and updated the contest so that people only had to complete the America PAC petition. 
Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul sued to block the giveaway, alleging that it violated state law against election bribery. Judges at the circuit, appellate and Supreme Court levels declined to step in. 
Musk’s involvement in the race has become one of the campaign’s major issues as voters are about to head to the polls. The state Democratic party has held People v.

(Photo by Jason Cameron/Getty Images)The Oregon Legislature is expected to advance two bills this week that could provide electric utilities with a financial safety net and some level of protection from bankruptcy-inducing lawsuits if their equipment starts a catastrophic fire.
The bills bear striking resemblance to others being considered and passed by legislators in three other states, as well as controversial laws passed in Utah in 2020. PacifiCorp, owner of Pacific Power in Oregon, contributed to all of the bills and the Utah law.
Each of those bills confers upon utilities some version of state-sanctioned approval for “acting reasonably” to prevent wildfires, if they get wildfire mitigation plans approved annually or every few years by the state. Cooperative and private investor-owned utilities such as PacifiCorp say they need this to ensure that they are making smart investments in wildfire prevention and grid reliability, and to ensure they don’t go bankrupt.
That’s the argument being used by Oregon’s bill sponsors, too. But trial lawyers across the West, who represent victims of utility-caused wildfires, say the bills are meant to shift the costs of utility-caused wildfire damages from companies to customers.
Oregon’s House Bill 3666 would grant utilities a state “wildfire safety certificate” for having annual wildfire mitigation plans approved by the Oregon Public Utility Commission, while House Bill 3917 would set up a catastrophic wildfire fund that utilities pay into.
Victims of utility-caused fires could collect from the fund 80% of “allowable damages,” as long as they agree not to sue the utility that caused the fire. The utilities would be allowed to raise customer rates to pay for the fund.
Reps. Pam Marsh, D-Ashland and Kevin Mannix, R-Salem, are sponsoring both bills, which could be voted out of the House Judiciary Committee as early as Tuesday.
Marsh contends Oregon’s bills do not in any way infringe on wildfire victims’ ability to sue utilities for maximum damages for causing wildfires. She said in an email that legislative attorneys assured her House Bill 3666, offering utilities state certificates for having approved wildfire plans, would not provide immunity or limit liability to utilities.
Trial lawyers do not agree.
“This sort of regulatory compliance defense is a standard thing that corporations across the country are always asking for. This is what they would love,” said Daniel Hinkle, a lawyer and senior state affairs counsel for the American Association for Justice. “They would love to check a box and get it rubber-stamped by an agency without opposing counsel, without anybody there to sort of push back on it, and then be able to use that prior certification as a complete, total defense against any claims for accountability later on.”
The Washington, D.C.-based association made up of trial lawyers has been tracking bills across the country that were introduced this year to limit utility-caused wildfire liabilities, including in Oregon.
“The overall goal, as I see it across a lot of these bills, is to shift the cost of this (utility-caused wildfires) onto ratepayers,” Hinkle said.

Insurers, as well as timber, farm and ranchland owners have come out against the bills in Idaho and Wyoming and expressed concerns about Oregon’s bills.
Kenton Brine, president of the NW Insurance Council, said in an email Oregon’s bills would likely impact policy holders and insurance companies. The group has not taken a formal stance on them yet.
“The impact for property owners of bills that limit or grant immunity from liability is significant,” he said in an email.
He said he shares concerns with the trial lawyers over Oregon’s approach, and that legislation as proposed is “likely to impose a new burden of proof on a property owner seeking recovery after a utility-ignited wildfire.”
PacifiCorp involvement
In Oregon, PacifiCorp lobbyist Annette Price and lawyer Jennifer Hudson participated in Marsh’s work group on the bills, along with representatives of Oregon’s cooperative and public utilities and lobbyists for the two other electricity monopolies operating in the state, Portland General Electric and Idaho Power.
Combined, the three monopoly utilities control 75% of Oregon’s electricity market.
Omar Granados, a PacifiCorp spokesperson, said in an email that the company’s work on bills such as Marsh’s are business as usual.
“Consistent with our long-standing practice to provide information to lawmakers who are considering energy policy legislation that could impact the utility and our customers, we provide comments, answer questions and participate on a number of proposed energy policy bills in the states we serve, which include Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho and Wyoming,” he wrote.
Marsh has said in public hearings that she started working on House Bill 3666 and House Bill 3917 after hearing from constituents about lackluster wildfire prevention work being done by Pacific Power, her area’s monopoly utility, and to ensure utilities operating in the state don’t go bankrupt. She said House Bill 3666 “will hold utilities to a high standard of performance through implementation of a safety certification.”
Marsh said House Bill 3917, establishing the catastrophic wildfire fund, is needed so wildfire victims have options.
“Without the fund, individuals have these paths: 1) Those with insurance can use their coverage. 2) Those without insurance will, most likely, struggle to cover basic needs with savings, government assistance, or friends and family. 3) All affected individuals can choose to take the utility to court,” she wrote in an email.
About 2,300 homes burned up in her southern Oregon district during the 2020 Labor Day Fires. Because no cause of the fires in that area were identified, her constituents weren’t able to collect any damages from an at-fault party and those without insurance have been left with nothing.
She added that she sees the bill as a starting point.
“If people agree that a fund of some kind could be useful, we will need to discuss questions around structure and operations, including coverage, administration, the mix of fund contributions, and so forth.”
Cody Berne, a governor at large for the Oregon Trial Lawyers Association and an attorney at Portland-based law firm Stoll Berne, said Oregon’s catastrophic wildfire fund as proposed would likely encourage low-income fire survivors and those without insurance to forgo collecting maximum damages in a lawsuit against a utility in a powerline-ignited fire and instead settle for less from the fund — a fund seeded with victims’ own money, collected through rate increases by utilities.
“This bill would charge customers to create a fund and also make them pay the next time Berkshire Hathaway burns down an Oregon town,” Berne said.
Berne is representing survivors of the historic 2020 Labor Day fires that killed 11 and destroyed more than 4,000 homes. Some of those fires were found to have been started by PacifiCorp equipment. PacifiCorp is owned by the multinational conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway.
A jury in 2023 found the company guilty for negligence and recklessness. A recent report from the Oregon Department of Forestry concluded that PacifiCorp did not start fires it was previously found to have started in the Santiam Canyon, refuting statements from first responders from the U.S. Forest Service and trial testimony.
PacifiCorp executives estimate the 2020 Labor Day Fires and 2022 wildfires caused by the company’s equipment in Oregon cost them nearly $2.7 billion. Berkshire Hathaway estimates it could face up to $8 billion in claims related to lawsuits over California and Oregon wildfires since 2020. That’s a bit more than half of Berkshire’s 2024 revenue — a record $14.5 billion.
“Most people — including fire victims — have to live with the justice system as it is. But when the justice system holds billionaires and their trillion-dollar corporations accountable, they think they can change the rules,” Berne said.
Starting with Utah
PacifiCorp had its first success in contributing to legislation that limited its liability and the damages wildfire victims can collect in a powerline-ignited fire in 2020.
PacifiCorp lobbyists provided comments and answered questions for lawmakers working on Utah’s House Bill 66, according to spokesperson Granados. Granados did not answer questions about whether the lobbyists or company lawyers participated in bill workgroups or helped with the bills in the drafting stage.
“This was an effort by a broad coalition,” he said.
The Utah law offers electric utilities statutory protection from negligence charges in powerline-ignited wildfires if the utilities have an approved wildfire mitigation plan. It also limits damages that survivors of wildfire can collect in suits against utilities as the lesser of either the cost to rebuild, or the difference of the fair market value of the home before the fire and the fair market value of the property after the fire. That means if it costs $300,000 to rebuild a burned home, but the fair market value of the home before the fire was $100,000 and the fair market value of the scorched property after the fire is $20,000 a victim only gets to claim $80,000 in damages.
In the years since Utah’s law passed, PacifiCorp attempted to pass liability limits via states’ utility commissions. In Idaho in 2024 the company asked the state’s commission to include language that would have made its electric utility Rocky Mountain Power liable only for “actual economic damages” in a powerline-ignited fire, excluding noneconomic, punitive and incidental damages.
It made nearly identical requests to commissions in Washington, Oregon, California and Wyoming, according to reporting from Boise State Public Radio.
Idaho’s commission declined to approve the changes, so the company went to the Idaho Legislature. Other state legislatures followed.
Reasonable and prudent
Oregon’s bills share similarities to that original 2020 Utah law. House Bill 3197, establishing a catastrophic wildfire fund, also limits recoverable damages from the fund to the lesser of either the cost of repairs or the difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and immediately after a catastrophic wildfire.
“The goal has been in a lot of these bills to restrict the recovery to the loss of fair market value, which is always going to be less than the cost of repair,” said Geoffrey Louden, a lawyer with the American Association for Justice.
All of the bills requiring approval or certification for wildfire mitigation plans that PacifiCorp has weighed in on in the West include language that describe the utilities as having acted “reasonably” and “prudently” to prevent fire in securing state approval.
Trial lawyers take the greatest issue with those words, as they are often used to establish a statutory presumption that an entity has not acted in a negligent, grossly negligent or reckless manner in cases of civil wrongdoing.
Hinkle, of the American Association for Justice, said getting laws passed with language like this is “standard corporate behavior 101.”
Marsh recently amended House Bill 3666 to remove language that previously said a wildfire safety certificate from the state “establishes that an applicant is acting reasonably with regard to wildfire safety practices,” to instead say a certificate indicates the utility was “consistent with the commission’s wildfire safety standards,” and cut off a provision making the certificate valid for 12 months. She said she worked with trial lawyers on the amendment.
But Berne of the Oregon Trial Lawyers Association and large landowners say this is not enough.
“If the goal is safety, this bill won’t accomplish it,” Berne said in an email. “It recycles fire safety rules that are already in place. There are no resources to investigate and make sure that investor-owned power companies are following the rules. The bill just gives the appearance of safety.”
Betsy Earls, a lobbyist for timber giant Weyerhaeuser, said issuing safety certifications to the utilities could have unintended consequences for companies like Weyerhaeuser even with Marsh’s amendment.
“It will amount to perhaps a thumb on the scale when juries are deciding and people are thinking about what’s being introduced and proven in court,” she told lawmakers at a March 18 public hearing for House Bill 3666.
The company’s 1.5 million acres in Oregon are prohibitively expensive to insure, she said, and though it deals every year with all kinds of fires and losses, sometimes the fires are caused by utility equipment, and the only recompense the company has for its losses is to sue the utility.
“We have no other way to recoup losses that are due to others’ negligence unless we go to court,” Earls said.
 


How are California’s utility and wildfire damage bills different?

	
In 2019, California passed laws creating a wildfire safety certification program for utilities as well as a catastrophic wildfire fund. But the policies in California are far different than those being proposed in Oregon and other states in the West, according to Berne of the Oregon Trial Lawyers Association. Wildfire safety certificates in California cannot by law be used to limit utilities’ liability in lawsuits because monopoly utilities in California are considered “strictly liable” for any fires they start. Having an approved plan and certificate from the California Public Utility Commission means the utility is allowed to raise rates to pay for wildfire prevention work and to participate in California’s catastrophic wildfire fund. The fund is available for qualifying utilities to recoup costs after they’ve paid fire victims damages. The fund does not send money directly to victims, who are never forced to give up their lawsuits, and who face no artificial caps on what they can collect in damages from utilities. PacifiCorp did not contribute to California’s legislation, according to Omar Granados, a company spokesperson.

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas officials on Monday said they plan to close a loophole in federal election law that allows foreign nationals to contribute money toward ballot measures, in the latest move aimed at overhauling the state’s ballot process.
House Bill 1837, sponsored by Rep. Mindy McAlindon, R-Centerton, would require an “affirmation” from the individual or organization making a donation that it “has not knowingly or willfully accepted funds in excess of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) in the aggregate from one (1) or more prohibited sources within the four-year period immediately preceding” the donation.
The bill defines a “prohibited source” as a political action committee that accepts at least one contribution from a foreign national, an organization funded by a PAC that receives a donation from a foreign national, contributions from a foreign national and contributions that violate state or federal law.
The bill will go before the House State Agencies and Government Affairs Committee later this week, McAlindon said, where she expects the Legislature’s “full support.”
Arkansas Secretary of State Cole Jester said in a press conference Monday morning that “foreign billionaires have been donating tens and hundreds of billions of dollars to statewide ballot initiatives across this country, including Arkansas.”
“In fact, a single Swiss billionaire, Hansjörg Wyss, has spent over $100 million in ballot initiatives across the country in an effort to remake the American Constitution in what he called a progressive vision,” Jester said.
(The Wyss Foundation is one of the supporters of States Newsroom.) 
While many state constitutions can be altered via direct democracy processes, the United States Constitution can only be changed via a specific process that does not include voting in an election.
Jester cited President Donald Trump’s recent executive order targeting election processes.
“President Trump has taken action on this in his recent executive order on election security,” Jester said. “He said that the foreign funding [of] ballot initiatives is a serious problem that states need to address. It’s unacceptable. In Arkansas, if you are a wealthy foreign national, we welcome your tourism, we welcome your friendship, but our constitution is not for sale.”

However, when asked, Jester only cited $1.34 million in donations from the 1630 Fund in 2018, an American nonprofit that is part of a network of left-leaning so-called “dark money” groups. He said the Swiss billionaire made donations to the 1630 Fund in 2018.
He said that Arkansans should know that “the person taking your signature was most likely funded by a Swiss billionaire who has never stepped foot in our great state.” However, Jester specifically said the issue he described with foreign funding of ballot measures wasn’t an issue during the 2024 election, although he anticipated that would not remain the case in future election cycles.
When requested, Jester’s office provided filings made by Arkansans For A Fair Wage during the 2018 election cycle, which showed that the 1630 Fund donated just over $1.34 million on $1.5 million in total donations received by the ballot committee. There’s no indication that any of Wyss’ donations to the 1630 Fund were included in the money the nonprofit gave to the Arkansas ballot committee. 
According to the 1630 Fund’s IRS Form 990, which nonprofits file each year, the fund received $143.3 million in contributions in 2018 alone, with $141.39 million in expenses.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi Monday ordered the dismissal of a longstanding Department of Justice lawsuit challenging Republican Georgia lawmakers’ overhaul of the state’s election laws in 2021.
Bondi said in a statement Monday that the federal lawsuit against Senate Bill 202 will be dismissed because it contained false claims that the Georgia election legislation was a politically motivated retaliation against Black voters and other Democratic-leaning voters who supported Democratic President Joe Biden.
Biden narrowly won Georgia’s 16 electoral votes in 2020 by less than 12,000 votes.
Republican legislators defended changes they made to Georgia’s election as part of an effort to restore public confidence in elections by tightening absentee ballot requirements, improving voter security and other aspects of the voting process.
Bondi is dismissing the Biden-era lawsuit challenging a law that critics called “Jim Crow 2.0.”
The turnout of Black voters in Georgia actually increased following the passage of the election overhaul, Bondi said.
“Contrary to the Biden Administration’s false claims of suppression, Black voter turnout actually increased under SB 202,” she said. “Georgians deserve secure elections, not fabricated claims of false voter suppression meant to divide us. Americans can be confident that this Department of Justice will protect their vote and never play politics with election integrity.”
Various progressive voting and civil right organizations and the Democratic Party targeted SB 202, a package of nearly several election bills Republican lawmakers pushed through with only five days left in the 2021 legislative session.
Georgia’s controversial 2021 voting law overhaul survives preliminary legal challenge

Prior to the 2024 election cycle, a Georgia federal court judge declined to temporarily block the state’s controversial election rules.
Trump won a second term in the White House in 2024 after securing 312 electoral votes to defeat Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. Georgia cast all 16 of its electoral votes for Trump.

Gretchen Whitmer wrapped up a weeklong mission in the United Kingdom and Ireland aimed at strengthening foreign economic relationships while state Republican lawmakers criticize her for being a “frequent flyer”.
This investment expedition is the latest venture in a string of economic-focused trips in recent months, including a trip aimed to build economic partnerships in Spain in November and a mission to seek out partnership opportunities in the United Arab Emirates in February. 
The European trip included meetings with industry and business leaders, as well as government officials to discuss collaborations in tourism and agribusiness, as well as defense and aerospace manufacturing, a news release from Whitmer’s office said.
The goal is to place Michigan at the forefront of innovation, Whitmer said in the release, placing the state in the best position to build upon its legacy of excellence in manufacturing and leadership in the agriculture industry.
“I was proud to travel to the United Kingdom and Ireland to strengthen our relationships with business and government leaders, tell our story, and make the case for Michigan as the best place to innovate, build the future, and grow,” Whitmer said.
Whitmer had a delegation of leaders from Michigan on the trip with her including the directors of the Michigan Department of Agriculture & Rural Development and the Department of Natural Resources.
Efforts to connect with Michigan’s partners across the globe reinforces Michigan as a go-to ally in economic development,  CEO of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation Quentin L. Messer, Jr said. 
“Whether in tourism, agribusiness or advanced manufacturing, by engaging directly with business and government leaders, Team Michigan is demonstrating our commitment to companies currently with Michigan presences and encouraging new ones to establish presences, while showcasing our world-class workforce, infrastructure, innovation ecosystem and location advantage,”  Messer said.
But as Michigan leaders across the political aisle tackle the issue of growing the state’s slow-growing population and making Michigan a prime choice to live and work, some state lawmakers say Whitmer ought to focus on domestic needs rather than racking up “frequent flyer miles.”
While Michigan’s international image may be dazzling, Rep. Tom Kunse (R-Clare) encouraged Michigan’s governor to lower her sunglasses long enough to see all the issues in Michigan that he says require her executive attention, offered in a tongue-in-cheek special tribute resolution “To Express Admiration for the Governor’s Tireless Commitment to International Visits and Frequent Flyer Programs”.
Kunse’s special tribute implores Whitmer to recognize that there is more than enough work that needs to be done in Michigan that ought to take precedence over international relations. Further, Michiganders are still waiting on Whitmer to deliver on her promise of a long term road funding plan and improvements in education and lowering the costs of living.

“While Michigan residents are busy dodging potholes, it’s reassuring to know that our governor is off admiring the roads of Europe,” Kunse said in a statement. “International diplomacy is alive and well, thanks to her firm belief that state business is best conducted from a poolside cabana located anywhere but Michigan.”
In order to bolster transparency and efficiency of overseas trips made by the governor, Rep. Steve Carra (R-Three Rivers) introduced a bill Thursday that would require a majority vote in both the state House and Senate to approve state funding for such trips.
House Bill 4310 would also require the governor’s office to submit the destination of travel, what the dates are of travel and the purpose of the excursion.
Whitmer’s office was asked about the GOP response to the trade trip, but did not return a request for comment by the time of publication.

Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion.
“We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat. “It’s the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It’s not sustainable, it’s not right and it’s not ethical.”
Addis and Democratic lawmakers in nearly a dozen other states want to force the world’s largest fossil fuel companies to help pay for the recovery costs of climate-related disasters. Last year, Vermont became the first state to pass a “climate Superfund” law, followed soon after by New York.
This session, 10 states have seen similar proposals, several of which have advanced in key committees. Advocates point to legislation in Maryland that has drawn support in both chambers, as well as to strong grassroots support in California after the Los Angeles wildfires.
Lawmakers say the rapidly increasing cost of climate disasters — from wildfires to floods to sea level rise — is more than state budgets can bear.
“Climate Superfund is the ‘it girl’ policy of the [2025] session,” said Ava Gallo, climate and energy program manager with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “There’s a lot of popularity in the idea of holding polluters responsible.”
The momentum for these “polluter pays” bills is tied to the maturation of attribution science. That new field of research can help calculate fossil fuel companies’ contributions to historic emissions totals, as well as the role climate change played in causing or worsening natural disasters.
Vermont’s law was the first attempt to use that science to charge emitters for their role in causing devastating floods and other catastrophes.
Fossil fuel companies and their allies have fought back hard. Late last year, the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging Vermont’s measure. The groups argue that emissions are governed by the federal Clean Air Act, precluding states from charging companies over global pollution.

Neither group responded to a Stateline interview request. The Independent Petroleum Association of America also declined an interview request.
A separate lawsuit, led by 22 Republican attorneys general, is challenging the New York law. And a conservative group has targeted Rachel Rothschild, an assistant professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, who helped draft the legal justification for climate Superfund policy. The group, Government Accountability and Oversight, has sought to subject Rothschild to a deposition, The New York Times reported, a move that some experts view as an intimidation tactic.
Meanwhile, oil and gas executives asked President Donald Trump during a White House meeting this month to direct the Justice Department to join the legal fight against climate Superfund laws, The Wall Street Journal reported. Industry leaders are also pushing Congress to shield them from more than 30 lawsuits brought by state and local governments that aim to make them pay for some of the results of climate change.
While experts expect a bruising legal battle over climate Superfund policies, the threat of lawsuits hasn’t deterred more lawmakers from backing the concept.
“States were a little bit wary; they wondered, ‘Is this some new radical plan?’” said Cassidy DiPaola, communications director with the Make Polluters Pay campaign, a coalition of groups backing such bills. “Then one of the littlest states passed it and this powerhouse, New York, passed it. That really set the ball rolling.”
Fossil fuel companies have cast doubt on attribution science. They also note that their production of oil and other products was done legally under U.S. and international regulations.
“Manufacturers will see this as a shakedown of any industry you don’t like at some point in the future, even though in the past they were licensed and operated under government regulation,” Brett Vassey, president and CEO of the Virginia Manufacturers Association, said during legislative testimony about a climate Superfund proposal in that state. “It will have a chilling effect on Virginia being able to grow its economy.”
Proponents of Superfund legislation point to legal settlements with large tobacco companies in the 1990s. Although those companies also sold their products legally, they were held responsible because they knew about the harmful effects of those products and deceived the public. Most climate Superfund proposals target companies for their emissions over the past 30 or so years, after leading experts had documented the dangers of greenhouse gases.
“There’s good documentation of how well the fossil fuel industry knew the probable long-term impacts of their product,” said Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat. “Should an industry that made such historic profits over a period of time and made so many representations that we had no problem not bear any of the costs?”
Golden and other lawmakers say it’s becoming impossible for taxpayers to cover the costs of recovery from wildfires and other catastrophes. In Rhode Island, sea level rise is causing massive damage for coastal communities, said Democratic state Rep. Jennifer Boylan, who has sponsored a climate Superfund bill to help the state adapt.
Some advocates also note that Trump’s return to the White House has cut off the possibility of federal climate relief.
“All the states are affected by the disappearance of this federal funding,” said Gallo, of the state lawmakers group. “States everywhere are going to be looking at some way to fill the gap.”
This session, climate Superfund bills have been introduced in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Virginia.
While the bills are structured differently, they all seek to target the largest polluters — often covering companies that produced 1 billion metric tons of emissions over the last 30 or so years. Lawmakers say that applies to roughly 100 companies.
The measures also take different approaches to assigning damages. Some direct state agencies to conduct complex studies to determine the costs of climate-caused disasters over a certain period, the approach pioneered by Vermont. Others set a fixed number that represents a conservative baseline for those damages. New York’s law set that figure at $75 billion over a 25-year period.
Many of the bills also require that significant amounts of the funding be directed to the communities hit hardest by pollution.
Advocates are particularly optimistic about the measures in California and Maryland.
Lawmakers in Maryland modified their bills to commission a study about the financial impacts of climate change. Those measures passed both the House and Senate, and legislators are working to reconcile the versions from each chamber. Figures produced by the study would be the backbone of a climate Superfund policy in a future session.
“From a legislative perspective, it’s a shot in the dark as to what the costs are,” said Democratic Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo, who sponsored one of the bills. “This will give us the factual data needed to make a more well-educated decision on policy.”
In New Jersey, an Assembly committee advanced a climate Superfund bill this month. State Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee and who sponsored the bill, said it will help to rebuild and fortify water treatment plants, schools and firehouses. He noted that Trump has called for the dismantling of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“The end of the world is coming; it’s kind of hard to ignore,” Smith said. “FEMA has been the backstop to help communities recover from disasters. If the handwriting isn’t on the wall to all the states that they’ve got to deal with this, shame on them.”
Lawmakers in many states have heard from mayors and other local government leaders that more climate recovery funding is essential.
“Municipal officials are getting behind [climate Superfund policies],” said Massachusetts state Sen. Jamie Eldridge, a Democrat who has sponsored similar legislation. “They’re facing the costs of flooding, of droughts, of heat waves, and really asking for relief.”

(Katie Adkins for KFF Health News)In the wooded highlands of northern Arkansas, where small towns have few dentists, water officials who serve more than 20,000 people have for more than a decade openly defied state law by refusing to add fluoride to the drinking water.
For its refusal, the Ozark Mountain Regional Public Water Authority has received hundreds of state fines amounting to about $130,000, which are stuffed in a cardboard box and left unpaid, said Andy Anderson, who is opposed to fluoridation and has led the water system for nearly two decades.
This Ozark region is among hundreds of rural American communities that face a one-two punch to oral health: a dire shortage of dentists and a lack of fluoridated drinking water, which is widely viewed among dentists as one of the most effective tools to prevent tooth decay. But as the anti-fluoride movement builds unprecedented momentum, it may turn out that the Ozarks were not behind the times after all.
“We will eventually win,” Anderson said. “We will be vindicated.”
Fluoride, a naturally occurring mineral, keeps teeth strong when added to drinking water, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Dental Association. But the anti-fluoride movement has been energized since a government report last summer found a possible link between lower IQ in children and consuming amounts of fluoride that are higher than what is recommended in American drinking water. Dozens of communities have decided to stop fluoridating in recent months, and state officials in Florida and Texas have urged their water systems to do the same. Utah is poised to become the first state to ban it in tap water.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long espoused fringe health theories, has called fluoride an “industrial waste” and “dangerous neurotoxin” and said the Trump administration will recommend it be removed from all public drinking water.
Separately, Republican efforts to extend tax cuts and shrink federal spending may squeeze Medicaid, which could deepen existing shortages of dentists in rural areas where many residents depend on the federal insurance program for whatever dental care they can find.
Dental experts warn that the simultaneous erosion of Medicaid and fluoridation could exacerbate a crisis of rural oral health and reverse decades of progress against tooth decay, particularly for children and those who rarely see a dentist.
“If you have folks with little access to professional care and no access to water fluoridation,” said Steven Levy, a dentist and leading fluoride researcher at the University of Iowa, “then they are missing two of the big pillars of how to keep healthy for a lifetime.”
Many already are.
Overlapping ‘dental deserts’ and fluoride-free zones
Nearly 25 million Americans live in areas without enough dentists — more than twice as many as prior estimates by the federal government — according to a recent study from Harvard University that measured U.S. “dental deserts” with more depth and precision than before.
Hawazin Elani, a Harvard dentist and epidemiologist who co-authored the study, found that many shortage areas are rural and poor, and depend heavily on Medicaid. But many dentists do not accept Medicaid because payments can be low, Elani said.
The ADA has estimated that only a third of dentists treat patients on Medicaid.
“I suspect this situation is much worse for Medicaid beneficiaries,” Elani said. “If you have Medicaid and your nearest dentists do not accept it, then you will likely have to go to the third, or fourth, or the fifth.”
The Harvard study identified over 780 counties where more than half of the residents live in a shortage area. Of those counties, at least 230 also have mostly or completely unfluoridated public drinking water, according to a KFF analysis of fluoride data published by the CDC. That means people in these areas who can’t find a dentist also do not get protection for their teeth from their tap water.
[Editor’s note: As the map below indicates, CDC data list three North Carolina counties as locations in which most of the pubic is consuming unflouridated water: Currituck, Tyrell and Stokes. At least two other counties — Lincoln and Union, which respective dentist shortage areas of 18% and 11% — have taken action in recent months to join this list.] 



The KFF Health News analysis does not cover the entire nation because it does not include private wells and 13 states do not submit fluoride data to the CDC. But among those that do, most counties with a shortage of dentists and unfluoridated water are in the south-central U.S., in a cluster that stretches from Texas to the Florida Panhandle and up into Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma.
In the center of that cluster is the Ozark Mountain Regional Public Water Authority, which serves the Arkansas counties of Boone, Marion, Newton, and Searcy. It has refused to add fluoride ever since Arkansas enacted a statewide mandate in 2011. After weekly fines began in 2016, the water system unsuccessfully challenged the fluoride mandate in state court, then lost again on appeal.
Anderson, who has chaired the water system’s board since 2007, said he would like to challenge the fluoride mandate in court again and would argue the case himself if necessary. In a phone interview, Anderson said he believes that fluoride can hamper the brain and body to the point of making people “get fat and lazy.”
“So if you go out in the streets these days, walk down the streets, you’ll see lots of fat people wearing their pajamas out in public,” he said.

Nearby in the tiny, no-stoplight community of Leslie, Arkansas, which gets water from the Ozark system, the only dentist in town operates out of a one-man clinic tucked in the back of an antique store. Hand-painted lettering on the store window advertises a “pretty good dentist.”
James Flanagin, a third-generation dentist who opened this clinic three years ago, said he was drawn to Leslie by the quaint charms and friendly smiles of small-town life. But those same smiles also reveal the unmistakable consequences of refusing to fluoridate, he said.
“There is no doubt that there is more dental decay here than there would otherwise be,” he said. “You are going to have more decay if your water is not fluoridated. That’s just a fact.”

Fluoride seen as a great public health achievement
Fluoride was first added to public water in an American city in 1945 and spread to half of the U.S. population by 1980, according to the CDC. Because of “the dramatic decline” in cavities that followed, in 1999 the CDC dubbed fluoridation as one of 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.
Currently more than 70% of the U.S. population on public water systems get fluoridated water, with a recommended concentration of 0.7 milligrams per liter, or about three drops in a 55-gallon barrel, according to the CDC.
Fluoride is also present in modern toothpaste, mouthwash, dental varnish, and some food and drinks — like raisins, potatoes, oatmeal, coffee, and black tea. But several dental experts said these products do not reliably reach as many low-income families as drinking water, which has an additional benefit over toothpaste of strengthening children’s teeth from within as they grow.
Two recent polls have found that the largest share of Americans support fluoridation, but a sizable minority does not. Polls from Axios/Ipsos and AP-NORC found that 48% and 40% of respondents wanted to keep fluoride in public water supplies, while 29% and 26% supported its removal.
Chelsea Fosse, an expert on oral health policy at the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, said she worried that misguided fears of fluoride would cause many people to stop using fluoridated toothpaste and varnish just as Medicaid cuts made it harder to see a dentist.
The combination, she said, could be “devastating.”
“It will be visibly apparent what this does to the prevalence of tooth decay,” Fosse said. “If we get rid of water fluoridation, if we make Medicaid cuts, and if we don’t support providers in locating and serving the highest-need populations, I truly don’t know what we will do.”
Multiple peer-reviewed studies have shown what ending water fluoridation could look like. In the past few years, studies of cities in Alaska and Canada have shown that communities that stopped fluoridation saw significant increases in children’s cavities when compared with similar cities that did not. A 2024 study from Israel reported a “two-fold increase” in dental treatments for kids within five years after the country stopped fluoridating in 2014.
Despite the benefits of fluoridation, it has been fiercely opposed by some since its inception, said Catherine Hayes, a Harvard dental expert who advises the American Dental Association on fluoride and has studied its use for three decades.
Fluoridation was initially smeared as a communist plot against America, Hayes said, and then later fears arose of possible links to cancer, which were refuted through extensive scientific research. In the ’80s, hysteria fueled fears of fluoride causing AIDS, which was “ludicrous,” Hayes said.
More recently, the anti-fluoride movement seized on international research that suggests high levels of fluoride can hinder children’s brain development and has been boosted by high-profile legal and political victories.
Last August, a hotly debated report from the National Institutes of Health’s National Toxicology Program found “with moderate confidence” that exposure to levels of fluoride that are higher than what is present in American drinking water is associated with lower IQ in children. The report was based on an analysis of 74 studies conducted in other countries, most of which were considered “low quality” and involved exposure of at least 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water — or more than twice the U.S. recommendation — according to the program.
The following month, in a long-simmering lawsuit filed by fluoride opponents, a federal judge in California said the possible link between fluoride and lowered IQ was too risky to ignore, then ordered the federal Environmental Protection Agency to take nonspecified steps to lower that risk. The EPA started to appeal this ruling in the final days of the Biden administration, but the Trump administration could reverse course.
The EPA and Department of Justice declined to comment. The White House and Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to questions about fluoride.
Despite the National Toxicology Program’s report, Hayes said, no association has been shown to date between lowered IQ and the amount of fluoride actually present in most Americans’ water. The court ruling may prompt additional research conducted in the U.S., Hayes said, which she hoped would finally put the campaign against fluoride to rest.
“It’s one of the great mysteries of my career, what sustains it,” Hayes said. “What concerns me is that there’s some belief amongst some members of the public — and some of our policymakers — that there is some truth to this.”
Not all experts were so dismissive of the toxicology program’s report. Bruce Lanphear, a children’s health researcher at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, published an editorial in January that said the findings should prompt health organizations “to reassess the risks and benefits of fluoride, particularly for pregnant women and infants.”
“The people who are proposing fluoridation need to now prove it’s safe,” Lanphear told NPR in January. “That’s what this study does. It shifts the burden of proof — or it should.”

Cities and states rethink fluoride
At least 14 states so far this year have considered or are considering bills that would lift fluoride mandates or prohibit fluoride in drinking water altogether. In February, Utah lawmakers passed the nation’s first ban, which Republican Gov. Spencer Cox told ABC4 Utah he intends to sign. And both Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo and Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller have called for their respective states to end fluoridation.
“I don’t want Big Brother telling me what to do,” Miller told The Dallas Morning News in February. “Government has forced this on us for too long.”
Additionally, dozens of cities and counties have decided to stop fluoridation in the past six months — including at least 16 communities in Florida with a combined population of more than 1.6 million — according to news reports and the Fluoride Action Network, an anti-fluoride group.
Stuart Cooper, executive director of that group, said the movement’s unprecedented momentum would be further supercharged if Kennedy and the Trump administration follow through on a recommendation against fluoride.
Cooper predicted that most U.S. communities will have stopped fluoridating within years.
“I think what you are seeing in Florida, where every community is falling like dominoes, is going to now happen in the United States,” he said. “I think we’re seeing the absolute end of it.”
If Cooper’s prediction is right, Hayes said, widespread decay would be visible within years. Kids’ teeth will rot in their mouths, she said, even though “we know how to completely prevent it.”
“It’s unnecessary pain and suffering,” Hayes said. “If you go into any children’s hospital across this country, you’ll see a waiting list of kids to get into the operating room to get their teeth fixed because they have severe decay because they haven’t had access to either fluoridated water or other types of fluoride. Unfortunately, that’s just going to get worse.”
Methodology: How we counted
This KFF Health News article identifies communities with an elevated risk of tooth decay by combining data on areas with dentist shortages and unfluoridated drinking water. Our analysis merged Harvard University research on dentist-shortage areas with large datasets on public water systems published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The Harvard research determined that nearly 25 million Americans live in dentist-shortage areas that span much of rural America. The CDC data details the populations served and fluoridation status of more than 38,000 public water systems in 37 states. We classified counties as having elevated risk of tooth decay if they met three criteria:More than half of the residents live in a dentist-shortage area identified by Harvard.The number of people receiving unfluoridated water from water systems based in that county amounts to more than half of the county’s population.The number of people receiving unfluoridated water from water systems based in that county amounts to at least half of the total population of all water systems based in that county, even if those systems reached beyond the county borders, which many do.
Our analysis identified approximately 230 counties that meet these criteria, meaning they have both a dire shortage of dentists and largely unfluoridated drinking water.
But this total is certainly an undercount. Thirteen states do not report water system data to the CDC, and the agency data does not include private wells, most of which are unfluoridated.

A rural intersection safety bill also got edits.","All advertising for marijuana would be illegal in Indiana under an amendment adopted Monday. (Illustration by Leslie Bonilla/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana lawmakers could ban all marijuana advertising within state lines, under an amendment adopted Monday in a transportation-focused committee. It goes beyond the billboard-specific prohibition taken in a Senate panel last week.
Rep. Jim Pressel, R-Rolling Prairie, said his community is “inundated” with billboards advertising illegal marijuana. The district is near Michigan, which has legalized it.
But that’s not all.
“My constituents, myself included, receive up to two — what would look like political mailers — a week advertising an illegal substance” at dispensaries in nearby New Buffalo, per Pressel. He chairs the House Roads and Transportation Committee.
He commandeered Senate Bill 73, dealing with utility trailer sales, for an amendment outlawing the advertising of marijuana and other drugs on Indiana’s list of Schedule I controlled substances. Indiana’s attorney general could sue for injunctions, civil penalties of up to $15,000 and “reasonable costs” incurred throughout the investigation and lawsuit.

“I’ve heard about (how) the First Amendment, I’m trampling on it. I don’t believe that to be true,” Pressel told the committee. He cited a federal appeals court decision that, “basically, if it’s a criminal activity, you have no First Amendment right to advertise. That’s my understanding.”
The ban would take effect upon the bill’s passage. Advertising from contracts entered into or renewed before the approval date would be exempt.
The committee accepted the edits by consent.
Pressel told reporters that the panel “deal(s) with billboard issues all the time,” but acknowledged that his amendment would also affect mailers, truck adverts, television and more. It also has the potential to impact online activity.
“We’re able to geofence a lot of different things. … So is it possible to geofence that out? I believe that it is, but can’t confirm,” Pressel said. “I haven’t talked to those folks.”
Pressel authored an additional amendment inserting tweaked towing regulations into Senate Bill 73. The proposal was advanced on a 12-0 vote.
Intersection opposition appeased
When opposition to a rural intersection safety measure erupted too close to the legislative session’s first-half deadlines, its author promised he’d fix it — or kill it. Sen. Mike Crider, R-Greenfield, developed the measure after his friends’ eldest son was killed in a crash along an uncontrolled intersection overgrown with tall corn.
A thorough amendment, taken by consent Monday, appeared to ease concerns from farmers.
Rural intersections sightline proposal to rack up edits

Senate Bill 183 initially mandated large “line of sight triangles” by uncontrolled intersections to be kept clear of crops, vegetation and other obstructions above 3 feet tall. Units of government would’ve sent landowners or renters notice for noncompliance. People involved in vehicle crashes resulting from blocked sightlines would’ve been able to sue for damages.
An amendment replaced the triangle concept with a “line of sight area.” That would be, at minimum, the 20 feet of road right-of-way extending on each side from the center line. The 3-foot rule would still apply for 55 feet along each road from the center of the intersection.
If a local government decides a landowner or lessee isn’t compliant, it would have seven days to send written notice through certified mail. The person or entity responsible for the land would have seven days after receiving notice to clear the sightlines.
Otherwise, the local government could take “corrective action” — and, if warned a second time or more for the same property, charge up to $500 per subsequent clearing.
“We have worked very diligently with stakeholders on … making sure that a traveling motorist doesn’t have an obstructed view when they get to an intersection,” Pressel said. “So, lots of time, lots of hours, have gone into this amendment.”
An Indiana Farm Bureau representative said the edits had softened the group’s opposition into neutrality.

(Travis Gauthier for Louisiana Illuminator)Blame George Soros.
That was the message from Gov. Jeff Landry and the Louisiana Republican Party before and after Saturday’s election that saw voters resoundingly reject four constitutional amendments. In their eyes, the Hungarian-born billionaire who conservatives bash for all things left-leaning was also responsible for their failed referendum. 
Sure, if you want to connect the faint dots, a Soros organization did make a substantial donation in 2023 to an offshoot of one of the groups in a coalition that opposed the amendments. But there’s no way of knowing if that money from two years ago was spent on this Louisiana election.    
The results were particularly disappointing to Landry, who spent much of his time over the past month on the chamber of commerce luncheon circuit campaigning for Amendment 2. Among the many things the convoluted proposal would have done is substantially reconfigure the state’s tax and budget laws.










We realize how hard positive change can be to implement in a state that is conditioned for failure.


– Gov. Jeff Landry


Boiled down from 115 pages to fit on an election ballot, the overwhelming consensus was Amendment 2 was too much for voters to digest.
“The ballot language does not explain the extensive breadth and depth of the amendment’s impact,” the neutral Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana wrote in its breakdown for Amendment 2. Its analyses are the widely accepted gold standard for translating such ballot proposals into plain English. 
The governor, however, didn’t see it that way.   
“Unfortunately, Soros and far left liberals poured millions into Louisiana with propaganda and outright lies about Amendment 2,” Landry said in a statement Saturday night. “Although we are disappointed in tonight’s results, we do not see this as a failure. We realize how hard positive change can be to implement in a state that is conditioned for failure.”
It’s a rather odd choice of words from someone who voters overwhelmingly put into office without a runoff less than 18 months ago.  
While it’s not surprising that Landry would lean on the GOP’s tried-and-tired Soros slander, his bashing of the Louisiana electorate came off as rather judgmental. Tell us you think little of voters, governor, without saying you think little of voters.
Echoing his condescending tone ahead of the election was the state Republican Party. Rather than attempt to explain Amendment 2 to voters – admittedly, a near-impossible task – the LAGOP doubled down on scare tactics in emails sent to members Friday and Saturday.
“Did you know: George Soros is funding FAKE NEWS campaigns against Amendment 2 on the March 29 ballot?” Friday’s message read.
No one expected the governor and Republicans to acknowledge the unpopularity of the four amendments. But Saturday’s election results send the clear message that voters, regardless of party, have grown tired of such propaganda. 
Maybe it has something to do with the Republican president running roughshod over the U.S. Constitution in his first two months in office and failing to deliver on many of his hollow campaign promises. Sure, it might be a stretch to blame Trump for the four amendments failing, but he certainly didn’t help their chances.

Early voting turnout numbers show Democrats voted in greater numbers. But make no mistake, many Republicans questioned the proposed constitutional changes. They, too, complained over the lack of clarity in Amendment 2 and what they saw as power grabs in the other three proposals. And with just 21% turnout overall, a considerable majority of voters said “no” by not bothering to show up at the polls.   
There were indications ahead of Saturday’s election the four amendments were doomed to fail, but state Republican leaders were either unaware or in denial. By then, early voting turnout figures provided some writing on the wall.  
That much was revealed a week ago at the White House when Landry joined Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise to announce Hyundai’s plans to build a $5.8 billion steel mill in Ascension Parish. Before Trump appeared, a “hot” microphone captured a conversation about the upcoming election among the three Louisiana leaders.
Scalise noted that a Jefferson Parish Council race was also on Saturday’s ballot, which he suggested would help turnout there.
“You’ve gotta predict most of them will be ‘yes’ votes,” Scalise said, referencing the amendments.
“Most of them ‘yes’ votes,” Landry repeats, then responds. “You know you’re doing something right when they’re spending money against you.”
Scalise is seemingly out of touch with his home parish, as its voters fell in line with statewide trends, with two-thirds of voters dismissing all four amendments. It was one of 49 parishes where “no” swept the ballot, compared with 11 where “yes” prevailed across the board. Amendment 2 gained approval in just three other parishes.
As for the governor’s take on opposition spending, it should be noted spending in favor of Amendment 2 included $292,000 from a Landry political action committee, Make Louisiana Great Again. Campaign finance records show another $157,000 came from Americans for Prosperity, $125,000 from the Louisiana Republican Legislative Delegation and $14,000 from Louisiana House Speaker Phillip DeVillier’s Foundation PAC.
All totaled, that’s $580,000 spent in support of Amendment 2, compared with $509,000 from opponents of all four proposals – hardly the “millions” the governor claimed.
So either our governor is bad at math, or he’s chosen to spread some “fake news” of his own.
Neither is a good look for Louisiana.

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Minneapolis last week became the fourth U.S. city to ban algorithmic rental price-fixing software, joining San Francisco, Philadelphia and Berkeley, California, in a growing wave of legislation aimed to protect renters from rental price-gouging.
While momentum builds at the city level — with Portland, Oregon; Providence, Rhode Island; and San Diego exploring similar laws — statewide bans have been slower to emerge.
The legislation targets tools such as RealPage’s YieldStar, which uses landlord-shared data to recommend rent increases — a practice critics say worsens unaffordable housing. Stateline reported last year that the algorithms have drawn increasing oversight attention as the country continues to wrestle with an affordable housing crisis.
“This wave of action shows that local governments are stepping up where federal enforcement takes time,” said Ivan Luevanos-Elms, executive director of Local Progress, the national network helping coordinate these efforts.
In 2024, proposed legislation failed to prohibit the use of these algorithms stalled in  Illinois, New York and Rhode Island.
Washington state has seen the most movement, with a proposed ban passing the Senate and awaiting a House vote. Colorado’s House approved a similar bill this week, and it’s now headed to the Senate.
Elsewhere, New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul has proposed legislation to ban algorithmic rent-setting tools, while Oregon lawmakers are considering an expansion of city-level bans. Lawmakers in Arizona, California, Idaho, Illinois, Georgia, New Hampshire, Hawaii have introduced bills, but none has advanced.
The legislative surge follows lawsuits against RealPage and six major landlords, accused by the U.S. Department of Justice and 10 state attorneys general of collusion and anticompetitive practices. But with court cases expected to drag on for years, cities are opting for faster action.
Still, these bans have met resistance from real estate and landlord groups. In Oregon, landlords and property managers argue the software helps manage rentals more efficiently.
“Without these tools, we must rely on outdated methods,” said Oregon landlord Aaron Douglas in submitted testimony. “This isn’t just an inconvenience; it’s a step backward.”

“Provost Mattison has been an exceptional leader and an esteemed colleague, and I’m beyond grateful for her unwavering commitment these last 10 years,” said Drake University President Marty Martin in the release. “She has tirelessly dedicated the pinnacle of her career to fulfilling Drake’s mission, and our University is better for her doing so. I wish her all the best as she begins this new chapter of her life.”
During her time at Drake, she led efforts to expand online education and diversity, equity and inclusion programming, in addition to her oversight of academic departments, office of student life and other areas of campus, the release states.
Mattison started serving as Drake’s provost in 2016, according to the release, and has held positions at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, the University of Northern Iowa and the University of Iowa. She also attended both state universities as a student, earning her undergraduate and master’s degrees from UNI and her doctorate from the UI.
Martin said in the release her background in epidemiology, starting with her studies in Iowa, helped steer the university through the COVID-19 pandemic, which he called an “extremely challenging time.”
Mattison said it’s the people who make up the Drake community she’ll miss the most, according to the release.
“Serving as provost of Drake University has been one of the greatest privileges of my career,” Mattison said in the release. “I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to have worked alongside such remarkable and talented colleagues and students.”

Josh Gottheimer's campaign said it is not behind an ad that urges Jewish Republicans to cross party lines and vote for Gottheimer in June's gubernatorial primary. (Photo by Danielle Richards for New Jersey Monitor)A new campaign ad in support of Rep. Josh Gottheimer is urging Jewish Republicans to change parties temporarily to vote for the Democrat in his party’s six-person contest for governor, saying Gottheimer is the “least not bad guy” in the race.
The ad, which appeared in the WhatsApp chat of a Jewish news site over the weekend, tells Jewish Republicans to “be a Democrat for a day” — or a “sheep in wolf’s clothing” — to cast a ballot for Gottheimer, who is Jewish. There are more than 1,000 people in the chat.
“Register as a Democrat and vote for this guy — his name is Josh Gottheimer. Just remember his name until you walk out of the poll and forget it,” the man starring in the two-minute ad says. “Just trust me, he’s the best option that we have. He’s the least not, not, not bad guy in the race.”
It’s unclear who’s behind the ad, and there’s nothing to indicate who paid for it. Gottheimer campaign spokesman Peter Opitz said the ad is not from the congressman’s campaign.
New Jersey voters can’t cross party lines in the voting booth for primary elections. If they are registered Republicans, they can only vote for Republicans. Party members have until April 16 to change their party registration in time for the June 10 gubernatorial primary.
This isn’t the only time New Jersey Republicans have been asked to switch parties to vote for a Democrat this year. Sen. Brian Stack (D-Hudson) sent a letter to Republicans asking them to change parties to cast ballots for the two Democratic Assembly candidates he is supporting in the 33rd District — which he represents — and then change their party affiliation back to the GOP after June’s primary.

The man who appears in the ad pushing Gottheimer’s candidacy tells viewers to “face the facts” that Democrats outnumber Republicans in New Jersey and the Democratic gubernatorial candidate will probably win November’s election to succeed a term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy, himself a Democrat.
The New Jersey governor is “the guy who decides whether you have to wear a mask in the Target,” he says.
“So here is the shtick. It’s called be a Democrat for a day. Don’t freak out. Calm down, calm down,” he says. “The Hasidim have been doing this for years. Not the worst thing in the world.”

(Main photo by Clark Kauffman/Iowa Capital Dispatch. Inset photo of company policy is from U.S. District Court records)Casey’s General Store is being sued for allegedly exploiting its workers through the discriminatory practice of imposing a tobacco-use surcharge for health insurance coverage.
The surcharge, which is alleged to be $35 per pay period, amounts to an illegal “cash grab” by Casey’s that is masquerading as a wellness program, the lawsuit claims.
Filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, the lawsuit seeks class-action status but is currently filed on behalf of one Casey’s employee, Elizabeth Blalock of Carroll County, Missouri.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Attorneys for Blalock allege that all Casey’s workers are automatically assumed to use tobacco unless they submit to a process in which they provide a sworn affidavit stating they do not. Any worker who fails to complete that process by a specified deadline is then required to pay “tobacco surcharge” for the entire calendar year, even if they do not use tobacco, the lawsuit claims.
In addition, Casey’s allegedly fails to provide the federally required options that would allow employees to avoid the surcharge. “The surcharge is structured as a penalty rather than a legitimate wellness incentive,” the lawsuit claims, since the workers “who miss the enrollment deadline are penalized for the entire year without any opportunity to later demonstrate compliance or avoid the surcharge.”
The lawsuit is based on the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. ERISA allows employers to deduct from workers’ pay a tobacco-use surcharge, but only in connection with wellness programs that meet specific federal guidelines established in 2014. Those regulations state they are intended to ensure corporate wellness programs actually promote health as opposed to being a “subterfuge for discriminating based on a health factor.”
The lawsuit alleges Casey’s is illegally shifting the costs associated with less healthy workers from the company back to those same workers “who end up subsidizing their healthier colleagues.”
ERISA bars any health insurer or medical plan from discriminating against participants by charging premiums based on a “health-related factor,” including tobacco use. It does, however, allow group health plans to establish premium discounts or rebates” in return for adherence to programs that promote wellness and disease prevention.
Casey’s, the lawsuit claims, does not meet that standard.
“There is no smoking-cessation program, waiver, or alternative route for tobacco users” to avoid the surcharge, the lawsuit alleges. “The only avenue for smokers to avoid the surcharge is to quit smoking and then submit that change in status to the benefits department. Thus, tobacco users are penalized based solely on their status as smokers, which violates ERISA’s nondiscrimination provisions.”
The lawsuit goes on to allege that “allowing companies like Casey’s to exploit their participants and unlawfully extract millions from them under the guise of a wellness program that is, in reality, a cash grab, directly contradicts ERISA’s purpose of protecting workers from health-based discrimination. If unchecked, this practice would permit employers to manipulate wellness programs as revenue generating schemes rather than genuine health initiatives.”
According to the lawsuit, Blalock has forfeited to Casey’s $35 in earnings per pay period — roughly $910 per year — in order to maintain health coverage through the company.
Casey’s, which is headquartered in Ankeny, is one of the nation’s largest convenience store chains, with more than 2,600 locations in 16 states. There are more than 18,000 employees enrolled in the company’s health plan, according to court records.
In seeking class-action status for their lawsuit, the plaintiff’s attorneys argue the amount of money at issue exceeds $5 million, and the number of Casey’s workers who might potentially join the case is more than 1,000.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for unlawful imposition of a discriminatory tobacco surcharge and breach of fiduciary duty. Casey’s has yet to file a response to the lawsuit. The company did not immediately respond Monday to requests for comment.
The plaintiff is represented by attorney Adam J. Wachal of the Koley Jessen law firm in Omaha.

Marygrace [&#8230;]","A health care worker administers the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.(Photo courtesy of Executive Office of the Maryland Governor)Several physicians and experts testified against two proposals introduced before the Health and Human Services Committee on Monday that they said would undermine public health and spread misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine. 
One proposal, LD 871, would prevent the state from requiring healthcare workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19, including emergency medical services personnel. Marygrace Cimino (R-Bridgeton) introduced the bill despite the fact that in 2024 the COVID-19 vaccine was removed from the list of immunizations the state requires healthcare workers to have, based on guidance from the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, although the agency continues to recommend the vaccine.
Given the current lack of a mandate, the legislation “serves no obvious purpose,” said Dr. Sydney Sewall, a pediatrician in Waterville and representative of the Maine Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. 
“The motivating force appears to be anti-vaccine sentiment,” he said. “We find it unfortunate that vaccine policy in general and COVID vaccine in particular, has devolved into a partisan issue.”
Northe Saunders, executive director for Maine Families for Vaccines, said the bill would tie the hands of future leaders and public health experts in the case of a possible new COVID variant or another surge.
“We cannot afford to ban the use of a tool that has saved millions of lives worldwide just because we’re no longer in a crisis,” he said.
Another bill presented to the committee, LD 436, sponsored by Rep. John Eder (R-Waterboro), would prevent any state agency from providing informational or educational materials about the COVID-19 vaccine for children under 18. That restriction would ban health care provider networks and offices, the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the MaineCare program from sharing resources with families to help make decisions about vaccination for their children.
During the public hearing, Eder’s bill was similarly critiqued by public health experts for promoting anti-vaccination rhetoric, endangering public safety and undermining trust in evidence-based healthcare. 
“This bill does not address a legitimate concern,” said Jessica Shiminski, program director of the immunization program within the Maine CDC. “Instead, it increases vaccine hesitancy and misinformation, posing a significant threat to public health. The state’s efforts to increase vaccination rates are crucial in protecting the health of children in Maine, and this bill undermines those efforts.”
Eder said he introduced the bill based on questions about the efficacy of the latest COVID-19 vaccine and the diminishing seriousness of infections in recent years. He cited the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which found that only 12.8% of children and 23.1% adults got the updated 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine. Combined with the fact that children are far less likely to fall seriously ill or face severe symptoms from COVID, Eden said the Maine CDC should stop promoting the vaccine for kids.
“American adults are abstaining, but children, babies as young as six months old, rely on informed decisions made by their parents based on information they get from us,” he said. “For many parents like myself, it’s foreboding to see the vaccine recommended atop the childhood vaccine schedule.”
The COVID-19 vaccine decreases a child’s risk of hospitalization by more than 50%, according to Sewall of the American Academy of Pediatrics. While most pediatricians recommend the shot, Sewall said that when given accurate information about the low risk of serious illness in children, most parents decline. The exception is children who are immunocompromised. 
“While the public health burden from COVID has greatly decreased, it still circulates and causes disease in kids,” Sewall said. 
“Parents and clinicians should have access to the most up to date, scientifically based information making decisions regarding child health. Politics should not play a role in vaccine policy.”

Enrique Sanchez, a Providence Democrat, is shown during a vehicle stop in Cranston early Monday. (Still from Cranston police body camera courtesy of Cranston Police Department)A state lawmaker accused of driving while intoxicated in Cranston in February can keep his license, but must use a breath alcohol ignition device for six months after pleading guilty to a traffic court citation.
State Rep. Enrique Sanchez, a Providence Democrat, pleaded guilty Friday before the Rhode Island Traffic Tribunal to refusing to take a breathalyzer test in exchange for prosecutors dropping a citation for failing to obey traffic control devices. 
He had pleaded not guilty to the citations during his initial appearance Feb. 19.
Sanchez, 28, must complete 10 hours of community service, undergo alcohol treatment, and use a breathalyzer-activated ignition device for six months, according to an order from Traffic Tribunal Magistrate Mark Welch.
Welch had also ordered Sanchez’s license suspended 30 days, but the ruling was retroactive to Feb. 19 — meaning it’s since been reinstated.
Sanchez still faces a misdemeanor DUI charge in Providence County Superior Court, where a pre-trial conference is scheduled for Friday, April 4. 
The second-term lawmaker deferred inquiries Monday to his attorney, former Rhode Island House Speaker John Harwood, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi has reserved comment on Sanchez’s Traffic Tribunal plea as the criminal case continues. Sanchez was arrested by Cranston Police on Feb. 3 after an officer spotted him behind the wheel of a 2017 Nissan Altima stopped at a green light on Reservoir Avenue at 3 a.m. The arresting officer claimed Sanchez was disoriented and smelled of alcohol, which Sanchez has denied.

For many California residents, the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year were the latest and most searing example of the devastating effects of climate change. Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion.
“We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat. “It’s the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It’s not sustainable, it’s not right and it’s not ethical.”
Addis and Democratic lawmakers in nearly a dozen other states want to force the world’s largest fossil fuel companies to help pay for the recovery costs of climate-related disasters. Last year, Vermont became the first state to pass a “climate Superfund” law, followed soon after by New York.

This session, 10 states have seen similar proposals, several of which have advanced in key committees. Advocates point to legislation in Maryland that has drawn support in both chambers, as well as to strong grassroots support in California after the Los Angeles wildfires.
Lawmakers say the rapidly increasing cost of climate disasters — from wildfires to floods to sea level rise — is more than state budgets can bear.
“Climate Superfund is the ‘it girl’ policy of the [2025] session,” said Ava Gallo, climate and energy program manager with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “There’s a lot of popularity in the idea of holding polluters responsible.”
The momentum for these “polluter pays” bills is tied to the maturation of attribution science. That new field of research can help calculate fossil fuel companies’ contributions to historic emissions totals, as well as the role climate change played in causing or worsening natural disasters.
Vermont’s law was the first attempt to use that science to charge emitters for their role in causing devastating floods and other catastrophes.










We've had disaster after disaster after disaster. It's the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It's not sustainable, it's not right and it’s not ethical.


– California Democratic Assemblymember Dawn Addis


Fossil fuel companies and their allies have fought back hard. Late last year, the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging Vermont’s measure. The groups argue that emissions are governed by the federal Clean Air Act, precluding states from charging companies over global pollution.
Neither group responded to a Stateline interview request. The Independent Petroleum Association of America also declined an interview request.
A separate lawsuit, led by 22 Republican attorneys general, is challenging the New York law. And a conservative group has targeted Rachel Rothschild, an assistant professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, who helped draft the legal justification for climate Superfund policy. The group, Government Accountability and Oversight, has sought to subject Rothschild to a deposition, The New York Times reported, a move that some experts view as an intimidation tactic.
Meanwhile, oil and gas executives asked President Donald Trump during a White House meeting this month to direct the Justice Department to join the legal fight against climate Superfund laws, The Wall Street Journal reported. Industry leaders are also pushing Congress to shield them from more than 30 lawsuits brought by state and local governments that aim to make them pay for some of the results of climate change.
While experts expect a bruising legal battle over climate Superfund policies, the threat of lawsuits hasn’t deterred more lawmakers from backing the concept.
“States were a little bit wary; they wondered, ‘Is this some new radical plan?’” said Cassidy DiPaola, communications director with the Make Polluters Pay campaign, a coalition of groups backing such bills. “Then one of the littlest states passed it and this powerhouse, New York, passed it. That really set the ball rolling.”

Fossil fuel companies have cast doubt on attribution science. They also note that their production of oil and other products was done legally under U.S. and international regulations.
“Manufacturers will see this as a shakedown of any industry you don’t like at some point in the future, even though in the past they were licensed and operated under government regulation,” Brett Vassey, president and CEO of the Virginia Manufacturers Association, said during legislative testimony about a climate Superfund proposal in that state. “It will have a chilling effect on Virginia being able to grow its economy.”
Proponents of Superfund legislation point to legal settlements with large tobacco companies in the 1990s. Although those companies also sold their products legally, they were held responsible because they knew about the harmful effects of those products and deceived the public. Most climate Superfund proposals target companies for their emissions over the past 30 or so years, after leading experts had documented the dangers of greenhouse gases.
“There’s good documentation of how well the fossil fuel industry knew the probable long-term impacts of their product,” said Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat. “Should an industry that made such historic profits over a period of time and made so many representations that we had no problem not bear any of the costs?”
Golden and other lawmakers say it’s becoming impossible for taxpayers to cover the costs of recovery from wildfires and other catastrophes. In Rhode Island, sea level rise is causing massive damage for coastal communities, said Democratic state Rep. Jennifer Boylan, who has sponsored a climate Superfund bill to help the state adapt.
Some advocates also note that Trump’s return to the White House has cut off the possibility of federal climate relief.
“All the states are affected by the disappearance of this federal funding,” said Gallo, of the state lawmakers group. “States everywhere are going to be looking at some way to fill the gap.”
This session, climate Superfund bills have been introduced in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Virginia.

While the bills are structured differently, they all seek to target the largest polluters — often covering companies that produced 1 billion metric tons of emissions over the last 30 or so years. Lawmakers say that applies to roughly 100 companies.
The measures also take different approaches to assigning damages. Some direct state agencies to conduct complex studies to determine the costs of climate-caused disasters over a certain period, the approach pioneered by Vermont. Others set a fixed number that represents a conservative baseline for those damages. New York’s law set that figure at $75 billion over a 25-year period.
Many of the bills also require that significant amounts of the funding be directed to the communities hit hardest by pollution.
Advocates are particularly optimistic about the measures in California and Maryland.
Lawmakers in Maryland modified their bills to commission a study about the financial impacts of climate change. Those measures passed both the House and Senate, and legislators are working to reconcile the versions from each chamber. Figures produced by the study would be the backbone of a climate Superfund policy in a future session.
“From a legislative perspective, it’s a shot in the dark as to what the costs are,” said Democratic Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo, who sponsored one of the bills. “This will give us the factual data needed to make a more well-educated decision on policy.”
In New Jersey, an Assembly committee advanced a climate Superfund bill this month. State Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee and who sponsored the bill, said it will help to rebuild and fortify water treatment plants, schools and firehouses. He noted that Trump has called for the dismantling of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“The end of the world is coming; it’s kind of hard to ignore,” Smith said. “FEMA has been the backstop to help communities recover from disasters. If the handwriting isn’t on the wall to all the states that they’ve got to deal with this, shame on them.”
Lawmakers in many states have heard from mayors and other local government leaders that more climate recovery funding is essential.
“Municipal officials are getting behind [climate Superfund policies],” said Massachusetts state Sen. Jamie Eldridge, a Democrat who has sponsored similar legislation. “They’re facing the costs of flooding, of droughts, of heat waves, and really asking for relief.”

Lyndsay Quist will lead INDOT as the second commissioner under Braun after Kent Abernathy, who held the role from Jan. 13 to March 28.
The State Personnel Department provided no reason for his resignation.
Quist will oversee the planning, building and maintenance of the state’s transportation infrastructure with a focus on quality of life enhancements, economic growth and accommodating new modes of transport, according to a release.
“As the crossroads of America, our roads and transportation are critical for driving economic growth in our state,” Braun said. “Lyndsay Quist’s experience of over a decade with INDOT as well as her experience as an engineer with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has prepared her well to step into this role and serve Hoosiers.”
Quist has served in multiple roles with INDOT since 2013. Before joining the agency, she worked with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at the New Orleans District in Louisiana.
Warren Lenard was tapped to lead IOT. He will oversee information and technology efforts across Indiana state government.
“IOT works behind the scenes to keep state government afloat and operational. I am excited to announce that Warren Lenard will sere as the next Director of the Indiana Office of Technology,” Braun said. “His private sector experience brings the type of entrepreneurial mindset that our state government so desperately needs.”

The care at Community PACE is paid for by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities, and Medicare, the federal insurance program for people 65 and older. The center is a one-stop shop that provides medical and social services to older adults during the day, allowing them to continue living safely in their homes.
If Congress cuts funding to Medicaid, Levin expects his center would probably close. Unlike traditional nursing home care, which state Medicaid programs are required by federal law to cover, the services at PACE centers like his are an optional benefit that 33 states have opted to cover.
Around the nation, doctors, lawmakers, advocates and patients are watching anxiously as Republicans in Congress consider proposals to slash billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in proposed tax cuts. The specific nature of the funding cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states.










If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved.


– Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy, Justice in Aging


The additional financial burden could blow billion-dollar holes in state budgets, forcing state lawmakers to slash health benefits or restrict who’s eligible for them. Nearly a fifth of Americans rely on Medicaid, and the percentage is even higher in some states.
“There are a lot of people who don’t pay attention to this because they think it doesn’t affect them personally,” Levin said. “But 1 in 4 people in Michigan are on Medicaid. It’s very likely you have friends or family on Medicaid.”
Nearly all Americans over age 65 are covered by Medicare, which Republicans have pledged not to touch. Medicare doesn’t cover most nursing home or other long-term care, however. Neither does most private insurance.
But Medicaid does.
“If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved,” said Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy for Justice in Aging, an advocacy group focused on addressing poverty among older people.
“Many of us have a connection to the program or will one day,” she said.
A divided front
Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But policy experts say that reducing coverage for some Medicaid recipients, such as the working adults who got coverage under expansion programs, will have ripple effects on vulnerable groups such as children and older adults.
Republicans aren’t united in a desire to see massive cuts.
Last month, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican governor in a purple state, publicly called on Congress not to slash Medicaid funding.

Earlier this week, Washington Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier wrote a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider cuts to Medicaid and expressing her concern about the large number of military retirees and senior citizens in her district.
Caldier, a dentist who has worked with nursing home patients, told Stateline she believes the most likely cuts would be a reduction in the amount the federal government matches state spending for working adults who are covered under Medicaid expansion. That, she said, would have little impact on older adults.
“The only caveat is that I am very worried that the leadership in our state does not have a good relationship with our president,” Caldier said. Democrats control the offices of governor and both legislative chambers in Washington state. Caldier worries that if Washington lawmakers defy the president over issues such as gender-affirming care for transgender youth, the feds could retaliate by slashing their Medicaid payments to the state.
“If we got into a political match with the president, we would lose, no matter how you slice or dice it,” she said.
In Idaho, Republican state lawmakers shot down a bill that likely would have repealed Medicaid expansion, before passing one that will introduce sweeping policy changes in an effort to control costs.
Even in Congress, some Republicans are balking, publicly defending Medicaid and warning about the consequences of deep cuts. Some who have high percentages of Medicaid recipients in their districts have urged party leaders not to cut funding for the program and have vowed to vote against any budget plan that does so.
Medicaid covers 72 million Americans. A majority of American adults, including two-thirds of Republicans, say they want Congress to either maintain current Medicaid spending or increase it, according to a February 2025 poll from KFF, a health policy research group.
President Donald Trump has said in recent months that he won’t touch Medicaid. But last month, U.S. House Republicans pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that calls for about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help counterbalance the Trump administration’s desired $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.
Facing cuts that large, states would have to figure out which benefits to chop in order to keep their budgets balanced, which is a constitutional requirement in most states.
Older adults and people with disabilities already account for more than half of states’ Medicaid spending, on average. In some states, including Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi and North Dakota, those groups account for two-thirds of state Medicaid spending.
Idaho state Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Democrat on the state Senate Health & Welfare committee, said her biggest concern is Congress reducing the federal match rate. This is the amount of money the federal government chips in to help states pay for Medicaid. How much a state receives mainly depends on how wealthy its residents are. Richer states such as California and Connecticut get less help, while poorer states get more.
In Idaho, on the poorer end of the spectrum, the feds pay about 67% of traditional Medicaid costs and 90% of Medicaid expansion costs.
“It is all a domino effect,” Wintrow said. The federal government covers about $3 billion of Idaho’s $4.2 billion Medicaid budget. “If the feds start chopping that off, it’s going to impact everything.”
Cutting care at home
All state Medicaid programs have opted to cover at least some home-based and community care, such as home health aides who assist people with bathing, toileting and other daily living activities, transportation and adult day care.
Kean and other experts worry that because federal law doesn’t require state Medicaid programs to cover home-based care, state lawmakers might sharply reduce spending on those services — or even eliminate coverage.
 

“When states have budget shortfalls, they start to tighten eligibility for the home-based programs,” said Kean. “We’re certain those would be the first to go if federal funding is cut for Medicaid.”
Paying for home-based services out of pocket would exhaust the median Medicare recipient’s savings in less than two years, according to KFF.
The median cost of a year of a full-time aide to help is about $62,400, far above the median income for Americans over 65, which is about $36,000. The median life savings for Medicare beneficiaries was $103,800 in 2023.
Home-based services are a popular benefit for state Medicaid programs, because most enrollees prefer to remain in their homes. And despite the expense, home care can be more cost effective than nursing homes — about $38,000 vs. nearly $54,000 per year in 2021, according to a KFF analysis.
Cutting Medicaid also could make it harder to recruit and keep a workforce of nursing home and home health employees.
Over the past two years, most states — even those led by Republicans — increased their Medicaid payment rates for those services, in an effort to combat the nationwide shortage of long-term care workers.
But federal funding cuts could jeopardize what states are able to pay those workers.
“There’s already a direct-care workforce crisis,” Kean said. “Even if eligibility isn’t directly cut or programs aren’t cut, there wouldn’t be enough workers to provide that care. At home and in nursing facilities, the quality of care will go down.”
In rural Michigan, Levin said the PACE center where he works employs about 100 people. Its closure would impact not only those workers, but also would mean his patients would be left to find transportation and other health services on their own, even if those services are still covered by Medicaid.
“Without access in rural areas, how are these individuals going to get to the bigger cities where they can get to their health care? It’s going to overwhelm other parts of the health care system,” Levin said.
“Everybody’s going to be responsible for taking care of the people who don’t have health insurance, in some indirect way or another. It’s going to affect us all.”

(Photo by Mark Susko/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)Firefighters have begun to contain wildfires in the Upstate, with the help of some weekend rain.
Together, the two fires burning in Greenville and Pickens counties grew to more than 13,500 acres over the weekend. By Saturday, the Table Rock wildfire in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains had become the largest, single mountain fire in state history.
Neither grew significantly between Sunday and Monday, with help from rain and increasing containment, according to a Monday update from the state Forestry Commission.
As of Monday morning, the Table Rock fire was 30% contained, and the Persimmon Ridge fire was 64% contained, according to the commission. That was a big improvement from Friday, a week after the first fire started, when both were at 0% containment.
“Yesterday’s rainfall, coupled with the strong firefighting efforts over the past several days, have allowed us to make great progress on the fires,” Mike Brod, who oversees a team of firefighters, said in a Monday morning update.
No homes had been damaged, and no injuries or deaths had been reported as of Monday, according to the commission.
People in Pickens County were allowed to return home Saturday evening as evacuations shifted from mandatory to voluntary. Greenville County residents nearest the blaze on Persimmon Ridge remained under mandatory evacuation orders.

The larger Table Rock fire, which was burning at more than 12,500 acres Monday, jumped the North Carolina border Sunday, igniting more than 500 acres over the state line in Transylvania County.
Officials planned to focus Monday on the northern and eastern edges of the Table Rock fire where the fire was smoldering. The half-inch or so of rain that fell Sunday will allow firefighters to work much closer to the flames, preventing them from spreading, Brod said.
The eastern edge of the Persimmon Ridge Fire was also a concern, since the flames had reached debris leftover from Hurricane Helene. Crews planned to break up the piles of debris to reduce fuel for the fire, Brod said.
More rain is expected Monday, with the National Weather Service predicting thunderstorms throughout the day Monday and again Wednesday.
Following the weekend rain showers, officials lifted a statewide burn ban for all but five counties.
Residents in Greenville, Horry, Oconee, Pickens and Spartanburg counties still may not set fires outdoors because resources are already stretched thin fighting fires in those areas, according to a news release.
Both fires were set by people. Four teenage hikers have been questioned by police about the Table Rock fire, and “charges are pending,” according to the latest update from the Pickens County Sheriff’s Office.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Table-Rock-Z8-3-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-31 12:23:25.903136

Perez announced [&#8230;]","Screenshot via the Florida Channel of Gov. Ron DeSantis in Orlando on March 31, 2025. Insisting more Floridians are clamoring for cuts to their property taxes than sales taxes, Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday attempted to hijack the proposal just announced by House Speaker Danny Perez to save Floridians nearly $5 billion in sales taxes and said that instead the Legislature should direct that cut towards property taxes.
Perez announced last week that he wanted to cut the sales tax for all Floridians this year from 6% to 5.25% — which, if passed, would save them nearly $5 billion. DeSantis dismissed the idea on Monday, though, saying that while well intentioned it would do nothing for Floridians hungering for property tax relief.
A sales tax cut isn’t the first place to go when it looks to providing relief for Floridians, he said.
“I want Canadian tourists and Brazilian tourists subsidizing the state, making it so Florida residents pay less less taxes,” DeSantis said at the Florida Realtors office in Orlando. “I don’t want to give Canadians a tax cut.”
He later doubled down, emphasizing that a sales tax wouldn’t be well directed.
“It also allows relief for foreigners. It allows for relief for visitors and part-time residents,” he said. “I think that tax relief needs to be focused on Floridians. We need a Florida First tax package.”
DeSantis has been speaking for more than a month about providing property tax relief, potentially by placing a constitutional amendment on the ballot next year to eliminate the ability of local governments to collect property taxes.
He took the House’s proposal as evidence that chamber is up for providing billions in tax cuts, and “if that’s something that they’re willing to discuss, we’ll accept that, but we’ll come with a proposal to focus that $5 billion on reducing property taxes for people in Florida.”
He added that if the Legislature agrees to that idea, it would be the “opening salvo” in providing major property tax relief for Florida homeowners, because he still hopes the Legislature will vote to place a constitutional ballot on the 2026 ballot removing local property taxes.
State pays the difference?
Such a proposal could result in approximately $1,000 in property tax cuts for every homesteaded Floridian, the governor said. Although most property taxes go to local governments, the state could cut what is known as the Required Local Effort, which pays for schools, he continued. He suggested the state could make up that difference through its budget reserves.
“We don’t need people to pay property taxes on that specific line-item,” he said. “So we would roll that back to zero. We’d also roll back some of the local lines and issue a rebate and that’s how you end up getting to the $1,000 per resident or homesteaded property.”
The Phoenix reached out to Perez’ office for comment but did not receive an immediate response.
Senate President Ben Albritton said last week that he was “open-minded” about Perez’s proposal to cut the sales tax.
“Everybody knows right now we have an affordability challenge with many families in Florida,” he said during a press conference on Thursday. “We’re reviewing what the proposal looks like and we’ll see where it goes, but, to be clear, we are supportive of lower taxes in Florida.”
Florida ranks near the middle of the states for per capita property tax revenue, according to the Florida Policy Institute. That’s not good enough, DeSantis says.
“You gotta do property relief,” he repeated towards the end of Monday’s news conference. “If you want to do sales on top of that, I’m all for that, for sure, but this property stuff needs to be addressed.”

The devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene in western North Carolina six months ago was, in many communities, enormous. Few aspects of normal life escaped being upended, and one very important such area was child care.
As journalist Sara Murphy detailed in a recent report published by NC Newsline and the national news site, the Hechinger Report, six months after the storm, many young children and their families are still struggling with the disaster’s consequences. At least 55 early child care centers were damaged in the storm, and several remain shut or are operating out of a temporary location. And the ramifications for kids, parents and the region’s economy continue to take a toll.

The Wichita Republican hopes lawmakers can wrap up the session after returning to Topeka on April 10. That would be before the mid-April release of new state government revenue estimates typically relied on to fine-tune the budget. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly marked close of the Kansas Legislature’s regular session by signing a bipartisan bill forbidding applicants for about 85% of state government jobs from being rejected solely due to lack of a college degree.
Kelly, the second-term Democratic governor, said she previously implemented that standard in executive branch agencies under her jurisdiction. The House and Senate approved Senate Bill 166 to formally emphasize a person’s prior experience or specialized training when determining work readiness for state government jobs.
“I am pleased to sign this bill to codify this practice,” she said. “There are a multitude of factors that go into employment consideration, and a postsecondary degree should not always be the deciding factor.”
No more than 15% of state employees worked in positions for which a college degree was necessary. These jobs would be exempted from the new state law.

“Countless Kansans chose to build their careers rather than take on debt for a degree, and it’s time we recognize and reward their skills,” said Rep. Sean Tarwater, a Stilwell Republican convinced he learned more on the job than in college earning a master’s degree.


The governor signed a cluster of noncontroversial bills last week as the 2025 Legislature brought the regular session to a close Thursday with a flurry of partisan activity. These pieces of new state law require higher educational institutions to update accreditation policies regularly, allowed dependents of military personnel stationed in Kansas to enroll in school early, voided a discriminatory residential covenant inhibiting a Wichita State University project and expanded college financial aid to Kansas National Guard members and their families.
Kelly will have an opportunity to sign or veto additional bills piled on her desk before the Legislature’s scheduled return April 10. House and Senate leadership want to quickly conclude their business for 2025. The goal of GOP leaders has been to tie the hands of Kelly in terms of budget and tax policy, while avoiding a repeat of the 2024 special session devoted to passage of a monumental state income tax cut.

Matter of perspective

House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican, praised the House for its dedication since the annual session began in January. He deflected questions about whether he would run for state insurance commissioner in 2026, but touted work of the 125-member House under his control.
“We have done a great job this year,” said Hawkins, referring to the first session since legislators salaries nearly doubled their salaries. “Do you realize that not once did we go past midnight. ”
Lenexa Sen. Dinah Sykes, who leads Senate Democrats, said the session was artificially shortened by GOP leadership to get the House and Senate out of Topeka before issuance of new state revenue estimates in mid-April. Normally, the Legislature would rely on that revised financial report to set final spending and tax policies before adjourning. This year, she said, Republicans insisted on flying blind and risked unnecessarily cratering the state budget.

“Republican legislative leaders condensed the schedule this year to complete work before we fully understand how the tax cuts we passed affect our budget,” Sykes said. “It’s irresponsible to make critical decisions without knowing the full consequences. In the future, we need to slow down and work together on bipartisan solutions that address real challenges in our state and benefit all Kansas families.”
In 2024, the consensus revenue group met April 17 to revise estimates made in November 2023 based on the additional six months of actual data.
Senate Majority Leader Chase Blasi, a Wichita Republican, pushed back.
“We have done a tremendous amount of work, and I believe a lot of good for the people of Kansas,” he said.
 
Veto pen at ready

The bipartisan harmony that greeted Kelly’s signing of a cluster of bills Friday clashed with the governor’s work on a pair of bills this session on election and health are reform. In both instances, the Republican-dominated House and Senate responded to Kelly’s vetoes with two-thirds majority votes to override her.
The House and Senate agreed to punt Kelly’s veto of Senate Bill 4, which ended the three-day grace period for advance mail ballots arriving late at county election offices. Kelly said the bill would disenfranchise voters. State lawmakers also derailed her veto of Senate Bill 63, which prohibited health care providers from delivering gender-affirming medical care to minors. The governor said the law ignored a Kansas value of respecting parental rights.
“As I’ve said before, it is not the job of politicians to stand between a parent and a child who needs medical care of any kind,” Kelly said.


Kelly will have additional opportunities to veto bills that range from much-debated legislation on taxes, education, elections and child support for fetuses to lower-key bills on firework sales, sex education, government secrecy, horse racing and employee background checks.
While issuance of specialty state license plates for nonprofit organizations rarely produced controversy, Senate Bill 18 would authorize a plate for Hunter Nation Inc. The organization says it was dedicated to the political or legal fight to build “a grassroots army to promote and protect the traditional American values of God, family, country and the hunting way of life.” Hunter Nation has a litigation fund to pursue its agenda, including a plan to end federal listing of the gray wolf as threatened or endangered in 48 states.
“It’s a very bad policy to use license plates to espouse political or religious causes,” said Rep. John Carmichael, D-Wichita.

 
The budget debate

In terms of the state government’s budget woven into Senate Bill 125, Kansas governors have the option of rejecting the entire package or making line-item vetoes of specific spending provisions. Kelly has used this power in the past to jettison earmarks inserted into the budget at the behest of special interests.
In the new state budget, Sen. Pat Pettey, D-Kansas City, said she was concerned millions of dollars was earmarked to purchase a firearm-detection software system that would rely on school cameras to remotely identify people with guns. At the same time, she said, the budget didn’t appropriate enough for K-12 special education programs.
Sen. Renee Erickson, R-Wichita, said the Legislature was once again spending far too much. It was wrong to have allowed state general fund spending to climb from $7 billion in 2019 to $10.8 billion in 2025, she said. She said many of her constituents weren’t beneficiaries of that largesse.
“It’s too bad those average families don’t have a lobbyist,” she said.
Sen. Rick Billinger, the Goodland Republican who chairs the Senate budget committee, said the perspective of legislators inevitably ranged from those who argued state spending was outrageous or measly.
“Everybody has their outlook and they’ve got things that they want or things that they don’t want. That’s how the process works,” he said.
 

Constitutional questions
The House and Senate, with two-thirds majorities, agreed to place an amendment to the Kansas Constitution on statewide ballots in August 2026 that would undermine authority of Kansas governors to appoint members of the Kansas Supreme Court. The current merit-based approach enabled a commission led by attorneys to nominate finalists for Supreme Court vacancies to the governor, who could pick one or reject them all.
Kansas justices stand for retention elections on statewide ballots. However, the GOP-led Legislature has decided Supreme Court justices should serve six-year terms and stand for reelection just like local, state or federal government politicians. Kelly expressed reservations about the proposed change, but constitutional amendments go directly to the ballot. Governors cannot veto proposed constitutional amendments.
“Kansans can reclaim power from the elites who have controlled the Kansas Supreme Court for nearly 70 years,” said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Republican who has challenged Supreme Court decisions on abortion rights and school finance. “Should lawyers chosen by other lawyers decide who sits on our highest court?”
Senate Concurrent Resolution 1611 cleared the House 84-40 and was carried in the Senate by a vote of 27-13.
“This is a blatant attack by the legislators on our justices, and it’s part of a decades-long pattern of politicians attempting to punish the judicial branch for issuing decisions on education and reproductive freedom that they disagree with,” said Micah Kubic, executive director of ACLU of Kansas. “We are confident that, just as they did in 2022, the people of Kansas will see this attack for what it is and, once again, take action to defend their constitutional rights from the power grabs of extremist politicians in Topeka.”
During the 2025 session, a slew of proposed constitutional amendments fell short in the Senate and House. The roster included amendments to block public tax dollars from being spent on nonpublic K-12 schools, to allow individuals to vote at age 16, to include ammunition and firearm accessories in the 2nd Amendment right to bear arms, to affirm existing law requiring voters to be U.S. citizens and to allow prosecution of businesses who hire immigrants not in the country legally.
The Senate and House split on House Concurrent Resolution 5011, which would have limited growth of valuations on residential property to no more than 4% annually. The Senate passed the measure 27-13 after the proposed ceiling was raised from 3% and implementation delayed until 2027, but it was defeated in the House on a vote of 37-88.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P3190541-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-03-31 12:23:25.903136

(Photo by Aristide Economopoulos/New Jersey Monitor)COLUMBIA— Legislation advancing in the state House would ban credit card companies from tracking sales of guns or ammunition and ensure no government agency in South Carolina keeps a registry of gun owners.
Similar legislation has already been signed into law in other Republican-led states.
The bill, dubbed the “Second Amendment Financial Privacy Act,” is set for discussion Tuesday by the House Judiciary Committee. It would leave enforcement to the state attorney general. Any government or company that ignores a warning to cease and desist would face a fine of up to $1,000 per violation.
“We wanted to prevent anything that would infringe on gun owners’ rights,” the bill’s lead sponsor, Rep. Bobby Cox, R-Greer, told the SC Daily Gazette after a House panel unanimously advanced the bill.
The bill has the backing of the chamber’s GOP leaders. The 34 co-sponsors include House Speaker Murrell Smith and House Majority Leader Davey Hiott.
The proposal does not apply to gun ownership records kept during the “regular course of a criminal investigation and prosecution.”
Legislation similar to the South Carolina proposal started popping up around the country after the International Organization for Standardization, a Switzerland-based group that creates international business standards, approved in September 2022 the creation of unique codes — called merchant category codes — for stores that sell guns and ammunition.
Businesses are coded for all sales made with a credit or debit card, whether at a restaurant, a clothing store or the grocery. In addition to banks using the codes to track rewards programs, the coding helps with business accounting systems and tax records.
Advocates that pushed for a separate code for gun stores, led by New York-based Amalgamated Bank, argued it was a safety measure that could reduce mass killings.
The killers in mass shootings such as the July 2012 Aurora, Colorado, movie theater; the June 2016 Orlando nightclub; and the 2017 Las Vegas music festival all bought thousands of dollars’ worth of guns ahead of the massacres, according to a report by The New York Times.
Critics of the coding say law-abiding gun owners could be unfairly profiled and tracked as a result.
South Carolina’s Alan Wilson was among 24 attorneys general nationwide who signed a letter to the heads of American Express, Mastercard and Visa less than two weeks after the international group approved codes for gun stores.
“Generating a ‘list of gun buyers’ creates the obvious risk that law-abiding consumers’ information will be leaked, discovered, hacked, or otherwise obtained and misused by those who oppose Americans exercising their Second Amendment rights,” read the letter dated Sept. 20, 2022.
Nineteen states have passed laws similar to South Carolina’s bill, according to the National Rifle Association. They include Georgia, Louisiana and Alabama. Legislators in North Carolina are considering a similar law.
The laws were initially preventive measures that didn’t do anything, since banks hadn’t adopted the coding.
But then California passed a law in September 2023 requiring banks and credit card companies to use the codes, followed by Colorado and New York. The codes must be assigned to gun stores in those states by May 1.
A bill that would ban the tracking nationwide was introduced last month in the U.S. House. Its 95 co-sponsors include Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina’s Second District.
“It’s a real issue that is out there,” Neil Rashley, chief attorney for the South Carolina Bankers Association, said last week. “But it’s kind of in flux.
With some states requiring the codes and others banning their use, Rashley said companies with national operations will likely have to hire extra staff to ensure they’re following the rules for each state.
The bankers’ association is not taking a position on the bill. Rashley said he’s confident banks in South Carolina are not using the gun shop codes, nor do they have any plans to do so.

(Rick Kern/Getty Images for National Council on Aging)Dr. Fred Levin has been watching with growing alarm the national debate around federal cuts to Medicaid. He’s responsible for the medical care of about 100 older adults at the Community PACE center in rural Newaygo, Michigan. For his patients, Medicaid isn’t just a safety net — it’s a matter of life or death.
“If left to see to their own needs, a lot of them would stay in their homes and would slowly die,” he said. “They wouldn’t be able to get to their doctors’ appointments unless they had a family member to help. They wouldn’t get social care. They wouldn’t have people coming into their homes and seeing the bed bugs or the lice in their hair. They wouldn’t get their medications.”
The care at Community PACE is paid for by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities, and Medicare, the federal insurance program for people 65 and older. The center is a one-stop shop that provides medical and social services to older adults during the day, allowing them to continue living safely in their homes.
If Congress cuts funding to Medicaid, Levin expects his center would probably close. Unlike traditional nursing home care, which state Medicaid programs are required by federal law to cover, the services at PACE centers like his are an optional benefit that 33 states have opted to cover.
Around the nation, doctors, lawmakers, advocates and patients are watching anxiously as Republicans in Congress consider proposals to slash billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in proposed tax cuts. The specific nature of the funding cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states.










If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved. 


– Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy, Justice in Aging


The additional financial burden could blow billion-dollar holes in state budgets, forcing state lawmakers to slash health benefits or restrict who’s eligible for them. Nearly a fifth of Americans rely on Medicaid, and the percentage is even higher in some states.
“There are a lot of people who don’t pay attention to this because they think it doesn’t affect them personally,” Levin said. “But 1 in 4 people in Michigan are on Medicaid. It’s very likely you have friends or family on Medicaid.”
Nearly all Americans over age 65 are covered by Medicare, which Republicans have pledged not to touch. Medicare doesn’t cover most nursing home or other long-term care, however. Neither does most private insurance.
But Medicaid does.
“If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved,” said Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy for Justice in Aging, an advocacy group focused on addressing poverty among older people.
“Many of us have a connection to the program or will one day,” she said.
 A divided front

Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But policy experts say that reducing coverage for some Medicaid recipients, such as the working adults who got coverage under expansion programs, will have ripple effects on vulnerable groups such as children and older adults.
Republicans aren’t united in a desire to see massive cuts.
Last month, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican governor in a purple state, publicly called on Congress not to slash Medicaid funding.
Earlier this week, Washington Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier wrote a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider cuts to Medicaid and expressing her concern about the large number of military retirees and senior citizens in her district.
Caldier, a dentist who has worked with nursing home patients, told Stateline she believes the most likely cuts would be a reduction in the amount the federal government matches state spending for working adults who are covered under Medicaid expansion. That, she said, would have little impact on older adults.
“The only caveat is that I am very worried that the leadership in our state does not have a good relationship with our president,” Caldier said. Democrats control the offices of governor and both legislative chambers in Washington state. Caldier worries that if Washington lawmakers defy the president over issues such as gender-affirming care for transgender youth, the feds could retaliate by slashing their Medicaid payments to the state.
“If we got into a political match with the president, we would lose, no matter how you slice or dice it,” she said.
In Idaho, Republican state lawmakers shot down a bill that likely would have repealed Medicaid expansion, before passing one that will introduce sweeping policy changes in an effort to control costs.
Even in Congress, some Republicans are balking, publicly defending Medicaid and warning about the consequences of deep cuts. Some who have high percentages of Medicaid recipients in their districts have urged party leaders not to cut funding for the program and have vowed to vote against any budget plan that does so.
Medicaid covers 72 million Americans. A majority of American adults, including two-thirds of Republicans, say they want Congress to either maintain current Medicaid spending or increase it, according to a February 2025 poll from KFF, a health policy research group.
President Donald Trump has said in recent months that he won’t touch Medicaid. But last month, U.S. House Republicans pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that calls for about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help counterbalance the Trump administration’s desired $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.
Facing cuts that large, states would have to figure out which benefits to chop in order to keep their budgets balanced, which is a constitutional requirement in most states.
Older adults and people with disabilities already account for more than half of states’ Medicaid spending, on average. In some states, including Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi and North Dakota, those groups account for two-thirds of state Medicaid spending.
Idaho state Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Democrat on the state Senate Health & Welfare committee, said her biggest concern is Congress reducing the federal match rate. This is the amount of money the federal government chips in to help states pay for Medicaid. How much a state receives mainly depends on how wealthy its residents are. Richer states such as California and Connecticut get less help, while poorer states get more.
In Idaho, on the poorer end of the spectrum, the feds pay about 67% of traditional Medicaid costs and 90% of Medicaid expansion costs.
“It is all a domino effect,” Wintrow said. The federal government covers about $3 billion of Idaho’s $4.2 billion Medicaid budget. “If the feds start chopping that off, it’s going to impact everything.”
Cutting care at home
All state Medicaid programs have opted to cover at least some home-based and community care, such as home health aides who assist people with bathing, toileting and other daily living activities, transportation and adult day care.
Kean and other experts worry that because federal law doesn’t require state Medicaid programs to cover home-based care, state lawmakers might sharply reduce spending on those services — or even eliminate coverage.
“When states have budget shortfalls, they start to tighten eligibility for the home-based programs,” said Kean. “We’re certain those would be the first to go if federal funding is cut for Medicaid.”
Paying for home-based services out of pocket would exhaust the median Medicare recipient’s savings in less than two years, according to KFF.
The median cost of a year of full-time aide to help is about $62,400, far above the median income for Americans over 65, which is about $36,000. The median life savings for Medicare beneficiaries was $103,800 in 2023.
Home-based services are a popular benefit for state Medicaid programs, because most enrollees prefer to remain in their homes. And despite the expense, home care can be more cost effective than nursing homes — about $38,000 vs. nearly $54,000 per year in 2021, according to a KFF analysis.
Cutting Medicaid also could make it harder to recruit and keep a workforce of nursing home and home health employees.
Over the past two years, most states — even those led by Republicans — increased their Medicaid payment rates for those services, in an effort to combat the nationwide shortage of long-term care workers.
But federal funding cuts could jeopardize what states are able to pay those workers.
“There’s already a direct-care workforce crisis,” Kean said. “Even if eligibility isn’t directly cut or programs aren’t cut, there wouldn’t be enough workers to provide that care. At home and in nursing facilities, the quality of care will go down.”
In rural Michigan, Levin said the PACE center where he works employs about 100 people. Its closure would impact not only those workers, but also would mean his patients would be left to find transportation and other health services on their own, even if those services are still covered by Medicaid.
“Without access in rural areas, how are these individuals going to get to the bigger cities where they can get to their health care? It’s going to overwhelm other parts of the health care system,” Levin said.
“Everybody’s going to be responsible for taking care of the people who don’t have health insurance, in some indirect way or another. It’s going to affect us all.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Despite his 2022 campaign promise to move into the congressional district he was elected to represent, U.S. Rep. Seth Magaziner hasn’t moved — and now, he doesn’t plan to.
The 41-year-old Democrat first revealed his change of heart during a taping of WPRI-TV 12’s Newsmakers on Friday, citing family’s circumstances for why he has backed off his campaign pledge.
“We’ve decided that at this point, it makes sense for us to stay in our house in Providence,” Magaziner said. He referenced his family’s new baby, born in April 2024, and his wife’s new job that requires a two-hour commute from Providence to Cambridge, Massachusetts. Moving to Cranston would likely extend that travel time.

The U.S. Constitution requires members of Congress to live in the states they represent, but not the district. Yet Magaziner pledged during his first run for congressional office in 2022 — filling the seat vacated by former Rep. Jim Langevin — that he would move into the 2nd Congressional District, which covers the state’s southern and western areas. 
At the time of the 2022 election, Magaziner and his family lived on the East Side of Providence, which falls within the 1st Congressional District. The capital city is the only state municipality bifurcated by the congressional district line. Indeed, Magaziner’s Providence home falls one mile away from the district line.
In 2023, Magaziner and his wife bought a house in the Edgewood section of Cranston. However, during his 2024 reelection campaign, Magaziner was still living and voting in Providence, outside his district, WPRI reported at the time. Magaziner told WPRI that renovations to his Cranston house were more extensive than expected, which is why he had not moved.
Now, the move is off, though the Cranston home is still listed under his wife, Julia McDowell’s name, according to city records. 
Magaziner’s office did not immediately return requests for comment Monday, including whether they plan to sell the Cranston house. However, he defended his decision on Newsmakers, insisting that where he lives has not hurt his ability to do his job or represent the 559,000 district residents.
“I continue to fight for the working people of the 2nd Congressional District with legislation in Washington, and I’ll continue to show up and deliver, just as I have for the last two and a half years,” Magaziner said during the taping.
John Marion, executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island, chalked up the scrutiny surrounding residency requirements in Rhode Island as “more symbolic than practical.”
“We’re so geographically compact in Rhode Island,” Marion said in an interview Monday. “If this were someone in Colorado who lived in another corner of the state, it might be a problem.”
Yet, Marion acknowledged the poor optics of Magaziner not fulfilling his pledge to move. 
Rhode Island GOP Chair Joe Powers seized on the “empty promise” in a statement Friday.
“Magaziner’s decision is yet another example of how little respect career politicians have for the people of this state,” Powers said. “He told voters he was moving into the district. He made that promise. Now he’s casually breaking it with a shrug and a smile, hoping no one notices or cares.”
Powers described the situation as a pattern among Rhode Island Democrats who “say one thing to get elected, then quietly do the opposite.”
A Washington Post analysis in 2017 found 21 U.S. representatives, of both political parties, living outside of their districts. Updated information for the current Congress was not immediately available. 
“It’s not the norm but it’s not unusual,” Marion said of congressional members living outside their district.

Across the United States, gun violence continues to be an ever-more-serious national plague. According to the latest mortality data from the CDC, firearm-related deaths among children and teenagers in the United States have soared by 50% since 2019. In 2023, firearms remained the leading cause of death among American youth for the third year in a row.
So what impact is this having on the attitudes of average Americans? A new report published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, entitled “Valuing the benefits of reducing firearm violence in the United States” indicates that it’s a big one and that most Americans would be willing to make significant sacrifices in order to address it. Indeed, the authors found that Americans would willing to pay nearly $100 billion for policies that reduce gun violence by 20%, and recently NC Newsline’s Rob Schofield caught up with one of the authors — Duke University Sanford School Professor Emeritus of Public Policy Philip J. Cook — to learn more.

Nearly 20 years ago, my wife and I were lucky enough to study abroad in England. We had been awarded graduate scholarships and obtained our student visas from the British government. At the time, there was a heartbreaking genocide happening in Darfur. As concerned students invested in the moral standing of our university, we joined peaceful protests calling on Oxford to divest from companies that profited from the genocide and urged the British Parliament to intervene.
I never feared that my exercise of free speech would get me arrested and kicked out of what I took to be the second freest nation on earth, after my own. And I certainly could not have imagined a swarm of British agents abducting me on the street and deporting me without cause. Perhaps in the time of King George III but not the age of constitutions.



Last week, Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish graduate student at Tufts University in Boston, was walking peacefully to the university’s Interfaith Center to break her Ramadan fast when six government agents in masks and hoodies surrounded her and took her away screaming in an unmarked SUV.
For a day or more, according to Fox News, Rumeysa’s family and lawyers had no idea where she was and were unable to contact her. No charges were filed against her. A federal district judge even ordered the government not to move her out of state. But she was moved anyway — to a detention center in Louisiana, awaiting deportation.
Rumeysa had a valid student visa, as Fox News also reported. She was awarded a prestigious Fulbright Fellowship to complete her Ph.D. at Tufts’ Department of Child Study and Human Development, where she researches children and media. No charges were filed against her and there was no warrant for her arrest; warrants are issued by judges who require the government to show cause.
The best guess for why she has been detained is that her name appeared with several others on an article in the student newspaper last year calling on Tufts University to “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide” and divest from companies with ties to Israel. The op-ed never mentioned Hamas, which the U.S. government rightly considers a terrorist organization. There is no evidence that she harbored any sympathy for, much less aided and abetted, Hamas or other organizations opposed to the United States. It seems her only “crime” was to peacefully speak out, as a concerned student, in a manner disfavored by the current administration.
Americans may freely disagree about the heartbreaking conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, which has left thousands of innocent Israelis and hundreds of thousands of innocent Palestinians dead or injured in recent years. For my part, having traveled to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, and believing in the state of Israel as a necessary response to the evils of the Holocaust (in which Jewish family members of mine were killed), I take seriously the conclusions of the International Criminal Court and Amnesty International that Israel’s war in Gaza is a “plausible” genocide.
But regardless of what we believe about Israel and Palestine, there is one thing on which Americans overwhelmingly agree: our constitutional right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment is sacred and immigrants who lawfully reside among us are not without rights of their own. As you uphold my right to call the war in Gaza genocidal, I defend your right to call Hamas an evil terrorist organization. In fact, I’ll join in that because it is also true.
Freedom of speech is as American as apple pie. It’s what has attracted many of the brightest minds from foreign lands to come here legally as students and help make America the richest, most innovative nation on earth — including Elon Musk.
Sadly, Rumeysa is not alone. She is one of hundreds of lawful immigrants so far who have been targeted for deportation by the Trump administration in recent weeks, without any pretense of due process. Their abductions on American streets by unmarked and unidentified “law enforcement” agents are being funded by our tax dollars to the tune of untold millions.
So far we have seen at least seven other students detained for showing sympathy for Palestinians; hundreds of Venezuelan migrants deported to a Salvadoran prison camp against the orders of a federal judge, and extended detentions and physical abuse of lawful migrants at the American border. These and countless other acts represent an unprecedented abuse of federal power against individuals whose lack of citizenship gives them limited legal recourse, in spite of their legal status in this country.
Given the choice, I still believe my fellow Americans would choose the Constitution over a man who would be king. It’s time we make that choice — not just for Rumeysa but for this country we love.

( Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)Gov. Andy Beshear signed a bill into law that sets up a new state aid fund for Kentucky communities affected by recent floods, though he has said the bill “isn’t enough.” 
House Bill 544, which received final passage in the General Assembly Friday with bipartisan support, establishes a new SAFE fund, or State Aid for Emergencies, to respond to widespread mid-February floods. The bill does not appropriate new dollars to respond to the floods. 
Kentucky previously started SAFE funds after floods in Eastern Kentucky and tornadoes in Western Kentucky.
Beshear said in a video shared on social media Sunday that he was “grateful” the legislature passed a new SAFE fund on the final day of the 2025 legislative session. The governor said the legislation “is going to help communities, cities and counties” affected by the floods, which took 24 lives. 
“After all or any of these natural disasters, the families that are impacted deserve our very best,” Beshear said. “They deserve that promise that we’re going to rebuild every structure and every life.” 
‘We’re there’: Beshear urges legislature to lift its cap on emergency spending

Under the legislation, $48 million will be transferred from the previous SAFE funds to the new one created by the bill. It also allows $100 million to be spent on flood aid from the current state budget on governor-declared emergencies, instead of the $50 million limit per fiscal year set by the legislature last year. Beshear said in February that the $50 million cap for the current fiscal year already had been reached.
When asked about the legislation before the veto period began in March, Beshear told reporters that the bill was “a little bit better from where it originally was” as it would allow funds allocated for next fiscal year to be used now. However, he said, that could be a problem for future natural disasters in Kentucky if funding is still limited. Beshear said that “while the bill isn’t nearly enough, I’ll sign it.” 
In other flood-related legislation that was filed this session, Beshear allowed a bill to become law without his signature that gives Kentucky public school districts options to make up or waive days lost to bad winter weather and floods. The Senate added protections for a controversial online school from enrollment caps imposed by state education officials. 
Additionally, the Senate passed a resolution that would have created a task force that would review how the state could become better prepared for natural disasters. However, the legislation did not move in the House.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/flood2_004-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-03-31 11:06:46.437705

For 10 years, Missouri had no incentive for production companies to film in the state. Now, more TV and film sets are coming to Missouri thanks to help from a tax credit established in 2023.


The “Show MO Act” gives up to a 42% tax credit on eligible film productions. Productions initially have the option for a 20% minimum credit but can receive up to four additional 5% credits for meeting certain conditions.


Last year alone, film productions working under the tax credit spent more than $33.5 million. The tax credit follows programs like Georgia’s long-running film tax incentive in boosting state film industries.

“That damn peach,” Missouri Film Office Director Andrea Sporcic-Klund joked, referencing the orange and green logo that appears in the credits of Georgia productions. “Hopefully you’ll be seeing our Missouri logo there pretty soon.”


Sporcic-Klund coordinates film productions in the state and promotes Missouri’s film industry through the incentive. Last year, four productions with budgets over $1 million were filmed in Missouri, which Sporcic-Klund says would not have happened without the incentive.


Film in MO, a nonprofit that works to support the tax credits, lobbied at the Missouri Capitol in February. Sporcic-Klund joined Pete Salsich, an entertainment lawyer who is on the board of directors at Film in MO, at the Capitol to promote the incentive to lawmakers.


“If you don’t have the tax credit, most of these films are simply going somewhere else,” Salsich said. “The tax credit becomes sort of your ticket into the conversation, but it’s not enough, because you can use that lots of places.”


The current tax credit is the state’s second attempt at incentivizing filmmakers to work in Missouri. The previous tax credit was repealed in 2013, with the film “Gone Girl” being the last major production in the state to receive a tax credit until the Show MO Act became official.


In the time after the tax credits expired, the state missed out on several opportunities for major film projects. The Netflix series “Ozark” was one of these productions, as the show drew much attention to the Lake of the Ozarks area despite being filmed mostly in Georgia.

“My hope is that we can get back to getting those solid productions that Missouri can be proud of,” said Sporcic-Klund. “I think losing them, like not having as big of a role in ‘Ozark,’ really changed minds.”


Renewed support for motion picture tax credits came to light in 2023, when the Show MO Act was passed. The bill was initially sponsored in the Senate by Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, who says he is looking forward to seeing successful results from the tax credit.


Hoskins explained that about 4,000 to 5,000 college students were graduating from Missouri universities every year with some sort of media or film degree but were going to other states for work.


“One of the points of that bill was to put the right leg forward and build up that industry so those Missourians can stay here and work in their industry,” Hoskins said.


To be eligible for the credit, each project must meet the minimum spend for the length of their script, employ certain amounts of Missouri registered apprentices and meet the criteria for a “qualified motion media project,” as outlined by the Missouri Department of Economic Development.


Film producer Cole Payne worked on his most recent project, the horror film “The Jester 2” under Missouri’s tax credit.


“As a Missourian, it’s nice to be able to stay at home and film,” Payne said.


The film, which wrapped in 2024 and is currently in post-production, was shot in various locations across Columbia, Rocheport and Boonville. On set, Payne said, everything went smoothly with the help of other Missourians.


“In the town of Rocheport, the mayor came out and supported us. The local restaurants opened up for us, made us dessert and let us use their space at night,” Payne said. “We just hired as many locals as we could.”

More than 30 other states have tax credits for filming. For people who work in Missouri’s film industry like Payne and Salsich, the credit gives them one way to show off their state.


“The out-of-town folks rave about how supportive and friendly everybody here is,” Salsich said. “When people leave here and have a good experience, they talk about it and they want to come back and do it again.”


Besides affordability and hospitality, Missouri’s geography is also appealing to producers. The state is central, which is important for transporting equipment, and, Payne said, “Missouri can be made to work for so many looks.”


The tax credit is mainly designed to bring positive marketing to the state. One of the additional credits that productions can receive is a 5% credit for filming in “rural or blighted” areas, in hopes of increasing tourism and boosting local economies.


An additional 5% credit can be awarded if a film’s script positively markets a city or region of the state, as determined by the Missouri Office of Economic Development. For some producers, this leads to a creative struggle.


Payne’s film did not receive a bonus for positive marketing of Missouri, despite spending two weeks filming in Rocheport. He disagrees with the state’s interpretation of positive marketing.


“Screenplays aren’t written to say, ‘Hey, we’re in this state, and these things are very great about this state,’” Payne said. “It doesn’t mean it can’t be a positive marketing opportunity for the state or the city that it’s filmed in.”


Other rules that were tacked onto the bill also proved to be another off-set roadblock for Payne. He says that the 100% audit required by the Office of Economic Development was a “surprise” since most audits for businesses are usually samples, which are cheaper.


Payne is currently in production for his second film in the state, which will begin filming at the end of March.


After 10 years without an incentive, Missouri has a lot of work to do to rebuild its film industry. Payne is just one producer working toward that goal.


“There’s a production industry in Missouri that’s broader than just tourism that says ‘Come live here,’ ” Salsich said. “Invest in a production house. Turn some old warehouses into sound stages. Invest in more infrastructure to enable more support to exist and attract more productions.”


Salsich says that the impact of the credit is very broad and that it is already being seen through money being spent and jobs being created through productions.


At the film office, Sporcic-Klund is optimistic about this year’s outlook for Missouri films.


“We’ve had two producers bring back second projects already, so the word is good,” she said. “We haven’t made a big push because we know that we lost a lot of infrastructure in those 10 years, so we’re building that back up.”


As the state works to rebuild the film industry, lawmakers have also taken steps to support the Show MO Act. A removal of the program’s expiration was proposed in a recent bill.


“Hopefully we don’t have to keep bringing things in, because we can start building the infrastructure and build brick-and-mortar businesses around this industry,” Payne said. “We will be able to if we can extend or remove the sunset on the bill.”


If the bill passes the House, motion picture tax credits will be ensured for the foreseeable future.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Firearms legislation in Kansas took a backseat during the 2025 legislative session to tax relief and election debates, but advocates and legislators who see room for improvement in Kansas’ gun laws are hopeful bills addressing suicide prevention and child safety will be addressed next year.

For the past three sessions, the gun violence prevention advocacy organization Moms Demand Action has supported a bill bolstering efforts to prevent children from accessing firearms. House Bill 2167 would require guns and stun guns to be locked in storage containers, and it would create a crime for failure to properly store a weapon where a child has access. Penalties would be greater for firearms with large-capacity magazines.
Shannon Little, the leader of the Kansas chapter of Moms Demand Action, said on the Kansas Reflector podcast that Kansas’ firearm laws are some of the weakest in the nation.
The organization’s safe storage bill was referred to the House Federal and State Affairs Committee, where rules allow anything introduced in an odd-numbered year to be brought up again the following session. The bill would penalize someone if an improperly stored firearm is used in a shooting.
“It would incentivize gun owners to responsibly store their firearms, and would definitely put the responsibility on secure firearm storage on adults and not kids,” she said.


At least two pieces of firearms legislation arrived on the governor’s desk Friday. Both have to do with law enforcement. House Bill 2052 broadens the concealed carry limitations for off-duty officers. Senate Bill 137 allows law enforcement agencies to sell or give firearms that were confiscated through civil asset forfeiture to licensed gun dealers. The governor could sign or veto those bills, and the Legislature could try to override a veto.
Little also highlighted House Bill 2379, a proposal from Merriam Democrat Jarrod Ousley called the “voluntary do-not-sell firearms list” act. Its essence is suicide prevention, Little said.
Kansas has a higher firearm death rate than the national average, and suicides made up 67% of gun deaths in the state in 2023, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The voluntary do-not-sell act would create an avenue for people to fill out paperwork to put themselves on a list that would prevent them from purchasing firearms. That paperwork would be available through health care providers and online.
Some kinks in the bill need to be ironed out, Ousley said, but he is operating within the parameters he’s politically allowed in Kansas instead of proposing a stricter red flag law, which exists in other states. Red flag laws, or extreme risk protection orders, allow authorities to temporarily seize someone’s firearms if they pose a risk to themselves or others. The provisions in Ousley’s bill make it so that any relinquishment of a firearm is completely voluntary.
“So it’s not infringing on their Second Amendment rights, aside from the safety precautions that they want to take on themselves,” she said.
The bill exists on a spectrum of prevention efforts, Little said. Even further down on the spectrum are nonpolicy efforts, such as asking a friend or family member to keep one’s firearms, that can be just as effective, she said. The thinking behind HB 2379, Little said, is to keep politics out of safety situations.
“I think it’s easier to start at the end of the spectrum that can do a lot of good (and) that the most people can agree on and, hopefully, get something really good passed,” she said.
The bill had a hearing March 13, during which several people told personal stories about loved ones or themselves. Some remembered loved ones who died by suicide. Many had purchased a firearm days — or even minutes — before they died. Some described their mental health struggles, stating they’d like to be able to sign up for a list like the one Ousley proposed.
“Six people in that room would have signed up that day,” Ousley said.

(Photo by Rick Kern/Getty Images for National Council on Aging)Dr. Fred Levin has been watching with growing alarm the national debate around federal cuts to Medicaid. He’s responsible for the medical care of about 100 older adults at the Community PACE center in rural Newaygo, Michigan. For his patients, Medicaid isn’t just a safety net — it’s a matter of life or death.
“If left to see to their own needs, a lot of them would stay in their homes and would slowly die,” he said. “They wouldn’t be able to get to their doctors’ appointments unless they had a family member to help. They wouldn’t get social care. They wouldn’t have people coming into their homes and seeing the bed bugs or the lice in their hair. They wouldn’t get their medications.”
The care at Community PACE is paid for by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities, and Medicare, the federal insurance program for people 65 and older. The center is a one-stop shop that provides medical and social services to older adults during the day, allowing them to continue living safely in their homes.
If Congress cuts funding to Medicaid, Levin expects his center would probably close. Unlike traditional nursing home care, which state Medicaid programs are required by federal law to cover, the services at PACE centers like his are an optional benefit that 33 states have opted to cover.
Around the nation, doctors, lawmakers, advocates and patients are watching anxiously as Republicans in Congress consider proposals to slash billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in proposed tax cuts. The specific nature of the funding cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states.










If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved.


– Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy, Justice in Aging



The additional financial burden could blow billion-dollar holes in state budgets, forcing state lawmakers to slash health benefits or restrict who’s eligible for them. Nearly a fifth of Americans rely on Medicaid, and the percentage is even higher in some states.
“There are a lot of people who don’t pay attention to this because they think it doesn’t affect them personally,” Levin said. “But 1 in 4 people in Michigan are on Medicaid. It’s very likely you have friends or family on Medicaid.”
Nearly all Americans over age 65 are covered by Medicare, which Republicans have pledged not to touch. Medicare doesn’t cover most nursing home or other long-term care, however. Neither does most private insurance.
But Medicaid does.
“If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved,” said Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy for Justice in Aging, an advocacy group focused on addressing poverty among older people.
“Many of us have a connection to the program or will one day,” she said.
A divided front
Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But policy experts say that reducing coverage for some Medicaid recipients, such as the working adults who got coverage under expansion programs, will have ripple effects on vulnerable groups such as children and older adults.
Republicans aren’t united in a desire to see massive cuts.
Last month, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican governor in a purple state, publicly called on Congress not to slash Medicaid funding.
Lawmakers will ask SD voters for permission to end Medicaid expansion if federal support declines

Earlier this week, Washington Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier wrote a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider cuts to Medicaid and expressing her concern about the large number of military retirees and senior citizens in her district.
Caldier, a dentist who has worked with nursing home patients, told Stateline she believes the most likely cuts would be a reduction in the amount the federal government matches state spending for working adults who are covered under Medicaid expansion. That, she said, would have little impact on older adults.
“The only caveat is that I am very worried that the leadership in our state does not have a good relationship with our president,” Caldier said. Democrats control the offices of governor and both legislative chambers in Washington state. Caldier worries that if Washington lawmakers defy the president over issues such as gender-affirming care for transgender youth, the feds could retaliate by slashing their Medicaid payments to the state.
“If we got into a political match with the president, we would lose, no matter how you slice or dice it,” she said.
In Idaho, Republican state lawmakers shot down a bill that likely would have repealed Medicaid expansion, before passing one that will introduce sweeping policy changes in an effort to control costs.
Even in Congress, some Republicans are balking, publicly defending Medicaid and warning about the consequences of deep cuts. Some who have high percentages of Medicaid recipients in their districts have urged party leaders not to cut funding for the program and have vowed to vote against any budget plan that does so.
Medicaid covers 72 million Americans. A majority of American adults, including two-thirds of Republicans, say they want Congress to either maintain current Medicaid spending or increase it, according to a February 2025 poll from KFF, a health policy research group.
President Donald Trump has said in recent months that he won’t touch Medicaid. But last month, U.S. House Republicans pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that calls for about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help counterbalance the Trump administration’s desired $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.
Facing cuts that large, states would have to figure out which benefits to chop in order to keep their budgets balanced, which is a constitutional requirement in most states.
Older adults and people with disabilities already account for more than half of states’ Medicaid spending, on average. In some states, including Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi and North Dakota, those groups account for two-thirds of state Medicaid spending.
Idaho state Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Democrat on the state Senate Health & Welfare committee, said her biggest concern is Congress reducing the federal match rate. This is the amount of money the federal government chips in to help states pay for Medicaid. How much a state receives mainly depends on how wealthy its residents are. Richer states such as California and Connecticut get less help, while poorer states get more.
In Idaho, on the poorer end of the spectrum, the feds pay about 67% of traditional Medicaid costs and 90% of Medicaid expansion costs.
“It is all a domino effect,” Wintrow said. The federal government covers about $3 billion of Idaho’s $4.2 billion Medicaid budget. “If the feds start chopping that off, it’s going to impact everything.”
Cutting care at home
All state Medicaid programs have opted to cover at least some home-based and community care, such as home health aides who assist people with bathing, toileting and other daily living activities, transportation and adult day care.
Kean and other experts worry that because federal law doesn’t require state Medicaid programs to cover home-based care, state lawmakers might sharply reduce spending on those services — or even eliminate coverage.
There’s a ‘very real chance’ of federal Medicaid expansion funding cuts, lieutenant governor says

“When states have budget shortfalls, they start to tighten eligibility for the home-based programs,” said Kean. “We’re certain those would be the first to go if federal funding is cut for Medicaid.”
Paying for home-based services out of pocket would exhaust the median Medicare recipient’s savings in less than two years, according to KFF.
The median cost of a year of a full-time aide to help is about $62,400, far above the median income for Americans over 65, which is about $36,000. The median life savings for Medicare beneficiaries was $103,800 in 2023.
Home-based services are a popular benefit for state Medicaid programs, because most enrollees prefer to remain in their homes. And despite the expense, home care can be more cost effective than nursing homes — about $38,000 vs. nearly $54,000 per year in 2021, according to a KFF analysis.
Cutting Medicaid also could make it harder to recruit and keep a workforce of nursing home and home health employees.
Over the past two years, most states — even those led by Republicans — increased their Medicaid payment rates for those services, in an effort to combat the nationwide shortage of long-term care workers.
But federal funding cuts could jeopardize what states are able to pay those workers.
“There’s already a direct-care workforce crisis,” Kean said. “Even if eligibility isn’t directly cut or programs aren’t cut, there wouldn’t be enough workers to provide that care. At home and in nursing facilities, the quality of care will go down.”
In rural Michigan, Levin said the PACE center where he works employs about 100 people. Its closure would impact not only those workers, but also would mean his patients would be left to find transportation and other health services on their own, even if those services are still covered by Medicaid.
“Without access in rural areas, how are these individuals going to get to the bigger cities where they can get to their health care? It’s going to overwhelm other parts of the health care system,” Levin said.
“Everybody’s going to be responsible for taking care of the people who don’t have health insurance, in some indirect way or another. It’s going to affect us all.”

The buoy, which has been periodically pulled out of the water for service and then redeployed, is designed to record and transmit weather data from a site called Seal Rocks. The information is important to oil tanker safety in Prince William Sound, but the buoy has had service outages in recent years. It has operated for only 35 days in the past year and a half, according to the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council. (Photo by Nate Littlejohn/U.S. Coast Guard)Too many of the weather buoys floating in the waters off Alaska are out of service and the federal government should devote more resources to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the interest of marine safety, according to a resolution pending in the Legislature.
The measure, Senate Joint Resolution 12, calls for Congress to “take actions necessary to restore the full functionality,” of the NOAA’s National Data Buoy Center meteorological sites in Alaska, which relay real-time weather information important to mariners.
The resolution calls for the state’s three-member congressional delegation to work to secure federal funding for that NOAA program, even as the Trump administration is slashing NOAA’s workforce and operations. And it points to Alaska’s vast size, harsh weather and heavy reliance on maritime operations.
Sen. Forrest Dunbar, D-Anchorage, the resolution’s sponsor, said Alaskans depend on the weather buoys and the information they provide to a degree that policymakers in the Lower 48 might not appreciate.
“These are serious life safety issues,” he said.
But the resolution is about more than buoys, Dunbar said. It is a defense of a federal agency and federal scientists currently enduring an onslaught of mass firings and budget cuts, he said.
“This is a good argument for preserving National Weather Service and NOAA funding,” Dunbar said, listing one of NOAA’s best-known divisions.
Of the 27 National Data Buoy Center meteorological/ocean stations deployed in Alaska, seven are currently out of service, according to the center.
There is particular concern about outages at a Prince William Sound site called Seal Rocks. The buoy there is supposed to be transmitting critical information about winds, wave heights and other conditions that affect the safety of oil tankers using the Trans Alaska Pipeline System terminal in Valdez.
That Seal Rocks buoy, an important source of weather data for marine-safety studies, has had intermittent outages for several years and is currently out of service.
It is at Hinchinbrook Entrance, the passageway between islands that connects Prince William Sound to the wider Gulf of Alaska. The area from Hinchinbrook Entrance to the Valdez terminal – which includes Blight Reef, site of the1989 Exxon Valdez disaster, is of special concern for tanker safety.  Under post-Exxon Valdez rules, oil tankers are escorted there by safety tugs, and shipments by loaded tankers are stopped when winds exceed 45 knots or waves are above 15 feet at Hinchinbrook Entrance.
The Prince William Sound Regional Citizens’ Advisory Council, a marine safety watchdog created by Congress after the Exxon Valdez spill, raised concerns about the outages as early as 2018.
Those outages continue.
John Guthrie, the council’s maritime operations project manager, told lawmakers at a recent hearing that the buoy has been operating for only about 35 days during the past year and a half. That hampers the U.S. Coast Guard, he said, because it has to make decisions about tanker traffic based on less-reliable information from more distant buoys, weather forecasts or chance observations by other mariners, he said.

	While subsistence fishers, commercial fishers and others on the water depend on the real-time weather information relayed by the buoys, “the Seal Rocks buoy, in particular, is a key component of the oil spill prevention system in Prince William Sound. The risk of another oil spill increases whenever it is not working,” Guthrie said at a March 20 hearing of the Senate Transportation Committee.
Dunbar said the Seal Rocks buoy situation should be compelling.
“Here’s a concrete example where National Weather Service and NOAA funding is absolutely essential to the safety of the environment in Prince William Sound but also to the economy in the state and, frankly, the nation,” he said.
Legislative resolutions do not create laws, but they express lawmakers’ sentiments. Resolutions directed at federal agencies or at Congress, such as the pending resolution on NOAA buoys, are intended to persuade federal policymakers and influence their actions.
The sentiment expressed in SJR 12, however, conflicts with Trump administration policies concerning NOAA and its divisions.
Already, the Trump administration has fired hundreds of NOAA employees around the nation, including many in Alaska. The National Weather Service has lost about 10% of its workforce. Another 1,000 NOAA employees may be fired next. The agency is among those targeted by the administration’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” or DOGE, which is led by billionaire Elon Musk.
The Trump administration’s objections to NOAA appear to be related to the agency’s work on climate change.
Project 2025, a preelection blueprint for a second Trump administration produced prior to the 2024 election by the conservative Heritage Foundation, cited that work in its conclusion that NOAA “should be broken up and downsized.”
NOAA’s divisions, including the National Weather Service and National Marine Fisheries Service, “form a colossal operation that has become one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry and, as such, is harmful to future U.S. prosperity,” the Project 2025 “Mandate for Leadership” document said.
Though Trump attempted to distance himself from Project 2025 before the November election, many of the plan’s authors have high-level positions in his administration. Those include Russell Vought, director of the Office of Budget and Management, who was Project 2025’s lead author.
Impacts to NOAA of the DOGE-imposed cuts and restrictions go beyond lost jobs and workers.
NOAA just canceled a scientific conference that has been held annually for half a century. The 2025 Global Monitoring Annual Conference would have focused on information about greenhouse gas emissions, carbon cycle feedbacks and other atmospheric science subjects. The 2024 conference was the 52nd held by NOAA.
Senate Joint Resolution 12 was pending in the Senate Rules Committee as of Friday.

The following is an excerpt from the recently published “Disciples of White Jesus.” In its description, Publisher’s Weekly says, “A shifting American culture is pushing white Christian boys toward radicalization, isolation, and violence, according to this persuasive treatise.” Consider buying the book at an independent Minnesota bookstore. 
We cannot understand the problems of radicalization among young, white Christian boys in America, nor fully grapple with the challenges and troubles facing these boys, without understanding what’s happening in American schools. And without consulting that most underpaid and too-often scapegoated American professional, the public school teacher.
A teacher I’ll call Joe, 59, is just the kind of teacher that hard-core advocates of traditional masculinity might dream up as their ideal educator for young, white Christian boys and men — at least at first blush. Joe, who has been teaching for 36 years in total, and 33 years in the Minneapolis Public Schools, stands 6 foot, 5 inches tall. When it comes to physical education instruction, which he has led for 23 years at his current school building, Joe is no-nonsense and almost stern, cutting a strong, athletic and disciplined figure, a product of his Marine veteran father, who worked for decades in underground pipelines after leaving the military.

Joe spends his winter days at an upper elementary school in a relatively affluent neighborhood of Minneapolis, with a student body that’s more than 85% white; only to drive across the Mississippi River after school to St. Paul’s Central High School, where he works as an assistant basketball coach at a school that is 59% POC students, including 29% Black students, in a neighborhood where 18% of residents live in poverty. 
It’s a fitting dual existence for Joe, who describes his childhood as a life in two worlds. His dad was a member of the Red Cliff Native American tribe, and the family lived together on the reservation near Bayfield, Wisconsin, even though Joe’s mother was white. He recalls that sometimes he was bullied on both ends, about his Indigenous ancestry by the white kids, and from the Native kids, called an “apple,” suggesting that while he was “red” on the outside, he was really “white” on the inside. Joe thought maybe that was because his teacher mom encouraged her four boys to do well in school, something that wasn’t always popular on the reservation, for myriad reasons.
Teaching PE and coaching basketball enable Joe to use parts of his skill set and personality that some advocates of gender absolutism might consider contradictory. He retains much of the “tough-love,” “old-school” military mentality that his dad instilled in him. And at the same time, Joe also saw the ways in which that hard-core masculine identity led his dad to a life of physical pain and even premature death. Joe saw the strengths and limitations of a masculinity that’s only rooted in hardness and discipline. So he brings a bit of his mom’s more nurturing side to his role as an educator and coach as well. After all, Joe says the best parts of his day are often the hours he spends in physical education with a smaller group of students with disabilities and cognitive delays. These students, who are often withdrawn or quiet or uncooperative in public settings, seem to innately trust Joe, something I saw firsthand when I served as a substitute teacher in his classroom. They know the rhythms and routines of the gymnasium; it was a place they clearly felt accepted, loved, and known — something achieved by an educator rooted in discipline and athleticism but also in emotional connection, patience, and kindness.
Given his popularity among many of his students and student athletes, and his continued commitment to athleticism even into his 59th year, you might think that Joe is supremely confident and undeterred in any school setting. But he knows that washboard abs or biceps would be no match for an AR-15 in a potential school shooting situation.
“That scares me more than anything as a teacher,” Joe told me, when we discussed the potential of a school shooter coming to our shared neighborhood. “Even who I am, there is very little I can do to stop that situation. The best thing we can do is just barricade ourselves.”
Joe says he thinks about it often, imagining himself in the shoes of fellow teachers and educators who have faced active shooters in their buildings.
“They probably thought the same things I do,” he said. “Your senses are so heightened as a teacher. You’re making sure all your doors are shut. You’re following the proper procedures for code red. What do you do? What do I do? What if I’m at prep? What if it’s happening in another area of the building? Of all the things, that’s the one that scares me the most.”
I’m struck at this moment by the seriousness and vulnerability and sadness that has come over Joe’s face. This is a man who deeply loves being a teacher. By the nature of his work with disabled students — among whom boys are overrepresented — and his role as a boys’ basketball coach, Joe does tend to spend a bit more time with boys as an educator and coach, though his office is also filled with cards from former students, divided equally between boys and girls. He’s also the father of a 20-something son, whom he watched attend school in the same district where he teaches. He says the two of them will talk about those boys who seem to fall through the cracks, the ones for whom traditionally male-dominated outlets like sports or mathematics don’t seem to fit, but who also don’t find their place in outlets like music or drama. He and his son recently together discussed the fact that two of his classmates — despite their relatively privileged backgrounds — had recently died of drug overdoses. Joe talked also of watching the boys who used to run with joy and abandon around his gym classes, pelting each other with balls, turn into sullen, withdrawn, and angry teenagers. Sometimes seeing them makes him feel sad and powerless.
“When you, as a teacher, can pinpoint those students out, you try and let them figure out a way for themselves, and also serve as advocate for them and help them find a way,” Joe says. “Sometimes they just need an ear to bend. Sometimes parents will ask me about younger kids and help them find a group, or a place to fit in.”
I realize, in talking with Joe, that it’s not his height or his athleticism or his perceived traditional masculinity that makes Joe a favorite among his students, or that has enabled him to have such longevity as a PE teacher in a challenging time for public school teachers, especially in inner-city, urban school districts. For Joe, for his students: the key is trust and relationship. He has been able to carve out a unique sense of both in his role as teacher and coach in Minneapolis. But it doesn’t escape me that even in this ideal school, Joe still faces the fear and anxiety of the violence of the wider world, the ominous threat of a school shooting.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1532870985-1024x461.jpg,,,2025-03-31 10:01:27.156599

Gaines/Maryland Matters)Lawmakers have had 82 days to deal with the major issues of the 2025 General Assembly session and, as usual, most of the big issues are still hanging with eight days left to Sine Die, the last day of the 90-day session.
But if anyone is panicking, it’s not evident. Most of the big issues are progressing, if slowly, and the House and Senate appear to be talking to each other on the bills where they have disputes. That doesn’t mean there won’t be a wrench thrown into the works in the next week, or that an unexpected issue won’t arise. Or that they’ll be done before the last minute.
But with eight days left, here’s where some of the issues we’ve been following stand.
It’s always been the budget
Coming into the session, it was clear that the big issue would be the fiscal 2026 budget, which had an estimated $3 billion deficit.  Uncertainty at the federal level related to budget and job cuts and agency presence in Maryland complicated what would have been a challenge in most years.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) and legislative leaders have broad agreement on a budget that must be balanced. Their plan includes more than $2 billion in cuts and $1 billion in new taxes.
“What is very clear and what is the most important to note about this budget is that it is fiscally sound,” said Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City). “It invests in all of our core priorities, like public education, public safety and health care, and it raises revenues from those who can most afford it, while protecting against the inevitable uncertainties that are coming from the administration.
Democratic majority muscles spending, tax plan through preliminary vote

“It is a sound budget that I think makes the appropriate efforts to put Maryland on as solid a footing as possible, given the level of uncertainty that we have,” he said.
The state’s General Fund budget — the portion paid for through sales and income and other direct state taxes — is about $400 million smaller than the current year.
Republicans and others note that many of the so-called cuts are accounting gimmicks that include holding open positions instead of hiring and shifting costs such as teacher pensions and the costs of property tax assessments to local governments.
Democrats take pains to note that their tax increases are targeted to high earners, and it’s true that 94% of Marylanders will see either a reduction in their income taxes or no change at all. But for many, the reduction — $50-$60 annually on average — will not bring the kind of “breathing room” Moore told reporters he wants the middle class to have.
High earners — $500,000 and above — will move into two new brackets. There’s also a new surcharge on capital gains for some taxpayers.
And any tax decreases will be offset by increases in vehicle emissions testing fees, taxes on vending machine sales, a $500 million tax on data and IT services, and others. One Republican calle the plan a “net more than it is a net less for taxpayers.”
The Senate will hold a preliminary vote on the two-bill package on Monday. The debate there may look similar to more than seven hours of back-and-forth in the House last week as Republicans unsuccessfully offered more than 20 amendments.
Ferguson said he expects a final vote Tuesday. The House and Senate can then convene a conference committee to work out what the Senate president described as minor differences — including the Senate eliminating a combined corporate income tax provision — by the end of the week.
The Senate version will also likely lower a House increase of the sales tax on car sales. In its place, Ferguson said the Senate is adding a $5 fee on the sale of each individual tire. The money would go to the Transportation Trust Fund.
“There’s been a lot of chatter around vehicle miles traveled, but there are concerns around privacy … and tires actually serve as kind of an interesting proxy for vehicle miles traveled,” Ferguson said. “The more you use your car, the more tires you use. So it’s similar to the gas tax. It is a user fee.”
The vote Monday means the legislature will miss the 83rd day requirement to complete work on the budget. That will trigger a letter from Moore invoking a requirement for lawmakers to remain in Annapolis to finish the budget if it is not finalized before midnight April 7, but so far no one expects the session to go into extra innings.
An energy package comes together
Also expected on Monday is an initial Senate vote on the leadership energy package, which includes a host of provisions intended to address high electric bills  for Maryland customers, with rates expected to increase further this summer.
With utility bills rising, some sort of energy reform was also expected this session. But it was not until last week that amendments suddenly debuted, bringing pieces of several other energy bills into one large package that is expected to hit the floor today.
General Assembly energy package a mixed bag for environmental groups

The legislation includes a utility bill rebate for Maryland residential customers, which is estimated to total about $80 per household, on average. But the payment, which would come in two installments, would also depend on a household’s energy usage.
“These will be immediate relief for ratepayers, who we know are feeling it harder than ever,” Ferguson said Friday.
The bill also aims to accelerate Maryland power generation — including nuclear power and potentially natural gas — and give a boost to energy storage technology, which makes use of large batteries to store energy for later use.
“We’re going to be focused on generating more affordable, reliable and cleaner energy than we have today here in Maryland,” Ferguson said. “This energy package gives Marylanders more control in the short term, in the mid-term and in the long term, to lower utility bills and address the threat of climate change at the same time.”
Environmental groups say they’re thrilled to see provisions curbing utility spending on gas pipelines, and preventing investor-owned utilities from using ratepayer dollars for private jets and trade association memberships. They’re also happy about new requirements for utilities to justify multiyear rate increases, among other provisions.
But the bill’s fast-track process for power plants gives many groups pause, with worries that the procedure will result in new natural gas-burning power plants that raise the state’s emissions, and jeopardize low-income and minority communities where power plants have previously been located.
“There are some things that concern us,” said Josh Tulkin, director of the Maryland Chapter of the Sierra Club. “Given how complicated and nuanced they are, these are risky things to do quickly.”
Blueprint reform slogs to the finish
Another issue that was expected to dominate the session was reform of the 10-year, multibillion-dollar Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, now in its third year.
Local school officials continued to say they need flexibility to implement the plan according to their counties’ unique needs and budget hawks saw the plan as ripe for savings, even though Democrats insist the plan has been budgeted for through next year.
The governor said he remains fully committed to the Blueprint, and the Moore administration proposed a number of cuts, most framed as deferrals or increases that were lower than orginally planned increases.
But those brought protests from advocates and pushback from some lawmakers, with the loudest opposition coming from the House.
The House earlier this month approved an Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act — the vehicle for the Blueprint changes — that rejected the governor’s call for a freeze in funding for community schools, those schools located in low-income neighborhoods, and a reduction in the growth of the per pupil fundng formula.
The House also stuck to the Blueprint’s schedule for increasing “collaborative time” for teachers, cutting down their in-class time to allow more time for planning, training and working on projects or with students. Critics said collaborative time will require hiring 12,000 more teachers at a time of teacher shortages, and the administration plan would have delayed its implementation.
The Senate this week will take up its own version, which roughly splits the difference between the House and the governor, accepting the delay in collaborative time for teachers, but siding with the House on the need for community school funding, among other changes.
The bill should go to the House later this week, which is expected to reject it, setting up a potentially contentious conference committee before next Monday.
Housing for Jobs Act lags
One of the governor’s priorities is running behind schedule compared to most other bills this session.
House Bill 503, dubbed the Housing for Jobs Act, was voted out of its first committee in the original chamber just Friday, meaning it still needs approval from the full House before it begins the process over in the Senate. There is a Senate version of the bill, but lawmakers there are letting the House steer the progress of the bill.

Lawmakers will have to scramble if they want to get it over the finish line before Sine Die.
The legislation got a late start in committee, with the first hearings not held until early thing month. Once it was introduced, county officials found many “significant” issues, including its goal of requiring counties to automatically approve new housing developments in areas with high job growth, unless officials could cite a specific reason to reject the project.
In the time since, lawmakers, county officials and the administration began working on amendments to address the raised concerns.
It took weeks to settle on the new bill language, but the House Environment and Transportation committee essentially rewrote the bill to instead create a commission that would recommend solutions to improve the state’s 96,000 housing unit shortage, among other changes.
The new language has been described as “simpler” and more streamlined, which could have a better shot of jumping through the remaining legislative hurdles in the condensed timeframe — but it’s not guaranteed that the governor’s bill can beat the clock.
New funds for abortion grant
Legislation to tap into some $25 million in insurance surcharges is on the verge of full passage, as both the House and Senate versions of the bill are waiting on final approval in the opposite chamber.
House Bill 930, awaiting a final vote from the Senate, would allow the Department of Health to use money that has been collecting dust for around 15 years. The Affordable Care Act requires that insurers collect a $1 premium per person per month that can only be used for abortion services.
Supporters of the legislation say over the course of 15 years, the fund has accumulated some $25 million, which could be used to provide abortion coverage for uninsured or underinsured individuals. HB930 would create a grant fund with those dollars to do so.
Senate Bill 848 is in the same situation on the House side, meaning if either chamber votes on the legislation this week, it will go to the governor’s desk for consideration.
Chrometastically yours, almost.
Maryland is this close to expanding its roster of state symbols.
  Lobbyist Ashlie Bagwell (left) speaks to her client David Shore before a hearing on a bill to add the mineral chromite to a list of official state symbols. (File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)
A House bill to make chromite the official mineral of Maryland needs only a final vote in the Senate to secure its spot among symbols that include a state cat and dog, dinosaur, butterfly, cake and crustacean.
An identical Senate bill is scheduled for an April 1 hearing in a House Committee.
Since both bills flew out of their chambers of origin unaltered, there’s a good chance that David Shore, who eight years ago began his quest to have the mineral named as a state symbol, will see his efforts realized.
Chromite was first discovered in the Bare Hills area of Baltimore County. It quickly became an additive in paints and the making of steel alloys. It was shipped all over the world from Baltimore.
In a year of difficult debates on budgets, taxes and other serious issues, Shore’s “chrometastic” legislation might be the feel-good bill of the 2025 session.
And it’s fiscally responsible. Legislative analysts say approving the bill does not affect businesses or local government and “does not materially affect state finances.”
And no one is proposing a tax on it — as far as we know.
Reconsidering the Child Victims Act
Lawmakers will also attempt to pass legislation that will limit the state’s financial risks stemming from lawsuits filed by people claiming they were sexually assaulted while in state facilities.

It took a decade for the state to pass the Child Victims Act, a law that made it easier for child sex abuse victims to file claims against public and private institutions.
But the changes have exposed the state to potentially billions in claims. Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles), the sponsor of the 2023 law and the current bill to limit state liability, said failing to act this year could bankrupt the state.
Wilson and his colleagues will attempt to make substantive changes to the law in just eight days.
The bill remains in a House committee. It must pass out of committee and get through the full House before it can begin again in the Senate.
And if it manages to get through the General Assembly and be signed into law, Wilson acknowledged it will likely face court challenges. Opponents of Wilson’s efforts say the proposed changes are unconstitutional and insulting to survivors of institutionalized sexual abuse.
Another peek at Second Look
Criminal justice advocates will be focused this week on the Senate, after that chamber’s Judicial Proceedings Committee advanced the House measure known as the Second Look Act by an 8-3 vote Friday.
The bill by Del. Cheryl Pasteur (D-Baltimore County) would let incarcerated individuals who serve at least 20 years in prison petition a judge to have their sentences reduced. The measure has sparked robust debate in both chambers, which is expected to continue on the Senate floor.
“Philosophically, some of us are just probably at different ends of the spectrum when we’re talking about dealing with someone who’s in this position,” Sen. Charles Sydnor III (D-Baltimore County), who sponsored the Senate version that didn’t advance out of the committee, said Friday.
The Senate advanced a similar measure last year, but it stalled in the House. This year, the House approved the bill first that included a more than two-hour, emotional debate during a rare Saturday session March 15.
The Legislative Black Caucus has labeled the bill a priority.
Reparations moving along
Another caucus priority was discussed Friday by the House Health and Government Operations Committee, which voted to advance a Senate bill to create a Maryland Reparations Committee.
Senate Bill 587, sponsored by Sen. C. Anthony Muse (D-Prince George’s), seeks to create a Maryland Reparations Commission to study the inequality African descendants faced in the state. A House version sponsored by Del. Aletheia McCaskill (D-Baltimore County) didn’t advance from that committee.
The bill would focus on “individuals impacted by historical inequality,” which means those whose ancestors were enslaved in the state or “impacted by inequitable government policies.”
The specific policies would be from the federal, state or local between 1877 to 1965, informally known as the post-Reconstruction and Jim Crow eras. The bills say those years “have led to economic disparities based on race, including housing segregation and discrimination, redlining, restrictive covenants, and tax policies.” The commission would also examine how public and private institutions may have benefited from those policies.
Reparations could include statements of apology, monetary compensation, social service assistance, business incentives and child care costs. The commission would be tasked with submitting a preliminary report by Jan. 1, 2027, and a final report by Nov. 1 of that year.
Friday’s vote fell along party lines, with the six committee Republicans voting the bill, after more than 90 minutes of debate. Del. Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel), chair of the committee, stressed the need for a “calm, respectful” discussion.
Del. Teresa E. Riley (R-Cecil and Harford) said the bill would “pick winners and losers.”
“It’s going to be extremely difficult who would be eligible,” she said. “I think ultimately if we do come up with something that’s substantial, it will bankrupt the state of Maryland.”
Del. Matthew Morgan (R-St. Mary’s), called the measure “political” and offered an amendment to have a report done by Sept. 1, 2026, in time for next year’s elections. But Peña-Melnyk said more time is needed, not just for the report, but to appoint the nearly two dozen members to the commission.
“This cannot be done in a year,” she said. “This would take so much time, and you want to do it right.”
Del. Kim Ross (D-Baltimore County) said the bill doesn’t create a racial divide.
“On a practical level, reparations helps level the playing field,” she said. “I would feel more pride in my state with a commission this like in place. I would feel good about living here.”
Other matters

SB357: Expands the authority of the Prescription Drug Affordability Board’s efforts to reduce the cost of certain prescription drugs. The Senate version of the bill received some amendments in the Health and Government operations Friday, meaning the Senate will have to review the changes if the House approves it before it can go to the governor’s desk.
HB39: Repeals a penalty for intentional transfer of human immunodeficiency virus. The bill just needs approval from the full Senate before it goes to the governor for consideration, while the Senate version of the bill is awaiting a committee vote in the House.
SB414: creates a one-time $1,000 tax credit for parents who had a stillborn child. With no House version, the legislation is awaiting approval from the House Ways and Means Committee, which held a hearing last week, before it can move forward.
HB102: delays the implantation of the Family and Medical Leave Insurance (FAMLI) program by 18-months. The House approved the bill 95-34 Friday, but it still needs Senate approval. The Senate has not moved its version of the bill out of the Finance Committee.
SB 181/HB 1123: Both measures focus on medical and geriatric parole and have been approved by their respective chambers. A few differences in the bills include the Senate version stating that a person must be 65 years old to petition for parole; the House version set the age at 60.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/state-house-flowers-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-03-31 09:02:09.885696

Minnesota is at a critical moment. The state’s commitment to supporting people with disabilities is at a crossroads. 
Gov. Tim Walz’s proposed budget includes an array of cuts to disability waiver services, notably to the inflationary adjustment for service providers. 
This threatens to undo years of progress.  
These cuts — from an 11% adjustment increase in 2026 to just 4% — are not mere numbers on a spreadsheet. They represent a threat to the quality and accessibility of disability services across Minnesota and serve as a blow to an already reeling workforce that provides these life-saving services. The impacts of these budget targets may be greater than the governor is anticipating. 
Of chief importance are the impacts these cuts will have on the workforce that underpins disability services. These professionals, who are primarily women and people of color, are paid low wages as it stands, especially as inflation impacts every Minnesotan’s purchasing power. Reducing the inflationary adjustment to 4% every two years ensures their pay will fall further behind increasing costs. As a result, this field’s vacant positions will become increasingly uncompetitive to new workers and existing workers will leave in search of better pay. 
We frequently hear from direct care workers: “I love this work, but I can’t afford to keep doing it.” Now, under the governor’s proposed budget, that refrain will only grow louder. Low pay and rising costs will drive workers away, increasing turnover and further straining already limited resources. 
While we hear the governor’s optimism that these budgetary adjustments will not impede the quality of care, or the number of people served, in no other industry could one expect such a large cut to not affect the work. To ask an industry that already stretches its resources to its limits to absorb this cut will result in serious consequences for those receiving care.
The ripple effects of these cuts will not stop with workers. Those receiving services and their families will bear the brunt of this proposal. Strained support networks created from these cuts will leave families with fewer resources to care for their loved ones, forcing them to shoulder an even greater responsibility. Potential facility closures will mean that those receiving care may not have the opportunity to live near their loved ones, to live in the place they desire, or to receive the care that best meets their needs.  
The governor and the Legislature must grapple with challenging questions this session about how to meet Minnesota’s needs within the realities of the state’s budget. It’s imperative these decisions prioritize the dignity and well-being of Minnesota’s many people who live with a disability and the workers who support them.
My final message is this: Legislators, I encourage you to see the faces behind the numbers. Disability services are people in our community, friends, and family members. I know you care deeply about equity and progress. I know you see an indispensable workforce for what it is. These values are at stake in this budget cycle, and we need you to balance it with the same compassion that we have come to expect from Minnesota. 
We are a state that has long prided itself on being a leader in giving everyone a fair shot at living a fulfilled life. It’s time for us to invest in those values. 
A reevaluation is needed, one with the outstanding legal and moral obligations to care for people living with disabilities.

This week: Massive cuts at the Minnesota Department of Health; the most diverse places in Minnesota; recovering ill-gotten gains from Feeding Our Future defendants; and county-level impacts of Trump’s NIH cuts.
MDH losing $226 million in federal funds
The Minnesota Department of Health announced last week that the Trump administration is unilaterally rescinding $226 million in federal grants related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
“This termination is effective immediately and impacts ongoing work and contracts,” Health Commissioner Brooke Cunningham said in a statement. “This action was sudden and unexpected.”
The cuts amount to about 25% of MDH’s current budget, according to KARE-11, and are likely to result in the layoffs of around 200 employees. The actions are part of a broader nationwide effort to eliminate $11 billion in spending by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Among the programs affected: COVID-19 testing and vaccination efforts; research to improve vaccine effectiveness and respond to future pandemics; and efforts to develop treatments for other types of virus with pandemic potential.
Minnesota recently scored poorly on a national ranking of health emergency preparedness.
Minnesota’s most (and least) diverse counties
Minnesota has become ever so slightly more diverse since 2020, according to Census data analyzed by the USA Facts team. But it’s close to the bottom tier of states on diversity.
If you were to select two Minnesota residents at random, there’s roughly a 40% chance that they won’t have the same race and ethnicity. The most diverse state is Hawaii, where there’s a 76% chance you’ll get two people of different races, while the least diverse state is Maine, where the odds of selecting different races is just 16%.
There’s lots of variation at the county level, too. Morrison County in central Minnesota is the least diverse in the state, with less than a 9% chance of drawing two people of differing ethnicities. You might expect urban core counties like Hennepin or Ramsey to have the most diversity but that’s not quite right: Mahnomen County in the northwest scores highest on the measure, with a 62% chance of selecting people with different ethnicities. That likely owes to the county’s high proportion of Indigenous residents.
Hennepin and Ramsey aren’t far behind, however.
Nationwide, the least diverse places are counties in Appalachia, while the most diverse tend to be located in Hawaii and Alaska.
Feds may only be able to recover $50 million from Feeding Our Future defendants
Federal prosecutors have seized about $75 million in assets from Feeding Our Future defendants so far, according to the Star Tribune. That’s just a fraction of the estimated $250 million in total diversions of money by the alleged fraudsters.
And the final tally of recovered funds is likely to be even smaller, as some of the seized assets are depreciating in value and will cost money to sell off. The final recovery might be as little as $50 million, prosecutors say.
Defendants funneled their ill-gotten gains into things like lavish trips, shopping and entertainment, prosecutors allege. Some money was squirreled away overseas.
In federal white collar crime cases, recovery rates of as little as 10% are often seen as commendable, giving the difficulties of clawing back money that may have been spent over many years.
The effect of NIH cuts in your county
A consortium of researchers at several universities have released county-level estimates of the total financial impact of cuts to National Institutes of Health grants announced by the Trump administration last month.
The estimates incorporate not just the lost grant dollars themselves, but also the spillover effects of the additional economic activity the NIH grants stimulate. Running the numbers that way shows that the cuts have impacts not just in the counties where the affected medical and scientific institutions are located, but also in surrounding communities that benefit from the economic activity generated by those research hubs.
No county in Minnesota is unaffected, according to the researchers’ estimates. Minnesota as a whole will see a $355 million decrease in economic activity, causing the loss of more than 1,400 jobs.
Hennepin and Olmsted counties, home to the University of Minnesota and the Mayo Clinic respectively, account for more than $200 million of Minnesota’s losses.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/P1229249-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-31 09:02:09.885696

But one state lawmaker believes there exists another untapped market: corporate litigation.

But one state lawmaker believes there exists another untapped market: corporate litigation.
Delaware and its centuries-old Court of Chancery is the undisputed leader of business incorporation and corporate law in the United States. Delaware proudly boasts that 67% of Fortune 500 companies and 80% of the companies filing initial public offerings in 2023 were incorporated there.
Nevada movers and shakers have long toyed with the idea of the Silver State jumping in on that corporate action. A bubbling of recent corporate dissatisfaction with Delaware has rekindled interest and created a new window of opportunity.
Democratic Assemblymember Joe Dalia is sponsoring Assembly Joint Resolution 8, which proposes amending the Nevada State Constitution to establish a dedicated business court.
“This will allow Nevada to compete more capably for the multibillion dollar corporate filings market by offering businesses greater legal predictability and efficiency,” Dalia told lawmakers on the Assembly Judiciary Committee, which heard his resolution in early March.
Nevada over the past two decades has taken steps to make itself a more enticing option for incorporation.
“However, despite the progress we’ve made, and despite having some very talented judges on the bench right now, our system still suffers from certain structural limitations that put us at a disadvantage relative to Delaware,” he said.
AJR8, if passed in the current legislative session, would have to pass again in the 2027 legislative session. Then it would go to voters in the 2028 general election for final approval. The particulars of the business court would then have to be established by the Legislature, presumably during its 2029 session.
Once established, the court would handle complex business matters, such as disputes over shareholder rights, mergers and acquisitions, and fiduciary duties.
Courts dedicated to specific areas of law are not unusual. In Nevada, family court is its own division and judges do not hear civil or criminal cases. Courts in Clark and Washoe counties have operated dedicated business dockets since 2001, with the goal being to adjudicate those cases more quickly.
UNLV Boyd School of Law professor Benjamin Edwards worked on the resolution with Dalia. He explains a dedicated business court using a metaphor of a busy roadway or highway.
“This is basic infrastructure that creates a lane attractive for trailers so they are not next to your Corolla,” he said.
But the financial benefit would come when more businesses choose to incorporate in Nevada and pay the state’s filing fees.
Delaware, a state with a population of 1 million people and 2.2 million businesses, generates $2 billion a year in revenue from commercial business filings. That revenue makes up 29% of their state’s general fund. (On top of that, additional taxes, and economic activity, are generated by the lawyers and their staff doing increased business in the state.)
By contrast, in Nevada, business licensing generated approximately $200 million last fiscal year, according to a report from the Nevada Secretary of State’s Office, whose commercial recordings division oversees them.
Nevada Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar, who supports AJR8, says if Nevada could siphon just 5% market share off Delaware, that could mean an additional $100 million in revenue that could help “solve some of our problems — education, health care, a lot of things.”
Edwards doesn’t think Nevada will cause a “DExit” —  a silly term being thrown about that plays off the UK’s Brexit — but instead will influence new companies. Even the initial approval of AJR8 sends a signal to the business community, he added.
“I don’t think Delaware will stop growing anytime soon,” said Edwards, but if their growth slows while Nevada’s business community grows that impact will “compound rapidly” and translate into additional revenue for the state.
Other supporters of the prospect of a Nevada business court agree.
“This is the type of economic development that is very cheap for the state,” said Bryan Wachter of the Retail Association of Nevada, which testified in support of the resolution. “You are going to consider a multitude of ways of approaching economic development. Some of those are going to come with a very heavy price tag. This one does not.”
 Dissatisfaction in Delaware

“Everybody who really understands (AJR8) supports it,” said Edwards. “If you talk to business lawyers or people who are familiar with it, they get it immediately.”
But for everyone else, including the lawmakers who’d have to approve it twice and voters who’d have to approve it once, the issue may come across as Nevada kowtowing to corporate overlords who are throwing a fit because Delaware was mean to them.
“Anybody who tells you they know the right balance between protecting investors and management in corporate law is an idiot,” opined Edwards. “Nobody has a clear sense of the perfect ratio.”
Nevada and Delaware simply “strike different balances,” he added.
Enter the 1,000-lbs elephant in the courtroom: Elon Musk, the controversial billionaire who in addition to being CEO of Tesla and other companies is currently running amok as the head of the Trump administration’s slash and burn Department of Government Efficiency.
Musk has been one of the loudest critics of Delaware’s Court of Chancery and has transferred the incorporation of three of his companies to other states. In early February, he posted on his social media platform: “Texas and Nevada are the best choices for incorporation.”
Texas became the state of incorporation for Tesla and SpaceX last year. Nevada became the state of incorporation for X Corp (formerly Twitter) in 2023.
“He’s someone who has brought a lot of attention to the issue,” acknowledged Edwards, but he believes it’s shortsighted for Nevada lawmakers to see the business court proposal as being associated with Musk. “It has nothing to do with him really.”
Aguilar, when asked about Musk being outspoken on the issue, all but changed the subject, and said there are a lot of good corporate actors: “You don’t hear about them” in the contest of business litigation venue attractiveness “because they are driving their businesses forward, and they want a fair environment.”
Businesses have broader issues — primarily how easy it is to file litigation against corporations in Delaware — that are long-standing but largely uninteresting to people outside of the insular corporate law world.
“Every maybe 30 years or so there will be something that happens in Delaware that leads to a lot of people freaking out about something,” said Edwards.
Indeed, proponents in the late 1990s and early aughts pitched the establishment of dedicated business dockets in Nevada as having the potential to be a siren song for businesses contemplating a state other than Delaware.
Musk and the corporate law world’s current flavor spike centers on controlled companies — companies where one person owns more than 50% of stock. Delaware law is currently seen as being friendlier to shareholders than controllers, and has ruled that some companies for some purposes can be considered controlled even if technically 50% of the stock isn’t held by one person.
That includes Tesla and a massive $50 billion shareholder-approved CEO compensation package for Musk, which the Delaware Chancery Court rejected. (The CEO package case is being appealed to the Delaware Supreme Court.)
Delaware lawmakers last week passed legislation to make it more difficult for small investors to challenge decisions made by controllers or powerful shareholders. Opponents called it “a billionaire’s bill.”
Nevada, while it does not have nearly as extensive a corporate law history as Delaware, does have an established statutory environment, according to Edwards, and is already seen as a business friendly state for incorporating.
TripAdvisor, which is moving its incorporation from Delaware to Nevada, has acknowledged in filings the legal appeal in Nevada. Specifically, company leadership says it has more protections from legal liability in Nevada than it does in Delaware.
Aguilar as secretary of state, with assistance from Edwards, filed an amicus brief in the TripAdvisor case.
Aguilar says lawyers in that case were attempting to paint Nevada as the “wild wild west” where laws can’t be trusted and aren’t sophisticated enough. Delaware Gov. Matt Meyer publicly said companies that relocate to Nevada are “rolling the dice.”
“It’s not the wild wild west,” Aguilar told the Current. “There is accountability. There are measures to do what is best for shareholders.”
For large corporations, especially publicly traded ones, where to incorporate is a highly complicated decision made in consultation with an army of attorneys, Aguilar continued.
“All the law firms are aware of Nevada. Those movements (like TripAdvisor) are starting to come because attorneys are saying Nevada is sophisticated and does a good job.”
Other companies reportedly considering leaving Delaware include Dropbox and Meta, the parent company of Facebook.
Dalia, a freshman assemblymember, is employed by Meta as lead privacy and product counsel. He told the Current his work “generally centers on enforcement against bad actors using Meta products and Federal Trade Commission compliance” and is “completely unrelated” to the resolution he is sponsoring.
“AJR8 comes out of my earlier legal career advising investors and startups in Silicon Valley, where I saw first-hand how Delaware profited massively from its Court of Chancery,” he added.
That sentiment has been echoed by other supporters of the resolution.
Jeff Saling, co-founder of the nonprofit business incubator StartUpNV and venture capital fund Sierra Angels, jokingly told lawmakers during support testimony of AJR8’s hearing that he is “part of the problem.”
“When founders come to me to ask where to incorporate, I have to say Delaware,” he said. “Whether or not they’ll be able to get funding depends on whether they have a Delaware C corp.”
 Nevada Court of Chancery?

What exactly the dedicated business court greenlit by AJR8 would look like would be decided in a future legislative session, presumably in 2029, the session after voter approval.
Lawmakers on the Assembly Judiciary Committee, noting that Nevada’s existing court system is already strained, raised questions about how a dedicated business court would be funded.
Edwards told lawmakers he believes the additional costs of running a business court would be offset by court filing fees and additional revenue from business recordings, but that the Legislature would ultimately have to decide its structure.
Democratic Assemblymember Selena La Rue Hatch pointed out there are incarcerated people who have been waiting “for years and years” in the court system.
“Can you explain why we are jumping business ahead of our constituents’ needs?” she asked.
Edwards and Dalia argued that a dedicated business court could free up the non-business judges to more expeditiously handle civil and criminal cases, benefitting the judicial system overall. They also expressed their support of additional resources for other aspects of the court system.
Edwards said a large public corporation could close a deal in Delaware in 90 days, but in Nevada could be on hold for years because the average adjudication time for business cases is currently around 1,200 days.
“That’s a real barrier in terms of selecting Nevada,” he added.
Another potential hangup is that AJR8 proposes business court judges be appointed for 6-year terms by the governor from a list of three nominees vetted by a special nominating commission. That’s different from Nevada’s current status quo of electing all judges.
Dalia said that elected benches offer no guarantee that the judge will be an expert or even familiar with business law, creating an efficiency that would be seen unfavorably by businesses and result in longer timelines for cases. He added that, unlike criminal and civil law, business law is not part of the standard curriculum at law school.
In Delaware, judges are appointed for 12-year terms and there is a rigorous process to ensure competence and expertise, said Edwards.
Texas, which is also making a push to establish a business court, is contemplating judges appointed to 2-year terms by the governor. Edwards told the Current that structure could be problematic, especially if Texas were to ever become a swing state as people have long predicted.
“If you’re sued in Texas and politically connected and you don’t like the judge, you can just stall and wait until a new governor can appoint a new judge,” he added.
AJR8’s proposal is more like Delaware than Texas. Edward believes it would be more stable because the special nominating commission would be a mix of lawmakers (the assembly speaker and senate majority leader) and judicial officials (the chief justice of the state supreme court and chief judges of the state’s three most populous district courts).
The Assembly Judiciary Committee took no action on the resolution during its March 3 hearing. On March 25, AJR8 was withdrawn from the committee and placed on the Chief Clerk’s desk. That is typically not a positive sign for a bill or resolution. But proponents are still making the case for why Nevada should try.
“We’re in a period where there’s a lot of discussion around this shift” in corporate law, said Edwards. “It’s my view that Nevada should do things that make sense. You can create infrastructure that will pay for itself and also make things more efficient and draw in more revenue.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/court-money-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-03-31 09:02:09.885696

American Indian and Alaska Native tribes are fighting for equal governance and sovereignty over their own health data. (Kris Hanning/University of Arizona)When Stephanie Russo Carroll, a citizen of the Native Village of Kluti-Kaah in Alaska, set out to earn her doctorate in tribal health 15 years ago, she focused her research on tribal cultural and health programs within six tribes.
She needed vital statistics data, such as birth and death rates, for each of them. But getting that data from the state, which houses vital statistics, was difficult — and in some cases, the data she needed was missing.
“Health outcomes data were unobtainable,” Carroll recalled. In one case, her team had to try using breastfeeding rates as a proxy to estimate birth rates. But even getting those for all six tribes was impossible.
For the next two decades, Carroll would continue to push for U.S. tribes — which are sovereign nations — to own and maintain control over their data, including health statistics.
The concept, known as data sovereignty, is important amid the harrowing health disparities seen in tribal people, rooted in forced assimilation dating back more than a century. Often, data gathered by and about tribes has been shared with state and federal agencies; but those same agencies haven’t always shared their tribal-related statistics in return.
The reasons vary, from systemic issues within the health care system to mistaken assumptions by some federal officials about what data be securely sent to tribes without risking privacy violations.
Lackluster investigations may perpetuate high Native infant mortality rate

The lack of tribe-specific data has hindered tribes from fully taking care of their members and clouded their work on public health responses to disease outbreaks such as syphilis and COVID-19, on maternal and infant health outcomes, and on chronic issues such as diabetes, heart disease and substance use.
Data sovereignty is especially relevant now, as the Trump administration scrubs federal health websites of data that recognizes and tracks metrics among the country’s various racial and ethnic groups, including what little data there is on tribal members.
States govern their own health data systems. But the same isn’t true for the nation’s 574 federally recognized tribes.
Now an associate professor of public health at the University of Arizona, Carroll co-founded the U.S. Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network and directs the Collaboratory for Indigenous Data Governance. Both are groups that work to research and strengthen Indigenous data governance, accuracy and data-driven policy.
“If you don’t know who has been sick or hospitalized,” Carroll said, “how can you make sure you have the right care systems for your community?”
Withholding tribes’ data
As part of its slashing of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, the Trump administration removed numerous racial, ethnic, adolescent and maternal health datasets from the websites of several federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While some of the data has been reinstated, the swift deletions raised alarms in tribal communities.
Abigail Echo-Hawk, a member of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma and director of the Urban Indian Health Institute, said the youth behavioral risk surveys were reinstated, but were missing key race and ethnicity search features that tribes use to track mental health conditions in American Indian and Alaska Native teens.
“Now, we can’t search, disaggregate by Native youth,” she said. “That information is about our children, and it is the legal right of both now the tribal epidemiology centers and the tribes to have access to that previously gathered information.”

Despite their public health authority, tribes and tribal epidemiology centers, which support tribes with health data tracking, say federal and state health officials have long withheld or denied requests to direct access of health data related to their tribes, including coronavirus data during the pandemic.
Such data is tied to treaty rights obligations and shouldn’t be lumped together with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently under attack by the Trump administration, Echo-Hawk said.
“Our treaty rights are tied to having information around tribal people. So, if you’re going to uphold our treaty rights, you need to say: ‘This number of Native people are experiencing this issue,’ or ‘This number of Native people exist,’” she said.
It wasn’t until 2021 that the CDC conducted its first comprehensive life expectancy profile of American Indians and Alaska Natives; it showed that in 2019, their life expectancy was seven years lower than that of white people.
“All of the data is a story. It’s a grandmother, it’s a son, it’s a story of a community’s well-being,” Echo-Hawk said.
When tribes receive federal grants — whether for transportation, housing or education initiatives — there are grant reporting requirements.
 










All of data is a story. It's a grandmother, it's a son, it's a story of a community's well-being.


– Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the Urban Indian Public Health Institute




Under those rules, tribes send raw data to federal agencies, but they often don’t get that data back, said social demographer Desi Small-Rodriguez, an assistant professor of sociology and American Indian studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, who co-founded the data sovereignty network with Carroll.
“It’s a one-way data highway coming from tribal governments — leaving tribal governments and going into the feds — and it’s not coming back,” said Small-Rodriguez. She also directs the Data Warriors Lab, working with tribes — including her own Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Montana — to develop legal mechanisms to ensure data ownership.
She said the federal government should provide funding, as part of its treaty obligations, to pay for expensive data support such as secure storage systems, high-performance computers and analytics staff.
“As part of our treaty rights, we have a right to health care and education. We have a right to clean water and air — and data form the basis for all of that,” she said.
State data agreements
In January, the Tulalip Tribes in northwest Washington state secured a data-sharing agreement with the state department of health. It gives the tribes access to the state’s disease reporting system, allowing them to extract some data directly. Tulalip plans to eventually secure access to more datasets.
It’s the first agreement of its kind in the state, said Summer Hammons, legislative policy analyst in the Treaty Rights and Governmental Affairs Department of the Tulalip Tribes, which has at least 5,000 members. Hammons grew up on the reservation.
She hopes it will help the tribe direct resources and funds where they’re needed — whether it’s more cancer screenings or vaccinations against diseases such as measles, as other states grapple with outbreaks of the virus.
“It allows us to collaborate and lead on outbreak investigations related to tribal members,” Hammons said. “It’s a clear outline that tribes own their data in partnership with the state, because the state’s the one that’s collecting it. But we want to tell our story, and we want to be able to work with DOH [department of health] to be mindful of our stories and to also get better access to the statistics.”
For Indian Country, federal cuts decimate core tribal programs

A few other states — Alaska, Arizona, Oregon and South Dakota — also have limited-scope agreements with tribes.
Gary Ferguson, Unangax (Aleut), is the director of integrative medicine at Tulalip Health Clinic. He said he hopes the data will help the tribe track health care interventions over time.
“We don’t know what’s working. We don’t know what’s not working,” he said. “We want to celebrate our wins.”
Tracking disease
In recent years, the nation has seen alarming surges in congenital syphilis, a preventable infection passed through pregnancy to newborns. Nearly 40% can be stillborn or die as a newborn. Babies can also suffer lifelong blindness or deafness. Tribal babies suffer the highest rate.
Officials at the Great Plains Tribal Epidemiology Center, which tracks tribal public health across four states, were denied syphilis data from local public health departments for years until the group leaned on the CDC for assistance.
It wasn’t until then that, finally, last year, one state — South Dakota — agreed to share American Indian and Alaska Native syphilis cases as soon as they’re reported, said Sarah Shewbrooks, the group’s lead tribal epidemiologist.
Shewbrooks hopes the access in South Dakota will pave the way for more agreements in the other Great Plains states.
‘We needed this yesterday’
During COVID-19, American Indian and Alaska Native people were more likely to be infected and compared with white people, had double the risk of in-hospital death and three times the rate of severe infection, research shows. Yet even then, data weren’t telling the whole story.
Echo-Hawk’s organization published a report card in 2021 that scored each state’s collection of Natives’ COVID-19 cases. In total, the nation averaged a D+. This year, she published a follow-up for epidemiologists on addressing the misclassification of Native people, who often are listed as “white” or “Hispanic” in health settings and death certificates. Many states also inconsistently or don’t report tribal affiliation on death certificates, which can make tribe-specific death rates elusive.
A report in 2021 from the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office found that some officials from the CDC and the Indian Health Services agency didn’t recognize that they were required by law to share data with tribal epidemiology centers, the centers told investigators.
In the GAO report, investigators detailed logistical barriers, including federal agencies’ reluctance to share COVID-19 data because of concerns around privacy and security in data transmission.
“This is one of the best examples of what structural racism looks like,” said Shewbrooks. “Because when you look at the infrastructure for public health systems and public health data, tribes and [tribal epidemiology centers] were never included in that infrastructure.
“COVID really put it up there as: No, we needed this yesterday.”
Shewbrooks said that as part of her work she’d go to funeral directors, who may fill out death certificates, throughout the region to educate them on proper classification of American Indian people. “I even had one say to me once, ‘I just always code them by how they look. I never ask what their race is.’”
“A lot of them didn’t know that this is data that gets really used,” she said. “Vital records data is just super important, foundational work in a lot of epidemiological work.”

There is no national standard for tribal health data, explained Cheryl Ellenwood, who is a citizen of the Nez Perce Nation and also Diné (Navajo).
Ellenwood, an assistant professor in Washington State University’s School of Politics, Philosophy and Public Affairs, experienced firsthand the data disconnect when both her parents died of COVID-19.
Four years ago this month, her mother, Annie Benally Ellenwood, an enrolled Navajo tribal member from New Mexico, died at age 71 in a hospital in Idaho. Annie Ellenwood’s death, however, wouldn’t show up in primary statistics of COVID-19 deaths in Navajo people — her tribe isn’t listed on her death certificate.
“I was very hurt by this, because my mother died because of COVID-19, and I wanted her death to count and mean something,” Ellenwood said.
“It still feels very life and death, like we are fighting to demonstrate the impact of so many things on our people,” she said.

Patrick Morrisey signed a bill into law that will ban food containing some artificial food dyes from being sold in West Virginia starting on Jan. 1, 2028. (Photo by Leann Ray/West Virginia Watch)West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed a bill that will ban a list of artificial food dyes from being included in food items sold in grocery stores or in school lunches.
Republican lawmakers behind the measure have said the synthetic red, blue, green and yellow dyes are unnecessary and harmful. They’ve linked them to behavioral issues in children.
“West Virginia ranks at the bottom of many public health metrics, which is why there’s no better place to lead the ‘Make America Healthy Again’ mission,” Morrisey said March 25. “By eliminating harmful chemicals from our food, we’re taking steps toward improving the health of our residents and protecting our children from significant long-term health and learning challenges.”
Several states are considering similar legislation, and West Virginia is the first state to pass a sweeping synthetic food dye ban from grocery stores and school cafeterias.
House Bill 2354 bans the use of seven artificial dyes — Red No. 3, Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5, Yellow No. 6, Blue No. 1, Blue No. 2 and Green No. 3 — in school meals beginning Aug 1. That will take effect much sooner than the federal ban on Red No. 3 and California’s ban of the other dyes.
The dyes would be prohibited along with the preservatives butylated hydroxyanisole and propylparaben, in drugs and food items for sale in the state beginning Jan. 1, 2028.
“This extended deadline allows companies ample time to adjust, protecting consumers from price increases,” a news release from the governor’s office said.
The state’s food and beverage industry pushed back on the measure, warning that it would lead to increased grocery prices and empty shelves. Alternative ingredients don’t exist to scale, they said. 
Del. Evan Worrell, R-Cabell, maintained that the food industry was using “scare tactics” to fight the bill.
“While there are many steps to take to improve our health outcomes, this bill starts by not allowing manufacturers to choose ‘poison for profit’ in our food supply,” he said. “I applaud the governor for signing the food dye bill into law. The governor believes in the [Make America Healthy Again] movement as I do and we are taking steps to improve the quality of health in West Virginia.”
Last September, California became the first state in the nation to ban food dyes from school meals, snacks and drinks. Titled the California School Food Safety Act, the law takes effect Dec. 31, 2027.
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has told food executives that removing artificial food dyes is an urgent priority.
In January, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that Red No. 3 would be banned from food starting January 2027 and from drugs in January 2028. The Jan. 15 order came one week before President Donald Trump’s inauguration and two weeks before Kennedy’s confirmation hearings in the U.S. Senate. The questioning included dyes and their use in U.S. foods.
“Thank you to the Legislature, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the entire Trump Administration for helping us launch this movement right here in West Virginia,” Morrisey said.

Democrats have introduced a bill to make an income tax exemption on overtime pay permanent. (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Democrats in the Alabama House of Representatives have introduced a bill to preserve an income tax exemption on overtime pay that Republicans plan to jettison to pay for a tax cut package that includes a grocery tax reduction.
HB 467, sponsored by House Minority Leader Anthony Daniels, D-Huntsville, would remove a June expiration date from the tax break, approved in 2023, and create a commission to study its economic impact.
“These are hardworking Alabamians that are putting into our economy,” Daniels said at a press conference last week. “These are not handouts. These are dollars that they are earning.”
When approved, the tax break was estimated to cost the Education Trust Fund budget $34 million. But the Alabama Department of Revenue says that the exemption has reduced revenue to the ETF by about $230 million.
Republicans, who hold supermajorities in both chambers of the Legislature, have signaled since late last year that they planned to let the exemption lapse. Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, told media in December that the impact to the ETF could be almost $350 million before the exemption is set to expire.
House Republicans last week approved four bills that would cut taxes by $191 million.
The bills include legislation to increase the tax exemption for retirement income and increase the income tax thresholds, along with deductions and child tax credits for households who earn less than $120,000 annually.
Another bill would reduce the state grocery tax from 3% to 2% while also allowing but not requiring cities and counties to reduce their local grocery taxes.
Garrett told his colleagues in the House that reducing taxes on groceries is possible only if the tax break on overtime wages is discontinued.
All the tax breaks that legislators are considering reduce revenues to the ETF. Daniels said letting the overtime tax exemption expire would be a burden.
“We are increasing the taxes of hardworking Alabamians by about $230 million,” he said.
Daniels’ bill retains most of the language regarding the overtime tax exemption that is currently in state statute. The most significant change removes the section in the code that set time limits for the tax break, which was from October 2024 to June this year.
The legislation to exempt wages earned while working overtime was filed as the Republican budget chairs balked at how much the tax break has revenues directed toward the Educational Trust Fund budget.
More than a dozen other House Democrats have signed onto the bill as cosponsors, and Daniels said his proposal has received bipartisan support, including the Alabama Policy Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank that focuses on issues within the state.
The Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank based in Washington D.C.,, has publicly opposed Daniels’ proposal, arguing that it could benefit highly paid professionals and encourage employers to shift employees to hourly work without paying additional compensation.
According to a blog post, an employer could shift a person earning $50,000 and working 60 hours a week. The employer could offer $13.75 per hour to the same employee and have them work overtime. That would earn the worker an additional $4,000 after taxes without the employer having to pay the worker additional compensation.
“It creates a tax loophole that is ripe for abuse and, even if it could lead to some workers taking home higher after tax income when they work overtime, it does nothing to stop overwork of employees and it just lets employers off the hook when they are asking workers to work excessive hours,” said David Cooper, director of state policy and research at the EPI.
The exemption could also benefit highly paid hourly wage workers, white collar hourly employees such as attorneys or physicians. An example in the post considers a hypothetical CEO who earns a $4,000 hourly wage who then works more than the standard 40 hours, who would then earn even more because of the overtime tax exemption.
But the magnitude of that issue in Alabama is unclear.
“Unfortunately, the information is not reported to the Department by the income range of the person,” wrote Kirk Fulford, deputy director of the Legislative Services Agency Fiscal Division in an emailed statement. “We have no way of knowing that.”
Despite that, Daniels and other Democrats urge their colleagues to consider the overtime tax exemption to the list of proposals.
“It is giving hardworking Alabamians an opportunity to take more of their money home,” Daniels said. “But the dollars that this is returning, that is returning to our economy, is more than paying for itself.”

(Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)By middle school, we’re all taught that the word “democracy” combines “demos,” the Greek word for people, with “kratos,” meaning rule.
Rule of the people.
That doesn’t describe the government we live under.
Alabamians say they want Medicaid expansion. They don’t seem keen on the state’s effective abortion ban. If you let Alabama voters decide whether the state should have a lottery, odds are that it would pass, and it wouldn’t be close.
None of those initiatives will pass the Legislature anytime soon. State government rests on gerrymandered districts that give party extremists a loud voice in elections. It’s also highly centralized, with state lawmakers handling issues that in other states would be city or county matters. It doubles the influence of special interests. Lawmakers fear the judgment of lobbyists more than the verdicts of voters.
Now look over to the federal side.
It seems reasonable to think that most Alabamians don’t want to make food, clothing or other goods more expensive, as President Donald Trump is doing with his tariffs. Especially when raising the price of imports from Mexico will jack up costs for the state’s automotive industry, a large employer our state leaders allegedly revere (though they seem to despise auto workers getting fresh about pay and overtime).
Or look at farmers. Prices for corn and soybeans, among Alabama’s leading agricultural products, fell 10% after Trump announced his tariffs. And is there a constituency for wiping out healthy food choices for school children?
Then there are the dedicated public servants getting thrown out of work for capricious reasons.
How are our federal representatives handling all this?
Democratic Reps. Terri Sewell and Shomari Figures have gone on record opposing the tariffs. But what about the Republicans who make up 78% of Alabama’s congressional voice?
Rep. Barry Moore likes imports. Specifically, making it easier to import firearms into a state suffering from nation-leading rates of gun violence. But he’s also said he supports tariffs on cars, claiming they will bring jobs back. Which is not how the industry sees this playing out. (Hyundai announced $21 billion in auto manufacturing projects to let Trump think it was a response to his tariffs. In fact, most of that reflects investments made before the trade announcements.)
Rep. Robert Aderholt also supports tariffs. He cheered them as protecting steel and aluminum manufacturing. There were fewer than 1,300 steelworkers in Alabama in 2022. There were nearly 59,000 people working retail sales, who are about to find their jobs a lot more difficult.
Sen. Tommy Tuberville calls Trump, who can’t commit to a single tariff approach, a “master negotiator” and claims tariffs will only bring “a little bit of pain.” Something — he didn’t say what — would be “much much worse” without them.
Sen. Katie Britt calls tariffs a “bargaining chip” with other countries. And if Trump throws Alabama jobs into the pot, she appears to be OK with that.
Rep. Dale Strong is too busy venting about something he heard on NPR to defend the 28,000 men and women in his district at risk of losing their jobs under this administration.
U.S. Reps. Mike Rogers of Saks and Gary Palmer of Hoover haven’t said anything, as far as I can tell. It’s a far cry from 2015, when they were screaming about government overreach after President Barack Obama proposed a plan to cut carbon emissions and let the states figure out how to get there.
In short, our congressional delegation is full of cheerleaders shaking the pom-poms for Team Red as their quarterback leaves the field to set the stands on fire. With you in them.
Alabama leaders neither listen to nor fear the voice of the people. The state has a long history of sending Babbitts and backbenchers to Congress, people less interested in showing leadership than collecting the perks of office and doing what they’re told.
That’s perfect for Trump. Most of our representatives seem happy to be limbs of the president. If that means kicking the state they represent — well, look, that’s what they were told to do. Don’t expect an appendage to talk back.
These tariffs threaten the state economy. And our congressional delegation, for the most part, is vigorously applauding.
That’s not democracy.  We need another Greek word to describe this.
Deilos, according to this biblical website, means “cowardly, timid, or fearful.”
A deilocracy. Rule by cowards.
A system that limits voters’ practical choices means that Alabama politics produce sycophants, not leaders. We get officials who don’t fear voters. And representatives who tell you that losing your job and paying more for groceries is worth it because Trump’s will is all that matters.
It would be nice to see more backbone. More advocacy for the people of the state.
But that’s not the system we live in. That’s democracy.
Deilocracy means we have leaders content to turn Alabama into the president’s doormat.

The Alabama Senate approved SB 200 on March 18. The House approved HB 360 on March 19. Both bills have moved to the opposite chambers for consideration.  States throughout the country have been increasingly using diversion programs for defendants who committed offenses that stem from an underlying issue, such as drug addiction.
Supporters say diversion programs reduce both court and incarceration expenses, as as expenses connected to treatment programs.
Judges can order people to enter diversion programs in collaboration with prosecutors and treatment providers. Courts are also able to offer accountability to ensure defendants are complying with the conditions of the program and track the progress of defendants. Once defendants complete the rehabilitation program, the record for that offense is expunged and removed from their criminal records.
Pretrial diversion programs are effective. And expensive for participants.

Court proceedings will resume oftentimes if a person is unable to complete the treatment program or adhere to the conditions outlined by the judge. Under the bills, district attorneys may also remove people from diversion programs for a good reason.
“Right now, statutorily wise, the only courts that are set up by state statute are drug courts,” said Casey Bates, chief of staff for Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Sarah Stewart who is helping to craft the legislation. “A number of different counties have set up mental health courts or veterans courts.”
Many times, diversion programs are not available to people unless they reside in an area that offers one they qualify for.
“We wanted to have a framework in place that is going to address any type of court that will be helpful,” Bates said. “Our goal is to keep people from offending again. We don’t want to send them to prison and then have them come back and reoffend. By setting up the accountability court, that is going to be the umbrella for any of the types of courts that are necessary.”
The bills require the Administrative Office of the Courts to establish a process and set policies  governing diversion programs.
The bills were amended as they went through the legislative process to allow courts to accept people referred by municipal courts within their jurisdiction and any contractor that is part of the program must be certified by the Alabama Department of Mental Health.

(Arielle Robinson / Verite News)NEW ORLEANS – Seven Tulane University students who participated in a protest demanding the release of pro-Palestine activist Mahmoud Khalil from immigration detention could face consequences from school administrators.
The students are alleged to have committed conduct violations and face a series of administrative hearings, students and their supporters said at a news conference last week.
They believe Tulane administrators are targeting them after a March 11 protest that was held off-campus near Tulane and Loyola University, where activists called on the schools to not cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and to make the schools sanctuaries for immigrant students, faculty and staff. The calls came after Khalil, a pro-Palestine protester and former Columbia University student, was arrested at his university apartment and sent to Jena, Louisiana, to await deportation.
“[Tulane] will suppress anyone who dares to exercise their First Amendment right to condemn them,” Tulane student Cameron McLaren said at the press conference.

This latest crop of disciplinary measures from Tulane is part of a nationwide wave of discipline that student activists have been met with for their pro-Palestine activism. Student organizers from Tulane and Loyola still face discipline, including semester-long suspensions, from the encampment or other pro-Palestine-related activism.
According to emails sent to two of those students and reviewed by Verite News, Tulane investigators contend that the students are associated with a group called Tulane Students for a Democratic Society. The group was suspended as a student organization by the university last year over a different unauthorized pro-Palestine protest and is currently forbidden from operating on campus.
The group, which now calls itself Together United Students for a Democratic Society, said in response in an Instagram post that the university is repressing students who are exercising their right to freedom of speech. The group now operates off-campus under a different name, though it continues to use a logo in university colors that is identical to the one it used when it was recognized by the university.
University spokesperson Michael Strecker declined to comment on the individual student conduct charges, noting that the code of conduct applies to student actions on and off campus.
“We fundamentally respect the right to protest,” Strecker said. “However, students may be held accountable for behavior if it violates university conduct policies.”
The students deny the university’s accusations, pointing out that the group has changed its name, met off-campus and didn’t hold the March 11 protest on school property.
Atticus Pratt, one of the students involved, is facing a probe called a “major matter investigation” that could lead to suspension or expulsion. Pratt said they had faced conduct charges before for their activism.
“They want to suspend students so we can’t go on campus and we can’t organize,” Pratt told Verite News. “They want to scare us out of continuing to organize. They want to make other people known that there will be consequences for joining an organization like SDS, or for attending an off-campus protest.”
Adelaide Ritzman, another student facing conduct charges, said they believe the university is violating the First Amendment rights of students who participate in such protests.
“Tulane is trying to figure out who they can scapegoat and who they can kind of make an example of,” Ritzman said.
New Orleans-area First Amendment attorney William Most, whose law firm has been involved in some of the legal matters surrounding protests at Tulane, agrees.
“Tulane may have violated federal law in its drastically harsher treatment of pro-Palestine students as compared to other students for comparable conduct,” Most said in statement to Verite News. “And [Tulane’s police department] in particular may have violated the First Amendment in its crackdown on students based on the content of their speech.”
As the Trump administration targets immigrant students and diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in higher education, some Tulane students say the school is cracking down on student speech beyond just protests.
McLaren, another one of the seven students facing discipline, said she was arrested and briefly detained earlier this month after briefly leaving her backpack unattended in the Lavin-Bernick Center for University Life, which resulted in the evacuation of the building.
McLaren spoke up at the press conference publicizing the disciplinary allegations. She said she was walking around campus with a sign on her backpack that criticized the university’s decision to get rid of its diversity, equity and inclusion office and encouraged people not to attend Tulane because of it.
The note read: “Tulane just got rid of DEI…if you have the means, go elsewhere,” according to the Tulane Hullabaloo.
Strecker said McLaren was neither arrested nor charged.
According to Strecker, Tulane police were made aware of an abandoned backpack that had a note attached to it left on the Lavin-Bernick Center’s second floor. The university said the building was quickly evacuated due to safety concerns. University police immediately responded, investigated the event and eventually found that the backpack posed no threat and normal operations resumed after the location was deemed safe, the spokesperson said.
Tulane crime logs show that a “suspicious package” was reported in the building and that the case was closed with no further action being taken. The same website says that this term means that no further investigative action is needed.
McLaren declined further interview requests, but said in an email to Verite News that her “arrest and conduct charges are clearly politically motivated. I did not break any laws nor did I violate any conduct rules.”

Bello described wage theft, discrimination, threats to her and her family, withheld documents, and being unfairly fired. But, as a single mother, she said she’s had no choice but to keep working and endure these conditions to provide for her family. 
“It’s difficult to talk about this,” she said in Spanish, taking a deep sigh. 
When Bello started out as a housekeeper about four years ago, she said she worked independently and lived in the house where she was employed, an experience she described as isolating. Bello worked from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., seven days a week, and said she was not allowed to spend time with her family. She also said she was never paid because her employers claimed to use her salary to cover her room and board. 
Bello then worked for a cleaning company where she said she continued to face abuse, like working from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m. for a low fixed pay rate and with a lack of access to meals and breaks. Despite these conditions, she said it was an improvement from her previous job. However, when she raised some concerns to her employer, Bello said she was fired. 
“I was unaware of everything, I was unaware of minimum wage, unaware of what I should have been making,” Bello said. 
To address situations like this and other mistreatment domestic workers can face, Sen. Rebecca Saldaña, D-Seattle, introduced Senate Bill 5023, which would allow workers such as nannies, housekeepers, and gardeners to have access to minimum wage and overtime, workers’ compensation, meal and rest breaks, and written work agreements and terminations. 
“I feel like this work is what allows all the rest of us to be able to go to work,” Saldaña said. “[This bill] is making sure that the people that take care of our homes and our families and our children are also able to provide for themselves as well.” 
As it stands, the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act, a federal law, excludes domestic, farm, and hospitality workers. Their labor has been devalued because the majority of these workers were people of color, immigrants, and women, said Danielle Alvarado, executive director of Fair Works Center. 
“When you have really entrenched ideas about ‘Is the work important? Is it really work?’ it’s part of how you can end up in a situation where mistreating certain workers and not giving them the same respect that you would give other workers can become normalized,” Alvarado said. 
In 2018, Seattle became the first city in the country to adopt legislation that’s similar to the bill now pending in the Legislature. It was implemented in late 2019. Months later, the pandemic hit and further complicated conditions for domestic workers. 
Alvarado said that the rollout of the Seattle law has helped inform the state bill. Though Bello works in Seattle, she said she previously did not know about the protections in the city law. 
The biggest difference in the state legislation compared to the Seattle policy is that it allows workers to retain personal effects such as legal documents and requires employers to create a written contract with workers. These provisions were added in response to input from workers who said they lacked evidence when verbal agreements weren’t met. 
The bill would also allow workers to file a retaliation claim against their employer with the Department of Labor and Industries. The agency could impose civil penalties up to $1,000 for each employer violation. 
Democrats in the Senate passed the bill on a 29-20 vote earlier this month, with one Democrat joining Republicans in opposition. If it receives final approval this year, the new protections for workers would take effect July 1, 2026.
Republicans argue that domestic workers are independent contractors who can set their own wages and hours and that the added requirements would create a burden for those hiring the workers.
“If we have all of this bureaucratic red tape that we have to go through, what kind of pressure would that put on others to hire?” said Sen. Perry Dozier, R-Waitsburg, in a floor speech.
Bello ​​takes pride in doing her job. “It’s something beautiful, it’s something that has helped me develop new skills such as being creative and organizing,” she said. 
She hopes others value domestic workers and acknowledge the rights they have both as workers and human beings. 
“We shouldn’t have to get to the point of abuse for our voice to matter, we shouldn’t have to get to the point where something scars us for the rest of our lives for our voice to matter,” Bello said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/housekeeper-cleaning-windows-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-31 08:09:21.348631

Not all 20-odd million of us, of course: We tend to be politically soporific, occasionally becoming passionate over potholes or maybe a too-short grouper fishing season, but preferring to keep reality at arm’s length. 
Still, something is changing. People are angry, auto-calling their representatives, making signs, demonstrating and showing up at town halls.
  U.S. Rep. Neal Dunn via U.S. House
MAGAs will tell you these are nothing but a bunch of disgruntled Democrats, but I’ll bet cash money a good number of those veterans protesting silently outside Tallahassee City Hall last week usually vote Republican. 
And I’ll bet a decent number, frightened and frustrated over President Musk’s scorched-earth attacks on the Department of Education, NOAA, USAID, etc. (it’s a terrifyingly long list), didn’t vote at all in 2024.
I overheard a couple of them talking about it during a recent town hall in Tallahassee. They both said they didn’t like either candidate: Harris was too pro-Israel, Trump was good at business (highly debatable) but a terrible person, and until now they never really thought it mattered who got elected.
Now they know.
The town hall was organized by the Democratic Party of Leon County, hoping to get our congressman to come and talk to us, his constituents. 
Rep. Neal Dunn was invited. He never even responded. He certainly didn’t show up.
Republicans don’t show up, not any more.
They don’t like getting booed. They don’t like facing outraged citizens.
A few tried holding town halls. Did not go well. But hey, at least they actually held town halls. Nobody’s seen hide nor hair of Florida Republicans. 
Maybe they’re huddled together in an undisclosed location. 
I doubt anyone expected to see either of our senators: Ashley Moody remains a MAGA acolyte, while Rick Scott held a telephone town hall once, but that was back during the pandemic.
Invisibility
Lawmaker invisibility hasn’t stopped constituents from arranging meetings and imploring these politicians — who allegedly work for them — to come and listen. 
Tampa Bay voters put on a town hall in Clearwater on March 15 in Rep. Anna Paulina Luna’s district.
  Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, via U.S. House
She was, unsurprisingly, absent. Undeterred, a large crowd addressed a cut-out of her.
Some told the cardboard Luna they feared DOGE would wreck Social Security.
One lady, whose husband was fired from the U.S. Geological Survey in DOGE’s senseless purges, said, “I’ve called and I have emailed and heard nothing from you.”
Maybe Luna’s too busy lobbying to carve Trump’s face on Mt. Rushmore.
Luna doesn’t support Ukraine, and pitched a little hissy fit when Democrats waved the blue and yellow flag in the House, snapping, “Put those damn flags away!” 
But by God, she’s determined to get to the bottom of the great JFK assassination cover-up, demanding the doctors who treated JFK in Dallas and members of the Warren Commission who investigated it appear before Congress. 
Unfortunately for her and for the CIA/Cuba/KGB/Space Aliens conspiracy theorists, all those people are quite dead. 
No-show
Neal Dunn, last week’s no-show, is a urologist from Panama City and is, like Luna, one of the state’s least impressive members of Congress.  
He’s done absolutely nothing of note, unless you count his proposed resolution to “Protect American Businesses from Onerous Refrigeration Regulations.”
You’d think he might have bothered to attend a room of 500+ voters, eager to hear from him. 
It wouldn’t have been much of an inconvenience, either: According to his website, he was in Tallahassee that morning, hosting an event for young people who might want to attend one of the service academies. 
That event ended at 11 a.m.; the town hall started at 11 a.m.; the distance from City Hall to the American Legion Hall is 1.8 miles.
It would have taken him a solid five or six minutes to drive there.
Concerns
The standing-room-only audience created a list of what they’d like to talk about: the unelected Musk, DOGE’s trashing of government services, Ukraine, health care, reproductive rights, our endangered planet, our endangered entitlement programs, and our endangered democracy. 
A panel of worthies, including a county commissioner, a city commissioner, legendary activist Karen Woodall, and former Democratic congressman Alan Boyd, tried to address people’s issues. 
It wasn’t smooth sailing.   
Many were thoroughly annoyed with the good souls on the panel as well as the minority party in Washington. 
Democrats are good at lamenting, hand-wringing, and doom-predicting — all reasonable responses to the atrocities visited upon the country by President Musk and his henchpersons.
They just don’t seem to have much in the way of answers.
One guy stood up and yelled, “What’s the solution? I think we know the problem!”
Attack on universities
Sentient Americans understand the United States is being dismantled, hurled into a Dumpster, and set on fire. 
Rep. Dunn’s district contains six institutions of higher education. All receive federal funds. 
If DOGE gets its way and slashes the budgets of the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, what will become of research at FSU, FAMU, and other colleges and universities? 
FSU alone could lose $65 million. 
That would be a direct hit on the College of Medicine, all the science departments, and the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory — the largest and most important magnet lab in the world. 
It conducts experiments in (among other things) superconductivity, critical to efficient and sustainable energy sources. 
If that money goes away, it won’t just be scientific research that suffers: There will be a knock-on effect, harming the whole university. 
The best professors will leave; the best students won’t enroll; lots of people will be laid off.
What will happen to the hundreds of federal jobs at Tyndall Air Force Base at the western end of Rep. Dunn’s territory? How about the USDA Farm Service office in Madison at the eastern end?
Florida is home to 100,000 federal employees, most of them represented by Republicans. 
How about DOGE’s decimating NOAA and the National Weather Service? Florida’s entire Democratic congressional delegation warned that this was a Very Bad Idea.
No Republicans signed onto their letter.
Remember Michael?
Maybe Dunn thinks Florida doesn’t need hurricane forecasters; maybe he’s forgotten what Hurricane Michael did to his district in 2018. 
Without NWS it would have been even worse.
  Hurricane Michael, a Cat 5 storm fueled by the excessive warmth of the Gulf, destroyed much of Tyndall AFB in Panama City. (Photo via the Florida Air National Guard)
What would Dunn — or any of Florida’s senators and representatives— say to the 400 statewide who’ve lost their jobs with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service? Or the untold numbers who’ll soon be sacked by the Veterans Administration?
Dunn is a veteran himself, but he’s pretty offhand about their concerns. It’s only 20 “in the region” (whatever than means — VA jobs, maybe?
“This is not a massacre,” he said.
Maybe not to him, but the veterans protesting outside his recent event at Gulf Coast State College weren’t impressed: “There’s nowhere in the Constitution that what is going on with DOGE and Elon Musk is appropriate,” one told WJHG TV.
That’s putting it mildly.
But the Constitution doesn’t seem to matter to DOGE, President Musk, Trump, or the Republican-controlled Congress.
Maybe it will mean something to the Supreme Court.
What do you say, Rep. Dunn?

Transparency and accountability are the answer.
The Employer Price Transparency Study – Round 5, conducted by RAND, has consistently  shown that Indiana’s hospital prices are among the highest in the nation, ranking 8th overall. Hoosier employers and employees are paying nearly three times what Medicare pays for the exact same services at the same hospitals — an average of 297% compared to the national average of 254%. This alarming statistic demonstrates a clear need for reform. 
These inflated hospital costs have a direct and negative impact on Indiana’s manufacturing sector. Every dollar spent on excessive health care charges is a dollar that cannot be invested in workforce development, technological advancements, or business expansion. 
In a global marketplace, our ability to compete hinges on our efficiency and our ability to attract and retain a skilled workforce. The current high cost of health care in Indiana makes it more difficult for manufacturers to offer competitive benefits packages and to allocate resources strategically for future growth. 
Since self-funded employers pay directly for their employees’ health care claims, escalating hospital prices translate to immediate and substantial increases in their expenditures. These rising costs force employers to allocate more resources to health care, potentially diverting funds from other critical business areas. Ultimately, the financial burden of high hospital prices significantly affects the sustainability and competitiveness of all employers, but most acutely self-funded insurance models. 
House Bill 1004 takes meaningful steps toward addressing this issue. It introduces measures to increase transparency in hospital pricing and to put pressure on exorbitant costs. For instance, the bill establishes a hospital facility fee excise tax for charges exceeding 265% of  Medicare facility fees.  
Under this legislation, nonprofit hospitals would be mandated to report aggregate data on billed services and their comparison to Medicare reimbursement rates. Nonprofit hospitals charging more than 300% of their modified Medicare reimbursement rate could forfeit their nonprofit status. These provisions are critical for bringing much-needed transparency and  accountability to our health care system.
The passage of HB 1004 is not just about lowering health care costs; it is about strengthening Indiana’s economy and ensuring a prosperous future for our manufacturing industry and its employees. By addressing the issue of high hospital prices, we can free up valuable resources that can be reinvested in our workforce, making Indiana a more attractive place to do business and create jobs.

Spartz, a third-term federal lawmaker who represents Indiana’s 5th Congressional District north of Indianapolis, struggled for nearly two hours to speak over the yells and boos.
And she isn’t the only Indiana public official being criticized for access, or a lack thereof. Examples abound, from Attorney General Todd Rokita to state lawmakers and Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith.
Spartz’s event came shortly after U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson advised Republicans to avoid town halls which have been attracting vocal critics of actions by Trump and Musk, who is leading an effort to ferret out waste and fraud that has included firing federal employees, halting some government payments and uprooting programs.
Spartz, however, did not heed that warning and faced hundreds of angry — often hostile — Hoosiers at town halls on Friday and Saturday, the latter held in Muncie.
She threatened at several points during the town halls to stop hosting such events, but repeatedly asserted her desire “to hear all sides” from “everyone in my district.”
“You don’t have to scream,” Spartz told Friday’s crowd in Westfield. “I’m glad that we have people that came here — and I understand your frustration. … That’s why I have these town halls. We want to have these conversations. But if people just come here because they want to scream, it’s not productive.” 










We want to have these conversations. But if people just come here because they want to scream, it’s not productive.


– Republican U.S. Rep. Victoria Spartz


Some of Spartz’s GOP colleagues have been less inclined.
Republican U.S. Senators Jim Banks and Todd Young, as well as Reps. Mark Messmer and Marlin Stutzman, are among those being criticized for not holding or attending town halls. 
Banks, specifically, ignited a political backlash last week after he skipped a constituent-led “Empty Chair Town Hall” and instead sent donuts — a move critics called “a dismissive stunt.”
“The idea of people having access to government in a variety of ways is foundational to American representative democracy. On one hand, it shouldn’t have to be required — it should just go without saying that in a representative form of government law, public officials should speak to the people who put them in office,” said Gerry Lanosga, professor of journalism at Indiana University and board member for the Indiana Coalition for Open Government. 
“What we’re kind of seeing now is partly pushed by officials who get into office and just don’t want to engage with citizens more than beyond the ballot box,” he continued. “I think it’s a real concern. And I think it’s a real sort of black eye on American democracy if public officials want to insulate themselves from the voices of people.”
‘Chaotic,’ ‘frustrating’ town halls
During the weekend town halls, Spartz emphasized that her office “has an open door policy” and “wants to hear from you all.”
In Westfield, multiple constituents pushed back: “You never respond!” some said. Others left angrily in the middle of the event, shouting that Spartz “doesn’t actually want to hear from you — she doesn’t care what you think!”
In a post to X on Saturday, Spartz rebutted. 
“I don’t think (the) radical left has learned yet that shouting and screaming is not going to work — no one is going to be intimidated,” she wrote. “I still appreciate everyone who came to my town halls this week & hope at least some on the left were able to hear common sense policies we are trying to implement benefiting all Americans.”

Elsewhere in recent weeks, other members of Indiana’s congressional delegation have been absent from “empty chair” town halls across the state.
One of those hosted last week by Indivisible Northeast Indiana — part of a progressive national movement to “mobilize local activists to resist extremist polices” — drew hundreds to the Allen County Public Library in Fort Wayne.
Indiana House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta and state Rep. Kyle Miller, both Democrats, took the stage to answer questions from the public. Three of Indiana’s Republican congressional lawmakers — Banks, Stutzman and Young — were represented by empty chairs.
Banks, Indiana’s junior U.S. senator, instead sent donuts to the crowd.
He said on X that the Indivisible group consists of Democrats who are “anti-Trump/Banks,” and that town hall attendees seemed “really angry.”
“So I sent my favorite donuts hoping to lighten the mood,” Banks said.
A video about the donut delivery showed some at the event laughing and eating the donuts. Others weren’t so receptive.
“I’m going to throw up on them,” said one attendee. Another asked, “Why isn’t he here?” referring to Banks, while a third man said, “Tell him to go to hell.”
Jim Carpenter, co-founder of Indivisible Northeast Indiana, said in a statement that “the parlor trick of offering donuts” was “a waste of taxpayer money” and “ironic coming from someone pledging to eliminate fraud and waste in the federal government.”
When asked about the town halls, Banks’s staff gave the Indiana Capital Chronicle a single response: “No taxpayer dollars were used to purchase donuts.”

Young, separately, had met with the Indivisible group following a protest in front of his office.
A spokesperson for the senator told the Capital Chronicle that he “regularly meets with Hoosiers in a variety of formats, including attending meetings and events across Indiana, hosting constituent coffees, and holding virtual meetings with Hoosier groups when the Senate is in session.” Additionally, Young’s staff “meets with individuals and groups in all 92 counties.”
In Evansville, hundreds of protesters gathered earlier this month in “frustration” over refusals by Messmer, Indiana’s 8th District representative, to hold a town hall or engage with constituent concerns.
Hoosiers also pushed back after staff for U.S. Rep. Erin Houchin, who represents Indiana’s 9th Congressional District, “put a pause” on regularly scheduled office hours with constituents in Bedford.
Democratic officials have been more willing to continue town halls.
Rep. André Carson, whose district encompasses most of Indianapolis, hosted an hour-long virtual conversation last week, where he largely fielded questions about DOGE cuts. 
First Congressional District Rep. Frank Mrvan, a Democrat from Highland, held a similar remote town hall in early March.
State officials face scrutiny, too
At the state level, Republican Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith said he also remains committed to meeting face-to-face with Hoosiers.
Ahead of his Monday town hall in Franklin, Beckwith made clear in a post to X that, “I think going out into communities and having conversations is such an important part of being in public office.”
Even so, constituents are barred from responding to the lieutenant governor’s posts on the social media site.
Beckwith’s staff have previously suggested that “security” concerns prompted tighter interaction restrictions on X, and said the office’s social media accounts — along with the accounts for the two agencies that report to the lieutenant governor — are monitored by his team “in an effort to inform the public about activities and events.”
They cited the office’s social media policy, which states that “the focus of the social networking opportunities is to share information” about the agencies, while “larger discussions of political views and philosophies may be addressed elsewhere.”

Beckwith’s personal X account alternatively permits anyone to comment and reply on posts, for example.
Such limitations were not in place on social media accounts held by former Republican Lt. Gov. Suzanne Crouch, nor are those restrictions in place Gov. Mike Braun’s official account.
The Capital Chronicle also received complaints from constituents who encountered issues when trying to contact the Indiana Attorney General’s Office by phone or email.
Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita maintained that Hoosiers have “unprecedented access to his office” but said staff are sometimes “bombarded, and we have overflow.”
“If a number is left, we call it back, for sure,” Rokita said about phone calls to the state agency. He noted that his office has “several full-time employee-equivalents” whose jobs are dedicated to “consumer outreach.”

Rokita referenced his “Eyes on Education Portal,” which at times has flooded and even “overwhelmed” the office with messages in “short period(s) of time.”
He also pointed to the agency’s employee handbook, which requires that “all phone calls, all emails — any contact — is to be returned in 24 business hours.”
“And if that doesn’t happen, there are consequences. It doesn’t happen often, but I executed one of those consequences a couple weeks ago, and I’m just sad to hear something like that. But if it’s a pattern, I promise I’ll get to the bottom of it,” Rokita said. “I pride myself on accessibility.”
Indiana Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray further held that it’s “super important” for state lawmakers to remain open and accessible to Hoosiers.
That “can be challenging,” though, during the legislative session.
“We’re super busy. I go, like everybody else, to at least one town hall … during the weekends, on Friday or Saturday. And most of mine this year have been pretty full and kind of robust conversations, which I really, really enjoy,” Bray said. “And I try pretty hard to answer emails and phone calls and things like that, but it is difficult to keep up with those because of the pace of session.” 
“Probably not unlike any others, I could stand a little bit of criticism for being slow to get back with people,” he continued. “But the folks’ input is super important. It helps me stay grounded and keeps my ear to the ground. The time I invest in that makes me a much better legislator.”

Lanosga described an “eroding, a kind of shrinking in the ability of people to get their voices heard by government officials, at all levels, from both sides of the aisle,” over the last three decades. Increasingly, he said, “the ears of the representatives or politicians aren’t hearing the voices of the people.”
“I think citizens — if they’re disturbed about lack of engagement or lack of responsiveness of elected officials — should pick up the phone. They should write letters. They can write letters to news media. They can write emails. They can do social media campaigns,” he said. “All of those things should be tools in the arsenal of arguing for these sorts of robust public debates and public discourse.”
While there can be “legitimate reasons” for public officials to limit accessibility — such as for physical safety — Lanosga cautioned that those justifications “can end up really pushing back the boundaries of people’s access to make their voices heard.”
“Citizens can go to meetings that are scheduled of governing bodies. But outside that, government officials don’t really have to talk to you if they don’t want to. I think it’s very serious,” he said. “And so in those circumstances, you’re right to kind of ask, ‘What’s the point of me even raising my voice if no one’s here to listen to it?’ And so that’s kind of the situation we’re getting into. And if people don’t start pushing back against it and reclaiming that territory, it’s really hard to get back.”

(Photo by Julia Shumway/Oregon Capital Chronicle)By the time Joanna Rogers got to give testimony at the Capitol on a bill that could one day help enshrine the right to a healthy and safe climate in Oregon’s Constitution, she and other speakers were told they’d have one, rather than two, minutes to make their case for or against the bill. The 11-year-old from Portland made fast edits to her testimony so she could cut straight to the heart of the matter.
“You are in charge of so many kids’ fates. Please do what you can,” Rogers told the lawmakers.
If passed, Senate Joint Resolution 28 would refer a ballot measure to Oregon voters in November to amend the state constitution so that it guarantees the “inherent, fundamental right to a clean, safe and healthy environment, including but not limited to clean air, clean water, thriving ecosystems and a stable climate system.”
It would make Oregon one of four states to make such a promise to future generations in its guiding legal document and would allow Oregonians to sue the state government and its agencies if it reneges on that promise.
At the first public hearing for the bill Wednesday in the Senate Rules Committee, Rogers was among a crowd so packed with people hoping to give testimony that a second room was opened to accommodate them. More than 170 people submitted written testimony in support of the bill in advance of the hearing and 26 submitted written testimony in opposition.
Those opposed include large trade associations such as the Oregon Farm Bureau, Oregon Business & Industry, Associated Oregon Loggers and home building groups.
“We see this as a pathway to an endless stream of lawsuits against family farms and ranches,” Lauren Kuenzi, a lobbyist for the Oregon Farm Bureau, told lawmakers. “This will put the court in the driver’s seat, allowing them to shape public policy for a lot of industries.”
The bill’s chief sponsor, state Sen. Jeff Golden, D-Ashland, said it would not lead to lawsuits against private parties or individuals.
“The government has a responsibility to uphold constitutional rights. Private interests have no responsibility to uphold constitutional rights,” he explained.
Citizens could sue the Department of State Lands for permitting a new mining operation, but they could not sue the mining company under the amendment.
Sharla Moffett, a lobbyist for Oregon Business & Industry, expressed concern that it would raise environmental rights to the same level as the right to due process and equal protection under the Oregon Constitution, without clarifying what all those rights entail.
“The terms ‘clean air,’ ‘clean water,’ ‘thriving ecosystems’ and ‘a stable climate’ could be highly subjective and are not defined in the bill,” Moffett said.
The bill is cosponsored by state Sens. James Manning Jr., D-Eugene, Floyd Prozanski, D-Eugene, and Reps. Tom Andersen, D-Salem, Thủy Trần, D-Portland, and Mark Gamba, D-Milwaukie.
Gamba, who tried to suppress tears as he gave testimony, described the need for the Legislature to meet climate change “as the existential threat that it is.” He said suing corporations over the environmental harm they’ve caused has proven to be extraordinarily difficult. But holding Oregon’s government accountable into the future could offer options.
“It’s a clever idea. It’s a bold idea. It allows voters to put an environmental rights amendment into our constitution and reclaim some of our power to stand up to big polluters,” Gamba said to applause in the hearing.
Among those in attendance was Miko Vergun, a 22-year-old plaintiff in the landmark youth climate case Juliana v. United States, filed a decade ago in U.S. District Court in Eugene against the federal government by 11 young Oregonians and 10 peers from several states.
The case, which attempted to hold the U.S. government accountable for accelerating global climate change through lawmakers’ policies and fossil fuel subsidies, never got a trial. It recently hit a dead end after the Supreme Court declined a petition from the plaintiffs to throw out a lower court’s decision to dismiss the case.
Vergun told the senators things might have been different if the state had guaranteed a constitutional right to a healthy climate for her and other young Oregonians.
“In states like Montana and Hawaii, young people like me have won their cases because their constitutions explicitly protect the right to a healthy environment. That’s why SJR 28 matters. It would give Oregonians the same chance to be heard and protected,” she said.

The Chesapeake Bay Journal
The low, rock-covered berm juts like a crooked finger into the Middle Branch of the Patapsco River. It doesn’t look like much now. When finished, though, this and other marine construction work under way in South Baltimore will become 10 acres of wetlands in a city desperately short of natural shoreline.
Roughly three quarters of Baltimore’s waterfront is lined with bulkheads, piers and brick promenades, hardening that severely limits habitat for waterfowl, fish and crabs. The Hanover Street project is the opening salvo in an ambitious effort to restore more than 50 acres of wetlands along 11 miles of shoreline in the long-neglected southern part of the city.
“A year from now, you’ll see a … freshly planted wetland that extends far out into the water,” said Brad Rogers, executive director of the South Baltimore Gateway Partnership. In league with the city and another nonprofit group, Parks and People Foundation, Rogers’ group is spearheading the restoration effort.
The Middle Branch Resiliency Initiative, as it’s called, aims to protect disadvantaged communities in South Baltimore from increasingly frequent flooding and improve water quality there while also providing residents better access to the waterfront.
The initiative is part of a more expansive plan called Reimagine Middle Branch, a community-driven environmental justice movement to enhance the 19 neighborhoods in the area and reconnect them to the shoreline they’ve been cut off from for so long. The vision, Rogers said, is to transform what’s been called Baltimore’s forgotten waterfront into Baltimore’s next great waterfront.
For as long as anyone can remember, the Middle Branch’s shores have suffered from erosion, ship-channel dredging and filling of wetlands. People passing by on busy Hanover Street couldn’t even see the water because their view was blocked by a forest of phragmites.

“It used to be this wide open, deltaic environment with reeds and birds,” Rogers explained as he walked along the rocky berm under construction in the river.
Now, the invasive plants crowding the water’s edge have been removed. The berm, once finished, is to be topped with a layer of sand and organic material, into which wetlands vegetation will be planted. The berm and its plants will help dampen wave-driven erosion from storms and nuisance flooding, protecting a vital traffic artery. Gaps left in the offshore structure will provide access to quieter near-shore water for fish and waterfowl.
For the time being, a floating yellow boom stretches out from the shoreline encompassing the area undergoing a nature makeover. But even before the first blade of marsh grass gets planted, the project is drawing a crowd — of birds and fish.
“You put in this boom and suddenly you see herons, cormorants and menhaden along the shore,” Rogers said.
The Hanover Street wetland is expected to be completed later this year even as construction is planned to start on three other projects. Next up is rehabilitation of a 9-acre patch of marsh between two streets that parallel the river.
“What we’re doing is restoring [its] connectivity to the Patapsco and restoring it as a more ecologically functional marsh as opposed to wet soils and phragmites,” Rogers said.
After that, wetlands are to be added along the shore by Medstar Harbor Hospital, where flooding-aggravated erosion threatens the Middle Branch Trail along the waterfront and is crumbling three concrete piers standing forlornly in the water.
“We want to be able to expand and enhance that and make it a much more attractive place to spend time,” Rogers said.
More wetlands are planned along a tract known as Spring Gardens, the ironically named site of a BGE liquefied natural gas tank farm. The final project would restore woods and marsh at Smith Cove, where two stormwater outfalls now dump runoff from the developed uplands. A boardwalk and environmental education center are also planned there to connect with a new half-mile long waterfront park in Westport.
The waterfront park is to be built in conjunction with a new housing, office and retail complex, One Westport, the first phase of which began construction last year on a 43-acre swath of waterfront that’s sat barren for decades awaiting redevelopment. A coal-burning power plant once occupied part of the site, and an unknown quantity of potentially toxic ash from the facility was buried at a spot now largely paved over, according to an inventory of coal ash disposal sites.

“For the first time in history,” Rogers said, Westport residents “will have access to their own waterfront.”
Unlike many previous urban redevelopment efforts, under Reimagine Middle Branch, the South Baltimore group has worked with leaders and residents of the area’s neighborhoods to plan the Westport park’s amenities, including a playground, outdoor gathering space, kayak launch and a memorial to the Black Sox Negro League baseball team.
“We’re not telling them how they want to develop, and we’re not telling them what kind of investment they’re looking for,” said Rogers. “We’re helping them choose.”
In conjunction with the physical upgrades, the partnership also has sponsored a series of activities and events, including boat cruises in warm weather and ice skating in winter, to encourage residents to come to and reclaim their waterfront.
The partnership has raised about $67 million just for the shoreline restoration work, with much more to be lined up for the Westport park and other elements of Reimagine Middle Branch.
About $40 million of the funds provided so far came from federal agencies. With the Trump administration trying to freeze or cancel many grants and Congress looking to slash spending overall, it’s unclear how much more federal financial support can be counted on.
“It is a time of uncertainty,” Rogers acknowledged, “and everyone involved in environmental restoration or economic development … is going to have to figure out how to be flexible and adaptive.” But the need is so great, he added, “The work can’t be stopped.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/67bf74f5aff91.image1_-1024x667.jpg,,,2025-03-31 07:00:24.114912

Our clients frequently receive very long sentences — for defending themselves against abusive partners, acting under coercion or duress from abusive partners, or because they were unable to prevent their abusive partners from hurting their children. In cases involving felony murder and imputed liability, our clients are sentenced as though they were the people who carried out violent crimes, despite never having harmed anyone. Many of our clients are serving life in prison.
Sentenced to long prison terms, our clients use their time in prison as productively as they can — to seek education, engage in programming, and learn skills that make them employment ready. They do so much programming, in fact, that within a few years, there is nothing left for them to take.
Left to age in prison, our clients develop serious (and expensive to treat) medical issues. They grow old in a place that is not designed to meet the needs of the elderly. They are not dangerous. They are not violent.
Our clients use the limited legal options that are available to them to seek review of their sentences. But most of those processes are focused on legal errors, and so don’t take into account a person’s programming, growth, or positive institutional record.
The only pure review option, sentence modification, is severely time limited. Under current law, judges can only modify sentences if asked to do so within 90 days of the original sentence and within five years of the sentencing date. Judges are often disinclined to reconsider sentences that close in time to the original ruling and our clients may not have had time to amass the kind of record that might make a judge reconsider a sentence within that short period.
Opponents of the Second Look Act argue that individuals who have been convicted of crimes of violence — the kinds of crimes that generate long sentences — are the “worst of the worst.” Our clients are far from the worst. They have been convicted of crimes of violence, but they are not violent people. They are mothers and grandmothers, sisters and aunts. They are eager to show their sentencing courts the hard work they have done while incarcerated.
They could be productive members of society if given the opportunity. All they ask is for the chance to make that case in court.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1440229538-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-31 07:00:24.114912

The bill then stalled on the next step, and a month passed before the House Rules-Legislative Committee approved it for placement on the calendar for debate. Now, as April is about to begin and lawmakers have only seven weeks to complete their work, it is uncertain whether that debate will take place.
The bill has the backing of House Speaker Jon Patterson of Lee’s Summit, but he’s not sure the rest of the GOP caucus is ready to follow him.
“It’s a matter of, do we have a majority of the people in the chamber that feel the same way?” Patterson said Thursday at the weekly House Republican news conference. “That I don’t know.”
For more than five years there have been legislative efforts, ultimately unsuccessful, to expand legal gambling through video lottery games and sports wagering — and to shut down unregulated games offering cash prizes that can be found in bars, truck stops and convenience stores across the state.
The proliferation of what are called gray market machines is one of the best arguments for authorizing video lottery games, Patterson said.
“If people are doing it, I would rather have them regulated and taxed and to make sure that kids aren’t doing it,” he said. “So I’m in favor of the bill itself.”
The legislation sponsored by state Rep. Bill Hardwick, a Republican from Dixon, has been revised since it was introduced and another major revision is awaiting action on the House floor. To win votes, an amendment Hardwick intends to propose would cut the number of machines allowed at each location to eight and add provisions allowing local governments — cities for incorporated areas, counties for unincorporated locations — to conduct votes on whether to allow video lottery terminals.
He also removed all provisions of the bill that would have eliminated the gray market machines. Instead of phasing them out six months after video lottery is launched, retailers could keep them if they prefer rather than become lottery outlets.
They could not have both.
 State Rep. Bill Hardwick, a Republican from Dixon, speaks March 25 on the Missouri House floor (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
Last week, Hardwick had a pad of lined paper in hand, going from member to member on the floor to see if he had enough votes.
“I think that we can pass it out of the House,” Hardwick said. “I think that we should pass it out of the House.”
The best argument he has for the bill, Hardwick said, is its potential to produce revenue for state education programs. Gov. Mike Kehoe didn’t recommend a $300 million increase in the state public school formula that would fully fund the program, calling it too expensive.
According to the fiscal note, video lottery would produce $112 million in the first year and almost $350 million a year when fully operational.
There is a substantial surplus currently in the state general revenue fund, but revenues are not growing and the Republican majority wants to cut state income taxes. 
“A lot of my members are thinking about the fact that the state’s going to have some tough budget times ahead, and by making a few regulatory and structural changes, we could change revenues without raising taxes on people,” Hardwick said.
For several years, the issue of gambling was a triangular debate. 
Casino companies and professional sports teams eager for the revenue from sports wagering opposed the video game vendors pushing for the new form of lottery game. Both were opposed at times by lobbyists for Torch Electronics, the largest of the gray market operators and a prolific political giver.
Torch didn’t want any bill that would make the law clear on the legality of its games.
It has been active both in the legislative halls and the courtroom, where it unsuccessfully sued the Missouri State Highway Patrol to block criminal investigations of its machines. 
A representative of Torch declined to comment on the revised bill.
A campaign organized by major sports teams and bankrolled by online betting platforms in November won approval of sports betting for Missouri. While that issue is off the table, casinos aren’t backing down from their opposition to video lottery games.
The number of people visiting Missouri’s 13 casinos in the final six months of 2024 was down 25% from the same period of 2019, which is about the time the unregulated machines were making their debut. The remaining casino gamblers are each losing more, on average, and net winnings for the casinos have gone up 8% in that same period.
What the figures say is that small-dollar players are choosing to play the unregulated machines, said Michael Winter of the Missouri Gaming Association.
The association considers the unregulated machines to  be criminal gambling devices and the proposal for video lottery to be unconstitutional. The only place slot machines are legal, he said, is in the 13 casinos licensed by the Missouri Gaming Commission.
“I don’t think the market has stopped growing when you look at either illegals or the potential that putting in more slot machines than every location around the state could have on our properties,” Winter said. “So we think there’s still more downside and revenue we could lose if bills like this are passed.” 
The bill’s controls on improper play, such as by people under 21, are too loose, Winter said.
“They don’t have set aside rooms,” he said. “They don’t have licensed personnel overseeing the machine. You’ve got a person at the counter who’s in charge of making sure that only 21-year-olds play the machines.”
The changes in Hardwick’s proposed amendment are essential to winning passage, said Andy Arnold, a lobbyist for J & J Ventures, a vendor for video lottery games.
He thinks a bipartisan majority of the House can be assembled to pass the bill, but it would be close. To get to the Senate, a bill must win 82 votes from the 163-member House.
A provision that requires the games to be in a place “distinct and divided from the primary business operation area” was important to calming fears that minors may be playing the games.
Arnold has been working to get video lottery legalized for 10 years. The arguments from the casinos are more about market share than legality, he said.
“It’s just a matter of time before people see through and see that it’s nothing more than competition,” Arnold said. “They don’t want the competition. But they’ve already got the competition from the illegal machines.”

(Barbara Shelly/for Missouri Independent)Friends and family arrived bearing flowers. Smiling volunteers pointed the way to seats.
Everyone loves a naturalization ceremony. I attended one recently at a branch of the Kansas City Public Library and watched 71 new American citizens swear allegiance to the Constitution of the United States. Even more immigrants had taken the oath earlier in the day.
“This room is full of the most brilliant minds that the world knows,” Wasim Khan, a cultural leader, told the group. “You guys are the teachers. You know what it takes to be here.”
After the ceremony, as League of Women Voters volunteers swooped in to invite the new citizens to register, I asked a few people how long they have been in America.
Eight years, 12 years, too many years to count.
Naturalized citizenship is a long, expensive process and everyone who achieves it does so through a combination of grit and good fortune.
I’ve attended several of these ceremonies over the years to cheer on people I’ve had the privilege to know.
One was a piano teacher who came here from Kyrgyzstan to study at American universities. Several others arrived as refugees. They overcame language barriers and all the hardships of poverty to arrive at their naturalization ceremonies as educated, hardworking contributors to their communities.
The recent ceremony was no different from others I’ve witnessed, but I couldn’t summon the usual measure of joy.
Rather, I kept wondering what a naturalization ceremony will look like once the xenophobic policies of the Trump administration have been fully brought to bear.
Last year, I signed up to participate on a team that would sponsor a refugee family, in cooperation with a resettlement agency. I told myself that it would be a satisfying act of resistance in case Donald J. Trump won the presidency.
Along with others, I welcomed a family of eight at Kansas City’s airport on a snowy evening 12 days before Trump’s inauguration. They were exhausted and one person was ill but they were here and we were ready to introduce them to America.
We had no idea how difficult that was going to be.
Within a week of taking office, Trump had slammed the door to new refugee admissions and cut off funding for the families who had recently arrived.
The resettlement community had anticipated the first move. It was gobsmacked by the second. With an executive order, Trump wiped out money that was supposed to pay for rent and utilities, medical screenings and other services for hundreds of people who had entered the United States legally in the last 90 days.
Agencies went into emergency fundraising mode, but Trump’s action was crippling. The agency I volunteer for lost nearly $1 million of federal money it had counted on. Part of that amount was already spent in rent deposits and other costs.
It’s nearly impossible to cover a gap like that through donations. Within weeks two agencies in Kansas City laid off close to half their staffs. A smaller nonprofit laid off its entire refugee services staff. A mid-Missouri agency shut down its resettlement program.
My role in the resistance now includes scanning job ads for something that might work for adults who speak only a little English and will have to ride to work on the bus. I’ve become familiar with the difficulties of booking an appointment at the local Social Security office — and good luck once Elon Musk gets through with that program.
The family that my team works with was routed from their ancestral home and spent years in limbo in a neighboring country. The adults are fully aware that the leader of the United States does not want them here.
Their status is legal, but they are afraid. They grieve family members left behind in a refugee camp, clinging to hopes of a reunion that may not happen in this lifetime.
In my head, I construct sentences that begin with “at least.”
At least they aren’t here on humanitarian parole status — a category of immigrants more endangered than refugees.
At least they have a place to stay, a small rental house in a hollowed-out part of Kansas City. A recent New York Times story reported on newly arrived refugees in St. Louis languishing in motels on highway interchanges because the resettlement agency there was unable to pay apartment leases.
At least members of my family have friends. Immigrants from their home country have sought them out and embraced them.
The situation could always be worse. But it is bad enough.
Refugee resettlement is a way of participating in the global good. Therefore, it is not a priority in Trump’s “America First” agenda.
The immigrants whom I witnessed as they became naturalized citizens last month represented 36 nations, including some of the most troubled, like Haiti, Somalia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
They had cleared a high bar to get to the ceremony. All of them passed a civics test that most Americans would find daunting. They were deemed to be of “good moral character,” a standard that we don’t necessarily demand from our nation’s leaders.
Congratulations to the new Americans. May we always find a path for them.

I had just gotten out of an eye appointment, having picked out a new set of blue, thick-rimmed glasses. [&#8230;]","The Idaho Capital Sun staff at the Idaho Capitol Building in Boise. From left to right are reporter Mia Maldonado, editor-in-chief Christina Lords, reporter Kyle Pfannenstiel and senior reporter Clark Corbin. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)The first conversation I had with Andrea Verykoukis, I was sitting in my car in the parking lot of a Boise Eyemart Express with my cellphone on speakerphone on a cloudy day in late January 2021.
I had just gotten out of an eye appointment, having picked out a new set of blue, thick-rimmed glasses. That’s because, two days before, I had just been fired from the Idaho Statesman and needed to renew my prescription before I lost my health insurance. (If you don’t know that story, maybe I’ll tell it to you over a beer someday; if you do, know I am still a fierce Excel advocate and an advocate for making sure our reporters have the tools they need to do their jobs.)
Andrea, along with Chris Fitzsimon and a host of other talented journalists, had been hard at work launching or partnering with nonprofit news organizations focused on state politics and policy in all 50 states through States Newsroom, now the Idaho Capital Sun’s parent nonprofit and the reason our outlet exists.
I have to be honest here. After the firing, and after 12 years of journalism — 11 of them at newspapers in Idaho — I wanted out. I was looking at master’s programs to go be the librarian my mom always thought I should be and applying to public relations jobs I thought might fit.
But Andrea asked one question: What is going under covered and under reported in Idaho? And then she went quiet.
I think I rambled on for about 30 straight minutes about how public education has been chronically underfunded and our educators have been demoralized here, about how the shortages our health care workforce we faced even before COVID were in dire straights now, about how wildfire and mismanagement of federal public lands was threatening the places I grew up visiting, about how the Idaho Legislature every year comes with legislation to make it harder for Idahoans to cast a ballot or run a citizens initiative in our elections.
And I’ll never forget what Andrea said: “Well. It sure seems like you have more stories in you to tell. What do you think about launching a nonprofit focused on state politics in Idaho through States Newsroom?”
Then she explained that as a nonprofit news organization, States Newsroom allows any other media outlet to pick up our work — for free — with proper credit and attribution.
I thought of all the times sitting around the conference room at my first reporting gig covering local government and crime at the Moscow-Pullman Daily News and praying that larger news organizations could report on some of the tips and stories that we just couldn’t get to with our small, young staff. Of all the times I had to say no to stories worth pursuing at the Post Register in Idaho Falls as I stumbled my way through my first legislative session in 2013 because there just weren’t enough reporters to get them all done. And of all the times at the Idaho Press when I was assistant editor where we lost good, young reporters that we had spent years building up their reporting chops, figuring out complex local government systems and backstories, just to see them forced to take a PR job because journalism wasn’t paying their bills.
If we could help other Idaho newsrooms — and by extension, their Idaho readers — by providing in-depth coverage of the Statehouse, maybe, I thought, we could make an impact.
I took a week to talk myself out of it. I dove alone to Balanced Rock in Twin Falls County to explore somewhere I had never been in Idaho, to hike, to watch Salmon Falls Creek sweep by me, to see our farm fields laid out as far as the eye could see, to think. It was there I decided there was some journalism still left in me, and I was compelled to try.

I thought for sure we’d launch the Idaho Capital Sun, it wouldn’t work, and in a year say, well, we tried.
But that’s not what happened.
While Idaho newsrooms are very competitive and want to be first, right and contextual, they also understand Idahoans have a right to know how their tax dollars are being spent, and who is making the decisions that affects their daily lives and their futures.
The very first newsroom to pick up one of our stories, on the first day we launched, March 31, 2021 — four years ago today? The Idaho Statesman.
But it certainly wasn’t the last. To States Newsroom, the measure of our success isn’t tallied by click quotas for reporters or page view website traffic. It’s how many of our stories are good enough and helpful enough to be picked up by other newsrooms, so we track those metrics instead.
Just this month, the Idaho Capital Sun’s stories were picked up online by other news outlets 240 times, largely in Idaho but some also nationwide. And 62 of our stories this month have made it into print. And that’s just what we can monitor and categorize, likely a huge undercount of just how far our work travels.
Our work is picked up everywhere by the fine folks at the the weekly Sandpoint Reader to my hometown TV news station KPVI in Pocatello. By the Rexburg Standard Journal, by the ever-expanding BoiseDev online, by the Twin Falls Times-News and by another newspaper I called home for four years, the Idaho Press in Nampa. The Idaho Capital Free Press picks up our work in Grangeville, and so does the News-Examiner for their readers in Bear Lake and Caribou counties. Our work traveled across the country this month in publications like USA Today; the Adirondack Daily Enterprise in Saranac Lake, New York; Spokane Public Radio; and the Fox 26 TV station in Medford, Oregon.
And we return the favor. At the bottom of every one of our newsletters, the Sunrise, which you can sign up for online for free, I include a collection of links to the work of other Idaho news outlets the produce every day. I think a lot about our state’s news ecosystem, and we aim to bring to the forefront the hard work, under tough economic and political circumstances, that reporters are providing to the Gem State and her residents.
As I mentioned before, the Idaho Capital Sun is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, so donations from readers like you are what keep our lights on. It’s what keeps not only our readers informed at IdahoCapitalSun.com, but it also keeps the tens of thousands of readers of other hardworking Idaho news organizations informed, too.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
I never thought we’d last a year. Now, among the most chaotic and challenging news cycle and political climates I have ever faced in the 16 years I’ve been a professional journalist, I’m reminded every day just how essential our role is to meeting this moment. Because we have reporters originally born and raised here or who have lived here for decades, I’ve never felt more capable of reflecting the things Idahoans experience and want to know about in our work. I’ve never felt more “sure in my skis,” as they say, never been more confident in our ability to make change and help people understand their world around them.
If you’ve ever sent a note of encouragement or supported us financially over the last four years, through donations large or small, one-time or recurring, thank you for helping us grow and thrive. You are the reason we are celebrating our fourth anniversary today. If you’re new to the Idaho Capital Sun and our work, welcome. We hope you find value in what we do here.
And especially to our hard working reporting staff, Mia Maldonado, Kyle Pfannenstiel and Clark Corbin, our senior reporter who has been with us since the day we launched, thank you for waking up every day and fearlessly heading into spaces to shine the light of truth. I’m the luckiest editor in Idaho to work with people like you.

Murphy and other New Jersey representatives to address our transportation challenges directly by making our own transit investments, the author writes.","It’s time for Gov. Murphy and other New Jersey representatives to address our transportation challenges directly by making our own transit investments, the author writes. (Sophie Nieto-Muñoz | New Jersey Monitor)By Patrick DiRoma, co-founder of Bergen County Complete Streets
Three months into the long-awaited congestion pricing program, the signs are clear: congestion pricing works.
The policy is doing what no amount of roadway expansions have managed to achieve – significantly reducing travel times, saving residents valuable time that they would rather spend doing anything other than sitting in traffic. And unlike adding more car lanes, as the proposed New Jersey Turnpike expansion would do, it is creating healthier and safer places to live, work, and play.
Drivers and bus riders are seeing first-hand the benefits of reduced traffic as a result of congestion pricing, particularly near the bridges and tunnels that connect New Jersey to Manhattan.
Meanwhile, Gov. Phil Murphy and other New Jersey representatives are continuing to waste time and money attacking congestion pricing when they should be focused on improving the Garden State’s own transportation system. Their attempts to sue New York over this policy sent a clear message: They would rather maintain a broken status quo instead of providing high-quality public transit improvements that meet the transportation needs of hard-working New Jersey residents.
Such improvements would reduce the number of cars on the road, shorten commutes, improve air quality, and create opportunities to use space in ways that best serve people rather than vehicles. Congestion pricing is a policy that is actually addressing this problem head-on and New Jersey should be learning from it, not fighting it.
New Jersey deserves to have convenient, high-quality, and reliable transportation options and safer, cleaner streets, and that means investing in infrastructure that provides alternatives to driving, something that every administration in my lifetime has failed to deliver.
In pursuit of this goal, New Jersey can start by creating dedicated bus lanes on the George Washington Bridge. This can be implemented quickly and at minimal cost by partnering with New York. It would allow 10 times as many people to get across the bridge as compared to a regular vehicle lane; high-capacity buses would no longer be stuck in the same traffic as cars.
The state can also expedite the extension of the Hudson-Bergen light rail to Bergen County, which both the Bergen County executive and county commissioners support. Other states have expedited transit projects through targeted exemptions from environmental impact studies. Given the overwhelming environmental benefits of public transit, New Jersey should be doing the same.
Finally, New Jersey residents need access to safe infrastructure for growing micro-mobility. Many residents already use devices like scooters and bikes for last-mile access to our state’s transit stations, and it is time to provide the infrastructure necessary to keep them safe and enable more local trips to be done in ways that don’t contribute to traffic and congestion.
Congestion pricing is already encouraging people to think differently about transportation. More and more people are realizing the harsh reality of a transportation system built solely for cars: if everyone drives, nobody moves. Public officials must commit to improving mass transit and expanding alternative transportation options if we want to have safe, healthy communities instead of endless traffic, congestion, and pollution.
Sadly, some of our representatives are choosing to be fear-mongers instead of leading. They would rather promote a handful of sensational crime incidents around transit, hoping the public ignores the traffic violence that has not only become routine on our streets but has gotten worse, with 691 traffic fatalities in New Jersey last year alone.
New Jersey’s mass transit system is something few other states have, and people should feel empowered and motivated to utilize this amenity that connects us to the wider region. Furthermore, people should demand that service be valued, improved, and expanded by our elected leaders to meet the state’s transportation needs.
From Bergen County and beyond, the benefits of congestion pricing are clear. We should be celebrating it as the step forward it is and not allowing lawmakers to distract us with an obvious smear campaign against the program for political gain. Congestion pricing is a regional fix for a regional problem — improving connectivity for commuters and reducing traffic and gridlock throughout the area. It’s time for Gov. Murphy and other New Jersey representatives to address our transportation challenges directly by making our own transit investments instead of trying to tear down others.

The bills that advanced make up just over 20% of the roughly 1,960 House measures filed at the start of session. And while a supermajority of those were authored by Republicans, a record number of Democrat bills advanced, the House minority leader said. 
Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, attributed the chamber’s success to a two-tiered committee system with new oversight committees that he implemented this session. 
“We went into the evenings a few nights, but you never saw any super late nights,” he said Thursday during a media availability. “I think this might be the first session I’ve experienced, at least that I can remember, where we weren’t in here past 10 p.m. hearing legislation. And I think that’s kudos to our new two tier committee system, where bills, when they made it to the floor, they were ready for primetime because members put in work on their bills on the front end.”
Minority Leader Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City, said 29 Democratic bills were sent over to the Senate this year. 
“I think that’s a record for us. In the last several years we’ve been working well with the Republican caucus to get our bills done,” she said Thursday. “But you know, our members have worked really hard on our priorities and working across the aisle and looking for things that solve problems for Oklahomans.”
Of the hundreds of bills that passed through the House, some have garnered more attention. House lawmakers advanced:

House Bill 1003 that seeks to raise the age sexual of consent in Oklahoma from 16 to 18 years old; 
a bill creating the first residential setbacks for wind turbines, requiring they be half a nautical mile from dwellings and 1.5 times the turbine’s height from neighboring property lines. A similar measure passed the Senate, but with smaller setback requirements; 
legislation creating a new felony for being in the U.S. illegally that would repeal a controversial law that was signed last year; 
a ban on cellphone use in schools. The House sent legislation requiring a bell-to-bell ban to the Senate; 
two bills that would legalize sports betting in Oklahoma, with exclusivity granted to tribes despite the threat of veto from Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt; 
a bill allowing health care providers to refuse to offer specific procedures or care based on moral, religious or conscientious beliefs is on its way to the Senate. It advanced despite earlier opposition from Oklahoma physicians;
a handful of bills from Rep. Suzanne Schrieber, D-Tulsa, addressing child care issues in the state. These measures include granting a tax credit to employers that provides childcare subsidies to employees and exempting the income of child care providers when applying for the Child Care Subsidy Program;  
a bill, which increases the amount a person who is wrongfully convicted can claim, advanced. It would allow wrongfully incarcerated inmates to claim $50,000 per year of incarceration. State law caps the compensation amount at $175,000; 
a bill increasing payments to foster care families intended to help families cover the cost of caring for a foster child by $5 per day; 
a bill requiring school districts to show a video on human growth and development while in the womb to high school students passed through the House; 
an effort to give the Oklahoma Attorney General the ability to investigate and enforce reported violations of the Open Records Act by public bodies; and 
a bill creating a license for “professional storm chasers” that allows them to subvert road closures, run red lights, add flashing lights and act as “emergency vehicles.”

Two bills seeking to alter Oklahoma’s cockfighting statutes did not advance and did not receive a hearing in a committee. 
A bill to bar undocumented immigrants in Oklahoma from driving vehicles using licenses issued in other states also did not get heard on the floor. 
The bills that advanced are eligible to be heard in Senate committees over the coming weeks. The Senate sent 321 bills to the House for consideration.

Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner.As Wisconsin school districts seek permission this week from voters to spend more than $1.6 billion for operational and building costs, state lawmakers are looking for ways to address the issue of schools’ growing reliance on referendum requests.
Voters across the state are deciding this spring on a total of 94 referendum requests including some in February and many in the upcoming April 1 elections. According to the Wisconsin Policy Forum, it’s the most ever between January and April in a non-presidential or midterm election year and it’s the continuation of an ongoing trend.
Republicans have introduced three proposals for new limitations on the referendum process in reaction to Milwaukee Public Schools’ successful request last year, with lawmakers saying the proposals would increase fairness and transparency for voters and taxpayers. However, one Democratic lawmaker and other stakeholders said the proposals would limit local control and don’t address the structural financial issues that drive school districts to go to referendum.
Eliminating ‘recurring’ referendum requests
A bill coauthored by Rep. Cindi Duchow (R-Town of Delafield) and Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield)  would eliminate referendum questions that allow permanent operational funding increases and would limit other referendum requests to cover no more than a four-year period.
Duchow said in an interview with the Wisconsin Examiner that she doesn’t think there is a problem with school districts going to referendum and called them the “perfect tool” to allow local residents to make funding decisions. But she doesn’t think funding increases sought through a referendum should be permanent — or, in legislative terminology, “recurring” year after year. 
The referendum option was created for schools in 1993 as a part of legislation that put limits on schools’ ability to raise revenue by increasing property taxes. 
Anne Chapman, research director for the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials Association (WASBO), said in an interview that the idea behind the legislation was that property taxpayers would be protected and the state would take care of school districts financially in return. From 1993 to 2010, revenue caps — the limit on how much districts could raise without voters’ permission — were tied to inflation. The inflationary increases were eliminated in 2009 and state funding has not filled the gap to give schools an inflationary increase. 
According to WASBO, general school district revenues have lagged the rate of inflation for a decade and a half. If funding had kept up with inflation, districts would be getting $3,380 more per pupil in 2025.
Wisconsin schools also only receive funding for about a third of their special education costs and many are drawing from their general funds to keep up with providing expensive federally and state mandated services to students with disabilities. Districts are also dealing with declining enrollment, which results in lower funding for a district as there are fewer students even if fixed costs such as maintaining facilities may not fall.
School officials and advocates have pointed out that many districts are relying heavily on referendum requests to meet costs (even to keep schools open), saying the trend is untenable. Mauston School District is one example as school leaders were considering dissolving the district after two failed referendum requests until voters finally approved a request in February.
Chapman noted that when a referendum fails it can result in a school deferring maintenance, increasing class sizes and cutting staff, AP programs, language, support staff for special education, nurses, librarians, athletics and “all the things that kids need to kind of stay engaged in school.” 
Dale Knapp, director of Wisconsin-based research organization Forward Analytics, said in 2023 that he didn’t “think the lawmakers who created this law envisioned referenda being relied on this much.”
“Maybe the answer after 30 years of the limits is an in-depth review of the law to see how it can be improved to continue protecting taxpayers and ensure adequate funding of our schools,” Knapp said.
Duchow, however, said that the state is providing “plenty of money” to schools.
“If they want a new gym, that’s on them. I’m not here to build you a new gym. The people who live in that community should make that decision,” Duchow said. She also said there are some schools that probably need to consolidate and others that need to close.
While school districts do go to voters to fund building costs, many are also going to referendum for “operational” (and often recurring) costs and as a way to keep up with staff pay, afford educational offerings and pay utility bills.
Duchow said recurring referendum questions are unfair. She said lawmakers in the caucus have been discussing changing the policy for a while. A similar proposal was introduced in 2017.
“We are looking at declining enrollment around this state, and how do we know what we really need 10 years from now?” Duchow said. “The Milwaukee referendum never goes away, so 10 years from now, we have less students in Milwaukee and we need the same amount of money?  We have more technology coming in, which means we probably need less teachers.” 
Duchow said Milwaukee’s $252 million operating referendum, which was the second largest school operating request in state history, was the “catalyst” for her bill.
Republican lawmakers and other state leaders have been highly critical of the request, which the district said was needed to fund staff pay and educational programming and voters narrowly approved. The criticism grew louder after the district’s financial crisis that resulted in the resignation of the superintendent and audits launched by Gov. Tony Evers.
“Enough is enough. MPS is a disaster. We have the worst reading scores in the nation, and all they do is scream they need more money,” Duchow said. “Money is obviously not the answer.”
Even with declining enrollment, the Milwaukee Public School District is the largest district in the state with 65,000 students enrolled, according to the 2024-25 enrollment data from DPI. This is over 2.5 times as many students as the next largest district in Wisconsin, Madison Metropolitan School District.
MPS students are also more likely to face significant challenges. More than 20% of students in the district have a disability, more than 80% are economically disadvantaged and 17.5% are English language learners. Statewide about 40% of students are economically disadvantaged, 15.7% are students with disabilities and 6.92% are English language learners.
Chapman said students with higher needs often incur higher costs for districts. 
Duchow said that putting a four-year limit on referendum requests for recurring funds gives communities the ability to react to changing circumstances and that school districts should justify to voters why they need the funds. She said she would be open to discussing a different limit when it comes to nonrecurring referendum requests.
“It’s also not fair that everybody could vote for that referendum and then decide, hey, this is really too expensive. I can’t afford these property taxes and then they move out, and I’m still there paying the referendum,” Duchow said. 
Duchow said she hadn’t yet spoken with any school district leaders when she was interviewed by the Examiner in early March, but planned to reach out before a public hearing on the bill.
“I’m sure I can already tell you how the schools are going to feel. The schools are going to feel they want their recurring referendum, just like we want your boss to give you a 20% raise every year without you justifying why you should get it,” Duchow said. “That’s what the schools want, too. I don’t blame them. I would, too, but we can’t do that to our taxpayers.”
According to the Wisconsin Eye on Lobbying website, the Wisconsin Education Association Council has registered against the bill, while the Wisconsin REALTORS Association has registered in favor.
Lawmakers have added new restrictions to school referendum requests before. The 2017-19 state budget limited scheduling of a referendum requests to only two per year and only allowed them to be held on regularly scheduled election days.
“It used to be that referendums could be called by a school district at any time, but the Legislature said… we don’t want you to have the option to run so many referendums,” Chapman said. 
Chapman noted in an interview that recurring referendum requests pass at lower rates than other types because it is harder to convince taxpayers. She said voters “know how to handle this” and lawmakers shouldn’t further reach in to restrict district’s options.
“Some districts and some communities want a recurring referendum,” Chapman said. “School districts have the option of asking for recurring and sometimes they do and voters sometimes approve them because they’re asking to fill structural budget holes that are never going to go away. They’re asking for basic operating dollars that they’re going to need in four years.” 
A recent Marquette Law School poll found that Wisconsinites are becoming increasingly concerned with holding down property taxes since 2018 and less favorably inclined toward increasing funding for K-12 public schools. 
Chapman noted that districts also often make nonrecurring referendum requests for recurring costs because they are an easier ask, though this places districts in another difficult position.
“As soon as you go to nonrecurring referendum in this environment with grossly inadequate state funding and state policies to support schools financially, you are now going to be in your own personal fiscal cliff,” Chapman said. “You’re going to have to go again, and probably for more, because your costs have gone up and funding does not keep up with inflation.” 
Bills meant to provide ‘fairness,’ ‘transparency’
Lawmakers, concerned about the MPS referendum, requested a Legislative Fiscal Bureau memo last year that found some school districts in Wisconsin could see a decrease in state aid after the MPS referendum due to the way that equalization aid is calculated.
Equalization aid acts as a form of property tax relief, according to the Wisconsin School Business Officials Association. The amount of aid a district receives from the finite pot of money distributed by the state is determined by a formula that depends on a district’s property wealth, spending and enrollment.
Spending triggered by referendum requests is one factor in determining districts’ equalization aid, and Milwaukee — like other districts with low property wealth per pupil compared to the rest of the state — will receive more state aid per pupil than other districts with higher property wealth per pupil as a result of its increased spending from the referendum.
Chapman noted, however, that all 148 referendum requests for operating expenses in 2024 affect the share of equalization aid districts receive. She also emphasized that it’s not the only factor affecting the amount of aid districts get.
“Some districts have increasing enrollment, which means they’re going to pull more money away from Milwaukee.” Chapman said. “There’s all of these factors that affect every single district, and they intertwine with each other.”
Republicans viewed Milwaukee’s referendum as taking too much from other districts. 
“Is it fair to the students, parents and taxpayers in Waukesha, Madison, Wautoma and others suffer without having the right to cast a vote?” the bill authors Rep. Scott Allen (R-Waukesha) and Sen. Julian Bradley (R-New Berlin) asked in a memo. “Local school referendums should not have a significant negative impact on other districts. Simple fairness demands this type of thinking.”
The lawmakers’ bill would exclude any district referendum request worth more than $50 million from being considered when determining equalization aid. The effect of the bill would be that districts that pass a large referendum would have their aid eligibility reduced, leaving local taxpayers to pay more of the cost. The bill would only apply to districts below a certain property wealth value.
Chapman said the bill would penalize districts for being larger and having lower property wealth and is an example of lawmakers trying to micromanage local entities.
A final bill introduced by Allen and Sen. Rachael Cabral-Guevara (R-Appleton) would require that tax impact information be added to ballots. Currently, referendum ballot questions are required to include the dollar amount of the increase in the levy limit.
Under the bill, referendum questions would also need to include the estimated interest rate and amount of the interest accruing on the bonds, any fees that will be incurred if the bonds are defeased and a “good faith estimate of the dollar amount difference in property taxes on a median-valued, single-family residence located in the local governmental unit that would result from passage of the referendum.” 
Proposal criticisms
Freshman Rep. Christian Phelps (D-Eau Claire) said he wasn’t inclined to support a ban on recurring referendum requests given the inconsistency in state funding. 
“We go through this sort of toxic [state] budget cycle every two years and districts have to levy, and they don’t even know what to plan for, so recurring referendums are obviously a response to that,” Phelps said.
Phelps said the question of fairness is relevant when talking about the referendum process, but the framing of the Republican proposals is misguided, given the state’s over $4 billion budget surplus.
“It is not fair to taxpayers that, depending on what school district you live in, you might have an astronomical property tax bill just to keep that district running. That’s not fair,” Phelps said. He said the state of Wisconsin is “underfunding public schools and not using the taxes people already paid.”
Derek Gottleib, an assistant professor at the University of Northern Colorado and senior research director for School Perceptions, an education research firm, said Republicans appear to be “operating on behalf of the taxpayers across the state who have voted no on school referendums and yet lost and so had their taxes raised anyway.”
“Suddenly, because so many [referendum requests] are passing, homeowners, taxpayers who don’t want to have their taxes raised are saying that this is unfair or we shouldn’t have to have our taxes raised just because everybody in our community wants to raise our taxes and Republicans are coming to the defense of those folks,” Gottleib said. 
According to the Wisconsin Policy Forum, while the number of requests continues to rise, approval rates have started to decline with the 66.2% approval rate in 2024 being the lowest in a midterm or presidential election year since 2012.
Gottleib said some of the concerns raised by lawmakers are valid. For example, he said the current terms used to describe referendum questions are “obscure” and unclear.
“Why not just say a permanent referendum and a temporary referendum?” he asked. “You could do a lot to increase the transparency of what people are voting on if you made that little language change.” 
Gottleib also said that he does have “sympathy” for those who don’t think there should be permanent funding requests, but acknowledged that this would have consequences for districts because it removes predictability in planning.
However, he said he doesn’t agree that the potential for people to move out of a community or into a community in the future should be the deciding factor in funding decisions. 
“That’s a basic feature of any community anywhere,” he said. 
The argument that “it is not a legitimate exercise of public governmental power to make a decision for a community, given the fact that the community will change in the future…is ridiculous,” Gottleib said. “If that were the case, it would make all public decisions fundamentally illegitimate.”
The increasing number of referendum requests, Gottleib said, is a sign that revenue limits are set too low, at an amount that is unacceptable to community members. He noted that when operational referendum requests fail, the schools typically cut theater arts, advanced placement coursework, second language instruction, foreign language instruction and other programs that aren’t required by the state.
Chapman called the proposals a “BandAid” on the issues districts are facing that “isn’t even really fixing the problem.” 
“[If] legislators really wanted to protect taxpayers and make sure schools have what they need, they would do something like keep revenue limits inflationary [and] significantly improve the funding for special education, which would help every single kid,” Chapman said.

(Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)Watercraft inspection stations managed by the Idaho State Department of Agriculture are open for the 2025 season. 
This means all boat owners — regardless of their watercraft size, propulsion, motorized or non-motorized — must stop for mandatory inspection when traveling past an inspection station during operating hours. 
Inspection stations are essential to prevent invasive species, such as quagga mussels, from entering Idaho’s waterways. Quagga mussels were first discovered in the Snake River near Twin Falls in 2023, and have since cost the state millions to suppress as they have the potential to outcompete other aquatic species and clog agricultural and energy infrastructure.
Quagga mussel elimination efforts have also killed thousands of native fish in the Snake River, including at least 48 white sturgeon, some of which were up to 35 years old and eight feet long, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
‘We take this seriously’: ISDA director on out-of-state boat traffic, Idaho quagga mussels

“Stopping at watercraft inspection stations and following the simple steps of cleaning, draining, and drying your watercraft are essential to ensuring Idaho’s waters thrive for generations to come,” department director Chanel Tewalt said in a press release. “It is up to all of us — boaters, anglers, and outdoor enthusiasts — to take responsibility in safeguarding our waters from invasive species.” 
 How to prevent the spread of invasive species in Idaho waterways

Idaho law requires all out-of-state watercraft to be inspected and decontaminated at a watercraft inspection station prior to launch.
When entering Idaho, boat owners should look for road signage and electronic message boards directing them to inspection stations. Before launching a watercraft in Idaho, nonresident owners must also purchase an invasive species sticker. 
Before transporting any watercraft, Idaho law requires operators to remove the drain plug and drain all water, including from internal compartments such as ballasts, bilges, live wells, and motors. All bilge and ballast plugs and other barriers that prevent water drainage must be removed and remain open while a watercraft is transported by land within the state.
To prevent the spread of invasive species, watercraft owners can follow these steps: 

Clean all equipment before leaving any waterbody, removing visible plants and animals.
Drain water from all compartments, including motors, live wells and boats. Pull the boat’s bilge plug and allow water to drain. 
Dry all equipment thoroughly before using the watercraft in a different waterbody.

In 2024, the Idaho State Department of Agriculture’s Invasive Species Program performed nearly 157,000 watercraft inspections — a 44% increase from 2023. Throughout the history of the program, Idaho stations have performed over one million inspections.

(Getty Images)Health insurance companies are under increasing scrutiny for allegedly using artificial intelligence bots and algorithms to swiftly deny patients routine or lifesaving care — without a human actually reviewing their claims.
The high-profile killing late last year of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has focused even more attention on so-called prior authorization, the process by which patients and doctors must ask health insurers to approve medical procedures or drugs before proceeding. There had been protests and outrage over the company’s practices for months before Thompson’s death, and UnitedHealthcare has been accused in a class-action lawsuit of using AI to wrongfully deny claims.
As more patients and doctors voice their frustrations, states are responding with legislation designed to regulate prior authorization and claims reviews. So far this year, lawmakers in more than a dozen states are considering measures that would, for example, limit the use of AI in reviewing claims; exclude certain prescription medications from prior authorization rules; ensure that emergency mental health care is not delayed for more than 48 hours; and require that insurers’ review boards include licensed physicians, dentists or pharmacists with clinical experience.
Insurers have long required doctors to obtain their approval before they’ll pay for certain drugs, treatments and procedures. They argue it is necessary to rein in health care costs and limit unnecessary services. But many doctors and patients say the practice has gotten out of hand, causing delays and denials of care that are harming and even killing people.
In a survey last year by the American Medical Association, 93% of doctors said that insurers’ prior authorization practices delayed “necessary care” for their patients. Twenty-nine percent said such delays had led to a “serious adverse event,” such as hospitalization, permanent injury or death.
In 2023, insurers selling plans on the marketplaces created under the Affordable Care Act denied a combined average of 20% of all claims. Of the 73 million in-network claims they denied, only 1% were appealed, according to KFF, a health policy research group.
The federal role
Under the Biden administration, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice took a firmer hand against health care corporations alleged to be engaging in behavior resulting in limited and more expensive care for patients. The administration also approved rules requiring that beginning in 2026, Medicare and Medicaid plans create a streamlined electronic process for reviewing claims, making decisions more quickly and providing specific reasons for denying care.
Senators move prior authorization, PBM regulations

But it’s difficult to hold insurers accountable, according to Timothy McBride, a health policy analyst and co-director of a program at the Institute for Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis.
“Each part of the health care industry — hospitals, pharmaceuticals, insurers — they all have a lot of concentrated power,” McBride said in a phone interview. “And unless somebody actually takes it on directly, it’s going to stay that way. I think the Biden administration tried to take it on, but didn’t make a lot of progress.”
It’s unclear whether the Trump administration and Congress will reverse course. During his confirmation hearing on March 14, Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, defended the use of artificial intelligence in reviewing claims.
“AI can be used for good or for evil, and it to a large extent depends on who’s using it and for what purpose,” Oz told members of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee. “I think AI could play a vital role in accelerating preauthorization.”
In the past, Trump has supported measures to help patients, such as increasing hospital price transparency and lowering prescription drug prices, McBride noted. But “Republicans and conservatives generally are anti-regulation,” he said. “My gut feeling would be that they back off on the Biden push on this.”
States have limited power to act on their own. They have authority only over state-regulated health plans, which include Medicaid, plans for state workers and policies residents purchase from the ACA marketplaces. About 90 million people are covered that way. State laws do not apply to the 156 million workers, retirees and dependents who get their coverage through employer-sponsored health plans, which are regulated through a federal law known as ERISA.
Furthermore, health insurance companies are large and have deep pockets, allowing them to easily absorb state fines.
But Kaye Pestaina, the director of the program on patient and consumer protection at KFF, said states have an important role to play.
“Much of the focus around prior authorization at the federal level has kind of originated from state protections, so I imagine there will be continual activity by state legislatures to come at the problem,” Pestaina told Stateline.
What states are doing
Pestaina said states are trying a number of solutions. For example, states such as Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania have given their insurance regulators more authority to directly access claims denial information, in order to overturn decisions or potentially enforce state rules. And these efforts have largely had bipartisan support.
In Pennsylvania, Republican state Sen. Kristin Phillips-Hill pushed through bipartisan legislation in 2022 to streamline prior authorization practices for state-regulated health plans after hearing numerous complaints from patients and doctors.
The legislation created an Independent External Review organization that allows Pennsylvanians to submit an online form to request a review if their insurer denies a service or treatment. If the review organization decides the service should be covered, the insurer must do so. Before then, patients could turn only to a federal review process, which may have been more challenging to navigate and taken more time.










There is a role for some oversight to make sure that things are covered. But right now, I think the system is out of balance.


– North Carolina Republican state Rep. Timothy Reeder


“Our reforms created clear rules, clear timelines for the prior authorization process, and it removed ambiguity or uncertainty from the system that at times, insurers could exploit and providers could be confused over,” Phillips-Hill told Stateline. “Prior to that reform, if you had a denial from your insurer, you had very little recourse.”
The program began in January 2024, and in its first year the Pennsylvania Insurance Department overturned half of 517 denials, which amounted to claims from 259 people.
Jonathan Greer, president and CEO of the Insurance Federation of Pennsylvania, said his trade group worked with lawmakers to come to an agreement on how to change the prior authorization process in a way that worked for insurers and patient advocates. Greer says he thinks Pennsylvania could be a model for other states.
“Prior authorization, I think unfairly, has been characterized as a reason to say ‘no’ by insurers,” Greer said. “The purpose of prior authorization is to make sure that you know the care that you get is consistent with the care that you need.”
In North Carolina, Republican state Rep. Timothy Reeder is hopeful that his prior authorization bill will make it across the finish line this year. Reeder’s bill would set tight deadlines on insurers’ claim decisions and require companies to have licensed practitioners on their claim review boards. Insurers would also have to publicize a list of services they require authorization for.
“I’m not saying that we need to get rid of it completely,” Reeder told Stateline. “There is a role for some oversight to make sure that things are covered. But right now, I think the system is out of balance.”
But some state laws have proven to be less effective than advertised.
In 2021, Texas enacted a first-of-its-kind law creating a “gold card” standard, under which physicians whose care recommendations are approved by insurers at least 90% of the time are exempt from the prior authorization process. But as of the end of 2023, only 3% of Texas physicians had earned gold card status, according to the Texas Medical Association.
That’s why the group is pushing legislation that would require insurers to report which preauthorization exemptions they granted and denied and how many claims went to independent review. Dr. Zeke Silva of the Texas Medical Association’s legislative council said it would be “in the same spirit” as what Pennsylvania has done.
“Our focus with the [Texas Medical Association] is our physicians being able to provide the best care possible. And we want that to be free of burden,” Silva told Stateline. “We want to minimize third parties coming in and inappropriately denying care that our physicians and our patients think is in their best interest.”

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Cave City was quiet last week.
The day after a high-end EF-3 tornado ripped through the small Sharp County town with 165-mile-per-hour winds on March 14, the main stretch had been abuzz with volunteers, heavy machinery and people sifting through what remained of their homes, businesses and storage units.
Fifteen tornadoes touched down in Arkansas during the March 14-15 severe weather event, according to the National Weather Service. Three people were killed in neighboring Independence County by the same tornado that devastated Cave City. That tornado was also the longest-tracked tornado in Arkansas since 2008, according to the weather service, remaining on the ground for over 80 miles — something the service noted as being “exceptionally rare” for a tornado in Arkansas.
Fast forward a week and a half, and the atmosphere in town has changed. Power lines no longer litter the sidewalk on one side of Main Street. People weren’t slowing in their cars, gawking and taking videos on their phones as they drove past the destruction. Cell service had been restored, even if it was somewhat spotty.
The cleanup had made remarkable progress, even after a week that began with a tornado and continued with whipping winds and fires that burned homes in an already-devastated area. 
The remains of the town’s pharmacy — totalled by the tornado — are gone. Only a concrete pad and a small pile of rubble remain. The church and the grocery store are surrounded by fences, their roofs covered with tarps and sheet metal to keep out future rain. An excavator began tearing into a brick house next door to the grocery store, pulling down what remained of its roof.
Other than people operating heavy machinery — clearing debris and trees — not many people were walking around.
Irma Carrigan, who runs the Crystal River Cave Tours and Motel, said the day after the storm that she wasn’t convinced the hordes of volunteers and support that arrived in town after the storm would last. But on Wednesday, a week and a half after the tornado that totaled her car and pulled down a massive tree in her yard, crushing one of the many small buildings on her property, Carrigan said she’d been pleasantly surprised by just how much people wanted to help, noting that she hadn’t heard one complaint from those who had arrived to offer assistance.
“It has all been very positive, very caring people,” Carrington said. “They set up food centers for different places. We didn’t have to cook during all of that.”
“The volunteerism is just phenomenal,” Carrington said. Still, sometimes it could be overwhelming, she noted, being asked by volunteers how to help when those impacted themselves still weren’t sure.
“You just look ignorant to them because you’re just saying, ‘I don’t know,’” Carrington said.
The waves of volunteers ebbed about five days after the storm, Carrigan reported, but she was grateful for the help she got. A nonprofit brought in a crane, cut up the huge tree into chunks, and helped haul it onto a family friend’s truck. Some roofers reattached a part from her roof that had blown off in the storm.
Still, other things have been slow coming. Carrigan said that as of Wednesday, they were still being told they had to boil their water. Their internet only returned two days prior, and cell service wasn’t always reliable.
In the aftermath of the storm, sleep was sometimes hard to come by.
“Your brain won’t turn off,” Carrigan said. “I think mentally, you can’t shut it off. You’re still thinking, ‘What am I going to be doing tomorrow? What can I do?’ You just continue to pray that you’ll get guidance and where you need to go next.”
Walking down one of the roads that branched off from Main Street, Carrigan pointed to her neighbors’ houses. The white, two-story, former boarding house next to hers was the oldest in town, she said, and one of its occupants was on hospice. It was badly damaged.
Next door to it was a smaller house, the back of it torn open. Those neighbors, Carrigan said, were trapped under the rubble of their home for hours after the tornado hit. One of them was over 90 years old. She said she’d heard that the property had already been sold to someone else.
The yellow house even farther down was occupied by another elderly neighbor in their 90s, Carrigan reported. They planned to repair the damage, she’d heard.
Another neighbor will tear down and put in a mobile home, Carrigan said. Yet another told Carrigan they were considering a modular home.
“He said, ‘I’m too old to build. I’m too old to rebuild,’” Carrigan said of the neighbor who was considering a mobile home. “And he said, ‘I want something; I don’t want to wait two or three years to get it.’”
Some people were scared to even clean their windows until their insurance appraisers showed up, Carrigan said, leaving some in a state of limbo.
Carrigan expressed support for a federal disaster declaration, which Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders requested last week. Sander asked for additional federal help over the weekend.
“I would think they would,” Carrigan said of the federal government helping with disaster recovery. “I mean, I can’t imagine a disaster any worse.”
However, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which normally manages federal disaster responses, is in the crosshairs of the Trump administration as one of its targets to be shut down, with the Washington Post reporting that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem expressed support for removing FEMA’s role in recovering from disasters by October. 
It’s unclear how such an action would impact a federal disaster response in Arkansas if the declaration is approved. Stateline reported last month that disaster experts and states have said that they aren’t able to take on the role FEMA currently fills.
Carrigan wasn’t the only one who would like to see the disaster declaration approved. Brandi Schulz, the executive director of the Cave City Area Chamber of Commerce, said the money that would be available to both businesses and residents would help with the recovery.
“From a chamber director perspective, I know that (a federal disaster declaration) would open up some options for our businesses that were impacted,” Schulz said. “I know that there were going to be more options, supplemental options, outside of insurance if that does go through, so in that regard, I am hoping that we can get more assistance to our businesses and also to our residents.”
Schulz described Cave City as a “very DIY community,” and said that it, combined with the support of volunteers and donors, meant that the city would likely be in “a very good place” on debris removal within the next week. Roughly 59 people have been displaced by the tornado in the area, Schulz estimated.
Taking care of the physical needs of those who were affected doesn’t just mean helping clear debris, however. Schulz said the wife of the town’s fire chief, whom the chamber director said “specializes in trauma debriefing,” has been offering resources for the community.
“I think the biggest thing is people knowing that they’re not alone, that we’re here for them,” Schulz said. “And I think we’ve shown that in the last week or so.”
Carrigan expressed some frustration with communication from state and local authorities, even as she said she appreciated what they were doing and was satisfied with the rate at which cleanup and recovery had been happening. She heard that state money was available to those impacted to help with storm recovery, but wasn’t able to figure out how to apply. She said the Red Cross opened a shelter, only to close it 48 hours later.
“I went up to the Assembly of God to check out, try to find this Red Cross and they said, ‘Well, they were here, but nobody came up here to use their services,’” Carrigan said. “And I said, ‘Well, honey, nobody knew that they were here.’”
Schulz said local officials made efforts to reach people who weren’t able to get online information, at one point distributing fliers, she said. 
The Red Cross confirmed it closed the shelter due to lack of use.
“We had some families that expressed interest, and then had found other places to say,” Red Cross regional spokesperson Sharon Watson said, adding that they had been coordinating with local faith leaders and town officials to get the word out. “Some had requested hotels, and we didn’t have hotel vouchers to offer because we had a shelter set up, and our shelter was available so therefore they opted to find other places to stay, which we completely understand.”
Watson noted that the shelter wasn’t the only way it was helping the community. On Thursday, the Red Cross opened several “Multi-Agency Resource Centers” in conjunction with the Arkansas Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster for those affected by the tornado outbreak, designed to serve as a “one-stop shop” for residents to get answers from state and local authorities about disaster assistance. 
The MARCs were open from Thursday to Sunday in different cities — Diaz on Thursday, Cave City on Friday, Melbourne on Saturday, and Pocahontas on Sunday. 
Meanwhile, management of volunteers and donations was handed over to Eight Days of Hope, a Christian nonprofit, after being managed by local officials such as Schulz. 
Gale Manning, the rapid response manager for the Cave City relief efforts, said the organization will be on the ground until April 5. Volunteers have been helping cut up and haul off trees, he said, to help make the area safer. He said roughly 70 to 80 people had been volunteering on the weekdays, with volunteers coming from as far away as Alaska.
“They’re devastated,” Manning said of the people who had been impacted by the storm. “They’ve lost their life savings, belongings. But, you know, as the days go on, they feel a bit better. Again, we share the gospel and we let them know that God’s in control and that he knows what’s going on, and he promised us all a better day.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_5054-copy-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-31 07:00:24.114912

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)It feels like Oklahoma officials have lost touch with reality and think President Donald Trump must be the biggest idiot on the planet.
Because why else would they be first in line in trying to snooker the Trump administration into giving a state that has some of the worst education outcomes in the entire country essentially carte blanche power to decide how hundreds of millions of federal dollars should be spent in our schools?
Last week, our state superintendent and some Republican legislative leaders urged Trump’s administration to bypass the U.S. Department of Education’s traditional funding pathways and give federal dollars directly to the state so that Oklahoma’s Education Department can categorize schools “into types based on need” and offer a “diverse marketplace of solutions.”
Our leaders stupidly argue that federal officials tie too many administrative and bureaucratic strings to that funding. Those “strings” are used to ensure compliance with pesky things like our children’s civil rights.
In a video posted to X, Superintendent Ryan Walters said that having direct access to the funding will ensure more money gets into the classroom and to teachers and improve academic outcomes and results, instead of being tied up in administrative costs.
“This will forever change education. It will forever empower states and give states the ability to truly empower parents,” Walters said.
If this happens, it will forever change Oklahoma education, but I suspect it won’t be for the better.
Our lawmakers and Walters haven’t proven yet that they deserve this enormous amount of trust. It seems like a terrible idea to give them unchecked powers to determine winners and losers in our already struggling school system. Why on earth would we want to enable them to underfund certain rural and urban schools, increase funding to private schools, undercut services offered to impoverished or tribal students, or demolish programs that serve special education or English learners?
Walters pledged that he’d continue supporting disabled students, but made no guarantees about protecting anyone else. We don’t know how our leaders would spend the money differently in a way that bolsters math and reading literacy rates.
Recent nationwide tests showed that only 23% of fourth graders and 20% of eighth graders were proficient in reading. Only 31% of fourth graders and 17% of eighth graders were proficient in math.
Without cheating, that needle stubbornly refuses to move under our Legislature, which has wisely zeroed in on improving academic outcomes while somehow simultaneously managing to demonstrate their overall lack of understanding of how learning happens.
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said in a statement that “Oklahomans are best-equipped to determine what education should look like for our students.”
I’d like to know why he believes we’re suddenly best equipped to oversee hundreds of millions in additional dollars.
Perhaps it is because we’re bottom 10 in reading and math proficiency. Or is it because the private school tax credit program lawmakers are wasting our money on is serving an outsized number of rich families? Is it because Republicans are unveiling increasingly bizarre schemes amid growing public pressure to improve academic performance? Or maybe it is because GOP lawmakers are apparently so bad at state budgeting that they’ve padded the existing state Department of Education budget so much that Walters was emboldened to buy Bibles and give his employees $600,000 in raises, including a $45,000 payout to the agency’s chief adviser.
Meanwhile, because we can’t get enough qualified educators in our classrooms, lawmakers are looking to remove a requirement that our early childhood educators have a college degree. Even though that strategy has not measurably improved performance in the upper grades, they want to allow those without a formal education to teach our youngest students the building blocks of reading and math. Yikes. Maybe instead of lowering the standards of who we allow in our classrooms, we should just acknowledge teaching is hard and make sure we’re paying a wage that makes qualified people want to teach.
State leaders are still pointing the finger at each other for last year’s insane effort to bamboozle Oklahomans into thinking our children’s academic prowess had dramatically increased under Walters’ tutelage. In reality, our leaders secretly lowered the bar students must meet to be proficient and didn’t tell anyone — until Oklahoma Voice uncovered it. Even then Walters ignored the fiasco for months.
And for a state that likes to lament overtesting, our legislators sure are proud of mandating an unnecessary exit exam. Starting this year, Oklahoma students must complete the U.S. Naturalization Test in order to graduate. It’s just one more unnecessary hurdle that could prevent someone from graduating and distracts from our real struggles.
Frankly, none of that gives me a lot of confidence that Oklahoma’s government would know how to spend federal dollars for policies and initiatives that would ensure that our schools and students are achieving their maximum potential.
If anything, our leaders should be begging Trump’s federal government to increase its scrutiny of our school system or perhaps fund increased teacher and school support staff wages.
Because only states that meet the highest academic outcomes should be given the flexibility to control their own fate.

(Photo by Daniella Heminghaus for New Jersey Monitor)For many California residents, the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year were the latest and most searing example of the devastating effects of climate change. Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion.
“We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat. “It’s the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It’s not sustainable, it’s not right and it’s not ethical.”
Addis and Democratic lawmakers in nearly a dozen other states want to force the world’s largest fossil fuel companies to help pay for the recovery costs of climate-related disasters. Last year, Vermont became the first state to pass a “climate Superfund” law, followed soon after by New York.
This session, 10 states have seen similar proposals, several of which have advanced in key committees. Advocates point to legislation in Maryland that has drawn support in both chambers, as well as to strong grassroots support in California after the Los Angeles wildfires.
Lawmakers say the rapidly increasing cost of climate disasters — from wildfires to floods to sea level rise — is more than state budgets can bear.
“Climate Superfund is the ‘it girl’ policy of the [2025] session,” said Ava Gallo, climate and energy program manager with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “There’s a lot of popularity in the idea of holding polluters responsible.”
The momentum for these “polluter pays” bills is tied to the maturation of attribution science. That new field of research can help calculate fossil fuel companies’ contributions to historic emissions totals, as well as the role climate change played in causing or worsening natural disasters.
Vermont’s law was the first attempt to use that science to charge emitters for their role in causing devastating floods and other catastrophes.










We've had disaster after disaster after disaster. It's the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It's not sustainable, it's not right and it’s not ethical.


– California Democratic Assemblymember Dawn Addis


Fossil fuel companies and their allies have fought back hard. Late last year, the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging Vermont’s measure. The groups argue that emissions are governed by the federal Clean Air Act, precluding states from charging companies over global pollution.
Neither group responded to a Stateline interview request. The Independent Petroleum Association of America also declined an interview request.
A separate lawsuit, led by 22 Republican attorneys general, is challenging the New York law. And a conservative group has targeted Rachel Rothschild, an assistant professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, who helped draft the legal justification for climate Superfund policy. The group, Government Accountability and Oversight, has sought to subject Rothschild to a deposition, The New York Times reported, a move that some experts view as an intimidation tactic.
Meanwhile, oil and gas executives asked President Donald Trump during a White House meeting this month to direct the Justice Department to join the legal fight against climate Superfund laws, The Wall Street Journal reported. Industry leaders are also pushing Congress to shield them from more than 30 lawsuits brought by state and local governments that aim to make them pay for some of the results of climate change.
While experts expect a bruising legal battle over climate Superfund policies, the threat of lawsuits hasn’t deterred more lawmakers from backing the concept.
“States were a little bit wary; they wondered, ‘Is this some new radical plan?’” said Cassidy DiPaola, communications director with the Make Polluters Pay campaign, a coalition of groups backing such bills. “Then one of the littlest states passed it and this powerhouse, New York, passed it. That really set the ball rolling.”
Fossil fuel companies have cast doubt on attribution science. They also note that their production of oil and other products was done legally under U.S. and international regulations.
“Manufacturers will see this as a shakedown of any industry you don’t like at some point in the future, even though in the past they were licensed and operated under government regulation,” Brett Vassey, president and CEO of the Virginia Manufacturers Association, said during legislative testimony about a climate Superfund proposal in that state. “It will have a chilling effect on Virginia being able to grow its economy.”
Proponents of Superfund legislation point to legal settlements with large tobacco companies in the 1990s. Although those companies also sold their products legally, they were held responsible because they knew about the harmful effects of those products and deceived the public. Most climate Superfund proposals target companies for their emissions over the past 30 or so years, after leading experts had documented the dangers of greenhouse gases.
“There’s good documentation of how well the fossil fuel industry knew the probable long-term impacts of their product,” said Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat. “Should an industry that made such historic profits over a period of time and made so many representations that we had no problem not bear any of the costs?”
Golden and other lawmakers say it’s becoming impossible for taxpayers to cover the costs of recovery from wildfires and other catastrophes. In Rhode Island, sea level rise is causing massive damage for coastal communities, said Democratic state Rep. Jennifer Boylan, who has sponsored a climate Superfund bill to help the state adapt.
Some advocates also note that Trump’s return to the White House has cut off the possibility of federal climate relief.
“All the states are affected by the disappearance of this federal funding,” said Gallo, of the state lawmakers group. “States everywhere are going to be looking at some way to fill the gap.”
This session, climate Superfund bills have been introduced in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Virginia.
While the bills are structured differently, they all seek to target the largest polluters — often covering companies that produced 1 billion metric tons of emissions over the last 30 or so years. Lawmakers say that applies to roughly 100 companies.
The measures also take different approaches to assigning damages. Some direct state agencies to conduct complex studies to determine the costs of climate-caused disasters over a certain period, the approach pioneered by Vermont. Others set a fixed number that represents a conservative baseline for those damages. New York’s law set that figure at $75 billion over a 25-year period.
Many of the bills also require that significant amounts of the funding be directed to the communities hit hardest by pollution.
Advocates are particularly optimistic about the measures in California and Maryland.
Lawmakers in Maryland modified their bills to commission a study about the financial impacts of climate change. Those measures passed both the House and Senate, and legislators are working to reconcile the versions from each chamber. Figures produced by the study would be the backbone of a climate Superfund policy in a future session.
“From a legislative perspective, it’s a shot in the dark as to what the costs are,” said Democratic Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo, who sponsored one of the bills. “This will give us the factual data needed to make a more well-educated decision on policy.”
In New Jersey, an Assembly committee advanced a climate Superfund bill this month. State Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee and who sponsored the bill, said it will help to rebuild and fortify water treatment plants, schools and firehouses. He noted that Trump has called for the dismantling of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“The end of the world is coming; it’s kind of hard to ignore,” Smith said. “FEMA has been the backstop to help communities recover from disasters. If the handwriting isn’t on the wall to all the states that they’ve got to deal with this, shame on them.”
Lawmakers in many states have heard from mayors and other local government leaders that more climate recovery funding is essential.
“Municipal officials are getting behind [climate Superfund policies],” said Massachusetts state Sen. Jamie Eldridge, a Democrat who has sponsored similar legislation. “They’re facing the costs of flooding, of droughts, of heat waves, and really asking for relief.”

(Courtesy of Barbara Perez)OMAHA — Mele Mason recalls the days when the newsroom at Omaha TV station KMTV had journalists covering city hall, the county courthouse, the statehouse and the “cop shop.”
Reporters attended multiple other governmental meetings and community gatherings, said Mason, who worked as a news videographer at the station in the 1980s.
But those days are gone, she said, with her old newsroom now about one-third the size.
So when Mason saw that an effort was underway to address shrinking newsrooms by enlisting local residents to document actions taken at government meetings, she signed up.
“It just has been frustrating to see the lack of information that’s coming out. Coverage has gone way down. They don’t have the usual beat reporters,” Mason said.
Today, she is among about 60 people in the Omaha area who have undergone training to become “Documenters” at local government meetings, by taking notes and passing them onto editors for publication.
“I wanted to do something for the community,” Mason said. “I think it’s important that people have access to what happens at public meetings.”
Finding reporters in new places

That is one of the example of how news outlets increasingly look to ordinary folks to help them cover news events. This comes as there are fewer reporters and fewer applicants for reporting jobs, particularly in rural areas.
At Nebraska’s community newspapers, would-be citizen reporters are taking an online training course called “Earn Your Press Pass” to learn how to cover meetings. Other papers rely more on retirees, freelancers and “sports moms” to help.
At the Sidney Sun-Telegraph, Barbara Perez took the Press Pass course after being promoted from advertising manager to editor-publisher. She didn’t have any formal training as a reporter, so the Press Pass program — which she now requires of every new hire on staff — got her up to speed on issues like open meetings laws, public records and newspaper style.
“It’s especially helpful when you’re not hiring classically trained journalists,” said Perez from her office in western Nebraska. “We can’t just print anything, like the hearsay you see on social media.”
Getting creative
At the West Point News, editor Mike O’Brien lured a former news editor, Willis Mahannah, out of retirement to cover city council and county board meetings after losing a news reporter and being unable to fill the vacancy. To help cover the communities of Beemer and Bancroft, O’Brien relies on “contacts” in those towns to provide tips and stories.

“We had three full-time reporters, but now we’re down to me as the lone reporter,” O’Brien said. “Papers are finding it harder and harder to have a full staff, so definitely we’re relying more on contributions to the community.”
A recent study by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln found that there were 565 full-time reporters at print and broadcast outlets in the state.
While there was no past data to compare with the number of journalists now, Jessica Walsh, an assistant UNL professor of journalism, said there’s no doubt the number has declined.
Her effort to map and track local reporting in Nebraska found at least nine counties with no local reporting outlet and 16 county seats that had no local news organization.
Walsh said that when she talked to local editors and station managers, she was struck by the strong sense of dedication to providing local news.
But they also told her how hard it has become to hire trained journalists, particularly in rural areas.
Different era


Mapping Nebraska journalism
Part of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln report on journalists in the state included developing an interactive “map” of where reporters are located.
Jessica Walsh, the UNL professor who headed up the study, said it provides an instant look at where “news deserts” are located in the state, and where they aren’t.
Fifty-five of the state’s 93 counties in the state, the study found, have two or fewer full-time local journalists.
Walsh said the map shows the “areas of concern” for news coverage, since studies have show that civic engagement declines in areas with no coverage.
She said she hopes her work makes Nebraskans “more appreciative of their local journalist(s)” and inspires those who don’t subscribe to the local newspaper, to do so.


The result is that the remaining journalists often cover multiple towns or beats. One recent ad for an editor/reporter in central Nebraska sought someone to cover eight communities.
“When I look at this report, I don’t see that everything is horrible and there’s no hope,” Walsh said. “On the people level, there’s a lot of dedicated local journalists, covering meetings and sports at night. They’re really part of the community.”
She said she “was encouraged by all the people still working in local journalism despite the challenges.”
“They’re just really spread thin,” Walsh said.
One way local newspapers are addressing the shortage of reporters is by enlisting non-journalists to help out, said Dennis Derossett, the executive director of the Nebraska Press Association.
While many small-town papers traditionally had their “chicken dinner” correspondents, DeRossett said that the goal of the Press Pass program is to train someone to cover “true news events” and happenings in a community.
New training
The Press Pass program was created by Joey and Lindsey Young, who saw how difficult it was for western Kansas newspapers – including the three they own – to recruit college journalism grads to rural areas.
Joey Young, who served as president of the Kansas Press Association, said his wife used her background as a teacher to develop the online program. It covers topics like interviewing skills, covering meetings, writing in newspaper style and journalism ethics.
Hundreds of prospective journalists across the country have taken the course, Young said, with several advancing from correspondents or part-time reporters to full-time jobs.
“Community newspapers have to adapt. The traditional pipeline of journalists fresh out of college working in rural community newsrooms isn’t there anymore,” he said. “I think newspapers have an opportunity to pivot to this model in training interested community members into becoming good reporters.”
Documenters is a national program now active in 27 U.S. cities that seeks to train people to attend under-reported meetings and take notes – notes that can later be turned into reports on what happened.
The Nebraska program, based in Omaha, is run through the Nebraska Journalism Trust, which also operates the online news outlet, the Flatwater Free Press.
Documenting meetings
About 60 Documenters have taken the training since the Nebraska program was revived last summer, said Leah Keinama, director of civic journalism for the Trust.


Nebraska Documenters
For more information about the Nebraska Documenters program, access the website, flatwaterfreepress.org/documenters/
Earn Your Press Pass information can be obtained on the website, www.earnyourpresspass.com


About 10 of those graduates consistently cover meetings in the Omaha area, from the Omaha School Board and Omaha City Council, to the Douglas County Board and Westside School Board.
The program is seeking to expand into Nebraska’s Panhandle, to document meetings in a rural area over the next couple of months, Keinama said.
Documenters are paid $16 an hour, with a minimum of three hours paid to attend a meeting, take notes and turn them over to Keinama, who edits the notes into reports posted on the Flatwater website.
“What we want them to do is produce very objective notes of what happened,” she said. “So that if someone wasn’t at this meeting, they would understand what happened.”
Keinama said she feels that the Documenters notes offer more detail and are often more objective than the official meeting minutes generated and posted by a clerk of a government board.
The reports generated by the Documenters, besides providing accountability, can be used by full-time journalists to generate more detailed stories, she said.
The work also serves to give people a taste of what it’s like to be a reporter, Keinama, perhaps leading someone to pursue a job as a journalist.
“It’s really important for people to know that they have a place in citizen journalism and the civic process and that you don’t need special credentials or special exposure,” she said.
Leaning on viewers
Nebraska TV and radio stations have nothing akin to Documenters or Earn Your Press Pass to train regular citizens to become reporters, but they are relying more and more on video and photographs submitted by citizens, according to Jim Timm, president and executive director of the Nebraska Broadcasters Association.
The recent blizzard, Timm said, was a good example, with people sending in images of damage. Accidents and fires are other examples, he said.
Mason is well acquainted with the news landscape. Besides being a former video journalist at TV stations in Omaha and Seattle, she has her own freelance video outlet, Mason Video in Omaha.
Her firm is regularly hired by NBC, CNN, Fox and ESPN to provide video of Omaha — and Nebraska-area events. Recent live feeds included an interview with former astronaut Clayton Anderson and video from the tumultuous town hall held by U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb.
She said she was impressed by the quality of the Documenters training. Mason said she realizes that traditional news outlets don’t have the staff anymore to cover all the government meetings, but the work is important.
“It’s kind of scary that all these things could go on without anyone knowing what is going on in their government and their city,” she said.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Organizers of a Transgender Day of Visibility rally in Lansing say the event was a “living testament to trans joy, trans resistance and trans community.”
Hundreds gathered on the lawn of the Capitol for around two hours Sunday for a rally featuring speakers, dance breaks and performances by local drag queens.
Transgender Day of Visibility is celebrated internationally every year on March 31 after Michigan resident Rachel Crandall-Crocker founded the holiday in 2009 to create a day focused on the happiness of the transgender and nonbinary communities.
Emme Zanotti, senior director of movement building and political affairs for Equality Michigan, said during the rally that “Trans Day of Visibility certifies that we are here and solidifies that we are to be seen as living, breathing human beings” rather than “just accepting that who we are as human beings is to be hidden, cast aside or kept a deep, dark secret.”

While Trans Unity Coalition founder Bree Taylor said the current political climate is challenging, and transgender people have a right to feel hurt, she said it is important to “find moments of celebration in the midst of adversity and to keep showing up with that joy.”
“When we decide to exist proudly in the public eye, we disrupt every storyline that says we can only be ashamed of ourselves or invisible,” Taylor said.
Audra Wilson, who represents the transgender community on Michigan’s LGBTQ+ Commission, said events like the rally provide a safe space for people to find a sense of belonging with other members of the community and allies.
“This is somewhere where, even though we’re out in public, people get to be themselves. People get to feel safe. People get to be seen and be visible,” Wilson said.

But creating a sense of community is just as important for people who may not be as comfortable sharing their identity publicly, Crossroads founder Grace Bacon said, encouraging the crowd to host small gatherings and be intentional about forming friendships.
“We have to ferret out the people who are scared to come out, give them a place to be, a time to be, so that they can be themselves for a little while,” Bacon said.
Roz Keith, the founder of Stand with Trans, said that her goal when her son came out as transgender was to ensure that he felt supported and safe in his identity.
“What I learned through this journey is that being transgender is not about changing who you are, it’s about becoming who you have always been,” Keith said.

Taylor compared people’s gender identities to their religion.
“It’s something that can’t be casually changed because someone else disapproves,” Taylor said. “It is foundational to who we are, just like any belief that forms the very core of our own existence.”
But while Zanotti said celebrating trans joy has been meaningful, she added that it’s just the first step towards true acceptance.
“If these next generations are simply visible, it will not be enough,” Zanotti said. “It will now be our mission and our responsibility to make sure that transgender people are not just seen, but to make sure we are heard, and to make damn sure that we are understood.”

(Rick Kern | Getty Images for National Council on Aging)Dr. Fred Levin has been watching with growing alarm the national debate around federal cuts to Medicaid. He’s responsible for the medical care of about 100 older adults at the Community PACE center in rural Newaygo, Michigan. For his patients, Medicaid isn’t just a safety net — it’s a matter of life or death.
“If left to see to their own needs, a lot of them would stay in their homes and would slowly die,” he said. “They wouldn’t be able to get to their doctors’ appointments unless they had a family member to help. They wouldn’t get social care. They wouldn’t have people coming into their homes and seeing the bed bugs or the lice in their hair. They wouldn’t get their medications.”
The care at Community PACE is paid for by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities, and Medicare, the federal insurance program for people 65 and older. The center is a one-stop shop that provides medical and social services to older adults during the day, allowing them to continue living safely in their homes.
If Congress cuts funding to Medicaid, Levin expects his center would probably close. Unlike traditional nursing home care, which state Medicaid programs are required by federal law to cover, the services at PACE centers like his are an optional benefit that 33 states have opted to cover.
Around the nation, doctors, lawmakers, advocates and patients are watching anxiously as Republicans in Congress consider proposals to slash billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in proposed tax cuts. The specific nature of the funding cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states.











If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved.

The additional financial burden could blow billion-dollar holes in state budgets, forcing state lawmakers to slash health benefits or restrict who’s eligible for them. Nearly a fifth of Americans rely on Medicaid, and the percentage is even higher in some states.
“There are a lot of people who don’t pay attention to this because they think it doesn’t affect them personally,” Levin said. “But 1 in 4 people in Michigan are on Medicaid. It’s very likely you have friends or family on Medicaid.”
Nearly all Americans over age 65 are covered by Medicare, which Republicans have pledged not to touch. Medicare doesn’t cover most nursing home or other long-term care, however. Neither does most private insurance.
But Medicaid does.
“If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved,” said Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy for Justice in Aging, an advocacy group focused on addressing poverty among older people.
“Many of us have a connection to the program or will one day,” she said.
A divided front

	
Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But policy experts say that reducing coverage for some Medicaid recipients, such as the working adults who got coverage under expansion programs, will have ripple effects on vulnerable groups such as children and older adults.
Republicans aren’t united in a desire to see massive cuts.
Last month, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican governor in a purple state, publicly called on Congress not to slash Medicaid funding.
Earlier this week, Washington Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier wrote a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider cuts to Medicaid and expressing her concern about the large number of military retirees and senior citizens in her district.
Caldier, a dentist who has worked with nursing home patients, told Stateline she believes the most likely cuts would be a reduction in the amount the federal government matches state spending for working adults who are covered under Medicaid expansion. That, she said, would have little impact on older adults.
“The only caveat is that I am very worried that the leadership in our state does not have a good relationship with our president,” Caldier said. Democrats control the offices of governor and both legislative chambers in Washington state. Caldier worries that if Washington lawmakers defy the president over issues such as gender-affirming care for transgender youth, the feds could retaliate by slashing their Medicaid payments to the state.
“If we got into a political match with the president, we would lose, no matter how you slice or dice it,” she said.
In Idaho, Republican state lawmakers shot down a bill that likely would have repealed Medicaid expansion, before passing one that will introduce sweeping policy changes in an effort to control costs.
Even in Congress, some Republicans are balking, publicly defending Medicaid and warning about the consequences of deep cuts. Some who have high percentages of Medicaid recipients in their districts have urged party leaders not to cut funding for the program and have vowed to vote against any budget plan that does so.
Medicaid covers 72 million Americans. A majority of American adults, including two-thirds of Republicans, say they want Congress to either maintain current Medicaid spending or increase it, according to a February 2025 poll from KFF, a health policy research group.
President Donald Trump has said in recent months that he won’t touch Medicaid. But last month, U.S. House Republicans pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that calls for about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help counterbalance the Trump administration’s desired $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.
Facing cuts that large, states would have to figure out which benefits to chop in order to keep their budgets balanced, which is a constitutional requirement in most states.
Older adults and people with disabilities already account for more than half of states’ Medicaid spending, on average. In some states, including Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi and North Dakota, those groups account for two-thirds of state Medicaid spending.
Idaho state Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Democrat on the state Senate Health & Welfare committee, said her biggest concern is Congress reducing the federal match rate. This is the amount of money the federal government chips in to help states pay for Medicaid. How much a state receives mainly depends on how wealthy its residents are. Richer states such as California and Connecticut get less help, while poorer states get more.
In Idaho, on the poorer end of the spectrum, the feds pay about 67% of traditional Medicaid costs and 90% of Medicaid expansion costs.
“It is all a domino effect,” Wintrow said. The federal government covers about $3 billion of Idaho’s $4.2 billion Medicaid budget. “If the feds start chopping that off, it’s going to impact everything.”
Cutting care at home

	
All state Medicaid programs have opted to cover at least some home-based and community care, such as home health aides who assist people with bathing, toileting and other daily living activities, transportation and adult day care.
Kean and other experts worry that because federal law doesn’t require state Medicaid programs to cover home-based care, state lawmakers might sharply reduce spending on those services — or even eliminate coverage.
“When states have budget shortfalls, they start to tighten eligibility for the home-based programs,” said Kean. “We’re certain those would be the first to go if federal funding is cut for Medicaid.”
Paying for home-based services out of pocket would exhaust the median Medicare recipient’s savings in less than two years, according to KFF.
The median cost of a year of a full-time aide to help is about $62,400, far above the median income for Americans over 65, which is about $36,000. The median life savings for Medicare beneficiaries was $103,800 in 2023.
Home-based services are a popular benefit for state Medicaid programs, because most enrollees prefer to remain in their homes. And despite the expense, home care can be more cost effective than nursing homes — about $38,000 vs. nearly $54,000 per year in 2021, according to a KFF analysis.
Cutting Medicaid also could make it harder to recruit and keep a workforce of nursing home and home health employees.
Over the past two years, most states — even those led by Republicans — increased their Medicaid payment rates for those services, in an effort to combat the nationwide shortage of long-term care workers.
But federal funding cuts could jeopardize what states are able to pay those workers.
“There’s already a direct-care workforce crisis,” Kean said. “Even if eligibility isn’t directly cut or programs aren’t cut, there wouldn’t be enough workers to provide that care. At home and in nursing facilities, the quality of care will go down.”
In rural Michigan, Levin said the PACE center where he works employs about 100 people. Its closure would impact not only those workers, but also would mean his patients would be left to find transportation and other health services on their own, even if those services are still covered by Medicaid.
“Without access in rural areas, how are these individuals going to get to the bigger cities where they can get to their health care? It’s going to overwhelm other parts of the health care system,” Levin said.
“Everybody’s going to be responsible for taking care of the people who don’t have health insurance, in some indirect way or another. It’s going to affect us all.”

Shaundelle Brooks’ bill that would criminalize knowingly giving firearms to someone who recently received inpatient mental health treatment. 
Brooks named the bill “Akilah’s Law” in honor of her son Akilah Dasilva, who was one of four killed in a mass shooting at a Nashville Waffle House in 2018.
Brooks, a Democrat, has been lobbying for tighter gun restrictions ever since, and won her seat in the House in November after running on a platform of gun safety advocacy. This is her first session as part of the Tennessee General Assembly.
“Akilah was born here in Nashville, and his life was taken here in Nashville … my son Akilah would still be here with us today if the parents of the perpetrator had followed the instructions of law enforcement, the judicial system and medical professionals who deemed their son unfit to possess a firearm,” Brooks said Wednesday. 
“Despite being instructed by each of these oversight agencies to store their firearms safely and not return them to the shooter, the parents knowingly and intentionally disregarded those instructions, broke the law and (were) subsequently held accountable because they resided in another state,” she said.
The House Criminal Justice Subcommittee voted 6-2 to advance the bill to the House’s full Judiciary Committee. The bill still faces several hurdles before it can become law.
Brooks said the bill is focused on “upholding the law and holding those who break the law accountable.”
Travis Reinking of Morton, Illinois was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in February 2022 for killing four people and injuring four others at the restaurant with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. Illinois State Police had revoked Reinking’s firearm owner’s identification card prior to the shooting, requiring Reinking to surrender his guns to his father, Jeffrey Reinking.
Jeffrey Reinking returned the guns to his son, including the assault rifle used in the Waffle House shooting — an act that is illegal in the state of Illinois. The elder Reinking was sentenced to 18 months in prison in Illinois in March 2023.
Prosecutor: No punishment for shooter’s father under Tennessee law
Aldane Dasilva, Brooks’ son, was 12 when his brother Akilah was killed. For years, his family pursued accountability in court. 
“The law did not fail us,” Dasilva said. “It held both parties accountable: the father of the person that took my brother from me was held accountable using the same statute — the bill presented here today — by the courts of Illinois, because he broke the law.”
Tennessee had no such pathway for recourse.
In Tennessee, giving firearms to juveniles or people who are intoxicated are misdemeanor crimes. But Tennessee currently has no law against giving firearms to someone who has been committed for mental health evaluation. 
Nashville Assistant District Attorney Jan Norman was one of the prosecutors who prosecuted Travis Reinking for the Waffle House homicides. She testified Wednesday that she remembers talking with Brooks about the Illinois law.
“We were talking about that law and what the punishment was, and I said to her these words: ‘Shaundelle, it’s not enough. It’s not. The punishment is not enough. But thank God he gave him those guns in Illinois, because if that would have happened here in Tennessee, I couldn’t have done a thing about it. He wouldn’t have been punished at all if it happened in Tennessee,’” Norman said.

Brooks’ bill would criminalize the sale, offer of sale, delivery or transfer of a firearm to a person while knowing that the person has been a patient of a mental health institution – voluntarily or involuntarily – within the previous five years. It does not apply to people who were voluntarily admitted for treatment solely for alcohol abuse disorder who have no other secondary mental illnesses or substance abuse disorders.
Nashville-area psychiatrist Eric Zabriskie also testified in favor of the bill. He said firearms were the method used in 67% of the 1,245 deaths by suicide recorded in Tennessee in 2022. 
“If we continue to do nothing and take no preventative public mental health measures such as this bill, fewer (people) will make it back into (mental health) treatment, and more will go to the morgue and into the ground instead,” Zabriskie said.
Bill moves forward as Nashville remembers school shootings
Wednesday’s committee meeting fell during a time of remembrance and mourning in Nashville.
Thursday marked the second anniversary of a shooting at The Covenant School that killed 9-year-old students Hallie Scruggs, Evelyn Dieckhaus, and William Kinney as well as school headmaster Katherine Koonce, custodian Mike Hill, and substitute teacher Cynthia Peak.
Amid the public outcry for gun law reforms that followed, a 2023 special legislative session of the Tennessee General Assembly called by Gov. Bill Lee ended without the passage of any bills restricting access to guns.
On Tuesday, the Metro Nashville Public Schools Board of Education honored Antioch High School staff for their actions during a January shooting. Solomon Henderson, 17, opened fire in the school’s cafeteria, killing 16-year-old Dayana Escalante and injuring another student before taking his own life.
James Shaw Jr., who wrestled the gun away from Travis Reinking and sustained injuries in the Waffle House shooting, also testified Wednesday in favor of Brooks’ bill.
3 kids, 3 adults killed in shooting at Nashville private elementary school

“I’ve just seen the outcome of (a mass shooting), and I’ve seen how it could fracture families. I’ve seen the holes it could make. I could see how the mending doesn’t happen. And, as well, I’ve seen myself the diagnoses that I’ve had, of having PTSD and having things of that nature,” Shaw said. 
“I think it’s a step in the right way for some of the other mothers that are here from (Covenant) and from Antioch and from the other shootings that we’ve had recently here in Nashville,” he continued. “I think this is a step in the right way, so I’m very supportive of her bill, and I think it will help Nashville push forward and for us to just make laws, good laws, about gun safety and practice.”
Reps. Andrew Farmer (R-Sevierville), William Lamberth (R-Portland)), Lowell Russell (R-Vonore), Rick Scarbrough (R-Oak Ridge), Jason Powell (D-Nashville) and Gabby Salinas (D-Memphis) voted in favor of advancing the bill.
Representatives Fred Atchley (R-Sevierville) and Clay Doggett (R-Pulaski) voted in opposition.

(Justin Paget | Getty Images)West Virginia spent nearly $70 million paying to house foster children in out-of-state facilities last year because the state doesn’t have the capacity to keep children close to home. The astronomical price tag includes housing, feeding, medicating and educating hundreds of youth in foster care.
The Department of Human Services paid the bulk of the price tag. Angelia Hightower, a spokesperson for the department, said that some children were removed from out-of-state programs “due to safety concerns and educational deficiencies.”
The state continues to make payments to Devereux Behavioral Health, which operates in 11 states, despite five open West Virginia investigations against the facilities involving sexual abuse and neglect. While the company is facing multiple lawsuits over child abuse allegations, the state still has children living in Devereux facilities. The most recent payment of $5,015 was in late February, according to the state auditor’s public records.
The West Virginia Department of Education, which pays for some out-of-state education for foster children, said that every out-of-state facility had some level of findings of noncompliance that are often noted under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act during fiscal year 2024. 
“No egregious findings were noted,” said Christy Day, a spokesperson for the WVDE. “There were no findings that warranted removal of students.
Devereux was last monitored in 2018, she said. “Any educational findings/violations found at that time were corrected within one year in compliance with the U.S. Department of Education,” she said. 
Keeping children in West Virginia would be much cheaper, experts say, and allow better oversight of their treatment. But with a shortage of foster homes and in-state treatment beds, West Virginia relies on out-of-state facilities to house children, typically teens with behavioral or mental health issues. 
In 2024, Neveya (West Virginia Watch is not fully identifying her to protect her privacy) ended up in Laurel Oaks in Alabama, a residential treatment facility 706 miles from Charleston. The atmosphere was chaotic, she said. 
“I hated it there. Like every other day, there was a fight, every other day there was something,” said Neveya, 18. “I also had an issue with a girl there, and she peed on my stuff.”
Nevaya, who spent her childhood living under a bridge with her mother, had been in a facility in Charleston and attending public school. In 2024, a Child Protective Services worker put Nevaya on a flight to Alabama. Nevaya said she was given no warning but was told that the Charleston facility couldn’t support her mental health needs.
School was offered on-site at Laurel Oaks, but Navaya said her education during her five months there was minimal.
“If they had a fight on the floor that day, school’s canceled,” Neveya said. “I don’t mean to speak too harshly of it, but it’s almost like prison in a way.”
DoHS has asked lawmakers, who are right now vetting state budget requests, for a 65% increase in funding for foster care.
Del. Adam Burkhammer, R-Lewis, is a foster parent who has spearheaded legislation he hopes will reform the state’s troubled foster care system. He reiterated that the state doesn’t have enough in-state beds that can offer the kind of behavioral or mental health support these kids need.
“Right now is a really tough time. I know [DoHS] is aware of the problem, and they want to make this a focus. We all as a state and as a community should want to make this a focus,” Burkhammer said. 
“The ultimate goal is to get them back home, and the best case scenario would be with their family,” he continued. “These are our kids, our responsibility. We should do everything we can to get them home.”’

Court orders child out of state, agencies on hook to pay
The number of children coming into West Virginia’s foster care accelerated as the substance abuse crisis ravaged the state. The lack of available homes and beds in group homes has led to children being placed in hotel rooms and on campgrounds.
There are more than 5,800 children in state foster care. DoHS data shows that 471 are out of state, mostly in group residential care. 
By combing through the state auditor’s public data on spending, West Virginia Watch was able to track payments — a mix of federal and state dollars — to more than a dozen out-of-state facilities in FY 2024. WVDE paid more than $7 million for these facilities, according to the auditor’s records. 
Facilities were located in Arkansas, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah and more. One spending record showed the state paid Grafton School Residential Treatment in Virginia $687,908 last year.
Mike Folio, legal director for Disability Rights West Virginia, estimated that the state spends three times the amount of money on sending foster children out of state than it does on the ones who remain in state. His organization sued the state over alleged mistreatment of foster children, including sending them to dangerous out-of-state group homes. 
“Once they are sent out of state, they experience extreme trauma they will never recover from,” Folio said. 
Whitney Wetzel, a former DoHS spokesperson who is no longer with the agency, told West Virginia Watch in December that DoHS seeks to use out-of-state placements only when in-state services at the required level of care are unavailable. “Typically, these placements involve more intense or specialized services, which leads to increased costs,” she said.
The process for a child being sent out of state involves numerous stakeholders, and ultimately, the court makes the decision to send a child to an out-of-state facility, according to DoHS. 
“It’s important to emphasize that DoHS is one member of this selection team that recommends placements based on the child’s needs. DoHS is, however, the primary funding source and required to cover costs of court-ordered placements, even if they differ from a DoHS recommendation,” Wetzel said in an email to West Virginia Watch. 
Potential facilities to take children go through a vetting process, according to Hightower. It includes an on-site visit. Annual reviews are conducted at facilities with existing contracts to ensure compliance. 
“Social workers continue to meet the required monthly visit standards for all facilities,” Hightower said.
DoHS covers out-of-state education expenses for children who do not have an Individualized Education Program (IEP). 
The WVDE, obligated to pay for children’s education in out-of-state facilities, was invoiced for educational services for approximately 535 students in FY 2024, according to Day. Some students were listed twice due to being in multiple facilities.
The department handles the educational monitoring of these places, Day said. 
Neveya said school at Laurel Oaks was online, with an adult who was on-site to supervise if they had school for the day. There was no teacher on campus during her five months there.
“Schooling was hard. It didn’t give me much information,” she said.
Jeanette Jackson, chief executive officer for Laurel Oaks Behavioral Health Center, said any allegation at the center is thoroughly investigated. 
“Laurel Oaks Behavioral Health Hospital is committed to providing compassionate care in a safe setting to children and adolescents with psychiatric, emotional and behavioral disorders,” she wrote in an email.

Cost rising to send foster children out of state 
DoHS said they’d reduced the percentage of children in residential care from 24% to 14% over the last several years. Wetzel said they’ve tripled their spending on community-based mental health services.
A recent investigation from Mountain State Spotlight, a nonprofit newsroom, found that the state still sends children with physical or emotional disabilities to group homes and treatment centers at a rate three times the national average.
DoHS leaders recently requested more than $181 million for the foster care program in the department’s roughly $7 billion total budget request for FY 2026. It’s a 65% increase over the $110 million in the current DoHS budget for foster care.
Alex Mayer, new DoHS cabinet secretary, told lawmakers that the rising costs of out-of-state services are a budgetary risk.
“ … The limited in-state capacity and increased level of acuity among youth has also led to higher costs for out-of-state placements,” Mayer told the Senate Finance Committee on March 20. He has stressed that he is committed to working collaboratively with the Legislature to address child welfare issues. 
The state draws down federal money to help pay for children out of state. Burkhammer said federal reimbursement rates for out-of-state placements are part of the price problem.
“There could be a potential savings if we can bring those kids home and take care of them at home,” Burkhammer said.
Folio called on lawmakers to study how much the state is spending sending children out of state and, in response, invest those resources in community-based programs to keep children close to home.  
“The taxpayers will save millions of dollars,” he said. 
In February, Neveya was in Charleston, getting ready for a formal event at a nearby high school, excited to wear a long ruby red gown.
The teenager is back home in West Virginia after aging out of state care. She is living with a foster family who kept in contact with her when she was sent to Alabama. After years of poor education in facilities, they’re helping her get caught up on schooling so she can graduate.
She credits her new family and a therapist for helping her make it to this point. 
When asked what she’d tell the state foster care leaders, she replied, “I would want them to know that they need to have better facilities, because it sucked.”

Prior to the pandemic, Nebraska’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was consistently around 3.0%, ranging from 2.8% to 3.2%.
Nebraska’s preliminary unemployment rate still remains among the lowest nationally, tying for fifth lowest in the recently released data that reflects February. The national seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for February is 4.1%, up from 3.9% a year earlier.
Labor Commissioner Katie Thurber said the uptick appears to be driven by an increase in the state labor force.
“When someone enters the labor force and begins searching for work, they are classified as unemployed until they find a job,” she said. “Both new entrants and re-entrants into the labor force were up in February, and Nebraska’s labor force is now at an all-time high of 1,077,890 participants.”
The number of employed and unemployed people in the labor force are based on a U.S. Census Bureau survey on employment status. Both individuals who are claiming unemployment benefits and those who are not claiming the benefits can be counted as unemployed based on their survey responses. 
Those not working or seeking a job are not considered part of the labor force and are not included in the unemployment rate calculation.
The number of filled nonfarm jobs was 1,048,487 in February, up 6,569 over a year earlier. Private industries with the most growth over the past year were private education and health services (up 5,889 jobs) and mining and construction (up 1,803 jobs).

Minneapolis on Thursday has become the fourth U.S. city to ban algorithmic rental price-fixing software, joining San Francisco, Philadelphia and Berkeley, California, in a growing wave of legislation aimed to protect renters from rental price-gouging.
While momentum builds at the city level — with Portland, Oregon; Providence, Rhode Island; and San Diego exploring similar laws — statewide bans have been slower to emerge.

The legislation targets tools such as RealPage’s YieldStar, which uses landlord-shared data to recommend rent increases — a practice critics say worsens unaffordable housing. Stateline reported last year that the algorithms have drawn increasing oversight attention as the country continues to wrestle with an affordable housing crisis.
Colorado joins lawsuit alleging property management company illegally fixes rent prices

“This wave of action shows that local governments are stepping up where federal enforcement takes time,” said Ivan Luevanos-Elms, executive director of Local Progress, the national network helping coordinate these efforts.
In 2024, proposed legislation failed to prohibit the use of these algorithms stalled in  Illinois, New York and Rhode Island.
Washington state has seen the most movement, with a proposed ban passing the Senate and awaiting a House vote.
Colorado’s House approved a similar bill last week, and it’s now headed to the Senate. House Bill 25-1004, introduced on the first day of the state’s legislative session, would regulate rent-setting computer algorithms. A report from 2024 that has since been removed from the White House website found that Denver renters who live in buildings that rely on such algorithms pay an average of $136 more per month.
Landlords resist
Elsewhere, New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul has proposed legislation to ban algorithmic rent-setting tools, while Oregon lawmakers are considering an expansion of city-level bans. Lawmakers in Arizona, California, Idaho, Illinois, Georgia, New Hampshire, Hawaii have introduced bills, but none has advanced.
The legislative surge follows lawsuits against RealPage and six major landlords, accused by the U.S. Department of Justice and 10 state attorneys general of collusion and anticompetitive practices. Those attorneys general include Colorado’s Phil Weiser. But with court cases expected to drag on for years, cities are opting for faster action.
Still, these bans have met resistance from real estate and landlord groups. In Oregon, landlords and property managers argue the software helps manage rentals more efficiently.
“Without these tools, we must rely on outdated methods,” said Oregon landlord Aaron Douglas in submitted testimony. “This isn’t just an inconvenience; it’s a step backward.”

Gov. Bill Lee will include $20 million in the state’s budget for victim-serving agencies that — for weeks — have issued public pleas for help to keep their doors open in the face of steep cuts to federal grants. 
Sexual assault centers, domestic violence shelters and child abuse counseling agencies — many serving key roles in working with law enforcement to bring perpetrators to justice — have seen their share of federal Victims of Crime Act funding dwindled from a peak of $68 million in 2018 to $16 million last year.  
In response to these cuts, 35 other states took action to provide state funding. Tennessee was not one of them, until now. 
“Some of the victim services units are struggling to provide the services that are needed, particularly for our law enforcement and for the victims of crime in our state,” Jim Bryson, commissioner of the Department of Finance and Administration, said Tuesday in presenting the supplemental budget proposal to lawmakers. 
The governor’s funding — $10 million in grants for each of the next two years — fell short of the request for $25 million in recurring state funding a coalition of state nonprofits say they need to preserve current services.

Advocates, disappointed when the governor’s budget initially included no state funding for crime victims, nevertheless called it an important first step but are still seeking a long-term dedicated crime victim funding.
“This funding is an important acknowledgment of the urgent crisis facing Tennessee’s victim service providers,” said Stephen Woerner, executive director of Tennessee Children’s Advocacy Centers, which provides counseling and other services to children who have suffered abuse.
Woerner stressed the need for sufficient and sustained funding long-term. 
The Victims of Crime Act, or VOCA funding, relies on the fees and fines collected from individuals prosecuted in federal courts. It has seen a drastic drop in collections as prosecutors made a concerted shift to accept more plea deals — a trend that preceded the current Trump Administration.
A short-term infusion of COVID-era funding helped bridge the gap, but those funds have now ended.
Collectively, Tennessee organizations receiving VOCA grants serve more than 95,000 victims in Tennessee each year, according to the state’s Office of Criminal Justice Programs.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Some North Dakota health agencies are trying to adjust to the sudden loss of federal funding. 
The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services learned last week it lost about $3.2 million in federal funding for substance-use treatment and mental health programs after block grants were rescinded by a federal agency. 
In an evening email on March 24, the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration told HHS that the COVID-19 pandemic-era grants were taken back in accordance with President Donald Trump’s executive order empowering the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency to cut costs.
“These grants were issued for a limited purpose: To ameliorate the effects of the pandemic,” the email stated. “The end of the pandemic provides cause to terminate COVID-related grants. Now that the pandemic is over, the grants are no longer necessary.
The grants were scheduled to expire Sept. 30.
Pam Sagness, executive director for the Behavioral Health Division for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in 2021 the department received the five block grants to target substance abuse prevention, treatment and mental health programming totaling about $9.5 million. The funding for these grants came from the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.
Renae Moch, public health director for Bismarck-Burleigh Public Health, said the organization received $115,000 from HHS to develop plans for a 24/7, 365-day facility to focus on crisis response, mental health and addiction services, rather than treating patients in an emergency room.
“How we were notified and how this kind of went down has just been unbelievable,” Moch said.
  Renae Moch (Provided)
She said she received a general notification from HHS last Tuesday morning that their block grant funding was going to be impacted, but she was still unclear about what that meant and what funding was being rescinded. She got a call back about 4:30 p.m. from the department, 45 minutes before she was to present and hopefully award funding from the grant during a Bismarck City Commission meeting.
“I had to kind of refocus and compose myself before going up to the meeting at 5:15 p.m.,” Moch said. The presentation and contract award were pulled from the agenda.
Sagness said 42 grantees statewide will lose federal funding.
“Our focus now is on ensuring that services continue by identifying alternative funding and working with providers to minimize disruptions,” Sagness said in a statement. “It’s important for North Dakotans to know that support remains in place. Anyone struggling should continue to reach out for help, including through (calling) 988 or their local behavioral health provider.” 
The department received notice the grants were being terminated the day the funding was rescinded, Sagness said.
Holly Scott, a spokesperson for Fargo Cass Public Health, said its state partners confirmed that its funding for social detox center operations will run out after September.
“Our leadership team is currently working to determine the impacts of these changes, while also reviewing alternate sources of funding to assure long-term sustainability,” Scott said in an email.
Other organizations impacted by the loss of block grant funding:

Connect Us Therapy, Williston – $50,000 for crisis response and law enforcement mental health support
Corner Post Counseling, Mandan – $30,000 for crisis response and law enforcement mental health support
Public Health & Tribes, 23 contracts – $200,000 for substance-use prevention
Flint Communications, Fargo – $824,951 for Parents Lead, opioid messaging initiatives and marketing statewide
BeMoreColorful, Fargo – $160,000 for behavioral health workforce tools

“All of the planning and all of the work that has gone into it and now, here we are,” Moch said.
She said they don’t want to abandon the project, but the organization is going to have to come up with alternate funding sources.
“We will be losing months,” Moch said. She’s also hopeful a new grant or funding source can be identified before the city and county begin their budget discussions over the summer.
Agriculture research loses momentum with federal payments uncertain

Separate federal funding through the Health Equity Immunization Grant was also rescinded for Bismarck-Burleigh Public Health, she said. That funding impacted the organization’s ability to provide free COVID-19 tests and a portion of the salary for a vaccine specialist.
“It’s all related to the same decision,” Moch said. She added that arguments about the pandemic being over and the funding not being needed don’t hold water because they are still working through the impacts of COVID-19. That funding was supposed to continue until 2026, Moch said.
“The abrupt impacts on us at the local level is what is just so unexpected and so we’re just really trying to scramble now because there was no notice,” she said.
In an interview with the North Dakota Monitor, Gov. Kelly Armstrong said the COVID-19 pandemic has been over for three years, but he has been in contact with HHS to get a handle on the impacts to state health providers.
“I’m glad it happened during the legislative session so we can figure out how we readjust our budget and figure out how to finish off the session,” Armstrong said.
In a news release, the Department of Health and Human Services said it was evaluating funding options for the loss in federal block grants and will collaborate with other state agencies, organizations and private partners to address priority areas. The department said it will provide updates as more information becomes available.

In this January 2024 photo, an information screen for visitors at Sauk Prairie Hospital displays a recruiting message directed at health care workers. (Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)As more Wisconsinites need more hospital care, the supply of health care workers to provide that care remains slim — and to change that outlook will take concerted effort, according to a new report released Monday.
“Wisconsin’s health care workforce must grow faster,” says the 2025 Wisconsin Health Care Workforce Report, produced by the Wisconsin Hospital Association (WHA).
“Health care employers are working hard to retain current employees, re-recruit those who left for what they thought might be greener pastures and attract new talent to health care fields in Wisconsin,” the report states.
The report finds some glimmers of improvement and promising pathways for hospitals to further address their need for more trained staff. Over the last two years hospital job vacancies have fallen slightly and employment has increased.
But filling jobs remains a challenge and will remain that way for years, the report states. It suggests  a combination of strategies to overcome current trends.
Some of the strategies involve  how hospitals themselves structure jobs and hiring practices. But the report contends other sectors — government, educational institutions, and the insurance companies and government programs that pay the lion’s share of health care bills — will also need to shift their policies.
Reimbursement rates are not keeping up with increased costs as hospitals and other providers weather rising payroll and supply expenses, for example, the report finds.
By far the dominant contributor to the workforce challenges hospitals and health systems face, however, is demographic, according to the report. Wisconsinites continue to get collectively older.
“Only Wisconsin’s population over 65 has grown between the 2010 and 2020 census,” said Ann Zenk, senior vice president of workforce and clinical practice for the hospital association. The working-age population ages 18 to 65 decreased in that same period.
Those younger than 40 go to the hospital once a year on average. From ages 40 to 65 that ticks up to three times a year. After 65, “it doubles to six visits a year,” Zenk  said.
“As we age, we need more health care,” she said. “That is going to be a double challenge for hospitals because our available workers are a smaller pool and our demand is even greater.”
The population preparing to enter the workforce — people ages 19 and younger — “is not large enough to replace retiring baby boomers,” the report states. “Growing the health care workforce needed to respond to this demographic challenge will require increasing in-migration, ensuring access to career pathways and increasing interest in hospital careers.”
That starts with giving students in high school or even earlier “the opportunity to have exposure — you’re walking in the shoes of what it’s like to be a health care professional,” Zenk said.
Then there’s the education process itself — “making sure that educational pathways remain accessible,” Zenk said. The report urges policymakers not to add requirements to training programs that would make them longer, more complex or more expensive.
One promising training innovation, said Zenk, is the use of an apprenticeship program to prepare new registered nurses, pioneered in the last few years in Wisconsin by UW Health and the state Department of Workforce Development.
While the program stretches over four years for the equivalent of a two-year associate degree, she said, it also allows the participating students to “earn while you learn.” The concept is being expanded to prepare respiratory therapists.
The report also identifies generational shifts in what people expect from their jobs. Zenk said addressing demands for more flexible and family-friendly schedules can make it possible to hire and retain more successfully. But those changes may also mean demand for even more personnel.
“So where you need a roster of 10 nurses, you need 15 now to cover the exact same shift,” Zenk said.
The report also sees technology offering some relief.
Some of that might be replacing people for tasks such as registering at the front desk for a medical visit, Zenk said. But another example is monitoring equipment that could go home with a patient and be checked remotely, with nurses and clinicians visiting the patient at home every day, she observed.
Zenk said some regulations in health care can be reexamined and streamlined without endangering safety or the quality of care.
Physician assistants, for example, collaborate with and are overseen by a medical doctor. Zenk said in the past a physician could supervise no more than four PAs. That has since been relaxed, making it less burdensome for both doctor and PA alike, she said.
Zenk said another form of regulation has gotten worse, however: When health insurers interpose an increasing number of steps for them to sign off on the care a doctor or hospital provides.
“That requires staff to make those phone calls or enter that data, or requires physicians to document more and more and more to justify the care that they want to provide and that the patient needs,” she said.
She’s seen insurer-driven requirements increase in the last five years.
“That’s a major tug-of-war on clinicians’ time,” Zenk said, “and for patients also very frustrating.”
In the end, however, there’s no single silver bullet to resolve what is likely to be a persistent challenge for hospitals or their employees.
“There’s no one answer. We’re more than likely not going to be able to grow ourselves out of this one fast enough,” Zenk said. “But anything we can do to grow the workforce faster is going to help.”

“We usually will have a lot more sponsorships by now,” Fuad, communications organizer for the Providence nonprofit that empowers youth of color to fight for education justice and pursue career success, said on March 21.



401Gives starts at 6 a.m., Tuesday, April 1, and ends at 6 p.m., Wednesday April 2.

Several corporate sponsors from past years have recently emailed ARISE to say they cannot help with this year’s Visibility Event on May 8 at The Guild in Pawtucket because of changing priorities in a new political climate, Fuad said. 
It’s why there is a stronger sense of urgency for ARISE and other local nonprofit organizations that work to advance social justice as they gear up for 401Gives on Tuesday, April 1. 
About 600 nonprofit organizations serving Rhode Islanders have registered for the 6th annual 401Gives, the day of online giving that takes its name from the state’s area code. About 90 participating nonprofits are led by people of color, said Nancy Wolanski, director of the Alliance for Nonprofit Impact at the United Way of Rhode Island, which organizes the annual event.
Even before President Donald Trump President Trump signed an executive order dismantling Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) programs on his first day back in the White House, companies were already scaling back their DEI initiatives. Corporate charitable giving may be following suit. One high-profile example: The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, established by Meta co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, announced in February that it was ending its “social advocacy funding,” which included racial and gender equality initiatives, to focus instead on biology and AI.
“I would definitely reaffirm that there are concerns in organizations working in DEI, organizations working in racial justice, and it’s the time for us to come together as a community to really support them,” Wolanski said. “Those organizations are seeing more difficulty in fundraising, just in general, from philanthropy, and from the federal government that has closed some funding streams.”
401Gives raised over $3.8 million last year from over 16,000 donors who supported a total of 597 different Ocean State nonprofits. ARISE raised $38,806 last year, exceeding its $35,000 goal, and engaging a total of 595 donations to win the “Most Unique Donors” award for the third year in a row. 
This year, ARISE hopes to raise at least $45,000, Fuad said. Its 2025 401Gives talking points for donors will specifically highlight the organization’s work protecting civil liberties, such as testifying in favor of the Freedom to Read Act at the State House, and co-hosting “Know Your Rights” workshops around immigration, special education and bilingual education. 
Fuad said past fundraising outreach largely focused on ARISE staff sharing stories about their work, personal development and political engagement, or ARISE youth talking about their positive feelings from participating in the organization’s leadership training and advocacy programs.
For the last three years, ARISE has won a prize for peer-to-peer fundraising for small organizations — those having annual budgets between $151,000 and $500,000 — for its success in enlisting the help of alumni, staff, volunteers and the youth who participate in its programs. They send texts, promote times when matching gifts are available and share updates on group chats throughout the day. This year, youth participants working as a team have been given a goal to raise $4,000, Fuad said.
Starting at 6 a.m. on Tuesday, the first $20,000 raised during 401Gives will be matched by the Papitto Opportunity Connection. The maximum match per donor, per nonprofit, is $500. Last year, the early morning match lasted for just under two minutes. ARISE’s entire board, staff members and other supporters set their alarms to be ready to make a donation to secure matching dollars before the threshold is reached, Fuad said. 
Other matches are offered at noon and 4:01 p.m. on the first day. Online giving continues through 6 p.m. on Wednesday, April 2. The short fundraising window helps fuel “one big burst of collective energy,” Fuad said.
“It’s a really good energizer for us,” Fuad added. “We connect with our base, and it’s a reminder that this work is very community-led, that we really need individual donors to buy into our mission and buy into our work and buy into our programming.”
Likewise for Rhode Island Black Storytellers (RIBS). The Providence nonprofit dedicated to performing and sharing stories from Black history and culture in school programs and public performances has participated in 401Gives since its inception in 2020. RIBS raised $10,528 last year from a total of 118 donors, more than doubling its goal of $5,000.

Funding operations too
This year, RIBS set a goal to raise $25,000, said RIBS Executive/Festival Director and founding member Valerie Tutson. The fact that the contributions are unrestricted and can go towards general operating expenses is a big deal, she added.
“The challenge is, since our programming has grown, how do we support the operation?” Tutson said. “That’s why for us 401Gives are so important.”
Just last week, a bank’s charitable foundation delivered disappointing news to RIBS on a $25,000 grant it had applied for.
“The response to us was, ‘We have changed our funding priorities,’” Tutson said. “That was the wording that came from them.”
RIBS received a $10,000 challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Arts last year to support its Funda Fest, a 10-day Black storytelling celebration every January with performances at schools and public and private venues that takes its name from the Zulu word for “to speak/learn.”
“It was kind of an entry level grant to help an organization like RIBS, which doesn’t have a full-time development person and might not have all the time and resources to navigate how a governmental grant proposal goes in,” Tutson said. “(They) eliminated that program and now all organizations have to go into the same pool.”
RIBS was founded in 1998. Before the rise of DEI, its community outreach emphasized multiculturalism and strengthening literacy education and now will continue to do so, Tutson said.
“We’ve always been the Rhode Island Black Storytellers,” Tutson said. “It’s only been the last few years that we’ve been able to say, ‘Hey, if you’re concerned about justice, then you can really support our work.’”
On its 401Gives profile page, the group says it does not just tell Black stories but wants to help others do the same. “RIBS knows it is important for Black communities to know their own history and culture, and for others to experience Black culture presented by Black people,” it reads.

Barbara Brown, Kendra Drone-North and Sheila Beal all filed separate complaints against the BLR in 2024 — April, May and September, respectively — in the U.S. District Court [&#8230;]","(John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)Three African American women are suing the Arkansas Bureau of Legislative Research in federal court, alleging they experienced racial discrimination while working for the nonpartisan state agency.
Barbara Brown, Kendra Drone-North and Sheila Beal all filed separate complaints against the BLR in 2024 — April, May and September, respectively — in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. Little Rock civil rights attorney Austin Porter Jr. is representing all three plaintiffs.

B. Brown complaint redacted 
The BLR assists members of the General Assembly with drafting legislation, researching state policies and financial matters and codifying legislation that becomes law, among other things.
The three plaintiffs claim their non-Black superiors at the BLR, including Director Marty Garrity, failed to promote them into jobs for which they were qualified and instead hired less experienced non-Black employees, despite the plaintiffs’ positive performance evaluations. They also claim the BLR retaliated against them for complaining about the discrimination.
The jury trial in Brown’s case is scheduled to begin Oct. 6 in U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker’s courtroom. Drone-North’s case will go to trial Dec. 9 with U.S. District Judge Lee Rudofsky presiding.
U.S. District Judge D.P. Marshall Jr. is responsible for Beal’s case, and the trial is scheduled for June 2027, according to court documents.
All three women filed complaints against the BLR with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2023. The plaintiffs claim the discrimination was based on age in addition to race, and they assert that the BLR violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which protects people from employment discrimination on the basis of “race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.”

North complaint redacted 
The BLR, represented by the state Attorney General’s office, filed responses to each complaint in which it denied the allegations of discriminatory and retaliatory behavior.
Beal and Drone-North were fired from BLR before filing their lawsuits. The BLR’s response to Brown’s complaint in August 2024 states she was “currently an employee of BLR.”
Brown’s complaint alleges that Garrity and other BLR administrators repeatedly told her she had “not yet met the years of experience qualification” for promotions and pay increases. The BLR admitted this claim in its response but denied the allegation that non-Black employees were promoted without meeting the “years of experience” standard to which it held Brown.
The BLR repeatedly denied in its response to Drone-North’s complaint that younger, less qualified white women regularly received promotions the plaintiff sought.
The agency admitted in its response to Beal’s complaint that an employee who had worked at the BLR for less than a year received a promotion in “violation of BLR policy.” Beal’s complaint states that the other employee had been at the BLR for less than a year, the minimum amount of experience required before a promotion.

Beal complaint redacted 
The BLR also asserted in its responses that sovereign immunity nullifies the plaintiffs’ claims. Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that the state cannot be sued in its own courts.
Additionally, Brown and Drone-North failed to exhaust their administrative remedies before filing lawsuits, according to the BLR.
Garrity declined to comment on the pending litigation Thursday when reached by email, saying she would “let the responses speak for themselves.” Megan Markham, a spokesperson for Attorney General Tim Griffin, said in an email that the office “will continue vigorously defending the case.”
 Legislative involvement

While the BLR is a defendant in all three lawsuits, the State of Arkansas is also a defendant in Brown’s suit because the Arkansas Legislative Council’s executive subcommittee had “knowledge and willful disregard for Ms. Brown’s civil and employee rights,” her complaint states.
The executive subcommittee is responsible for overseeing appeals of investigative reports into discrimination complaints against state agencies. Brown filed a complaint against the BLR in early 2021, and the subcommittee met to discuss the issue, as reflected in both Brown’s legal complaint and the panel’s April 2021 meeting agenda.
The panel’s May 2023 agenda similarly states that it discussed a BLR “personnel matter.” Such discussions are not open to the public.
Brown and Drone-North both filed EEOC complaints in February 2023, and the BLR hired Little Rock attorney Carolyn Witherspoon to investigate, according to both women’s legal filings.
“However, rather than truly investigating the plaintiff’s complaint of discrimination, Carolyn Witherspoon looked for ways to nullify the plaintiff’s complaint,” Drone-North’s legal complaint states.
Brown claimed the BLR retaliated against her for “providing aid and agreeing to be a witness” in Drone-North’s complaint to the EEOC. Brown said the BLR used this as a reason to reprimand her; the agency denied this allegation in its response to her complaint.
The legislative subcommittee voted to affirm Witherspoon’s findings and reject the two appeals at the May 2023 meeting. The findings included that Drone-North’s EEOC complaint “did not have merit,” her legal complaint states.

Brown was mentioned by name during the public portion of the meeting before the votes, while Drone-North was not. However, the subcommittee was “concerned about the veracity and the accuracy of many statements made during the investigation” into Drone-North’s complaint, said the panel’s then-vice chairman, Rep. Bruce Cozart, R-Hot Springs.
Drone-North was fired from the BLR the following day, while Brown “was reprimanded” and experienced “consequences” later that month, according to both legal complaints.
Four months later, the Legislative Council’s Claims Review and Litigation Reports Oversight subcommittee was tasked with approving a $15,000 mediation settlement agreement between Drone-North and the BLR over her EEOC complaint, according to documents that have since been removed from the Legislature’s website. The subcommittee’s Sept. 13, 2023, meeting was canceled, meaning there was no action for the full council to approve later that day, though the matter was listed on the council’s agenda.
Drone-North’s complaint does not mention the potential settlement.

Meanwhile, Garrity fired Beal in February 2024 after Beal responded negatively to Garrity reprimanding her, according to the legal complaint. Beal claimed the reprimand was retaliation after she filed her second discrimination complaint to EEOC a few months prior. She was fired a month after the death of her son, of which Garrity was aware, Beal’s legal complaint states.
All three plaintiffs request back pay, compensatory damages, attorney fees and declarations that the BLR engaged in unlawful employment practices. Beal and Drone-North seek re-employment by the BLR; Brown seeks an injunction against the BLR engaging in further discrimination, as well as a formal promotion into the BLR position for which she claims she carried out the responsibilities but did not receive the title or appropriate pay.
 Legal representation

Porter, the plaintiffs’ attorney, said the three lawsuits are unlikely to be combined into a class-action lawsuit, which consists of a group of plaintiffs claiming the same injury and representing others who are not involved in the litigation.
Porter specializes in civil rights and employment discrimination litigation. In January, he testified against the eventual Act 116 of 2025, which Republican lawmakers claimed would force public entities to prioritize “merit” over “preferential treatment” in contracting and hiring practices.
“‘Merit,’ in a lot of people’s minds, means simply white,” Porter told a Senate committee.
The state’s Republican-led Legislature doesn’t seem to “have any interest” in protecting the state’s Black employees, who currently fill “a large part” of lower-level positions, Porter told the Advocate Tuesday.
In 2017, Porter represented Doris Smith in federal court when she alleged that the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration discriminated against her as a Black woman. Smith’s allegations were similar to those of the BLR complainants: she claimed the finance department failed to promote and pay her equitably to her white counterparts, retaliated against her for complaining about the apparent discrimination and fired her in 2018 after she filed a formal complaint.
A jury ruled in Smith’s favor in June 2020, awarding her $223,333.81 in back pay and $108,000 in compensatory damages. She was later reinstated as a finance department employee.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)The League of Women Voters of Kentucky joined with other advocacy groups at the Capitol Rotunda on March 28 for the Democracy Principle Rally. Why? Because our representative democracy rests on a fundamental principle: We, the people, have a right to participate in decisions that affect us. 
The League of Women Voters of Kentucky has documented how Kentucky’s legislative process, since 1998, has been manipulated in ways that increasingly minimize public input, stifling full and open debate on significant legislation.
The 2025 legislative session was no exception, with numerous bills passed and sent to the governor using fast-track maneuvers and undemocratic tactics, often in combination. Legislators used combinations like these:

File a “shell bill” with minor changes to existing law and assign it to a standing committee.
Rush a bill by holding bill readings on the chamber floor before the committee even discusses and votes on the bill.
Reschedule committee meetings with short notice to the public.
In committee, introduce and vote on a substitute bill that some committee members cannot access before the meeting and the public has not seen.
Send the bill for a floor vote that same day, giving non-committee legislators and their constituents little time to review the new language.
Then, the shenanigans rinse-and-repeat in the next chamber. 
 If such strategies produce a bill different from the originating chamber, specially appointed committees can produce yet another version for a final vote before the public and many legislators have time to review.

These strategies not only interfere with public participation, but legislators themselves may have limited access to bill substitutes before a vote, let alone journalists whose job it is to inform the public. Overall, these fast-tracking methods are unnecessarily hasty and may lead to careless mistakes or laws that are out of step with public opinion. Lawmaking should not be reduced to power plays, but be approached with careful consideration of intended and unintended consequences. 
KY legislature again excluded public via fast-track maneuvers, says League of Women Voters

Among the bills that were passed using one or more of these maneuvers were:

HB 4, restricting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and constraining instruction in public postsecondary institutions. 
HB90, originally focused on free-standing birthing centers, but last-minute additions included abortion-related provisions. 
HB241, a two-page bill allowing school districts to adjust calendars due to weather-related emergencies had multiple provisions about virtual education programs added on the Senate floor. 
HB 695, included last-minute changes to the state Medicaid program by adding mandatory work requirements for able-bodied adults. 
HB 775, a four-page bill on development districts that transformed to a 108-page bill making substantive taxation changes beyond development districts. 
SB 202, a five-page shell bill making innocuous word changes that became a 60-page bill to regulate the sale of cannabis-infused beverages.

Prior to these past two sessions, the League made recommendations to the General Assembly on how to strengthen public participation by respecting the Democracy Principle. We described how Kentucky’s Constitution, laws and legislative process rules actually provide opportunities for public participation in the lawmaking process. We urged the legislature to respect these constitutional and statutory requirements alongside its own procedural rules.
The 2025 legislative session lacks evidence that the General Assembly has taken these recommendations to heart. That’s why we took the message to the Capitol on the last day of the session, to unequivocally affirm that there should be no laws about us, without us. That is the heart of the Democracy Principle, and we will not let the people be ignored.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_3756-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-03-31 06:02:06.278286

Tina Spears called The Rhode Island Social Media Regulation Act were to succeed in the Rhode Island General Assembly. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current) Some things a Rhode Islander can do for the first time, legally, when they turn 18: Vote for president, visit a casino, or smoke a pack of cigarettes. 
A bill introduced by Rep. Tina Spears, a Charlestown Democrat, in the Rhode Island House of Representatives last week would add “use social media” to that list of coming-of-age privileges. 
“What it really does is it prohibits direct messaging on accounts for these youth who are under 18,” Spears said while introducing her bill Thursday, “They will not be able to use the platforms as they are currently structured today.” 
Spears reminded her colleagues on the Rhode Island House Committee on Innovation, Internet and Technology that the U.S. Surgeon General successfully curtailed smoking rates over time, and the same office recently cast youths’ social media usage in the same light. 
“The Surgeon General states, ‘We cannot conclude that social media is sufficiently safe for children and adolescents,’ which tells me as a policymaker and lawmaker, that we should be taking action to ensure that we are protecting our youth,” Spears told the committee, citing that youth often come into contact with self-harm content online.
Spears’ bill, The Rhode Island Social Media Regulation Act is a comprehensive effort to age-restrict social media usage and would require global social media platforms with more than five million users to verify the age of any Rhode Island user. Minors would not be able to make or use an account without their parent or guardian’s consent, and users would have two weeks to verify their identities.
Spears posed the bill as a public health effort as well as an attempt to shut off the illicit channels and activities young people can encounter in sparsely regulated online spaces.
“We do not allow drug trafficking, human trafficking, sextortion — any of those actions we do not allow in public venues in any way. Nor should we allow it on a social media platform,” the lawmaker said.
In addition to the restrictions on DMs, parents would have access to their children’s accounts, and minors would not be able to access social media sites between 10:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. without parental consent.  
Pure direct messaging apps “where messages are shared between the sender and the recipient, only visible to the sender and the recipient,” as the bill text puts it, would presumably exclude services like Signal and WhatsApp from the bill’s reach. But it’s unclear whether something like Discord, which is a messaging app with social-media-esque aspects, would be subject to the proposed law.
Companies who violate the regulation would see a $2,500 fine per violation, and a $5,000 penalty for repeat violations. The bill imagines the Department of Business Regulation would oversee the regulatory process, although Spears told the committee, “They don’t feel they’re equipped to actually oversee this,” and have suggested pursuing other options for the regulatory framework. 
There’s no equivalent bill on the Senate side currently. Spears’ bill has some slight bipartisan support, thanks to House Minority Leader Mike Chippendale of Foster signing on as a cosponsor.

‘You cannot trust what they’re doing on these, right?’
Another bill heard in the same committee meeting led by Rep. Megan Cotter, an Exeter Democrat, features five of the same sponsors as Spears’ bill. It would require companies which provide online services youth are likely to access to keep minors in mind when designing their platforms and is based on a similar law in California that passed in 2022.
“I just want to preface first that I’m in full support of Representative Spears’ bill. My bill is slightly different. If I had a choice, I would choose hers over mine, to be clear,” Cotter said with a laugh as she sat before the House committee.
Cotter said her bill derives from a parent’s love — and concern. “When we first have a child, you get your first car seat for your child, go down to the police station…[and] make sure you’ve put it in your car safely,” Cotter said. 
Then Cotter held up her phone and added, “Then they get to teenage years, and we give them one of these, and you cannot trust what they’re doing on these, right? We kind of know there are no guardrails for them.” 
Cotter said she “expected the tech lobbyists” to lobby against her bill. 
After Cotter presented her bill, tech committee Chair Rep. Jacquelyn Baginski, a Cranston Democrat, said, “Mom’s intuition should never be ignored. I think some of those big tech lobbyists you mentioned, I don’t know, maybe they’re in the crowd.”
No tech industry lobbyists testified at the hearing, but a few did submit written letters of opposition to Spears’ bill — all of them attached the names of national lobbying outfits, including NetChoice and the Chamber of Progress, the latter a trade group started by a former public policy executive at Google. 
Brianna January, the Chamber of Progress’s director of state and local government relations for the northeast, argued against the bill on several fronts in her written testimony, pointing to potential damage it would wreak on users and platforms alike. Websites may opt out entirely of the age verification process to avoid the hassle, January wrote, and “may turn entirely to children’s programming and eliminate all content for adults, turning YouTube into YouTube kids for everyone.” 
There could also be consequences for already marginalized teens who rely on social media and messaging for support and community, January wrote, especially LGBTQ+ youth who may “face unsafe or abusive home environments,” she wrote.
Concerns about privacy and the safety of young users also appeared in live testimony against Spears’ bill from Madalyn McGunagle, a policy associate at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Rhode Island. McGunagle argued that social media can be “where a child finds social support that they don’t have at home, as well as a community and like-minded peers,” as well as a venue for political and civic engagement.
“Does the ACLU have a position on criminal activity and exposure to youth on these platforms? Do you possess a position on that?” Spears asked McGunagle. 
“Not off the top of my head,” McGunagle said. “I would be happy to look into that for you.”
Both Spears’ and Cotter’s bills were held for further study, as is standard practice at an initial hearing. Both bills would also go into effect on Jan. 1, 2026, if enacted.

Age gates popping up across the states 
A number of state legislatures have had success in cracking down on teenager’s social media use and have instituted similar bills. As of June 2024, 10 states had enacted such legislation, according to The Age Verification Providers Association, a trade group.
Enforcement can still be difficult, as detailed in a 2024 article by PC Mag, given that age verification methods — from photo IDs to facial recognition — each have drawbacks. Legal challenges to age-verification laws have been plentiful, although judges’ interpretations of verification laws’ legality varies. In March, a U.S. judge in Florida struck down tech companies’ challenge to a block on platforms’ use of “addictive” features with minors, The Florida Phoenix reported. But in Texas, a judge sided with the tech industry, temporarily blocking provisions of a law regulating minors’ access to certain kinds of content, calling it “unconstitutionally vague,” according to The Texas Tribune.  
Measures to shape how and what kids access online also exist at the congressional level, with a piece of legislation called the Kids Off Social Media Act, introduced by Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii in January and buoyed by bipartisan support. Its cosponsors include Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama, as well as Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Sen. Angus King of Maine, an Independent. 
Potentially more enforceable are bills which latch onto teenagers’ internet use at a location already regulated: school. At least 19 states had cell phone restrictions in school buildings as of June 2024, Education Week reported.
On Wednesday, the Rhode Island Senate Committee on Education heard a bill by Sen. Melissa Murray, a Woonsocket Democrat, that would require school districts to set cell phone usage policies for their schools. Cell phone bans in public schools have become popular tools to mitigate waning classroom attention spans, with statewide bans seen in places as ideologically diverse as California and Florida, Stateline reported in February. The bill saw a healthy amount of support in written testimonies to the Senate committee.

(Photo by Sean Rayford/Getty Images)When Hurricane Helene tore through western Yancey County, Steve Boyd was one of thousands in the area who lost internet access.
The 70-year-old retiree, who lives outside of Burnsville, knows he got lucky. He didn’t lose his house, or his belongings — just a couple nearby trees that knocked out the power. For days after, getting back online was an afterthought.
“You don’t even think about internet when you don’t have lights, or anything else,” Boyd said.
His home, which sits off a miles-long county road, had been connected by coaxial cable. Shortly before the storm, he’d bought a new wi-fi system and new computers for him and his wife. But six months later, he’s still without internet. His provider, formerly a local shop that was later bought up by a larger company, has been working to restore service; he stops by their office daily.
Eventually, he broke down and decided to try out Starlink, the buzzy satellite internet service owned by SpaceX and Elon Musk. Boyd drove out to Best Buy and bought a $350 residential kit. When he got home, he set it up, only to realize there was a waitlist in the region. He paid $9 to get on it.
Many in western North Carolina impacted by Helene are now back online, after even the largest companies struggled to get service back up and running in the weeks after the storm. But the state isn’t just looking at getting access back to pre-Helene levels — it wants the entire state to have steady internet access.
It was set to be a long, complex process, even before Helene. Statewide connectivity means using a patchwork of solutions to reach communities like Boyd’s, investing hundreds of millions of dollars and navigating federal regulations that are about to see major changes.
All the while, natural disasters remain top of mind. When the mountains got hit, the whole region went off the grid. Can North Carolina prevent it from happening again?
Swaths of NC remain offline or underserved. The path to getting connected is complicated
Many parts of North Carolina remain either without stable internet or limited to slow speeds. Many of those places are rural communities — but not all of them. 
Parts of Wake and Mecklenburg counties, the state’s most populous areas, still struggle with limited connectivity. But the most challenging regions to get online are the rural ones: parts of the northern Piedmont, and long stretches of the southwest.

“We have the second largest rural population in the country,” said Angie Bailey, the director of North Carolina’s broadband infrastructure office, in an interview with NC Newsline. 
“So it’s those people in those areas that are sparsely populated, and it’s also figuring out how to work with broadband providers so they can get a return on investment.”
In total, there are more than 213,000 “unserved” locations across North Carolina, according to Federal Communications Commission data from June 2024. Those places have less than a 25 megabit per second download speed and three megabit per second upload speed. An additional 130,000 locations are “underserved,” with higher but still subpar speeds.
But finding agreement between locals and government surveyors on where exactly wiring is needed isn’t always easy, as one North Carolinian told attendees of a recent panel on rural broadband.
“I have verified the same hog house four times, that it doesn’t need power,” said Erna Bright, who has led broadband expansion efforts in northeast Gates County. “The satellite picture says it’s there, it’s unserved. Well, that pig doesn’t know how to use it.”
In the state’s most remote communities, laying fiber lines for just a few homes often doesn’t equal profits for prominent fiber companies. So officials have to look to other methods: wireless systems that bounce signals off mountains, or satellite connections like Starlink.

Still, some advocates are wary of those regions getting the short end of the stick in the process.
“It feels a lot like rural America doesn’t matter to the people who are making those decisions,” said Sara Nichols, an energy and economic development manager for Land of Sky Regional Council. “Because rural America has been given the ‘alternative technology solutions’ time and time again, that doesn’t quite meet their needs. Or it doesn’t meet them for long enough, because the technology changes pretty quickly.”
‘Building for resiliency’: How North Carolina can prevent hurricane blackouts in the future
Nobody knows whether it will be eastern or western North Carolina that takes the brunt of the next storm. But there’s no question that there will be a next storm.
“I’m not sure people thought about resiliency in the same way before the storm as they do now,” said Rep. Eric Ager (D-Buncombe). “People just didn’t imagine that mountainsides were going to slide down.”
Part of the federal requirements for broadband projects is having safety nets in place — for both regional residents and first responders during emergencies. But state officials will have to decide how to build them — and how much to spend.
A new contract signals one key part of that plan — Starlink, Musk’s low-earth orbit satellite service. The state plans to buy kits from the company for local governments and emergency officials to use during disaster scenarios.
  Angie Bailey, director of North Carolina’s Office of Broadband Infrastructure, speaks at a panel in Raleigh on March 25, 2025. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)
“We see them as a huge, important partner,” said Bailey, the state broadband office director. “A huge resource for the state and country.”
The world’s richest man garnered praise and headlines when he suspended Starlink charges in western North Carolina directly after the storm, and had additional equipment flown into the region. State lawmakers, after struggling to find kits, had “backchanneled with some of Musk’s people” to get more dropped off, said state Rep. Jake Johnson (R-Polk). 
The Republican lawmaker envisions a library-esque loaner system with Starlink kits in the future, where residents can “check out” a unit and pay the annual subscription fee.
“Really, you’re just no-interest financing it from the state,” Johnson said.
Concerns remain among some about Starlink as a permanent solution. Months after the storm, there’s a lengthy regional waitlist for residents who want to boot up and get connected. And others are wary of Musk’s close ties to the Trump administration.
“Obviously, I think there are real corruption problems that we’re going to have to manage going forward,” Ager said. “I don’t think we know what those are yet, but we certainly don’t want people making decisions about the federal government having the ability to enrich themselves.”
Money for hurricane-safe upgrades could come through extra federal money that doesn’t get spent on connection needs. Bailey said any money that’s left over could be used to address redundancies, as well as amping up cellular connections. 
And Johnson predicted there would be a hefty chunk left from a $100 million program to replace fiber poles. It could be used to buy Starlinks, he said, or to upgrade communications for fire departments, shelters and county emergency staff.
“That was kind of the worst part of the storm — that nobody could talk to each other for a long time,” Ager said. “Communication got really difficult. And that was true for emergency responders as well as just regular people.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages2025-HeleneRecovery-BatCave-SeanRayford-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-31 06:02:06.278286

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg on March 27, 2025, ordered top Trump administration officials to preserve records of their messages sent on the messaging app Signal from March 11 to March 15 following a transparency watchdog group’s lawsuit alleging that the officials have violated the Federal Records Act.
This marked the latest development since The Atlantic on March 24 published a Signal chat among Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other national security officials discussing specific plans to attack Houthi militants in Yemen. Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief at The Atlantic, was mistakenly included in the chat and wrote about what he saw.
Trump administration officials have shared contrasting accounts about whether they were discussing sensitive war information on Signal – but maintain that they did not share classified information.
Senator Roger Wicker, the Republican chair of the Senate Arms Services committee, and Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat chairing the committee, on March 27 requested an investigation into how the Trump officials used Signal to discuss military strikes.
Amy Lieberman, a politics and society editor, spoke with national security scholar Dakota Rudesill to better understand what constitutes classified information and how the government typically handles its most closely kept secrets.

How are government officials supposed to communicate about classified information?
The first way someone with the proper clearance can communicate about classified information is in person. They can talk about secret things in what is called a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF. This means a secure place, often with a big, heavy door and a lock on it, where security officials have swept the area for bugs and no one can easily eavesdrop. People who are in SCIFs usually have to leave their cell phones outside of the room, and then they can talk freely about secret information. A SCIF can be a particular room, or a floor of a building, or even an entire building.
Second, there is print communication: written documents with classification markings, which have to be handled in really particular ways, like in a safe location, and can be transported between SCIFs in secure containers.
Third, intelligence agencies, the White House and the Department of Defense also all have secure electronic systems. These include visual teleconferences, which are similar to a Zoom call and are secure for discussing highly classified information, as well as secure email systems and secure phones.
Many people with clearances have what is called “high side” email, which is shorthand lingo for classified email and messaging. Many people with security clearance would have two work hard drives and two computers. One of them is “low side,” where there is access to unclassified official email, documents and the internet.
All of these methods of secure communication can be clunky and take more time than people in our smartphone age are used to. That is the cost of protecting the nation’s secrets. My sense is the Trump administration officials wanted to move fast and turned to Signal, a commercial app that promises encryption. Signal is generally considered secure but is not perfect. There is abundant public evidence that Signal is not totally secure and indeed has been penetrated by Russian intelligence.
Can something be declassified after the information has been shared?
Yes. The president can classify and declassify at will via oral or written instruction.
The president’s constitutional powers include removing classification controls after information has been released or leaked. Trump could at any point declassify the information shared on Signal. Several of the Cabinet-level officials on that Signal chat also have expansive delegated powers over classification.
Even so, Trump’s national security Cabinet would have presumably still violated the law. For example, by putting national defense information inappropriately on an insecure app and not checking to verify the clearances of everyone on the chat and thereby allowing a reporter to be present, one could reasonably conclude that the team was showing “gross negligence,” running afoul of the Espionage Act.
The Espionage Act, enacted in 1917, criminalizes unauthorized retention and dissemination of sensitive information that could undermine the national security of the U.S. or help a foreign country.
Was the information shared on Signal likely classified?
Looking at the Signal message transcript that The Atlantic shared, it seems like at least four things were all but surely classified.
The most obvious was the details that Secretary of Defense Hegseth provided on the strike plans. These include the precise times that planes were taking off, what kind and when the bombs would fall. Recent reports have quoted defense officials confirming that this information at the time was classified.
Second, the chat revealed that the president gave a green light for secret strikes at a Situation Room meeting.
Third, there is the mere fact of these top officials deciding whether and when to execute attacks authorized by the president.
And fourth, according to media reports, the chat included the name of an intelligence officer whose position may have been secret.
The Trump administration says that there was no classified information in the chat. But several analysts have noted that defies belief. The exception would be a prior decision to declassify, but we have no evidence of that.
What other issues does this bring to mind?
First, we don’t know whether the Trump officials carefully thought about it before they set up this chat on Signal, which the Pentagon has warned government officials against using because of hacking concerns.
Second, even if the officials did make a focused decision to use Signal, what is the wisdom of that? I find it really, really hard to imagine that was a prudent decision when we think about how insecure this app is. There is also the fact that Steve Witkoff, Trump’s envoy to Ukraine and the Middle East, was party to the chat while he was in Russia. We do not know for sure if he had a device running Signal on him personally while he was in Russia, but in any event he would have been under intense Russian surveillance.
A broader issue is how the Trump administration is enforcing the law is a giant question mark. Usually, the law both authorizes the U.S. government to do things, and also says it cannot do things. Law enables and limits everyone, including the president. However, Trump wrongly claims that he is the final authority on the law, and so far the Justice Department only seems to be enforcing the law against people outside of the administration.
So does the law limit the Trump administration in any practical sense? Right now it is not clear – and there is abundant reason to be concerned about that from a rule of law standpoint.

National Heritage Areas are “lived-in landscapes” that are “representative of the national experience through the physical features that remain and the traditions that have evolved in them,” as defined by the Park Service. 
The Great Dismal Swamp is an environmental and cultural treasure, home to dozens of species of animals and, at one time, groups of Native Americans and formerly enslaved people who used it as a pathway to freedom.
The important details of where the conceptual boundary of the Great Dismal Swamp’s National Heritage Area would lie and who would manage any conservation, recreation and education opportunities remain unanswered questions at the moment. 
Sometime in 2026, the Park Service plans to submit a feasibility study to Congress that will answer those questions. Congress will have the final say on whether the region is suited for the federal designation. 
There are currently 62 designated National Heritage Areas in 36 states and territories. The unique federal designation does not result in any land transfers, local zoning changes or easements.

The entire state of Tennessee is a designated National Heritage Area, and the rights of landowners are not affected by the designation.
“A lot of people fear government overreach…” said John Warren, Communications Specialist at the National Park Service Northeast Region. 
“There’s no such federal footprint in a National Heritage Area. It is entirely something that the local community takes on and runs itself.”
Any federal funding for the proposed National Heritage Area would come by way of congressional appropriation. 
“A lot of those National Heritage Areas may receive up to $1 million annually, but others get a lot less,” said Warren. National Heritage Areas must receive matching funds from non-federal sources as well. 
The role of the National Park Service is to be a partner and advisor to the actual manager of the Heritage Area, called the “local coordinating entity,” an organization within the community chosen to interpret the history and traditions of the area and manage the conservation, recreation and education goals laid out by the project. 
 Creating a National Heritage Area

During virtual meetings held last week, members of the public shared their ideas on the Great Dismal Swamp National Heritage Area’s potential location, its coordinating entity, and the natural, cultural and historic resources the region has to offer.

The public was also asked if opportunities exist for improving the quality of those resources through conservation, recreation and education. Comments are encouraged to be submitted in writing online, by mail or over the phone until May 19.
The public comments are not meant to be a vote, said Warren, but “a way to collect information.”
“The study has 10 criteria, and the answer to all of these has got to be ‘yes’ for us to be able to give a favorable conclusion that, yes, this qualifies as a National Heritage Area,” said Warren. “So it’s a high bar.” 
Warren said that anecdotally, over the last ten years only about half of the National Heritage Areas that were applied for ended up receiving the designation from Congress. 
As part of the study, the National Park Service staff has also spoken with potential state and local partners as well as possible coordinating entities. Chesapeake City Council has voiced interest in assuming the managing role, said Julie Bell, cultural resource project manager for the Park Service.
Nonprofits, universities, and state and local governments are some examples of coordinating entities that were chosen to manage other Heritage Areas around the nation. Any entity outside of the federal government is allowed to assume the role, including Indigenous tribes, said Bell. 
The Great Dismal Swamp National Heritage Area will involve coordination across state lines since the Virginia-North Carolina border slices directly through the swamp. 
In 2003, the Northern Neck National Heritage Area was established along with six others around the nation. The designation was Virginia’s third National Heritage Area to date. 
Two other possible National Heritage Areas have completed their feasibility studies and are currently awaiting a decision from Congress: the Finger Lakes Region in New York and the Kentucky Wildlands. 
 The story of the swamp

The National Park Service is developing themes that are present in the Great Dismal Swamp region to tell a nationally distinctive heritage story. One theme is “a place of refuge” and another is “a field of conflict.” 
Based on artifacts found in the Great Dismal Swamp dating back over 5,000 years, the Nansemond, Meherrin, Yeopim and Lumbee people were likely stewards of the swamp long before European colonists arrived, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
After colonization, the role of the swamp for local communities changed. About 50,000 self-emancipated African Americans, called maroons, along with free Blacks, Indigenous people and Europeans lived in the swamp in search of refuge. 
Some used it as a pause point on their journeys north, making the swamp an official water-based rest stop on the Underground Railroad, but others settled permanent communities there up until the end of the Civil War. 
Today, the Great Dismal Swamp is protected by a 113,000 acre National Wildlife Refuge managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service. What is now a vast, uninhabited landscape is actually just a remnant of its former self. 
The once enormous swamp covered over 1 million acres, roughly the size of Delaware, but was drained over the years, first by a young George Washington in 1763. 
Washington and other investors initially aimed to create land in the swamp that could be sold for profit, then to dig a canal to transport goods across the swamp. Enslaved people were forced to provide the labor for these early economic ventures.  
One of the most successful business opportunities in the swamp turned out to be logging. The now globally rare Atlantic white cedar was in high demand, and gaining access to the trees required digging ditches to drain the swamp. By the 1950s, the last of the virgin timber in the Great Dismal Swamp was gone, according to a National Park Service story map. 
 The future of the swamp 

On George Washington’s birthday in 1973, about 50,000 acres of swamp land was donated to the Nature Conservancy and then handed over to the Fish & Wildlife Service, thus creating the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge. 
“We have discovered that swamps actually play a vital role in our environment and that they are necessary,” said Warren. “You know, they’re not just places that we want to avoid because they have a lot of mosquitos or something like that. They’re places that are useful to the environment.” 
The Fish and Wildlife Service says the swamp serves as a permanent and migratory home for roughly 50 species of mammals, 200 types of birds and 100 species of butterflies. The diverse ecosystem ranges from bald cypress to red maple and Virginia’s last historic refuge of native Atlantic white cedar. 
In addition to the habitat the swamp provides to wildlife, it also prevents floods and improves water quality in nearby communities with a combined population of nearly 1 million people, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service. 
A 2017 project to re-moisten the peat soils of the swamp served to benefit the surrounding population, including in Suffolk, by restoring a more natural water regime in the area. The Fish and Wildlife Service and its partners installed adjustable dams in key places to regulate the amount of water leaving the swamp, improving the environment’s ability to provide its once inherent benefits. 
The re-moistened peat is now able to absorb stormwater more efficiently, acting like a sponge to reduce flooding during severe weather such as the storms and hurricanes that are common in the region. Healthy peat also stores more carbon, a valuable tool in combating global climate change. 
“This is a region that has already changed a lot,” said Warren. Creating a National Heritage Area “may have some influence on that, or it may not.” Those decisions would be left to the local community and the chosen coordinating entity.

In Virginia, there’s a shortage of 133 certified professional controllers from nine FAA air traffic control facilities that serve the commonwealth, according to data from the 11-year FAA Air Traffic Controller Workforce Plan.

The FAA, along with other federal agencies, faced big cuts and employees were sent buyout offers at the start of the year by President Donald Trump’s administration, which is set on cutting “wasteful” spending. Some of the FAA positions cut focused on inspection and airport operations. 
U.S. Mark Warner, D-Va., said in January the buyouts offered could have negatively impacted the number of certified air traffic controllers.
“What happens if a few thousand air traffic controllers take that?” Warner said to DC News Now. “We won’t have air traffic potentially. It takes 18 months to get an air traffic controller trained up.”
However, Acting FAA Administrator Chris Rocheleau expressed a positive sign last week when he said the agency has made progress in addressing the nationwide shortage of air traffic controllers. He stated that approximately 7,500 applicants are now being referred for testing to help fill the shortage of about 3,000 controllers.
“I’m thrilled to see that early results of (the) air traffic controller hiring supercharge were so promising. By prioritizing a merit-based process, cutting red tape, and increasing starting salaries, we are bringing in the best and brightest across America to help keep our skies secure at record speeds,” Rocheleau said in a statement.
The results come after Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy’s Feb. 27 hiring announcement for candidates.
 What’s driving the air traffic controller shortage?

The shortage of air traffic controllers responsible for ensuring the safety and efficiency of the national airspace system has been a long-simmering problem. Several factors contribute to the dearth of workers, including the FAA’s specific and lengthy training and certification process, antiquated control tower equipment, long hours on the job and the inability to hire career switchers past the age of 31. 
Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, representing nearly 20,000 professionals, spoke to federal lawmakers about the persistent controller staffing challenges earlier this month at a U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Aviation Subcommittee hearing.
​​https://michiganadvance.com/2025/03/27/repub/after-deadly-midair-collision-lawmakers-grill-faa-army-on-shocking-lack-of-safety-system/
“A properly-staffed controller workforce is necessary in order to safely and efficiently meet all of its operational, statutory, and contractual requirements, while also having the personnel resources to research, develop, deploy, and then train the existing workforce on new procedures, technology, and modernization initiatives,” said Daniels on March 4 to lawmakers. 
He added that without a sustainable hiring, training, and staffing model, which is outlined in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024, “the FAA will struggle to maintain the current capacity of the system, let alone modernize or expand it for new users.”
Attention on air traffic controllers increased after an FAA investigation into the Jan. 29 mid-air collision of a commercial jet and Army helicopter near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport that killed 67 people. The agency’s probe found that only one controller was on duty, which “was not normal,” with one person doing the work normally assigned to two people at the time of the collision, the Associated Press reported. 
 How the recruitment and hiring process has improved

One of the ways the department is incentivizing interest in the open positions is by increasing starting salaries by 30% for candidates who go to the FAA Academy. The average certified professional controller makes over $160,000 per year.
Duffy said that the department would prioritize candidates who received the highest Air Traffic Skills Assessment Test scores for the FAA Academy and accelerate the time-to-hire for critical positions by cutting more than four months off the old process.
The FAA said once trainees successfully pass through the academy, they’ll be assigned to a tower or other facility across the country, where they’ll work toward their certification with experienced air traffic controllers.
“This staffing shortage has been a known challenge for over a decade, and this administration is committed to solving it,” Duffy said on Feb. 27. “The new streamlined hiring process is just the first step to deliver on President Trump’s agenda to prioritize the American people’s safety and modernize the federal government.”

It’s not surprising that Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, in our current partisan landscape, failed to protest the damage inflicted on Virginians by President Donald Trump’s reckless cuts to the federal workforce. Rarely do politicians publicly criticize the president when they’re from the same party.
Youngkin tweaks state budget with eye on federal cuts, but embraces key spending

That’s why Youngkin focused on the nation’s monetary struggles rather than the indiscriminate, rapacious actions of Trump and his designated henchman Elon Musk, who runs the DOGE apparatus.
“Today, we know we have a federal government that is facing huge fiscal issues with $37 trillion in debt, with $2 trillion being added every year,” Youngkin said earlier this month. “What that requires is real action quickly.”
Youngkin didn’t mention how the tax cuts that Trump rammed through in 2017 exacerbated the situation. After all, the national debt rose almost $7.8 trillion during Trump’s first term. Nor did he acknowledge that Virginians are losing job security even though they’ve done nothing wrong. He also left out the lawsuits and recalls to work of thousands of employees that have followed some of the initial layoffs, and the protesters that have rallied against the callousness emanating from Washington.
Instead, the guv noted more than a quarter-million jobs are available through a state portal. He suggested many people who are laid off can still land on their feet.
Youngkin deserves opprobrium for suggesting Virginia can absorb a huge portion of those federal jobs – especially since many won’t be at comparable salaries. More than 341,000 federal workers lived in the commonwealth in 2023, the U.S. Census Bureau reported. The potential economic hardships that residents here face are too real, too devastating to Virginians’ livelihoods.
“The indifference to the suffering of Virginians – who’ve done absolutely nothing wrong and were, in fact, extremely valuable to their agencies – is really problematic,” Jacqueline Simon, policy director of the American Federation of Government Employees, told The Washington Post.
Besides, the correlation between the skills among Virginia’s federal employees and the state’s available jobs “at best was 30%,”  Terry L. Clower, director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis and a professor who studied the issue, said in an interview.
Governors to laid-off federal workers: We’ll hire you

The Washington Post reported, just days after Youngkin’s comments, that many offerings the state has listed come with large pay cuts compared to federal jobs.
Clower noted the ongoing uncertainty for laid-off federal workers has complicated their lives. Should they try to relocate? If recalled to the federal government, should they go back to their jobs – knowing their return to civil service could be reversed, yet again?
An ancillary factor: “A lot of the (federal) contractors are starting to pull back on their hiring, even if their contracts haven’t been touched,” Clower said.
A Youngkin spokesman told me Thursday by email that the state has identified 259,000 jobs open in the public and private sectors, and roughly 120,000 of them require a bachelor’s degree or higher.
“We are committed to ensuring that these opportunities are accessible to people with a wide range of experience and backgrounds,” said Peter A. Finocchio. “ … Whether someone wants to continue in their current field or explore something new, Virginia is ready to support them with the tools, training, and guidance they need to thrive.”
The problem begins when someone’s skills don’t match up with available jobs in Virginia. There’s also the issue of whether the employment opportunity is nearby or clear across the state.
For example, would someone living in the state’s “Urban Crescent” (the major localities from Northern Virginia down through Richmond and jutting southeast to Hampton Roads) move elsewhere – and vice versa? Cultural and urban-rural differences could be factors.
Families with school-age children probably would think twice about selling their home, changing school divisions and jettisoning established relationships in their communities – especially if pay and benefits are significantly lower under a new employer.
If laid-off federal workers from the commonwealth don’t like the job market here, “They’re likely to leave Virginia and go somewhere else. That’s a bad thing,” said Vinod Agarwal, deputy director of Old Dominion University’s Dragas Center for Economic Analysis and Policy.
Such individuals would take their skills – and tax dollars – to another state. “That’s not good for Virginia’s economy,” Agarwal told me.
Last week, Axios.com reported that the Virginia Department of Health is facing layoffs after the Trump administration announced it’s cutting $11.4 billion in COVID-related funding. Axios said it was unclear how many VDH employees would lose their jobs. So federal cuts are having a ripple effect. 
On  Thursday, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said it would cut 20,000 positions, half through layoffs. Based in Washington, HHS said it would save $1.8 billion per year through a reduction in workforce from 82,000 to 62,000 full-time employees.
These announcements never seem to acknowledge how services to Americans will inevitably decline because there will be fewer employees to handle the various duties.
Military veterans are especially at risk from the layoffs. They constitute around 30% of the federal workforce. Virginia is home to the third-highest share of veterans nationwide, based on percentage.
It’s bad enough that Trump’s administration continues to announce cuts. What makes it worse is the lack of transparency about the decision-making process used by DOGE, or why jobs in specific agencies are now deemed extraneous.
Which brings me back to Youngkin. It’s fine he’s taken steps to assist Virginians affected by the chaos in Washington over federal layoffs. His rosy pronouncements, however, can’t make up for lower pay and benefits and questionable job security.
He should convey that reality to the president.

Mark McKenney, a Warwick Democrat. The House version is sponsored by Rep. David Morales, a Providence Democrat. If enacted, this legislation would protect against censorship in public and school libraries, and it would protect librarians. And it would make Rhode Island only the fifth state to protect the basic freedom to read (Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, and New Jersey are the other four).
The Rhode Island Senate Committee on Education has recommended that the proposed Freedom to Read Act be held for further study after conducting a State House hearing on March 12. But that is standard practice and doesn’t mean the end of the road for this important bill. 
Here’s why Rhode Islanders who care about democracy should support it.
Many Americans fear that the institutions protecting our democracy are under threat. Democracy originated in the city-states of ancient Greece, where citizens met in open forums to voice their opinions and share ideas. Ever since, the free flow of ideas has been essential to the preservation of democracy. Thus it’s now more important than ever to protect our access to all sources of ideas, including books.
The First Amendment protects our basic freedoms, including freedom of religion, freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, and freedom of the press. In 1982, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment protects books from being banned by government officials; however, that ruling is frequently ignored. Despite the fact that the First Amendment prohibits book banning, the number of actual attempts to ban them is increasing dramatically. In the 2023-2024 school year, PEN America counted more than 10,000 book bans in public schools. 
To any reasonably open-minded adult, the whole notion of forcing one’s own beliefs on others is preposterous. Probably every book ever written offends someone, somewhere, but hopefully no one wants to ban all books. No matter how innocent a book might seem, someone is bound to be offended. Winnie the Pooh? That honey-obsessed bear clearly has an eating disorder. And talk about eating disorders, The Very Hungry Caterpillar is a field guide to compulsive overeating. Goodnight Moon? That poor kid’s rodent-infested bedroom is disgusting and unsafe. I wish I were being facetious, but I’m not — people have attacked these classic books for the reasons mentioned.










The free flow of ideas has been essential to the preservation of democracy. Thus it’s now more important than ever to protect our access to all sources of ideas, including books.


How about Charlotte’s Web? Surely, no one could object to such a sweet, heart-warming story. Wrong. It was once banned from a few children’s libraries because a group of parents objected to the book’s “blasphemous” talking animals. There’s got to be an unoffensive book somewhere. I thought I found one: Sesame Street: Ready, Set, Brush! — a pop-up book featuring familiar Sesame Street characters demonstrating proper brushing techniques. Unoffensive? Not to some devout Jainists who avoid brushing their teeth because the act could harm the microorganisms living in the mouth. Fortunately, Jainists aren’t into book banning, or it’d be adiós Elmo and his toothbrush.
I could go on ad infinitum, but there’s no need. Books contain ideas, and even though some people are going to be offended, the unrestricted discussion of ideas must continue because that is the bedrock of democracy. Authors, librarians, and book lovers don’t want to silence anyone. We want to hear what you think about our books, and if a book offends you, please speak up. Write a letter to the editor, go to PTO and school board meetings, let us know what you think. Just don’t try to ban our books. Let us decide what books we want to read and what books we want our kids to read, and we’ll extend the same respect to you.
Amazingly, only 11 people were behind 60% of attempts to ban books in 2021-2022. Obviously, these folks are committed to their obsession, and nothing anyone can say is likely to dissuade them. Our best defense is to enact legislation that prohibits book banning and protects educators and librarians from censorship-related lawsuits.

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)U.S. Supreme Court justices heard oral arguments last week in a case that could allow states to challenge federal environmental rules in more favorable courts.
The case could determine whether certain U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations are reviewed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit — which has more liberal judges — or in regional courts, where certain states and industry groups would prefer to make their arguments.
The dispute centers around EPA’s decision that 21 states’ plans for ozone pollution failed to meet federal Clean Air Act standards. Oklahoma and Utah challenged that disapproval in the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which spans six Western states. The federal agency argued the challenge should be heard in the D.C. Circuit.
The D.C. Circuit is the venue for lawsuits over rules that are national in scope, while local or regional issues are heard in regional circuit courts. The EPA argues that it used a consistent methodology for all 21 denials, making it an issue that should be resolved nationally in a single court. Oklahoma and Utah contend that regional courts are better suited to account for state-specific factors.
During oral arguments, Justice Neil Gorsuch seemed to question the notion that states should bring their challenges to regional courts.
“[Air pollution] crosses the country in ways that don’t respect our jurisdictional boundaries between circuits,” he said.
Gorsuch suggested such an approach could create confusion, if states bring challenges to varying regional courts that issue conflicting rulings.
“We’re going to have different interpretations of the statute with different — different circuits and all these terrible splits and — and, gosh, we won’t have the immediate resolution of the D.C. Circuit that we could have,” he said.
Meanwhile, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson noted that state-specific factors informed each EPA denial.
“It matters that you are Denver versus, you know, Arizona or whatever in terms of how the modeling works,” she said.

(Mario Tama/Getty Images)For many California residents, the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year were the latest and most searing example of the devastating effects of climate change. Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion.
“We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat. “It’s the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It’s not sustainable, it’s not right and it’s not ethical.”
Addis and Democratic lawmakers in nearly a dozen other states want to force the world’s largest fossil fuel companies to help pay for the recovery costs of climate-related disasters. Last year, Vermont became the first state to pass a “climate Superfund” law, followed soon after by New York.
This session, 10 states have seen similar proposals, several of which have advanced in key committees. Advocates point to legislation in Maryland that has drawn support in both chambers, as well as to strong grassroots support in California after the Los Angeles wildfires.
Lawmakers say the rapidly increasing cost of climate disasters — from wildfires to floods to sea level rise — is more than state budgets can bear.
“Climate Superfund is the ‘it girl’ policy of the [2025] session,” said Ava Gallo, climate and energy program manager with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “There’s a lot of popularity in the idea of holding polluters responsible.”
The momentum for these “polluter pays” bills is tied to the maturation of attribution science. That new field of research can help calculate fossil fuel companies’ contributions to historic emissions totals, as well as the role climate change played in causing or worsening natural disasters.
Vermont’s law was the first attempt to use that science to charge emitters for their role in causing devastating floods and other catastrophes.










We've had disaster after disaster after disaster. It's the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It's not sustainable, it's not right and it’s not ethical.


– California Democratic Assemblymember Dawn Addis


Fossil fuel companies and their allies have fought back hard. Late last year, the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging Vermont’s measure. The groups argue that emissions are governed by the federal Clean Air Act, precluding states from charging companies over global pollution.
Neither group responded to a Stateline interview request. The Independent Petroleum Association of America also declined an interview request.
A separate lawsuit, led by 22 Republican attorneys general, is challenging the New York law. And a conservative group has targeted Rachel Rothschild, an assistant professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, who helped draft the legal justification for climate Superfund policy. The group, Government Accountability and Oversight, has sought to subject Rothschild to a deposition, The New York Times reported, a move that some experts view as an intimidation tactic.
Meanwhile, oil and gas executives asked President Donald Trump during a White House meeting this month to direct the Justice Department to join the legal fight against climate Superfund laws, The Wall Street Journal reported. Industry leaders are also pushing Congress to shield them from more than 30 lawsuits brought by state and local governments that aim to make them pay for some of the results of climate change.
While experts expect a bruising legal battle over climate Superfund policies, the threat of lawsuits hasn’t deterred more lawmakers from backing the concept.
“States were a little bit wary; they wondered, ‘Is this some new radical plan?’” said Cassidy DiPaola, communications director with the Make Polluters Pay campaign, a coalition of groups backing such bills. “Then one of the littlest states passed it and this powerhouse, New York, passed it. That really set the ball rolling.”
Lawmakers hope to use this emerging climate science to charge oil companies for disasters

Fossil fuel companies have cast doubt on attribution science. They also note that their production of oil and other products was done legally under U.S. and international regulations.
“Manufacturers will see this as a shakedown of any industry you don’t like at some point in the future, even though in the past they were licensed and operated under government regulation,” Brett Vassey, president and CEO of the Virginia Manufacturers Association, said during legislative testimony about a climate Superfund proposal in that state. “It will have a chilling effect on Virginia being able to grow its economy.”
Proponents of Superfund legislation point to legal settlements with large tobacco companies in the 1990s. Although those companies also sold their products legally, they were held responsible because they knew about the harmful effects of those products and deceived the public. Most climate Superfund proposals target companies for their emissions over the past 30 or so years, after leading experts had documented the dangers of greenhouse gases.
“There’s good documentation of how well the fossil fuel industry knew the probable long-term impacts of their product,” said Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat. “Should an industry that made such historic profits over a period of time and made so many representations that we had no problem not bear any of the costs?”
Golden and other lawmakers say it’s becoming impossible for taxpayers to cover the costs of recovery from wildfires and other catastrophes. In Rhode Island, sea level rise is causing massive damage for coastal communities, said Democratic state Rep. Jennifer Boylan, who has sponsored a climate Superfund bill to help the state adapt.
Some advocates also note that Trump’s return to the White House has cut off the possibility of federal climate relief.
“All the states are affected by the disappearance of this federal funding,” said Gallo, of the state lawmakers group. “States everywhere are going to be looking at some way to fill the gap.”
This session, climate Superfund bills have been introduced in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Virginia.
After a long slog, climate change lawsuits will finally put Big Oil on trial

While the bills are structured differently, they all seek to target the largest polluters — often covering companies that produced 1 billion metric tons of emissions over the last 30 or so years. Lawmakers say that applies to roughly 100 companies.
The measures also take different approaches to assigning damages. Some direct state agencies to conduct complex studies to determine the costs of climate-caused disasters over a certain period, the approach pioneered by Vermont. Others set a fixed number that represents a conservative baseline for those damages. New York’s law set that figure at $75 billion over a 25-year period.
Many of the bills also require that significant amounts of the funding be directed to the communities hit hardest by pollution.
Advocates are particularly optimistic about the measures in California and Maryland.
Lawmakers in Maryland modified their bills to commission a study about the financial impacts of climate change. Those measures passed both the House and Senate, and legislators are working to reconcile the versions from each chamber. Figures produced by the study would be the backbone of a climate Superfund policy in a future session.
“From a legislative perspective, it’s a shot in the dark as to what the costs are,” said Democratic Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo, who sponsored one of the bills. “This will give us the factual data needed to make a more well-educated decision on policy.”
In New Jersey, an Assembly committee advanced a climate Superfund bill this month. State Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee and who sponsored the bill, said it will help to rebuild and fortify water treatment plants, schools and firehouses. He noted that Trump has called for the dismantling of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“The end of the world is coming; it’s kind of hard to ignore,” Smith said. “FEMA has been the backstop to help communities recover from disasters. If the handwriting isn’t on the wall to all the states that they’ve got to deal with this, shame on them.”
Lawmakers in many states have heard from mayors and other local government leaders that more climate recovery funding is essential.
“Municipal officials are getting behind [climate Superfund policies],” said Massachusetts state Sen. Jamie Eldridge, a Democrat who has sponsored similar legislation. “They’re facing the costs of flooding, of droughts, of heat waves, and really asking for relief.”

More than 1,000 from across Ohio turned out Saturday to protest outside a Columbus Tesla dealership. Among other objections, they were protesting the sweeping powers President Donald Trump has given the world’s richest man and the way that man is using them.
A much smaller number — fewer than 50 — came out to show their support for Trump and Tesla founder Elon Musk, who holds an unofficial position in Trump’s administration.

There have been weekly protests outside the dealership in the Easton shopping development and in other cities since Trump took office in January. By Saturday, warm weather and rumors that the Proud Boys would come out in support of Trump and Musk swelled the ranks of those who wanted to protest the billionaires. Similar protests were held across the United States and around the world. 
Police separated demonstrators and counter-demonstrators. But both groups were peaceful, and in some instances talked seriously with each other.

People protesting Trump and Musk lined both sides of the street and wound around the corner. They expressed anger over many of the actions of the new administration, including its heavy-handed treatment of immigrants, its decimation of antitrust and consumer-protection watchdogs, and its perceived abandonment of Ukraine. 
But the major target of the protests was Musk and the power Trump has given him.
Musk wasn’t elected and he hasn’t been confirmed by the U.S. Senate. But as he runs the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency,” he’s tried to hack away at government programs, many of which benefit the poor and average Americans.
For example, Musk is trying to fire 80,000 people from the Department of Veterans Affairs, he axed a program that pays farmers for produce for food pantries, and he’s trying to lay off tens of thousands at such agencies as the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Education. As he has, Musk’s unofficial agency has committed a series of blunders that have left many to question his competence. Even so, Musk has become even richer under the new administration.
Protesters held signs with a picture of Musk doing a now-infamous gesture mirroring a Nazi salute in January. Some noted that Musk’s own companies get millions a day in government subsidies as he targets what he sees as waste in other programs.

“We don’t want no swasticars,” went one chant that took jabs at Musk’s electric car and rocket companies. “Take a one-way trip to Mars.”
Peggy Kissel of Westerville said she was protesting because she felt like she needed to do something.
“I don’t feel like we have a say in what’s happening because Congress and the courts haven’t been able to stand up to the things that are happening,” she said as cars drove past, honking in support.
A man who helped organize the counter-protest declined to identify himself except to call himself “Patriot Dad.” He said he came out to defend the Tesla dealership after acts of vandalism and the discovery of incendiary devices in other cities.

“There actually are Americans who care about protecting an American company and American workers,” he said. “I thought maybe we should create a shield or create a wall around a building that is clearly a target for domestic terrorism right now.”
Asked about the cuts Musk and Trump are making, the man said, “Most of us who voted for Donald Trump knew what Elon Musk was going to be doing when he got in there. Quite honestly Trump has all the authority he needs to go in and create efficiencies and that’s what Elon Musk is doing.” 
Many of those who were protesting the new administration were adamant that Trump is abusing his power.
Miriam Scudder said she’s traveled to several foreign countries, including in Africa. She said she’s worried that Americans don’t appreciate the rights Trump and Musk are trying to erode.
“We have a certain privilege here in the United States that I don’t see in other countries,” she said. “I don’t think we really appreciate how much we have here and I feel like we’re throwing it away. I feel like we’re the spoiled child throwing a temper tantrum because of something we can’t agree on. No. 1 is immigration because hate and fear are powerful things.”

It’s been two decades since state legislators bowed to tourism industry lobbyists and passed a law forbidding local school districts from starting the traditional calendar school year prior to the last week of August.
It was a familiar case of industry campaign cash trumping recommendations of education experts and the wellbeing of children.
In the years since, local school districts — anxious to take advantage of completing their first semester prior to the Christmas break — have repeatedly tried to buck the rule and often gotten into hot water for doing so.
Now, thankfully, it looks like legislative leaders may be backtracking a bit. Under a Senate bill introduced last week, the permissible start date would be set a week earlier — the Monday closest to August 19 — and it’s a welcome proposal.
The bottom line: The bill isn’t perfect as local districts would prefer more flexibility and tourism special interests are still being given way too much say-so in the matter, but in a legislature that so often ignores the best interests of kids, it’s better than nothing.

(Photo by Claire Sullivan/New Hampshire Bulletin)Women hold top spots in New Hampshire politics, including the governorship and three-quarters of the congressional delegation. In the Legislature, though, they remain significantly underrepresented.
While women make up 50.1% of the state’s population, per the latest census, they make up only 35.8% of the legislative chambers combined, according to data from Rutgers University’s Center for American Women in Politics. Historically and today, the largest gender gaps are in the 400-person House. Women are also typically underrepresented in the 24-person Senate, but they have reached gender parity briefly this century and, for two years, outnumbered men in the chamber by one seat.
Women lawmakers across the political spectrum offered a variety of opinions on why women remain underrepresented in the Legislature — and whether that underrepresentation has policy consequences for the state. While New Hampshire’s citizen Legislature is a point of pride for many, some said the $100-a-year pay had a disproportionate impact on women, who studies show still bear the brunt of child care and domestic duties. Women who were raising children while in office said strong support systems were essential for allowing them to do their work as elected officials.
Researchers said women see better representation in legislatures that are more professionalized, meaning elected office is a full-time job with better pay and resources like strong staff support and an office. They also pointed to other factors affecting women’s participation, like party recruitment efforts.
Some lawmakers described the personal impact of being a woman in a space dominated by men. They felt they had to work harder than their male colleagues to be taken seriously, and faced gendered stereotyping or assumptions. Meanwhile, others felt their gender posed no or little challenge to their political life.
New Hampshire is in the middle of the pack among states when it comes to women’s representation in legislatures. Nevada is the only legislature where women outnumber men, making up 60.3% of the chambers. In Arizona, women and men have equal representation, and in the other 48 states, there are more men than women. In Congress, 28% of lawmakers are women.
The share of women in the Legislature, with some spikes, has remained relatively stagnant over the decades.
“One of the things that those of us who study this like to say is that, you know, there’s nothing inevitable about women’s representation. It’s not as though time itself changes anything,” said Anna Mahoney, the executive director of Dartmouth College’s Rockefeller Center for Public Policy and the Social Sciences. “What changes women’s participation in government is action, either on behalf of political parties, or grassroots organizations, (or) women candidates themselves.”

In the chambers, on the trail
There’s a question Becky Whitley heard more than any other in her brief run for the state’s 2nd Congressional District last year — a question she wonders if a male candidate would hear.
“The number one question that I was asked, even by my own family members, was, you know: ‘What about your son?’” Whitley said. “And so I just question whether — and I don’t know, I can’t speak from experience — do men get the same questions, right?”

Whitley represented the capital area as a Democrat in the state Senate from 2020 to 2024. In her political experience, she felt women faced different pressures and expectations than men. That was felt across the aisle, too.
Sen. Denise Ricciardi, a Bedford Republican and a deputy majority leader in the Senate, said she’s used to challenging those expectations.
“If you’ve seen me, I have big hair, and I wear high heels. I think that people underestimate me because I don’t want to change my style to be taken more seriously, right?” Ricciardi said. “So you have to work harder. … I have to prove myself, but I don’t mind. In fact, it feels like a victory when you do prove yourself, and people see the real you.”
Ricciardi isn’t a fan of party politics; she said she’s motivated instead by “doing what’s right for people.” She said she feels women in a male-dominated space “have to work harder to be taken more seriously.”
While she said she hasn’t really experienced this perception from voters, “I definitely think with colleagues, I think there’s just this thought that … we’re not as smart or we can’t do it … the way they want to do it,” she said.
Whitley said “women have a very fine line to walk.”
“I felt this acutely in terms of … our standards for behavior, in terms of how strong we can be, in terms of our decorum, in terms of what we look like, what we can say,” Whitley said. “I felt very acutely that the line for what was appropriate for women in, you know, the public sphere was … quite different than it is for men. And so … I have always felt like, you know, I have to work a little bit harder. I have to be a little bit clearer. I have to … really walk that line. And I certainly think that men in my same position don’t feel that way.”

Other women lawmakers felt differently. Asked whether there are still obstacles for women in politics today, Sen. Regina Birdsell, a Hampstead Republican who serves as majority leader, said, “When I first got in, I say yes, but things are really starting to open up.” She said she has often observed women beat out men in legislative races, and that she has seen more younger women getting involved than when she first ran in 2010.
“If a woman is really interested in running, and they do it right, I think they have a much better chance of prevailing,” Birdsell said. “So I think … if you know how to do it, and you do it right, I think the door is wide open for you.”
Rep. Judy Aron, a South Acworth Republican who chairs the House Environment and Agriculture Committee, said she felt “we’re way past that” in terms of women facing obstacles in politics.

“I don’t know that there’s any particular right number of percentage. I mean, why should it be 50/50?” Aron said. “I think it’s a matter of … who our voters think are qualified to do these jobs, or be in these elected positions.”
But others felt fewer women in the Legislature meant less attention on issues that impact women. Mahoney, the Dartmouth researcher, said “a lot of the research shows that when you have more women in your legislature, the topics that you’re talking about and the legislative agenda itself shifts.”
Ricciardi pointed to the “Momnibus” bills, legislation aimed at maternal health spearheaded by women. Male colleagues aren’t as focused “on maternal issues, child care issues, family issues as much, and those are really important things that we need in our state,” she said.
Women have unique lived experiences to bring to the table, said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat who was the first woman in American history to be elected both as a governor and a U.S. senator. 
“You know, I used to say this a lot when I became the first woman to be elected as New Hampshire’s governor: women make up half of our population, and we have different life experiences than men do,” Shaheen said in a statement to the Bulletin. “Not better or worse — but different, and it’s important to have those experiences and views represented, regardless of which side of the aisle those women fall on.” 
Women shape elected bodies beyond just legislation, Mahoney said. Their presence in legislatures can affect everything from the architecture of the buildings where they work — adding women’s restrooms by the chambers’ floors where they weren’t before or rooms for nursing — to the culture of the chambers.
“When we look to see what kind of impact women have once they’re in the institution,” she said, “one of the things that I like to look at is not just necessarily the bills that they are supporting or that they’re voting for, but how they’re changing the institution itself.”

Challenges and solutions
The challenges facing women are multipronged, and so are the solutions to getting more in office, researchers said.
“We need societal and cultural change,” Mahoney said, “but we also need the nuts and bolts of party infrastructure and legitimate support in order to increase the number of women running for office.”
Those recruitment efforts may be difficult for candidates of any gender at a time “when government is not necessarily seen as a place where good things can get done efficiently,” and trust in American institutions is low, she said.
In terms of challenges on the campaign trail, research into voters’ perceptions of women candidates is “sort of mixed,” Mahoney said. 
In the general election, “you don’t see as much bias, because people are really relying on party cues, and so they’re going to vote for their party regardless of who the candidate is,” she said. “It’s really in those primary contests where women face specific challenges of fundraising, whether they are perceived to be really legitimate candidates that can win, and those sorts of things.”
Women candidates can benefit in elections where topics considered “women’s issues” — like reproductive rights — are important, Mahoney said. 
The set-up of a legislature can pose its own challenges. Emily Baer, an assistant professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire, pointed to the fact that in more professionalized legislatures, with better pay and more staff support, “women tend to be better represented.”
The “flip side” of having a citizen Legislature in New Hampshire, she said, “is it’s much harder  for women to serve in a state that is not providing them with the resources to pursue that as a career, while also balancing other things in their personal and professional lives.”
This may have an acute effect on women in particular because of factors like being underrepresented in professions that are considered political pipelines, as well as access to child care and other resources, she said.
“A lot of studies still show that women, even when they are working full-time professional careers, still do a lot more at home in terms of household responsibilities and child care responsibilities,” Baer said, “and serving in the state Legislature — particularly if it’s not something that can be a career for them, and they’re balancing it alongside their own professional career and then higher levels of responsibility at home — that’s something that affects women politicians much more than it would affect male politicians.”
Additionally, the citizen Legislature has a “bias towards older, retired individuals,” Baer said, “because they might have more time and slightly better financial position to allow them to serve in those legislatures. And so when we talk about parity in women’s representation, you want parity that actually reflects the diversity of that group as well.”
Research has found that women often wait to run for office until their children have gone to school or left home, which “frequently delays women’s entrance into politics,” Mahoney said. For many, family support is key.
Whitley, the former capital-area state senator, said her supportive spouse and community, as well as her mother nearby, made her public service possible.
“But not everyone has that, and so if one of those things weren’t true, I wouldn’t have been able to serve,” Whitley said. And, even then, serving longer than the four years she was in office “just wasn’t sustainable for my family,” she said.
  Sen. Rebecca Perkins Kwoka (Senate Staff)
Sen. Rebecca Perkins Kwoka, the Senate minority leader and a Portsmouth Democrat, said her legislative work “requires a lot of supportive people in my life, and also a really good mastery of Google calendar.” 
She’s found it helpful to talk with other moms doing similar work, and she hopes to return the help, even if it’s just talking about the actual logistics of the job, like juggling legislative demands with getting the kids to school. 
“Just being able to kind of demystify that, I think, for people makes it a little more accessible,” she said.
Birdsell, the Senate majority leader, said a program she was in aimed at getting Republican women in the state to run for office helped her greatly. They learned about media, the basics of the Legislature, went to Washington, D.C., and met stakeholders involved in the political process. That program is now defunct, but she said she would love to see its return.
And while state legislatures can be stepping stones to higher office, a number of women who propelled themselves to the highest political planes in New Hampshire — Congress and the governorship — did so without first serving in the State House, Baer noted, suggesting other avenues for women candidates.
Perkins Kwoka thinks women serving can act as a positive feedback loop.
“The more women we have serving, the more women, I think, will be able to see themselves in the role,” she said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_8020-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-03-31 05:03:04.198915

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A federal judge dismissed the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers seeking to shutter the Dakota Access Pipeline, finding that the tribe must wait until the Army Corps finishes a key environmental study to bring another legal challenge against the agency.
“No matter its frustration with Defendants’ sluggish pace, it is not yet entitled to a second bite at the apple,” U.S. District Judge James Boasberg wrote in a Friday order.
Standing Rock filed the lawsuit in October, arguing that Corps is violating federal law by allowing the pipeline to operate without an easement. The tribe also claimed that the Corps failed to properly study the environmental impacts of the Dakota Access Pipeline or require its developer to prepare adequate spill response plans, among other alleged violations.
The suit is a successor to a lawsuit the tribe filed against the same agency in 2016.

More Dakota Access Pipeline coverage

In that case, Boasberg in 2020 found the Army Corps had violated federal law by not conducting a full environmental impact study before granting an easement allowing the pipeline to cross underneath the Missouri River. He pulled the easement and ordered the Dakota Access Pipeline to be drained of oil pending the Army Corps’ completion of the study.
An appellate court in 2021 reversed Boasberg’s decision to shut down the pipeline, but did not reinstate the easement.
Boasberg wrote in a 2021 order following that decision that he could not shutter the pipeline because the tribe hadn’t sufficiently demonstrated that it posed an immediate threat of irreparable harm.
He noted in his Friday memo that “remarkably little” has changed in the four years since.
“Once more unto the breach, dear friends,” Boasberg wrote at the beginning of the order, quoting Shakespeare’s “Henry V”.
The Army Corps still has not finished the environmental impact study. It published a draft version of its report in late 2023. Once the study is complete, the Army Corps will use it to decide whether to grant the easement again.
One of the main arguments the tribe made in its 2024 lawsuit is that the Army Corps’ yearslong inaction on the Dakota Access Pipeline is a violation of federal law.
Boasberg wrote previously that, given the pipeline is operating on Army Corps land without proper authorization, the agency in the interim could have done something to enforce its property rights.
“The Corps has conspicuously declined to adopt a conclusive position regarding the pipeline’s continued operation, despite repeated prodding from this Court and the Court of Appeals to do so,” he wrote in his 2021 order.
But the Army Corps for now is not legally required to do anything but finish the environmental impact study, Boasberg stated in the Friday memo.
He said that other arguments Standing Rock raised in its complaint seek to relitigate issues that were already decided in the 2016 case, and that the legal landscape is not likely to change until the study is completed.
Boasberg noted that Standing Rock can file another lawsuit against the Corps once the study is published. The Army Corps of Engineers in legal filings also argued the tribe cannot sue the Corps over the easement when it had not yet made a final decision on the permit.
The tribe indicated last fall that it had new evidence to present related to the pipeline’s safety. The pipeline company has indicated previously it does not consider that information credible.
North Dakota, other states and pipeline owner Dakota Access intervened in the lawsuit on the side of the Corps. The intervenors called on the court to dismiss the case, arguing that the pipeline is important to the country’s economy, and that shutting it down would violate states’ rights and make road and rail transit less safe.
“The Dakota Access Pipeline has been operating safely for almost eight years now and is a critical piece of infrastructure for North Dakota and our nation’s energy security,” North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong said in a statement regarding Boasberg’s decision.
A spokesperson for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Army Corps of Engineers declined to comment.
“The Corps has failed to act and failed to protect the tribe,” Standing Rock Chairwoman Janet Alkire said in an October press conference announcing the lawsuit.
The pipeline, which spans more than 1,000 miles, carries crude oil from northwest North Dakota to Illinois. Its pathway includes unceded land recognized as the Sioux Nation’s in 19th century treaties signed by the U.S. government.

The majority party argues a stopgap two-year budget was needed to “keep the lights on” and provide consistency to Mainers amid federal uncertainty, but that it was only “part one.” The budget leaves some things unfunded, notably another expected shortfall for MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program. Democrats say that was an intentional decision to wait for updated state revenue projections and any changes coming from Washington D.C. 
Republicans argue, because of that, the budget isn’t balanced and also doesn’t include any of the policy changes Democrats may be looking to adopt in a “part two” budget — a framework they disavow as disingenuous. 
Some from the minority party have started collecting signatures for a People’s Veto of the budget that passed, which, if they secure at least 67,682 signatures from Maine voters by June 18, would put the law on hold until the November election or an earlier statewide special election — causing a government shutdown. 
“It’s reckless. It’s chaotic. It’s what we’re seeing in Washington, D.C., brought here to Maine,” Speaker of the House Ryan Fecteau (D-Bidderford) said of the People’s Veto.
Political jabs aside, how are legislators honestly thinking about re-evaluating spending in light of the projected $450 million deficit over the next two years?
That budget bill was “not the last word,” Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Brunswick) said.
“We need to start having the conversations about what the 132nd Maine Legislature wants,” Daughtry said. 
‘March majority madness’: Legislative Democrats pass two-year budget over Republican objections

Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook) said his primary concern for the remainder of session is MaineCare. 
“It’s not fixed,” Stewart said. “We are highly likely to be right back in here within a year dealing with yet another Medicaid bailout, to say nothing of what happens on the federal front.”
First, how much money is left? 
Republicans argue there is no money left for more work this session. Democrats argue that’s not true. There’s validity to both claims, depending on how you view the situation. 
The state is expected to bring in $11,224,416,665 in revenue over the next biennium, fiscal years 2026 and 2027, based on the latest forecast from December. 
While the general fund appropriations in the budget that passed last week total $11,320,717,493 for that timeframe, the total net impact is actually a bit less, $11,229,531,053.
Factoring in these new appropriations, remaining balances carried over and transfers, Christopher Nolan, director of the nonpartisan Office of Fiscal and Program Review, said fiscal year 2027 is expected to end with $127,737,632. 
This is what’s left for lawmakers to still appropriate in a “part two” budget or through individual bill spending.
However, funding the expected Medicaid gap in 2027 would absorb most of it. The tax increases and program cuts Gov. Janet Mills proposed will be considered in the next budget, which could free up more dollars for new initiatives. 
Uncertainty on the federal level adds another layer of complications to the funding landscape. On the state-level, the latest fiscal briefing from the Office of Fiscal and Program Review released last week shows general fund revenue is currently $28 million below budget. Much could change before the updated revenue forecast in May. 
There’s also another strategy lawmakers have expressed interest in exploring that could alter how much money they have to work with: resetting baseline spending, which the recently passed budget continued as is. 
Regardless, there is apprehension about fiscal possibilities, as underscored by Rep. Amanda Collamore (R-Pittsfield) on the House floor last week. 
“What is the point of working any bill with a fiscal note that isn’t negative?” Collamore asked. “I’m not sure it’s responsible to vote for any bill, including my own.” 
The process will, and should still play out, Stewart said. 
“We don’t know what we don’t know until we get there,” he said.
In any session, regardless of the economic landscape, the budget process is murky with many bills dying by way of the “appropriations table,” which all legislation with a fiscal note ends up on even after passing the House and Senate. 
Last session, less than 10% of bills on the table became law. 
The final arbiters are the legislators who sit on the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee, and the behind-the-scenes negotiating that determines their votes, along with the governor’s veto pen. 
Daughtry and Fecteau both said they believe what comes next shouldn’t actually be up to them. 
“I recognize as a leader I have a larger bully pulpit than the average members but I have trust in my colleagues not only on the policy committees but also on the Appropriations Committee,” Daughtry said. “I really am trying to keep my palate dry and wait and see what my colleagues are able to come up with, what our members of the public say as well.”
While acknowledging that the Legislature has a balancing act ahead of it, Fecteau agreed.
“I’m not going to sit here and say I can identify all of the ways in which we can save money from the baseline or we can save money from not moving forward new initiatives that were proposed or how we can generate revenue in the most effective way,” Fecteau said. “But what I can say is it will all be on the table and up for consideration amongst my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee. That’s their charge.”

What’s possible with what’s left? 
Stewart often repeats his stance that the state has a spending problem, not a revenue problem. Before the start of the session, he told Maine Morning Star he wanted the Legislature to audit the state budget to assess whether current funding levels are adequate. 
So what do lawmakers want to reassess? “It’s all the above,” Stewart said. “You’ve got to start peeling back the layers of the onion.”
Vacancies 
There’s the assumption, and historic reality, that the governor will get most of what she asks for, which includes a plan for approximately 250 more government positions. Stewart wants to see the state address vacancies first. 
As of Feb. 13, there were 1,975 vacancies out of 13,557 permanent positions, amounting to a 14.6% vacancy rate, according to the Maine Department of Administrative and Financial Affairs. For comparison, the vacancy rate in February 2024 was 16.6% and in March 2023 was 16.2%.
DAFS Director of Communications Sharon Huntley said there are many reasons positions are vacant, and sometimes it’s intentional, such as with seasonal positions, which make up 10% of the current vacancies.
“It’s also important to note that eliminating a position will not necessarily save money,” Huntley said. “Of the 1,975 permanent vacancies, nearly half don’t include any general fund funding. For example, positions that are in place to use on as-needed basis funded with non-general fund dollars. While vacant they don’t cost the state or the fund anything, and, similarly, eliminating them won’t save anything.”
Additionally, each biennial budget includes savings from attrition — the assumption that there will be gradual staff reductions due to employees leaving and not being replaced. The two-year budget that passed included a 5% attrition rate level, up from 1.6%, which means the state has to have some level of vacancy in positions that are funded with general funds to achieve this budgeted savings.
Aside from a focus on vacancies, Stewart questioned, “what’s the vision?” 
Pointing to Maine students’ low test scores, inadequate mental health supports — a key point of contention in budget debates last year — and closing hospitals, which had already been struggling financially with high operating costs and low reimbursement rates before the supplemental budget scuffle, Stewart said reforming systems is what’s needed.
In Stewart’s view, that’s namely MaineCare. 
Health care
Legislative Republicans already presented proposals for reforming the program during supplemental budget negotiations, which Stewart said they’ll continue to push. These include requesting waivers from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to mandate reductions in enrollment, as well as institute work requirements for able-bodied, childless adults. 
The mandated reduction could start with a full review of everyone on the program to eliminate people who no longer qualify, Stewart said. What exactly work requirements would look like, he doesn’t know. The Trump administration may make such changes on the federal level, though he doesn’t see that as a reason to avoid doing it on the state-level first. 
Daughtry said she’s willing to discuss MaineCare reform. 
“If we’re having provider fraud or someone taking advantage of the system, I’m willing to hear those ideas,” Daughtry said, “but when you’re penalizing people whose very lives depend on the health care, that’s not promoting the economy. That’s going after people in need.” 
Approximately 30% of Mainers and roughly half of all Maine children are covered by MaineCare. “I really do feel healthcare is a human right,” Daughtry said. She also said it’s the will of the people, who have twice approved expansions to MaineCare at the ballot box. 










If we’re having provider fraud or someone taking advantage of the system, I’m willing to hear those ideas, but when you’re penalizing people whose very lives depend on the health care, that’s not promoting the economy. That’s going after people in need.


– Senate President Mattie Daughtry


Fecteau said he’d entertain the reforms left on the table by Senate Republicans rejecting the supplemental deal, specifically restrictions to ensure that people who win the lottery or who are incarcerated don’t remain eligible for MaineCare.
While Fecteau said the two-year budget could have fully funded MaineCare through 2027, the decision not to was an effort to say “let’s have an open and earnest conversation around potential reforms.”
Senate Minority Leader Matthew Harrington (R-York) explained in a press conference last week that the minority party’s ultimate goal is to shift people currently on MaineCare to federal exchanges.
Maine is one of 19 states, and Washington D.C., that fully run their own health insurance marketplace, called CoverME.gov. 
Last month, nearly 65,000 Mainers signed up for affordable health coverage through CoverME.gov for 2025, according to Health and Human Services Commissioner Sara Gagné-Holmes. However, Maine’s Office of Health Insurance Marketplace is the smallest in the nation and the office is requesting more positions in this next budget to keep up with growing enrollment. 
For people who are working, Harrington argued, “These folks can afford to pay something for health insurance. We should be encouraging them to do so.”
Daughtry said such a claim misunderstands how the marketplace works, as people are not able to enroll if their income threshold is below the bar that qualifies them for MaineCare.
“It’s ensuring that folks are able to find a product that meets with their income guidelines,” Daughtry said. “Now, if we could actually have the real conversation behind driving more people to the marketplace, it’s making sure people have more money in their pockets.” 
Daughtry hopes the Legislature considers bills that seek to establish a living wage, particularly addressing underpay in the public sector, as well as proposals to help families, such as better supporting childcare.  
Harrington and Stewart also argued that high MaineCare enrollment hurts hospitals, as they only receive a 70% reimbursement through the program compared to higher private-payer reimbursements. 
Daughtry argued the state should increase MaineCare reimbursements. However, she added that private insurance is also not reimbursing people enough. 
“It’s not just MaineCare,” Daughtry said. “The health care system as a whole is broken.” 
Taxes and cuts
Given the $450 million deficit the state is facing over the next biennium, and that only $127 million remains for the second year, program cuts and taxes are being considered, including the slate of changes Mills proposed that were not included in the “part one” budget.
Progressives are not supportive of her plan to cut some programs, including childcare workers stipends, and Republicans have already drawn a line in the sand regarding tax increases of any kind. 
While Mills has suggested a number of largely regressive taxes, which have a greater impact on low earners, some Democratic legislators are alternatively pushing for a model that taxes the wealthy more, including a “millionaire tax,” similar to a law recently passed in Massachusetts to tax income over $1 million by an additional 4%. 
One of Fecteau’s proposals, LD 1082, is to increase the real estate transfer tax on home sales above $1 million to increase the resources the state commits to the construction of affordable housing. Other lawmakers have proposed taxes on short-term rentals or changing the timeframe for accessing Historic Property Rehabilitation Tax Credits to fund things like affordable housing and education without adding to state spending. 
Albeit in different ways, there’s consensus that systems need to change. 
Stewart said of Democrats, “They want to be all things to all people all the time,” intentionally or not, calling back to the phrase Mills repeated when she first introduced her budget plan in January. 
“I don’t think government can, or should, be all things to all people at all times,” Mills said in defense of her proposed cuts and tax increases.
Ultimately, as Fecteau put it, “It’s going to be a balancing act.”

Encino Energy was chosen to lease 62 acres of land in Leesville, which is property of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. Friday’s meeting lasted about 15 minutes. 
The commissioners posted the nominated leasing parcel for bid on Jan. 2, and the deadline to submit bids was Feb. 1. Each lease agreement includes a 12.5% royalty paid to the state for production, per state law, with an additional financial incentive paid by the winning bidder to the state, according to ODNR.

The lease bonuses for these nominations chosen by the committee is $218,715 for ODNR properties, according to ODNR.
Fracking is the process of injecting liquid into the ground at a high pressure to extract oil or gas. Anti-fracking advocates from Save Ohio Parks shouted questions and concerns while the commissioners conducted their meeting. 
Two nominations were considered and approved to go to bidding for fracking by the commission on Friday — 171 acres of Leesville and a possible right-of-way along SR 149 owned by the Ohio Department of Transportation in Belmont County. These nominations will go out to bid in April. 
Two nominations were up for a vote during Friday’s meeting that were not voted on — 3.6 acres in Valley Run Wildlife Area in Carroll County and a possible right-of-way along SR 151 owned by ODOT in Harrison County. 
“I propose we bring it up only for discussion today,” OGLMC Chair Theresa White said. Even though the commissioners approved the motion, there was no discussion on either piece of land. OGLMC plans to take action on these nominations at a future meeting. 
Melinda Zemper with Save Ohio Parks said Ohio needs a moratorium on natural gas fracking under state parks and public lands. 
“Gov. Mike DeWine and state legislators risk good health, our pristine lands, our water and air and livable planet by continuing to support this dangerous and polluting 20th century energy industry in our quickly warming 21st century,” she said. 
Before the meeting, Roxanne Groff also with Save Ohio Parks talked about the Jan. 2 well pad explosion in Guernsey County. The well pad is operated by Gulfport Energy and no one was injured. The Guernsey County Emergency Management Agency issued an evacuation notice within half a mile of the well pad. 
“Salt Fork State Park is going to be completely surrounded by frack well pads, and any one of those pads can have an explosion,” Groff said. “What are you going to do when there are 2,000 people in that park and there’s a well padded explosion?”
There were more than 1,400 fracking incidents associated with oil and gas wells in Ohio between 2018 and September 2023, according to FracTracker Alliance — a nonprofit that collects data on fracking pipelines. About 10% of those incidents were reported as fires or explosions.
“Our parks, our children, our grandchildren’s lives are at stake here, and you’re about to just say that doesn’t matter,” Groff said. 
Andrew Goode and Anthony Jesko are two new members of OGLMC. Both men were appointed to the commission by DeWine on Dec. 19, 2024.  Jesko is an attorney from Northeast Ohio and his term will expire Sept. 29, 2028, and Goode is an attorney from central Ohio and his term expires on Sept. 29, 2029. 
“I’ve listened intently to what you guys have said, and I will continue to listen to that, just so you guys are aware,” Goode said, referring to the comments Groff made before the meeting.

Other GOP politicians are holding back.
The 2026 gubernatorial race is heating up. Right now, there are three candidates seeking the GOP nomination: entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, Attorney General Dave Yost and businesswoman Heather Hill.
Already, endorsements are coming out.
Hill hasn’t received any, from research into statewide or local groups and politicians.
Yost has a coalition of about 30 county sheriffs and former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell.
Ramaswamy has received support from President Donald Trump, U.S. Senator Bernie Moreno, U.S. Congressman Warren Davidson of the Eighth District, Secretary of State Frank LaRose, Treasurer Robert Sprague, a coalition of about 20 sheriffs, religious lobbyist Aaron Baer and dozens of state lawmakers like Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon.
“He has the vision, business expertise, and relentless drive to make Ohio the best state in America to live, work, and raise a family,” McColley said in a statement.
But two of the most powerful Statehouse Republicans haven’t spoken up yet, including Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who appointed Tressel as lieutenant governor after appointing previous Lt. Gov. Jon Husted to the U.S. Senate.
“Well, the last I looked, we’re about 14 months away from the primary, let alone from the general election,” DeWine responded when asked about his endorsement and whether he is waiting for Tressel to get in the race. “So it’s a long, long way to go, and I’m sure there’ll be other people who get in the race.”
The governor hasn’t issued his endorsement yet, with many GOP strategists like Bob Clegg believing that he possibly chose his lieutenant governor — former OSU coach Jim Tressel — as his future replacement.
“He also picked somebody who has about 95% name ID in the state of Ohio, which is very rare,” Clegg said. “And Jim Tressel cannot have a better image here in the state of Ohio.”
Name identification refers to the number of voters who know you off the top of their heads already.
Although he hasn’t announced, Tressel has been out and about — headlining Republican events and fundraisers across the state. We asked him this week about when he will enter the race.
“When I was coaching, I would tell you I’m not thinking about the next game,” the former coach responded. “I’m thinking about this game. That hasn’t changed.”
The LG recently created a 2024 transition fund, which allows him to collect money for inaugural events. However, he filed the account after his inauguration. We asked his team why this was. Still, it would be illegal for him to use any of that money for campaign-related activities.
Tressel added that he has been busy learning about energy policy, foster care, education and workforce development.
House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, also hasn’t made his decision.
“The most important thing that I’m doing right now is getting the House of Representatives to come together cohesively on passing a budget,” the speaker said.
The state operating budget has monopolized this General Assembly so far, as it typically does in odd years.
“I don’t need some reason for people not to like somebody else across the aisle and not just across the Republican-Democrat aisle but across these aisles,” he said, gesturing to the GOP side of the chamber. “I don’t want to try to divide this caucus, so I’ve told all these folks if I’m going to endorse that’s not until after June 30th. Obviously, members of the House can do whatever they want.”
The Ohio Republican Party also hasn’t endorsed yet, but as DeWine said, there are more than 400 days until the primary.
“We have a long way to go,” the governor said.
Whoever wins that primary will face off against the Democratic nominee, likely former Ohio Department of Health Director Amy Acton.

(iStock/Getty Images Plus)No one asked for hippos to overrun Colombian rivers.
But hippos frolic in the South American country anyway, thanks to the extravagant ego of drug kingpin Pablo Escobar. He imported four of the beasts for a private menagerie. After his death, they escaped and multiplied, turning into an invasive species bedeviling officials. The government has sought to sterilize and deport the beasts, but cocaine hippos keep on thriving.
And so it is with bad ideas in the Kansas Legislature. Each year lawmakers wade through scads of proposals introduced by out-of-state think tanks or touted by conservative influencers, none of them with the slightest connection to actual Kansans’ problems or concerns.
Such ideas are the cocaine hippos of Kansas politics, taking up residence in the credulous heads of GOP lawmakers and driving out all hope of sensible policymaking.
Once you spot these cocaine hippos (I must give credit to classical music critic David Hurwitz for introducing me to the term), you can’t ignore them. Their bulky yet slippery bodies have twisted and distorted the state’s political landscape. Eradicating the creatures, in whatever ways possible, will only strengthen government.
Here are five hippos spotted in the past few months.
“The Legislature adopted a spending plan Thursday that fully funds public schools, provides pay raises for state employees, eliminates DEI initiatives, polices pronouns in emails, and puts the state on a course to blow through billions in reserves and face a budget shortfall within three years.” (March 27)
You might support or oppose diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives or people sharing their pronouns in email messages. But what do they have to do with any problems in Kansas? Who has been actually, provably harmed by any of this? Kansans have been swept along by a nationwide panic over innocuous attempts to create a more caring and accepting society.
House Republicans refused to consider a plea from Democratic Rep. Valdenia Winn to send a message that there is no place for racism in the state of Kansas.
Winn, a Kansas City Democrat, proposed an amendment to House Bill 2299, which declares that antisemitism is against the public policy of the state. She wanted to expand the language to condemn all forms of racism and discrimination. (March 26)
Racism and antisemitism are both bad. Very bad. Yet why were legislators taking up or debating this bill in the first place? Discrimination on the basis of both is already illegal. Hate crimes are illegal, too. Have we seen any recent examples of such or related public unrest in Kansas? (And no, muted protests against Israel in its war against Hamas don’t count.)
The House and Senate on Tuesday overrode Gov. Laura Kelly’s veto of legislation that could result in thousands of advance ballots being disqualified. (March 25)
You know who has administered elections in Kansas for years? Republicans. You know who has repeatedly reassured Kansans that our elections are safe and secure? Republican Secretary of State Scott Schwab. There is no evidence that allowing three days for mail-in ballots to arrive will cause any problems. But Rep. Pat Proctor, R-Leavenworth, has swallowed the propaganda of President Donald Trump hook, line and sinker. U.S. elections are free and fair, and there have been no issues in Kansas.
Still, the cocaine hippos overturn boats.
Kansas House Republicans have repeatedly met in closed caucus meetings this legislative session, doing state business in secret and upending longstanding tradition. (March 24)
Republicans enjoy preposterous supermajorities in the House and Senate. They have no reason to fear sunlight or transparency. Their leaders have more options and flexibility than they have enjoyed in years. And yet, they hide. They have somehow come to believe that letting people see what they do — even if it’s as simple as persuading members to vote one way or another — simply can’t be shared. But why? What harm have they suffered?
The House still approved Senate Concurrent Resolution 1602, a nonbinding statement that urges the governor to help secure the U.S. border with Mexico and work with federal authorities to enforce immigration laws. (March 20)
As has been pointed out repeatedly, and as can be seen by merely glancing at a map, Kansas doesn’t share a border with Mexico. We have to deal with Oklahoma and Missouri, which are bad enough. Immigration fearmongering has no connection with anything actually witnessed in Kansas. As a matter of fact, whole sectors of our economy would shut down without migrant labor.
And I could go on, but cocaine hippos have a way of crowding out all rational thought.
While those of us watching from afar can see the way in which these malignant ideas have infiltrated our government, they have found surprisingly receptive hosts in lawmakers. Indeed, the mental landscape of many in Topeka would appear entirely unrecognizable to many of us. They have welcomed the hippos, praised them as saintly creatures and called on them to reproduce even more freely.
As far back as 2012, literary critic Harold Bloom raised alarms about this tendency.
In a lecture about poet Walt Whitman, he told a crowd: “We are far along on a route away from democracy into the morass of plutocracy, … oligarchy and theocracy, because many millions among us live a reality completely separate from that of those in this room, for instance. The function of literary criticism at the present time cannot be the struggle with this Moby Dick of the American spirit, yet awareness of it should be part of our common ordeal of consciousness.”
Kansas and its residents confront real obstacles. We experience real needs. Schools and special education require investment. The tax system demands rebalancing, making sure those who profit the most help everyone else. Petty hatreds and discrimination deserve to rot in the ash heap of history.
Instead, we fight nonexistent problems with phantom weapons.
And those cocaine hippos keep breeding.

Nearly every modern medical treatment can be traced to research funded by the National Institutes of Health: from over-the-counter and prescription medications that treat high cholesterol and pain to protection from infectious diseases such as polio and smallpox.
The remarkable successes of the decades-old partnership between biomedical research institutions and the federal government are so intertwined with daily life that it’s easy to take them for granted.
However, the scientific work driving these medical advances and breakthroughs is in jeopardy. Federal agencies such as the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation are terminating hundreds of active research grants under the current administration’s direction. The administration has also proposed a dramatic reduction in federal support of the critical infrastructure that keeps labs open and running. Numerous scientists and health professionals have noted that changes will have far-reaching, harmful outcomes for the health and well-being of the American people.
The negative consequences of defunding U.S. biomedical research can be difficult to recognize. Most breakthroughs, from the basic science discoveries that reveal the causes of diseases to the development of effective treatments and cures, can take years. Real-time progress can be hard to measure.
As biomedical researchers studying infectious diseases, viruses and immunology, we and our colleagues see this firsthand in our own work. Thousands of ongoing national and international projects dedicated to uncovering the causes of life-threatening diseases and developing new treatments to improve and save lives are supported by federal agencies such as the NIH and NSF.
Considering a few of the breakthroughs made possible through U.S. federal support can help illustrate not only the significant inroads biomedical research has made for preventing, treating and curing human maladies, but what all Americans stand to lose if the U.S. reduces its investment in these endeavors.
 A cure for cancer

The hope and dream of curing cancer unites many scientists, health professionals and affected families across the U.S. After decades of ongoing NIH-supported research, scientists have made significant progress in realizing this goal.
The National Cancer Institute of the NIH is the world’s largest funder of cancer research. This investment has led to advances in cancer treatment and prevention that helped reduce the overall U.S. cancer death rate by 33% from 1991 to 2021.
Basic science research on what causes cancer has led to new strategies to harness a patient’s own immune system to eliminate tumors. For example, all 12 patients in a 2022 clinical trial testing one type of immunotherapy had their rectal cancer completely disappear, without remission or adverse effects.

Another example of progress is the 2024 results of an ongoing clinical trial of a targeted therapy for lung cancer, showing an 84% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death. Similarly, in a study of women who were immunized against the human papillomavirus at age 12 or 13, none developed the disease later. Since the widespread adoption of HPV vaccination, cervical cancer deaths have dropped 62%.
Despite these incredible successes, there is still a long way to go. In 2024, over 2 million people in the U.S. were estimated to be newly diagnosed with cancer, and 611,720 were expected to die from the disease.
Without sustained federal support for cancer research, progress toward curing cancer and reducing its death rate will stall.
 Autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases

Nearly every family is touched in some way by autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases. Government-funded research has enabled major advances to combat conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease.
For example, approximately 1 in 5 Americans have arthritis, an autoimmune disease that causes joint swelling and stiffness. A leading cause of disability and economic costs in the U.S., there is no cure for arthritis. But new drugs in development are able to significantly improve symptoms and slow or prevent disease progression.
Researchers are also gaining insight into what causes multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks the protective covering of nerves and can result in paralysis. Scientists recently found a link between multiple sclerosis and Epstein-Barr virus, a pathogen estimated to infect over 90% of adults around the world. While multiple sclerosis is currently incurable, identifying its underlying cause can provide new avenues for prevention and treatment.
Alzheimer’s disease causes irreversible nerve damage and is the leading cause of dementia. In 2024, 6.9 million Americans ages 65 and older were living with Alzheimer’s. Most treatments address cognitive and behavioral symptoms. However, two new drugs developed with NIH-supported research and clinical trials were approved in July 2023 and July 2024 to treat early-stage Alzheimer’s. Federal funding is also supporting the development of blood tests for earlier detection of the disease.
None of these breakthroughs are a cure. But they represent important steps forward on the path toward ultimately reducing or eliminating these devastating ailments. Lack of funding will slow or block further progress, leading to the continued rise of the incidence and severity of these conditions.
 Infectious diseases and the next pandemic

The world’s capacity to combat infectious disease will also be weakened by cuts to U.S. federal support of biomedical research.
Over the past 50 years, medical and public health advances have led to the eradication of smallpox globally and the elimination of polio in the U.S. HIV/AIDS, once a death sentence, is now a disease that can be managed with medication. Moreover, a new version of treatments called preexposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, offers complete protection against HIV transmission when taken only twice per year.
Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the critical role biomedical research plays in responding to public health threats. Increased federal support of science during this time allowed the United States to emerge with new drugs, vaccine platforms with the potential to treat a variety of chronic diseases, and insights on how to effectively detect and respond to pandemic threats.
The ongoing avian influenza outbreak and its spillover into American dairy herds and poultry farms is another pandemic threat looming on the horizon. Rather than build upon infrastructure for outbreak surveillance and preparedness, grants that would allow scientists to better understand long COVID-19, vaccines and other pandemic-related research are being cut. Decreased funding of biomedical research will hamper the U.S.’s ability to respond to the next pandemic, putting everyone at risk.
 Losses from defunding biomedical research

The National Institutes of Health contributed over $100 billion to support research that ultimately led to the development of all new drugs approved from 2010 to 2016 alone. Over 90% of this funding was for basic research into understanding the causes of disease that provides the foundation for new treatments.
Under the new directive to eliminate projects that support or use terms associated with diversity, equity and inclusion, the NIH and other federal agencies have made deep cuts to biomedical research that will directly affect patient lives.
Already, nearly 41% of Americans will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime, and nearly 11% with Alzheimer’s. About 1 in 5 Americans will die from heart disease, and nearly 1.4 million will be rushed to an emergency room due to pneumonia from an infectious disease.
Defunding biomedical research will result in a cascade of effects. There will likely be fewer clinical trials, fewer new treatments and fewer lifesaving drugs. Labs will likely shut down, jobs will be lost, and the process of discovery will stall. The U.S.’s health care system, economy and standing as the world’s leader in scientific innovation will likely decline.
Moreover, when the pipelines of scientific progress are turned off, they will not so easily be turned back on. These consequences will affect all Americans and the rest of the world for decades.
University shortfalls directly resulting from cuts to research support will dramatically reduce the capacity of American institutions to educate and provide opportunities for the next generation. Funding cuts have led to the shuttering or heavy reduction of training programs for future scientists.
Graduate students and postdoctoral trainees are the lifeblood of biomedical research. Supporting these young people committed to public service through research and health care is also an investment in medical advancements and public health. But the uncertainty and instability resulting from the divestment of federally funded programs will likely severely deplete the biomedical workforce, crippling the United States’ ability to deliver future biomedical breakthroughs.
By cutting biomedical research funding, Americans and the rest of the world stand to lose new cures, new treatments and an entire generation of researchers.

Dr. Fred Levin has been watching with growing alarm the national debate around federal cuts to Medicaid. He’s responsible for the medical care of about 100 older adults at the Community PACE center in rural Newaygo, Michigan. For his patients, Medicaid isn’t just a safety net — it’s a matter of life or death.
“If left to see to their own needs, a lot of them would stay in their homes and would slowly die,” he said. “They wouldn’t be able to get to their doctors’ appointments unless they had a family member to help. They wouldn’t get social care. They wouldn’t have people coming into their homes and seeing the bed bugs or the lice in their hair. They wouldn’t get their medications.”
The care at Community PACE is paid for by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities, and Medicare, the federal insurance program for people 65 and older. The center is a one-stop shop that provides medical and social services to older adults during the day, allowing them to continue living safely in their homes.
If Congress cuts funding to Medicaid, Levin expects his center would probably close. Unlike traditional nursing home care, which state Medicaid programs are required by federal law to cover, the services at PACE centers like his are an optional benefit that 33 states have opted to cover.
Around the nation, doctors, lawmakers, advocates and patients are watching anxiously as Republicans in Congress consider proposals to slash billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in proposed tax cuts. The specific nature of the funding cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states.










If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved.


– Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy, Justice in Aging


The additional financial burden could blow billion-dollar holes in state budgets, forcing state lawmakers to slash health benefits or restrict who’s eligible for them. Nearly a fifth of Americans rely on Medicaid, and the percentage is even higher in some states.
“There are a lot of people who don’t pay attention to this because they think it doesn’t affect them personally,” Levin said. “But 1 in 4 people in Michigan are on Medicaid. It’s very likely you have friends or family on Medicaid.”
Nearly all Americans over age 65 are covered by Medicare, which Republicans have pledged not to touch. Medicare doesn’t cover most nursing home or other long-term care, however. Neither does most private insurance.
But Medicaid does.
“If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved,” said Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy for Justice in Aging, an advocacy group focused on addressing poverty among older people.
“Many of us have a connection to the program or will one day,” she said.
 A divided front

Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But policy experts say that reducing coverage for some Medicaid recipients, such as the working adults who got coverage under expansion programs, will have ripple effects on vulnerable groups such as children and older adults.
Republicans aren’t united in a desire to see massive cuts.
Last month, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican governor in a purple state, publicly called on Congress not to slash Medicaid funding.
Health insurance for millions could vanish as states put Medicaid expansion on chopping block

Earlier this week, Washington Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier wrote a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider cuts to Medicaid and expressing her concern about the large number of military retirees and senior citizens in her district.
Caldier, a dentist who has worked with nursing home patients, told Stateline she believes the most likely cuts would be a reduction in the amount the federal government matches state spending for working adults who are covered under Medicaid expansion. That, she said, would have little impact on older adults.
“The only caveat is that I am very worried that the leadership in our state does not have a good relationship with our president,” Caldier said. Democrats control the offices of governor and both legislative chambers in Washington state. Caldier worries that if Washington lawmakers defy the president over issues such as gender-affirming care for transgender youth, the feds could retaliate by slashing their Medicaid payments to the state.
“If we got into a political match with the president, we would lose, no matter how you slice or dice it,” she said.
In Idaho, Republican state lawmakers shot down a bill that likely would have repealed Medicaid expansion, before passing one that will introduce sweeping policy changes in an effort to control costs.
Even in Congress, some Republicans are balking, publicly defending Medicaid and warning about the consequences of deep cuts. Some who have high percentages of Medicaid recipients in their districts have urged party leaders not to cut funding for the program and have vowed to vote against any budget plan that does so.
Medicaid covers 72 million Americans. A majority of American adults, including two-thirds of Republicans, say they want Congress to either maintain current Medicaid spending or increase it, according to a February 2025 poll from KFF, a health policy research group.
President Donald Trump has said in recent months that he won’t touch Medicaid. But last month, U.S. House Republicans pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that calls for about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help counterbalance the Trump administration’s desired $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.
Facing cuts that large, states would have to figure out which benefits to chop in order to keep their budgets balanced, which is a constitutional requirement in most states.
Older adults and people with disabilities already account for more than half of states’ Medicaid spending, on average. In some states, including Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi and North Dakota, those groups account for two-thirds of state Medicaid spending.
Idaho state Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Democrat on the state Senate Health & Welfare committee, said her biggest concern is Congress reducing the federal match rate. This is the amount of money the federal government chips in to help states pay for Medicaid. How much a state receives mainly depends on how wealthy its residents are. Richer states such as California and Connecticut get less help, while poorer states get more.
In Idaho, on the poorer end of the spectrum, the feds pay about 67% of traditional Medicaid costs and 90% of Medicaid expansion costs.
“It is all a domino effect,” Wintrow said. The federal government covers about $3 billion of Idaho’s $4.2 billion Medicaid budget. “If the feds start chopping that off, it’s going to impact everything.”
 Cutting care at home

All state Medicaid programs have opted to cover at least some home-based and community care, such as home health aides who assist people with bathing, toileting and other daily living activities, transportation and adult day care.
Kean and other experts worry that because federal law doesn’t require state Medicaid programs to cover home-based care, state lawmakers might sharply reduce spending on those services — or even eliminate coverage.
‘Are nursing homes our only option?’ These centers offer older adults an alternative.

“When states have budget shortfalls, they start to tighten eligibility for the home-based programs,” said Kean. “We’re certain those would be the first to go if federal funding is cut for Medicaid.”
Paying for home-based services out of pocket would exhaust the median Medicare recipient’s savings in less than two years, according to KFF.
The median cost of a year of a full-time aide to help is about $62,400, far above the median income for Americans over 65, which is about $36,000. The median life savings for Medicare beneficiaries was $103,800 in 2023.
Home-based services are a popular benefit for state Medicaid programs, because most enrollees prefer to remain in their homes. And despite the expense, home care can be more cost effective than nursing homes — about $38,000 vs. nearly $54,000 per year in 2021, according to a KFF analysis.
Cutting Medicaid also could make it harder to recruit and keep a workforce of nursing home and home health employees.

Over the past two years, most states — even those led by Republicans — increased their Medicaid payment rates for those services, in an effort to combat the nationwide shortage of long-term care workers.
But federal funding cuts could jeopardize what states are able to pay those workers.
“There’s already a direct-care workforce crisis,” Kean said. “Even if eligibility isn’t directly cut or programs aren’t cut, there wouldn’t be enough workers to provide that care. At home and in nursing facilities, the quality of care will go down.”
In rural Michigan, Levin said the PACE center where he works employs about 100 people. Its closure would impact not only those workers, but also would mean his patients would be left to find transportation and other health services on their own, even if those services are still covered by Medicaid.
“Without access in rural areas, how are these individuals going to get to the bigger cities where they can get to their health care? It’s going to overwhelm other parts of the health care system,” Levin said.
“Everybody’s going to be responsible for taking care of the people who don’t have health insurance, in some indirect way or another. It’s going to affect us all.”

(Sammy Smith/Nebraska News Service)Nebraska voters should be confident their Xs go where they are intended and are counted in the right pile. We know this from the state’s previous elections being free and fair. Yet, despite the results and the facts and the accurate tabulation of votes, tinkerers remain — those who insist a sky full of hanging chads, “2,000 Mules” and bus loads of immigrants is falling.
The hallmark of that body of nonbelievers (or true believers, whichever you prefer) is its lack of proof that elections in Nebraska — or anywhere else for that matter — are fraught with fraud when their candidate doesn’t win. No amount of verification, substantiation or confirmation convinces them. No number of losing court cases deters them.
Still, we have instances of new voter restrictions based on their beliefs.
For example, without evidence, some argued the possibility of hordes of fraudulent voters would overrun our state system, leading to a new requirement of voter ID with photos. Fair enough. Although the new requirement created very few hitches in our electoral getalongs, as we’ve noted in this space before, if a photo ID requirement disenfranchised one voter, that’s one voter too many.
Changes proposed
Apparently, Nebraska’s outstanding and secure election systems still need tweaking if one believes the basis for Legislative Bill 541. If passed, LB 542 would erect further barriers to register and vote while also somehow denying the science and data on counting votes by hand, which finds hand counts less accurate than machines. The good news is that as of this writing the bill has yet to go anywhere. Nevertheless, its introduction alone is rooted in lies that the 2020 election was peppered with improprieties and, more damaging, calls into question the integrity of county election offices, local election officials and the Secretary of State’s Office. Enough already.
Into this miasmic mix now comes a presidential executive order unnecessarily injecting the federal government into elections. Its first section, “Purpose and Policy,” relies on unproven assertions and outright conspiracy theories that the nation’s ballot boxes are being sullied with the votes of the ineligible, especially non-citizens. Those numbers are infinitesimal if at all. 
Nevertheless, the order says as a country we have failed “to enforce basic and necessary election protections.” Not according to the metrics we use to measure such things.
The order came shortly after an unprecedented national security breach was uncovered, involving the administration, and the denial fiasco that followed, calling the timing into question. More problematic, however, is that the action seemed to move the federal government into a space previously reserved for states and local municipalities, countermanding or diluting their power to hold elections. 
That’s a constitutionally bad look.
Requirements clear
In case the feds are asking, here’s what it takes to register to vote in Nebraska:

Be a United States citizen.
Be at least 18 years of age on or before the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November.
Live in the State of Nebraska.
Have not been convicted of a felony, or if convicted, have completed your sentence for the felony, including any parole term.
Have not been officially found to be mentally incompetent.

What remains to be seen is whether the order moves Nebraska or any other state to alter how it runs its elections, including the registration process, the actual voting, the processes used to tabulate the votes and the reporting of the results. Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evenen recently spoke in favor of the order, if only to help election officials better identify who is a citizen. But executive orders come and go as presidents come and go. Not so acts of state legislatures and Congress, which write laws.
In the 2024 general election, 156,302,318 of us showed up to vote. That was 63.9 percent of those eligible to vote. If you’re keeping score at home, Wisconsin led the league with nearly 77 percent turnout, while in beautiful Hawaii only half of eligible voters marked their X. Nebraska was well-represented in the turnout sweepstakes with 73.9 percent. Its 934,188 was the second-most ballots ever cast in a state election.
But before we thump our chests, remember that more than a quarter of the eligibles in Nebraska stayed home. Nationally the number was more than a third. Turnout here and across the country was historically high but did nothing to dispel the usual math that a good portion of eligible voters continue to disenfranchise themselves by failing to register or to vote.
Which is why, rather than littering the voting process with hurdles and hoops and questionable executive orders, we should be spending more time, money and political capital on increasing the number of voters exercising their civic duty.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA bill originally designed to encourage safe gun storage now includes a controversial tax break on firearm purchases, and a proposed database that was seen as the central element of a school safety bill has been dropped in response to privacy concerns.
The compromises were forged as lawmakers head into the final week of the 2025 legislative session – the first since a 14-year-old accused gunman killed two other students and two teachers at Apalachee High School in September.
Lawmakers have until this Friday to send bills to the governor, who then has 40 days to decide whether to sign them into law.
Safe storage incentive spliced with sales tax holiday for guns, accessories
A House bill that would have created a $300 income tax break for firearm safes and other safe storage devices now only applies to gun safety training.
And the bill – which had passed overwhelmingly in the House and with bipartisan support – has been spliced together with a Senate bill creating a sales tax holiday in October for the purchase of firearms, ammunition and other accessories, like scopes and magazines – as well as gun safes.
The Senate Finance Committee advanced the measure Friday.

A similar version of the Senate bill, sponsored by Dallas Republican Sen. Jason Anavitarte, passed in the Senate this session with a party-line vote. The proposal originally called for an 11-day tax holiday, but it has been shrunk to a four-day window under the compromise.
The House proposal stalled largely over concerns among Second Amendment advocates that the tax incentive would create a registry or a record of who benefited from it. 
Rep. Mark Newton, an Augusta Republican who is the bill’s sponsor, said Friday that the proposal is a way to promote gun safety training in a “Second Amendment-friendly way” while also saving taxpayers money.
Democrats immediately objected.
“We took a responsible gun ownership bill and turned it into a gun proliferation bill,” Sen. Jason Esteves, an Atlanta Democrat, said after the committee vote Friday.
Republicans dismissed those concerns.
“Isn’t true if you’re going to buy a safe that you need to buy a gun to put in it,” said Sen. Steve Gooch, a Dahlonega Republican who serves as Senate majority leader.
Not all Democrats opposed the bill, though. Sen. Michael “Doc” Rhett, a Marietta Democrat, voted for it because he said sees it as “a start.”
“Anything that will promote gun safety is a good start,” Rhett said.
House Speaker Jon Burns, a Newington Republican, told reporters Friday that he still thought “the larger picture is being accomplished, and that’s to ensure that we have gun storage, gun safety devices that are available to Georgians.”
“I just want to see us get something done,” Burns said.
Gun safety advocates who spoke at an already-planned press conference at the state Capitol Friday blasted the compromise. Rep. Michelle Au, a Johns Creek Democrat who has pushed for gun storage requirements, said HB 79 has been “essentially completely neutered.”
“I’m not exactly sure what this bill aims to do at this point,” Au said Friday. “I don’t know if they think that the activists who are here and the students and the families that are listening are stupid enough to think that this is action on gun safety.”
Heather Hallett, the founder and director of Georgia Majority for Gun Safety, said the House measure went from a promotion of safe storage to “a tax bill related to guns and related gun products.”
“We have a problem with safe storage (in Georgia) and the fact that our Legislature, after the worst school shooting in Georgia’s history, cannot unequivocally take up some legislation to say Georgians should adopt safe storage practices – that’s a real statement of where our Legislature stands on gun safety,” Hallett said. 
House Republicans have also revived a controversial Senate proposal that targets a Savannah ordinance penalizing gun owners who leave their firearms in unlocked vehicles. If passed, someone facing a fine would be able to sue the city for as much as $25,000 in damages. That measure was added to Senate Bill 204 last week.
Database cut from high-priority school safety bill
Burns’ signature school safety bill passed unanimously through a Senate committee Thursday, but with some key elements stripped out.
One of the most controversial aspects of House Bill 268 was the creation of a statewide database of information on students who might pose a threat to school safety. That provision was removed after an outcry from parents and child advocates who worried that youthful mistakes or behaviors caused by disabilities could follow a student and harm their future opportunities.
  Sen. Bill Cowsert. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“An amazing number of parents, particularly of teenage boys, who, by definition, they are immature and compulsive and do dumb things were fearful that their child might end up having a stigma attached to them of having a record that would go with them permanently about some stupid comment, threat, or behavior they had done as a teenager when, in fact, they were really not criminal, never engaged in criminal behavior, just immature behavior,” said Athens Republican Sen. Bill Cowsert, who is sponsoring the bill in the Senate.
The bill, which is 57 pages long, still touches myriad aspects of school safety. It would require public schools to implement a panic button system and share data with local law enforcement including school maps.
It would also require schools to more quickly share data when a student transfers, a response to the Apalachee shooting in which the accused gunman had allegedly been interviewed by the FBI in connection with shooting threats at a different school in another district more than a year before the attack.
“You can see this is an extraordinarily comprehensive approach to addressing the known problems we have with school violence,” Cowsert said Thursday to his Senate colleagues. “And hopefully, with God’s help, we won’t have another Apalachee in this state.” 
The bill will have to go back to both the House and Senate by April 4 if it is to become law this year.
Speaking to reporters on Friday, Burns was comfortable with the bill’s chances and about the database being removed from the bill.
“This is a great process we have up here,” he said. “I think we all come together, we deal with the facts, sometimes we have a little different viewpoints, and final passage of anything is never the final statement on it. So, we look forward to working with the Senate next week, and I believe they’ll get school safety across the finish line, and I know that it will offer protections for our students in Georgia for a safe learning place.”
Though the measure passed the Senate committee unanimously, some still hope to see the bill changed before it heads to the chambers.
  Rep. Michelle Au speaks at a press conference Friday. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Some child advocates say parts of the bill calling for trial as an adult for teenagers charged with making terroristic threats against a school could sweep children, especially children of color, into the justice system for youthful behavior.
Au said she is grateful that Burns is prioritizing safety in schools, but she’s disappointed the bill makes no mention of firearms despite concerns about the danger of shootings. 
“When we talked about the cell phone bans in schools, which was presented as a bill to increase student performance and concentration and reduce distractions in schools, most of the objections I heard about that bill reverted back to the argument about school safety and how are kids going to call us if there’s a school shooting?” she said.
Au was referring to House Bill 340, a ban on personal devices for students through middle school, which passed both chambers and is awaiting Gov. Brian Kemp’s signature. Several lawmakers indicated that they agree with the principle of removing cell phones in schools to increase student focus but said the idea of a child not being able to call 911 or text loved ones in case of an emergency gave them pause.
“Everyone’s thinking about it,” Au said. “I it’s a really conspicuous omission therefore to have any legislative push, an omnibus bill that has many different aspects to it addressing school safety, but to leave out the most obvious piece of it that any parent or any student will tell you is top of mind.”

The buildup to sine die is always dramatic, with legislators scrambling to get their bills heard and passed. Sometimes, they can even get a little sneaky by reviving legislation that, based on procedure, should not be able to pass.
Issues important to Georgians like gun storage and school safety as well as whether diversity, equity and inclusion should be taught in schools could be decided this week. Lawmakers also still have to hash out an agreement on a spending plan for next year.
Here are some of the other major pieces of legislation to watch out for as the Gold Dome’s final countdown begins.
RFRA
Republican lawmakers have been trying for a decade to pass a statewide religious freedom bill, but those efforts have fallen short amid outcry from LGBTQ advocates.
This year, a RFRA bill – short for Religious Freedom Restoration Act – is just about as close to navigating the Legislature as it’s ever been.

Acworth Republican Sen. Ed Setzler has shepherded the RFRA bill, Senate Bill 36, through the senate as well as a couple of contentious House committee hearings. A successful vote in the House would put the bill on Kemp’s desk.
Setzler says the bill would give religious Georgians the same protections from state and local governments that they get from the First Amendment on the federal level.
Opponents say that because Georgia does not have a comprehensive civil rights law, a RFRA bill would allow business owners who have faith-based beef with LGBTQ people to refuse to serve them.
Transgender bills
Depending on how the week goes, transgender Georgians could lose the rights to play on girls’ school sports teams, obtain puberty blockers or receive gender affirming care from the state health care plan.
The session began with competing House and Senate bills aimed at protecting women’s sports by keeping transgender women out of them.
Senate Bill 1 now seems to be the more likely bill to pass. It would prevent students designated male at birth from playing on teams for girls or women from K-12 through college in both public and private schools. It would also impose gender-based restrictions on locker rooms, changing facilities and restrooms. It does not include additional measures that were originally part of the House plan that remove references to gender from state code.
  Sen. Blake Tillery. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Transgender adults who work for the state government or their dependents could lose the ability to get gender-affirming care like surgeries or hormone treatments through the state health insurance plan.
Vidalia Republican Sen. Blake Tillery’s Senate Bill 39 would shut that off starting next year.
Tillery said taxpayer dollars should not go to transgender medical services.
Transgender advocates call the bill a mean-spirited attempt to gin up political support that could end up costing more money in lawsuits than it saves.
Whether or not you’re on the state health insurance plan, a specific set of drugs that block sex hormones and can delay puberty could become harder to get next year.
Savannah Republican Sen. Ben Watson’s Senate Bill 30 originally banned puberty-blocking medications outright for transgender minors but was amended in committee to make them more difficult to get. If the bill passes and is signed into law, the drugs could not be prescribed without seeing multiple specialized medical providers.
Because they were amended, SB 30 and SB 1 will need to pass both chambers to have a shot at becoming law. The state House could vote on SB 39 any time before Sine Die, which would set it up for Kemp’s pen.
Pro-LGBTQ advocacy groups have called on supporters to visit the Capitol this week to urge lawmakers to oppose RFRA and the transgender bill, which they are calling the “slate of hate”

Among them were Dianne Canales and Anna Kabir, who work at Druid Hills Primary Care, which provides gender-affirming care.
“Basically, we’re here to advocate for our transgender patients and make sure that the laws that they’re planning to pass are not gonna prohibit them from getting access to health care,” Canales said.
Canales said both SB 39 and SB 30 would affect the patients in their practice.
“We have patients both on that type of insurance and taking the hormones,” she said. “And so passing something that’s going to prevent them from getting coverage, is gonna affect our practice tremendously, but not just our practice, but our community, and our patients. It’s going to have a detrimental impact on their mental health needs.”
Sanctuary cities
Another Tillery bill, Senate Bill 21, targets so-called sanctuary cities by allowing them to be held civilly liable for crimes committed by undocumented migrants.
This has long been a goal of Republican state lawmakers, but last year’s killing of 22-year-old Laken Riley at the University of Georgia ignited calls to emphasize deporting undocumented immigrants. A Venezuelan man immigration authorities say crossed into the country illegally was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for Riley’s murder.
A bill passed last year in the wake of Riley’s death allows the state to strip funding from cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, and soon after he took office in January, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping immigration bill into law named after Riley.
Senate Democrats argued that the bill is cruel and could result in overcrowded jails and lawsuits against cities.
The House can cast a final vote for SB 21 to send the legislation to the governor’s desk.
Elections

Before the session is scheduled to wrap up Friday, lawmakers could likely pass legislation changing state election rulemaking procedures, ban the state from being a member of a multi-state voter list accuracy system and implement other voting law changes.
Last week, Republican legislators advanced this session’s most extensive election bills out of House and Senate committees, after some significant last minute changes were made that its sponsors said should alleviate some criticisms heard during public meetings.
The most sweeping measures were House Bill 397 and Senate Bill 197, which have the same proposals for restricting the State Election Board from rulemaking within 60 days of an election and banning voters from dropping off absentee ballots on the final weekend before Election Day.
The bills also began the state’s  transition from participating in the Electronic Registration Information Center, an organization that currently provides two dozen states a database to help maintain accurate voter rolls.

Brad Little vetoed a bill to ban Idaho businesses, local and state governments, private and public schools, and colleges and universities from requiring medical interventions, such as vaccines, treatment or medication.
Senate Bill 1023, called the Idaho Medical Freedom Act, would have banned businesses and any Idaho governments — local, county or state — from requiring medical interventions for employment, admission to venues, transportation, or providing products or services. 
The bill would’ve also extended to schools in Idaho — private or public — and colleges, universities and trade schools, blocking them from requiring medical interventions for school attendance, employment, or entrance into campus or school buildings.
Little vetoed the bill Saturday — the first bill the Idaho governor has vetoed this year.

“Medical freedom is an Idaho value. However, this bill removes parents’ freedom to ensure their children stay healthy at school because it jeopardizes the ability of schools to send home sick students with highly contagious conditions including measles, lice, ringworm, pink eye, strep throat, stomach viruses, the flu, and other illnesses that disrupt families’ lives,” Little wrote in a transmittal letter explaining his veto.
This year, Little signed into law a bill to let Idaho doctors and health care entities refuse care that violates their beliefs. He cited that bill as one of several examples of his support of “true medical freedom in Idaho.”
“We are proud that Idaho already boasts the freest laws in the country when it comes to personal medical decisions, and we need to keep it that way,” Little wrote. “Parents already have enough to worry about while raising their children. They do not need government imposing more limitations on keeping children safe and healthy from contagious illnesses at school.”
 Bill would’ve expanded on businesses COVID vaccine requirement ban

In 2022, Little vetoed a bill that would ban Idaho businesses from requiring COVID vaccines.
“I have been consistent in stating my belief that businesses should be left to make decisions about the management of their operations and employees with limited interference from government,” Little wrote in his transmittal letter explaining his veto. 
The new broader medical intervention requirement ban the governor vetoed would have expanded on a previous Idaho law banning COVID vaccine requirements, which Little signed in 2023, despite its similarities to one he vetoed a year earlier, the Idaho Statesman reported.
This year’s broader bill — amended twice — was cosponsored by Sen. Dan Foreman, R-Moscow, and Rep. Robert Beiswenger, R-Horseshoe Bend. Health Freedom Defense Fund President and Founder Leslie Manookian wrote the bill. 
 Citing Idaho doctor who spread COVID disinformation, Idaho GOP chairwoman pushed for governor to sign bill

In a column published Thursday, Idaho Republican Party Chairwoman Dorothy Moon urged people to ask Little to sign the bill. 
She referenced support for the bill by Dr. Ryan Cole, an Idaho pathologist whose Washington medical license has been restricted after state regulators found he shared COVID disinformation and broke medical standards by virtually prescribing ivermectin to COVID patients, against medical practice, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
“In 2020 and 2021, it felt like the whole world had gone mad,” Moon wrote. “Many of us feared for the future of freedom in America. But this is 2025, and much has changed since those dark days. The American people sent Donald Trump back to the White House with a mandate to set things right. He, in turn, appointed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead Health & Human Services. Like Dr. Cole, RFK Jr. has long been skeptical of Big Pharma’s rhetoric and the government overreach that enabled it.”
Idaho Freedom Action, the lobbying arm of the Idaho Freedom Foundation, in an email alert Saturday said the governor “betrayed Idaho,” arguing Little “chose special interests” over “the interests of Idaho’s families.” The group asked supporters to send form emails to Idaho state lawmakers requesting they override the governor’s veto. 
Overriding a gubernatorial veto requires two-thirds support in each chamber of the Idaho Legislature. The bill narrowly passed the Senate on a 19-14 vote, and the House passage barely cleared that two-third threshold on a 47-23 vote. 
 Bill allows limited medical intervention mandates

Under the bill, medical interventions include “a procedure, treatment, device, drug injection, medication, or action taken to diagnose, prevent, or cure a disease or alter the health or biological function of a person.” 
Business medical intervention mandates for employment would still be allowed in a few excepted circumstances, including in certain federal travel scenarios if jobs require entry into facilities that require medical interventions, or if required by federal law. 
The bill would also exempt medical intervention bans in situations where employers require “personal protection equipment, items, or clothing … based on existing traditional and accepted industry standards or federal law.” But the bill says COVID-era requirements, such as for masks or vaccines, are not exempt from the ban.
The bill would allow the Idaho attorney general or county prosecuting attorneys to enforce the law through injunctive relief, which are essentially civil court actions issued in lawsuits.

In the wooded highlands of northern Arkansas, where small towns have few dentists, water officials who serve more than 20,000 people have for more than a decade openly defied state law by refusing to add fluoride to the drinking water.
For its refusal, the Ozark Mountain Regional Public Water Authority has received hundreds of state fines amounting to about $130,000, which are stuffed in a cardboard box and left unpaid, said Andy Anderson, who is opposed to fluoridation and has led the water system for nearly two decades.
This Ozark region is among hundreds of rural American communities that face a one-two punch to oral health: a dire shortage of dentists and a lack of fluoridated drinking water, which is widely viewed among dentists as one of the most effective tools to prevent tooth decay. But as the anti-fluoride movement builds unprecedented momentum, it may turn out that the Ozarks were not behind the times after all.
“We will eventually win,” Anderson said. “We will be vindicated.”
Fluoride, a naturally occurring mineral, keeps teeth strong when added to drinking water, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Dental Association. But the anti-fluoride movement has been energized since a government report last summer found a possible link between lower IQ in children and consuming amounts of fluoride that are higher than what is recommended in American drinking water. Dozens of communities have decided to stop fluoridating in recent months, and state officials in Florida and Texas have urged their water systems to do the same. Utah is poised to become the first state to ban it in tap water.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long espoused fringe health theories, has called fluoride an “industrial waste” and “dangerous neurotoxin” and said the Trump administration will recommend it be removed from all public drinking water.
Separately, Republican efforts to extend tax cuts and shrink federal spending may squeeze Medicaid, which could deepen existing shortages of dentists in rural areas where many residents depend on the federal insurance program for whatever dental care they can find.
Dental experts warn that the simultaneous erosion of Medicaid and fluoridation could exacerbate a crisis of rural oral health and reverse decades of progress against tooth decay, particularly for children and those who rarely see a dentist.
“If you have folks with little access to professional care and no access to water fluoridation,” said Steven Levy, a dentist and leading fluoride researcher at the University of Iowa, “then they are missing two of the big pillars of how to keep healthy for a lifetime.”
Many already are.

Overlapping ‘Dental Deserts’ and Fluoride-Free Zones
Nearly 25 million Americans live in areas without enough dentists — more than twice as many as prior estimates by the federal government — according to a recent study from Harvard University that measured U.S. “dental deserts” with more depth and precision than before.
Hawazin Elani, a Harvard dentist and epidemiologist who co-authored the study, found that many shortage areas are rural and poor, and depend heavily on Medicaid. But many dentists do not accept Medicaid because payments can be low, Elani said.
The ADA has estimated that only a third of dentists treat patients on Medicaid.
“I suspect this situation is much worse for Medicaid beneficiaries,” Elani said. “If you have Medicaid and your nearest dentists do not accept it, then you will likely have to go to the third, or fourth, or the fifth.”
The Harvard study identified over 780 counties where more than half of the residents live in a shortage area. Of those counties, at least 230 also have mostly or completely unfluoridated public drinking water, according to a KFF analysis of fluoride data published by the CDC. That means people in these areas who can’t find a dentist also do not get protection for their teeth from their tap water.
The KFF Health News analysis does not cover the entire nation because it does not include private wells and 13 states do not submit fluoride data to the CDC. But among those that do, most counties with a shortage of dentists and unfluoridated water are in the south-central U.S., in a cluster that stretches from Texas to the Florida Panhandle and up into Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma.
In the center of that cluster is the Ozark Mountain Regional Public Water Authority, which serves the Arkansas counties of Boone, Marion, Newton, and Searcy. It has refused to add fluoride ever since Arkansas enacted a statewide mandate in 2011. After weekly fines began in 2016, the water system unsuccessfully challenged the fluoride mandate in state court, then lost again on appeal.
Anderson, who has chaired the water system’s board since 2007, said he would like to challenge the fluoride mandate in court again and would argue the case himself if necessary. In a phone interview, Anderson said he believes that fluoride can hamper the brain and body to the point of making people “get fat and lazy.”
“So if you go out in the streets these days, walk down the streets, you’ll see lots of fat people wearing their pajamas out in public,” he said.
Nearby in the tiny, no-stoplight community of Leslie, Arkansas, which gets water from the Ozark system, the only dentist in town operates out of a one-man clinic tucked in the back of an antique store. Hand-painted lettering on the store window advertises a “pretty good dentist.”
James Flanagin, a third-generation dentist who opened this clinic three years ago, said he was drawn to Leslie by the quaint charms and friendly smiles of small-town life. But those same smiles also reveal the unmistakable consequences of refusing to fluoridate, he said.
“There is no doubt that there is more dental decay here than there would otherwise be,” he said. “You are going to have more decay if your water is not fluoridated. That’s just a fact.”

Fluoride Seen as a Great Public Health Achievement
Fluoride was first added to public water in an American city in 1945 and spread to half of the U.S. population by 1980, according to the CDC. Because of “the dramatic decline” in cavities that followed, in 1999 the CDC dubbed fluoridation as one of 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.
Currently more than 70% of the U.S. population on public water systems get fluoridated water, with a recommended concentration of 0.7 milligrams per liter, or about three drops in a 55-gallon barrel, according to the CDC.
Fluoride is also present in modern toothpaste, mouthwash, dental varnish, and some food and drinks — like raisins, potatoes, oatmeal, coffee, and black tea. But several dental experts said these products do not reliably reach as many low-income families as drinking water, which has an additional benefit over toothpaste of strengthening children’s teeth from within as they grow.
Two recent polls have found that the largest share of Americans support fluoridation, but a sizable minority does not. Polls from Axios/Ipsos and AP-NORC found that 48% and 40% of respondents wanted to keep fluoride in public water supplies, while 29% and 26% supported its removal.
Chelsea Fosse, an expert on oral health policy at the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, said she worried that misguided fears of fluoride would cause many people to stop using fluoridated toothpaste and varnish just as Medicaid cuts made it harder to see a dentist.
The combination, she said, could be “devastating.”
“It will be visibly apparent what this does to the prevalence of tooth decay,” Fosse said. “If we get rid of water fluoridation, if we make Medicaid cuts, and if we don’t support providers in locating and serving the highest-need populations, I truly don’t know what we will do.”
Multiple peer-reviewed studies have shown what ending water fluoridation could look like. In the past few years, studies of cities in Alaska and Canada have shown that communities that stopped fluoridation saw significant increases in children’s cavities when compared with similar cities that did not. A 2024 study from Israel reported a “two-fold increase” in dental treatments for kids within five years after the country stopped fluoridating in 2014.
Despite the benefits of fluoridation, it has been fiercely opposed by some since its inception, said Catherine Hayes, a Harvard dental expert who advises the American Dental Association on fluoride and has studied its use for three decades.

Fluoridation was initially smeared as a communist plot against America, Hayes said, and then later fears arose of possible links to cancer, which were refuted through extensive scientific research. In the ’80s, hysteria fueled fears of fluoride causing AIDS, which was “ludicrous,” Hayes said.
More recently, the anti-fluoride movement seized on international research that suggests high levels of fluoride can hinder children’s brain development and has been boosted by high-profile legal and political victories.
Last August, a hotly debated report from the National Institutes of Health’s National Toxicology Program found “with moderate confidence” that exposure to levels of fluoride that are higher than what is present in American drinking water is associated with lower IQ in children. The report was based on an analysis of 74 studies conducted in other countries, most of which were considered “low quality” and involved exposure of at least 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water — or more than twice the U.S. recommendation — according to the program.
The following month, in a long-simmering lawsuit filed by fluoride opponents, a federal judge in California said the possible link between fluoride and lowered IQ was too risky to ignore, then ordered the federal Environmental Protection Agency to take nonspecified steps to lower that risk. The EPA started to appeal this ruling in the final days of the Biden administration, but the Trump administration could reverse course.
The EPA and Department of Justice declined to comment. The White House and Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to questions about fluoride.
Despite the National Toxicology Program’s report, Hayes said, no association has been shown to date between lowered IQ and the amount of fluoride actually present in most Americans’ water. The court ruling may prompt additional research conducted in the U.S., Hayes said, which she hoped would finally put the campaign against fluoride to rest.
“It’s one of the great mysteries of my career, what sustains it,” Hayes said. “What concerns me is that there’s some belief amongst some members of the public — and some of our policymakers — that there is some truth to this.”
Not all experts were so dismissive of the toxicology program’s report. Bruce Lanphear, a children’s health researcher at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, published an editorial in January that said the findings should prompt health organizations “to reassess the risks and benefits of fluoride, particularly for pregnant women and infants.”
“The people who are proposing fluoridation need to now prove it’s safe,” Lanphear told NPR in January. “That’s what this study does. It shifts the burden of proof — or it should.”

Cities and States Rethink Fluoride
At least 14 states so far this year have considered or are considering bills that would lift fluoride mandates or prohibit fluoride in drinking water altogether. In February, Utah lawmakers passed the nation’s first ban, which Republican Gov. Spencer Cox told ABC4 Utah he intends to sign. And both Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo and Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller have called for their respective states to end fluoridation.
“I don’t want Big Brother telling me what to do,” Miller told The Dallas Morning News in February. “Government has forced this on us for too long.”
Additionally, dozens of cities and counties have decided to stop fluoridation in the past six months — including at least 16 communities in Florida with a combined population of more than 1.6 million — according to news reports and the Fluoride Action Network, an anti-fluoride group.
Stuart Cooper, executive director of that group, said the movement’s unprecedented momentum would be further supercharged if Kennedy and the Trump administration follow through on a recommendation against fluoride.
Cooper predicted that most U.S. communities will have stopped fluoridating within years.
“I think what you are seeing in Florida, where every community is falling like dominoes, is going to now happen in the United States,” he said. “I think we’re seeing the absolute end of it.”
If Cooper’s prediction is right, Hayes said, widespread decay would be visible within years. Kids’ teeth will rot in their mouths, she said, even though “we know how to completely prevent it.”
“It’s unnecessary pain and suffering,” Hayes said. “If you go into any children’s hospital across this country, you’ll see a waiting list of kids to get into the operating room to get their teeth fixed because they have severe decay because they haven’t had access to either fluoridated water or other types of fluoride. Unfortunately, that’s just going to get worse.”
 



Methodology: How We Counted
This KFF Health News article identifies communities with an elevated risk of tooth decay by combining data on areas with dentist shortages and unfluoridated drinking water. Our analysis merged Harvard University research on dentist-shortage areas with large datasets on public water systems published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The Harvard research determined that nearly 25 million Americans live in dentist-shortage areas that span much of rural America. The CDC data details the populations served and fluoridation status of more than 38,000 public water systems in 37 states. We classified counties as having elevated risk of tooth decay if they met three criteria:More than half of the residents live in a dentist-shortage area identified by Harvard.The number of people receiving unfluoridated water from water systems based in that county amounts to more than half of the county’s population.The number of people receiving unfluoridated water from water systems based in that county amounts to at least half of the total population of all water systems based in that county, even if those systems reached beyond the county borders, which many do.
Our analysis identified approximately 230 counties that meet these criteria, meaning they have both a dire shortage of dentists and largely unfluoridated drinking water.
But this total is certainly an undercount. Thirteen states do not report water system data to the CDC, and the agency data does not include private wells, most of which are unfluoridated.

Spencer Cox will allow a bill aimed at banning many flags — including pride or LGBTQ+ flags — from schools and all government buildings to become law without his signature. Cox explained [&#8230;]","A pride flag flies at the Salt Lake City & County Building on Thursday, March 13, 2025. (McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)SALT LAKE CITY — Saying Utahns are “tired of culture war bills that don’t solve the problems they intend to fix,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox will allow a bill aimed at banning many flags — including pride or LGBTQ+ flags — from schools and all government buildings to become law without his signature.
Cox explained his reasoning in a letter to legislative leaders issued with just over an hour to spare before his midnight deadline Thursday to sign or veto bills passed by the 2025 Utah Legislature.
“HB77 has been one of the most divisive bills of the session, and I am deeply disappointed that it did not land in a better place,” wrote Cox, who also explained he agreed with the intent behind the legislation. “My understanding is that there was a deal on a compromise that would have removed problematic portions of the bill while retaining others that would support political neutrality in the classroom. Sadly the sponsors did not move that deal forward.”
Supporters of HB77, sponsored by Rep. Trevor Lee, R-Layton, argued it was meant to promote “political neutrality” in government spaces. But critics argued a broad ban that extended to all government properties would invite free speech litigation while also leaving some Utahns, especially the LGBTQ+ community, feeling unwelcome and erased.

Now slated to take effect on May 7, HB77 will ban almost all flags from being displayed on or in public buildings, except for flags explicitly allowed in a prescriptive list included in the bill, such as the U.S. flag, the state flag, military flags, Olympic flags, college or university flags, or others. Pride flags or other LGBTQ+ flags — which Utah lawmakers in recent years have repeatedly tried to bar from schools in various ways — would be prohibited.
It’s slated to make Utah the first state in the nation to enact such sweeping flag restrictions in government-owned buildings. The Idaho Legislature recently passed a similar bill, HB41, which Gov. Brad Little signed last week, but that legislation won’t take effect until July 1 and it only applies to schools. Idaho lawmakers are also advancing a separate bill to restrict government entities from displaying certain types of flags.

Utah’s largest LGBTQ+ rights group, Equality Utah, had negotiated with lawmakers on the bill, which originally focused the flag ban on school classrooms. However, in a House committee last month, Lee changed the legislation to broaden the flag ban to all government property, leading Equality Utah to oppose the bill even though it was prepared to take a “neutral” position on its earlier version.
Cox faced numerous calls to veto HB77 from advocacy groups including Equality Utah and the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah, as well as from Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall, whose city hosts the annual Utah Pride Festival. He could have vetoed the bill — but he indicated in his letter that it would likely just be overridden by the GOP-supermajority Utah Legislature. Instead, he’s urging lawmakers to work to fix it.
“I continue to have serious concerns with this bill,” Cox said. “However, because a veto would be overridden, I have decided to allow the bill to go into law without my signature, and urge lawmakers to consider commonsense solutions that address the bill’s numerous flaws.”
Cox encouraged lawmakers to consider allowing the Utah State Board of Education to “go further in ensuring the political neutrality of our classrooms, while also considering repealing the local government piece of this legislation and allowing elected representatives to answer to their own constituents.”
“If you are willing to pursue this kind of solution, you will have an open door in the executive branch,” Cox wrote.
Cox’s comments on the flag ban came after the bill cast final-hour drama over Utah’s multimillion-dollar bid to entice the Sundance Film Festival to stay, with some saying it could impact Utah’s chances.
Earlier Thursday, festival organizers announced they’d opted to move the event to Colorado to help the festival grow. By the time they’d reached their decision, Cox had not yet acted on HB77, but a veto was looking unlikely.

While Cox told reporters last week Sundance organizers had told state leaders “very clearly that political issues have nothing to do with the decision,” others, including Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall, worried that HB77 could indeed be “harmful to our effort to retain Sundance.”
In the end, Utah lost its bid. Cox — who earlier Thursday called Sundance’s decision a “mistake” — also included a note in his letter that he’ll be calling a special session to address, among other issues, what the Legislature should instead do with the $3.5 million it had set aside as part of Utah’s bid to keep Sundance.
“Let’s reappropriate that money to efforts in Utah to create a new festival and a world-class film economy right here in our state,” he said.
Cox says he agrees with ‘underlying intent’ but HB77 has flaws
Cox, in his letter, dove deeper into why he had misgivings with HB77 but said he agreed with the “underlying intent” of the bill.
“I deeply believe that our classrooms need to be a place where everyone feels welcome — free from the politics that are fracturing our country,” Cox wrote. “Parents are rightly upset when they bring their kids to publicly funded schools and see culture-war symbols in a place that should be apolitical. In an attempt to make some kids feel more welcome, other kids feel less welcome.”
Cox also said he appreciated that the bill is “neutral on the types of flags in question,” while adding that “I find it strange that no headline reads ‘MAGA flags banned from classrooms.’”

“I agree with the underlying intent of those legislators who supported this bill in an attempt to bring political neutrality to the classroom,” he said, though he added, “Unfortunately, this bill does not do that.”
He said because it’s aimed at only flags, “there is little preventing countless other displays — posters, signs, drawings, furniture — from entering the classroom.”
“To those legislators who supported this bill, I’m sure it will not fix what you are trying to fix,” Cox said.
He noted that many schools have already enacted their own “political neutrality” policies in classrooms, and he argued “we have a better place” to make regulations: the Utah State Board of Education. While he said the board has already set expectations for political neutrality in teacher code of conduct, “I believe more needs to be done by USBE to provide direction in this regard.”
“I have asked the Board of Education to continue their work to find ways to make our classrooms both more politically neutral and more welcoming to every student to exercise their own individual freedom of expression,” Cox said. “The idea that kids can only feel welcome in a school if a teacher puts up a rainbow flag is just wrong. Let’s do everything possible to make our classrooms one of the last remaining politically neutral places in our state.”
Cox says bill goes ‘too far’
The governor added that the flag ban “goes too far” by extending the ban to local governments.
“While I think it’s wrong for city and county officials to fly divisive flags, I believe that election have consequences and the best way to stop that behavior is to elect people who believe differently,” Cox said. “All this bill does is add more fuel to the fire, and I suspect it will only ratchet up the creative use of political symbolism.”
Ultimately, Cox urged legislators to focus on solutions rather than legislation that deepens divides.


Let us know what you think...


 

“As tired as Utahns are of politically divisive symbols, I think they are also tired of culture war bills that don’t solve the problems they intend to fix,” he said.
The governor urged lawmakers to work with the LGBTQ+ community, as they have in the past, to find common ground.
“Utah has always had a reputation of trying to find a way to work together and solve issues between sides that have strongly-held, opposing points of view,” Cox said. “There are so many examples of the LGBTQ community and the conservative community coming together to find helpful and hopeful compromise. I hope we can retain this as our model and North Star.”
The governor also shared a message directly to LGBTQ+ Utahns, acknowledging that “recent legislation has been difficult.”
“Politics can be a bit of a blood sport at times and I know we have had our disagreements,” he said. “I want you to know that I love and appreciate you and I am grateful that you are part of our state. I know these words may ring hollow to many of you, but please know that I mean them sincerely.”

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Nine months after historic flooding in McCook Lake wreaked havoc on homes, roads, trees and infrastructure, government officials are widening their focus from recovery efforts to prevention.
McCook Lake is a community of lakefront homes within North Sioux City in the southeastern corner of South Dakota, near the confluence of the Big Sioux and Missouri rivers.
Raging floodwaters that hit McCook Lake in June cost the city an estimated total of $15 million in infrastructure repair, according to North Sioux City and Union County officials. Homeowners suffered millions in additional damage and received some assistance from federal disaster relief programs, although not enough in some cases to replace their losses. Some also lacked flood insurance.
Local governments consider short-term, long-term mitigation plans
North Sioux City Administrator Jeff Dooley said the city is considering building greenways, culverts and storm sewer pipes along affected roads — capitalizing on some of the channels carved by the flood — to better direct future floodwaters into McCook Lake.
“Mother Nature has already plowed through there,” Dooley said. The city is also exploring how to better convey floodwaters from McCook Lake to the Missouri River “where it doesn’t harm anyone else.”

Dooley said a proposal will be presented to the public in late April for input from area residents and city commissioners. He plans to “hit these concepts hard” before applying for a Federal Emergency Management Agency hazard mitigation grant program by the end of May.
“A lot of damage has been done, and we’re doing our best to get out ahead of things,” Dooley said. “Any solution we come up with has to protect everybody.”
Dooley does not have a cost estimate prepared for the plan yet.

In the long term, Dooley and other area officials are requesting the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to help reevaluate the current flood plan and develop new mitigation plans. The current plan, which uses levees to redirect floodwaters over Interstate 29 and into McCook Lake before they reach the rest of North Sioux City and nearby Dakota Dunes, was developed in 1976. Union County, North Sioux City and Sioux City wrote a letter to the Corps saying they will sponsor improvement projects recommended by the Corps.
While Dooley said the Corps of Engineers likely recognizes a nearly 50-year-old mitigation plan is outdated, he warned it’ll probably take 10 to 15 years for a study’s conclusions to come to reality. That’s because the project will have a large study scope and a long construction timeline, he said.
Residents continue with recovery, lawmaker seeks to provide future relief
More than 100 homes were damaged in the McCook Lake flood, and 20 homes were demolished by North Sioux City in December. That’s left pockets of empty lots around the north side of the lake.
Morgan Speichinger lives on North Shore Drive, an outlet off the lake’s main road. Before the flood, her family couldn’t see the lake because of the houses lining its shore. Then the raging floodwaters carved a channel toward the river in her family’s backyard and through her neighbors’ houses.
“We didn’t have a lake view. Now, unfortunately, we do,” she said.

Speichinger said the tree’s root system diverted the raging waters away from her house, saving the property. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)
Speichinger and her husband rented a skid-steer loader at the end of March to move some of the 66 truckloads of dirt donated by RP Constructors and the Dakota County Fire District to fill holes in their property and in empty neighboring lots.
Other volunteers, such as workers with Mitchell Electric, helped move dirt with vans and trailers.
“I love the help and volunteers willing to step up and help other people, but it’s frustrating that we have to rely on our community to bring us back together,” Speichinger said. “You don’t see the city, county or state leadership out here, but they’re the ones who should be helping.”

Vermillion Republican Rep. Chris Kassin has visited McCook Lake several times, walking the lake and assessing damage done to his constituents’ homes. Kassin led a failed effort to establish a fund for the cleanup and restoration of McCook Lake this legislative session.
Kassin plans to explore legislation to “find a creative solution” to offer state financial support to future natural disaster victims. He plans to work with the state Department of Public Safety, Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources, and Department of Game, Fish and Parks to understand what options are available.
“It showed some gaps in the way we deal with disasters in the state and some of the lack of funding triggers or mechanisms that we might have to help people in need,” Kassin said during a legislative panel Thursday at the University of South Dakota.
Speichinger said she and her family plan to remain in their home because they can’t afford to move elsewhere. She said any mitigation plan North Sioux City presents should include an overhaul of the 1976 plan.
State analyzes prediction and modeling failures
Tim Cowman is the state geologist and director of the South Dakota Geological Survey. In a meeting with the East Dakota Water Development District in late 2024, he said the Big Sioux River flooding came faster and harder than predicted by the National Weather Service. The flooding was caused by three days of rain June 20-22 in southeast South Dakota, surpassing 17 inches in some locations.
Cowman said the water started flowing over I-29 a mile before the levee.
“The flood would have happened at McCook Lake whether or not that levee was there,” Cowman said.

Some residents including Speichinger say the levee over I-29 made the flooding at McCook Lake worse, that they were not properly informed of the plan to install it, and were not sufficiently warned about the potential effects. She, a group of other residents and their attorney have since served the state of South Dakota with a notice of a potential lawsuit over its role in constructing the levee, although no lawsuit has yet been filed.
Cowman said future mitigation measures should plan for flood events like this more often.
“These are 100 and 500 year floods, but they happen every five years now,” Cowman said.

Experts say factors in that change may include more severe precipitation due to climate change, the conversion of sponge-like prairies to farm fields, the installation of drain tile under fields to dump excess moisture into creeks and rivers, and urban sprawl that sends more runoff into waterways.
Cowman helps predict flooding impacts for the state with the South Dakota Flood Information System, which produces flood maps based on different scenarios, including peak flows and breached levees.
Cowman said predictions of the “magnitude” of flooding that struck McCook Lake should be more accurate in the future, because they’ll include data from the 2024 flood.
He and his team met with the National Weather Service Missouri Basin River Forecast Center in Kansas City twice to “work out kinks” and understand modeling and timing failures.
“From the state’s standpoint,” Cowman said, “we’re trying to make sure the river forecast center doesn’t get fooled again on a flood of this magnitude down there.”

Fair enough.
When he was campaigning, Trump also promised “Starting on Day 1, we will end inflation and make America affordable again,” as well as “Prices will come down. You just watch: They’ll come down, and they’ll come down fast, not only with insurance, with everything.”
Trump also promised that “drill baby drill” would not only “unleash” energy production in the U.S. As he insisted repeatedly at his campaign appearances in Nevada last year, lower energy costs rippling through the economy as a result of drill baby drill was also the centerpiece of his strategy for lowering prices on all other goods and services.
After falling consistently from its peak in the summer of 2022, the price of gas nationally has been been more or less stable for months, and now is within a nickel of what it was both the day Trump was elected and the day Trump was inaugurated.
In Nevada, the price of a gallon of regular is actually about a dime higher than when Trump was inaugurated.
Oil prices are projected to decline slightly this year, not because of drill baby drill, but because Trump’s tariffs and their accompanying televised presidential hissy fits are a drag on the economy. Trump met with oil industry executives Wednesday. They love the prospect of Trump cutting their taxes and regulations. But to no one’s surprise, except perhaps Trump’s, in these economic and geopolitical conditions, they (and their shareholders) have almost zero interest in drill baby drilling.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen by 5.5% since Trump’s inauguration. The S&P 500 has lost nearly 8% of its value. The Nasdaq Composite Index has dropped by more than 12%. A Deutsche Bank analysis the other day noted that under Trump, U.S. stocks are recording the second-worst post-inauguration performance in nearly 90 years.
“When I take office your 401 (k)  or IRA will start losing money very quickly, almost like nobody’s ever seen before” was not among Trump’s campaign promises. But he delivered on it anyway.
And what about the charismatic megafauna of Trump Nevada-specific policy promises, holy sacred No Tax on Tips amen?
Budget-wise it’s among the smallest of the numerous tax cuts he promised (the lost revenue from No Tax on Social Security income is humongous by comparison). So it might be included in the tax cuts for the rich and corporate that Trump and congressional Republicans are poised to pay for by cutting Medicaid (which will hurt Nevada more than most states, by the way).
At the same time, if tariffs send consumers into a spending tailspin, and tourists (and not just international ones) stop coming to Las Vegas, a lot of folks who might have hoped to catch a No Tax on Tips break may find that the presence or absence of federal taxation of tips is the least of their problems. If it wasn’t already.
Oh, and speaking of Social Security, Trump repeatedly promised while campaigning that he wouldn’t touch it. Yet he’s also enabling and parroting Elon Musk’s attempts to undermine what Musk calls a “Ponzi scheme.”
When he was campaigning Trump also promised to be a dictator on day one, punish his enemies, and concentrate unprecedented and,  according to multiple lower federal courts, unconstitutional authority in the executive branch at the expense of Congress and the judiciary.
Voters knew that was coming, too.
And whether despite that or because of it, a majority of Nevada voters joined a plurality of voters nationally to let Trump have at it.
In stark contrast to his thus-far barren promises that prices will come down and tremendous wealth will wash across the land, Trump has made substantial progress toward fulfilling his promises to establish authoritarian rule while sidelining an obeisant legislative branch and attacking an often game but structurally plodding judicial system.
Now all Trump need do to solidify his regime and its lawlessness going forward is convince voters that a ramshackle wreck of a third-rate economy is a small price to pay for the privilege of being ruled by Trump the Grand Authoritarian and his cadre of cold-blooded henchmen and creepy oligarchs.
What are the odds voters will buy that in the 21st century? Judging from the last 10 years or so, fifty-fifty sounds about right.

Reid/Kitsap Sun)Tatiana Leone never leaves her Bremerton apartment without a reusable grocery bag filled with documents detailing her son’s history of mental illness. She doesn’t know when she will run into her son, who lives unhoused in Seattle, and she wants to be prepared if he’s in a crisis.
She’s used the pile of documents — including records of his behavioral health history, jail stints and hospital stays — once before. In 2020, she successfully asked a Pierce County judge to involuntarily detain her son, whom she asked not to be named to respect his privacy, under Washington’s Joel’s Law. Leone, like others caring for loved ones experiencing acute mental illness, had spent many painstaking years trying to get her son help, only to find a fractured and complex mental health system that did little more than send her son to jail. She felt like she had exhausted all other options.
“It’s a gut-wrenching process because you don’t want to alienate your loved one and make them fear you or that the world is against them because they’re already thinking that in some cases,” Leone said. “You’re just trying to help.” 
Joel’s Law, which passed the state Legislature with overwhelming support in 2015, was designed to provide a lifeline for parents like Leone who wished to directly petition the judicial system to get their loved one into treatment. Typically, designated crisis responders — mental health professionals who act as a bridge between the medical system and the courts — are the ones to recommend involuntary detainment if they believe someone’s behavioral health conditions meet the state’s legal criteria.
While the law was celebrated for helping to elevate the voices of concerned families, petitioning the court is just one step in a long, complicated process that might not ultimately lead to treatment or sustained support, as Leone and others have experienced. Only three days after Leone’s son was detained, he was released from the hospital and was back cycling through the same systems as before.
Joel’s Law petitions comprise only a small portion of all involuntary detainments in Washington, but the number of cases involving the petitions has increased statewide by 266% since 2020, according to state court data obtained through a public records request. Much of that growth has been concentrated in the South and Central Puget Sound areas. Pierce and Kitsap County, where Leone attempted to get her son detained, have among the highest per-capita rates among Washington’s large counties. 
Medical professionals, mental health providers and lawyers have a longstanding disagreement over involuntary treatment, especially in Washington, where physicians are not allowed to make that call. Some medical professionals and families feel the system is antiquated and leaves too many people without care until they ultimately wind up in the criminal justice system. 
A decade since the law was passed, the use of the petitions is increasing, though questions remain about how much these petitions have helped make treatment more accessible to families. Those skeptical of the law acknowledge there needs to be more access points to behavioral health care but question if involuntary care is the appropriate response or if many of these people could be more effectively treated in the community.

Tara Urs, special counsel for civil policy and practice for the King County Department of Public Defense, feels for the family members submitting these petitions, knowing that the supports available outside of the hospital doors are difficult — and at times impossible —— to access. 
“I understand why people might want to be banging down the only door that might be available, even though I think it is the wrong door,” said Urs, who represents people facing involuntary detention. But the state must meet a high burden of proof before taking away someone’s civil liberties.
“Joel’s Law increased the kinds of people who could try to access the front door of the hospital, and for King County, I’m not sure how much of an impact that’s made,” she added. “But I don’t think that means that there’s not a problem worth solving.”
Number of petitions on the rise
A group of parents, frustrated that their loved ones with acute mental illnesses were not getting help, pushed for the passage of Joel’s Law in 2015. Doug and Nancy Reuter, whose son Joel became the law’s namesake, helped bring attention to the issue. Seattle police fatally shot Joel, a 28-year-old software engineer suffering from bipolar disorder, in 2013. The Reuters said they tried 48 times prior to that standoff to get their son help.
“What was happening everywhere — and I certainly heard about it in our area — was parents would be told, ‘Well we can’t do anything until they break the law,’ even though the parent knew the child was in grave danger of hurting themselves or somebody else,” said Kitsap County Commissioner Christine Rolfes, a former state senator who was a co-sponsor of the bill creating Joel’s Law.
Michael Kawamura, who oversees Pierce County’s public defender office, suspects the high number of Joel’s Law petitions filed in Pierce County could be due to the county being home to the largest psychiatric hospital in the state, Western State Hospital. A person can be held up to five days for an emergency detention, potentially followed by a 14-day treatment with additional 90- or 180-day extensions. With each extension, a new petition must be filed with the court, which could increase the number being filed in Pierce County.
“The majority of counties don’t do most of the long-term commitments,” said Kawamura, who helps oversee cases involving Joel’s Law petitions. “That’s just the hospital jurisdictions. And so most of the counties will do that initial 14-day commitment, but then they stop.”
Providers attribute much of the increase to more awareness. Police and mental health workers are educating families about Joel’s Law, and in some areas, the complex process to file a petition has been streamlined. 
“It’s 10 years old,” Jenna Vyhlidal, manager of mobile crisis outreach at Kitsap Mental Health Services, said of Joel’s Law, “but I think we’re finally starting to make it work.”
Dr. James Hughes, chief medical officer at Kitsap Mental Health Services, speculates that some of the difference between counties can be attributed to differing interpretations of state statutes. State laws on involuntary detainment are vague and open to nuanced interpretation. The definition of “imminent” — a requirement for someone to be involuntarily detained — is an example of that.
“I’ve heard it used differently by different counties or even different institutions,” he said.
Kitsap is among the counties where crisis responders are permitted to do single-bed certifications, allowing them to detain someone at a local hospital if no inpatient psychiatric beds are available throughout the state. Kitsap also permits non-emergent detention, letting crisis responders petition to detain someone who is not yet an imminent threat to themselves or others but is showing signs of a deteriorating mental state. 
“It lets us do our job but prevent future [crises] so we’re not five days behind,” Vyhlidal said.
By design, medical providers have few options to force a patient into treatment, especially in Washington. The state’s Involuntary Treatment Act was established in the 1970s amid the national “deinstitutionalization” movement that sought to release hundreds of thousands of people held in psychiatric hospitals and move away from the system that gave doctors the sole power to strip someone of their civil liberties.
“If I agree their loved one is in need of help, I can’t make them get it. I have to defer to somebody who did not see you in your acute crisis and may not have the same perspective on medical care or training as I do as the ER clinician caring for you,” said Nathan Schlicher, an emergency room physician who lives in Gig Harbor and is a past president of the Washington State Medical Association. “That is the unique nature of Washington law.”
One family’s journey using Joel’s Law
When Leone’s son’s mental health conditions started to escalate in his late teens, she didn’t know where to turn. She had brought him to the emergency room during a handful of episodes but was often turned away. She had heard of designated crisis responders but was told that the only way to get her son evaluated was to call the police. She tried this numerous times, which often led to him being taken to jail, she said.
“He really just needed help and intervention,” she said. “It didn’t help my son at all, because oftentimes, while in custody, their solution for people in mental health crisis is solitary confinement, and that’s not helpful either.”
On Christmas Eve in 2020, Leone’s son was in acute crisis, in a state of heightened fear and expressing thoughts of self-harm. Leone brought him to St. Anthony’s Hospital in Gig Harbor in hopes that he would be seen by a designated crisis responder from Pierce County instead of in Kitsap County, where they had been evaluated previously but involuntary detainment was not recommended, she said. While she was out getting her son warmer clothes, a designated crisis responder came and went without recommending involuntary detainment. Her son then ran away.

She was angry with the hospital staff for letting him walk out the door in the middle of a snowstorm. They told her there was nothing they could do. Not knowing what to do next, Leone drove to a nearby Target parking lot and called the police. “My son happened to bump right into me in a Target parking lot,” she recalled.
While Leone was on the phone with the 911 operator, her son was talking about harming himself. She asked the operator if she could hear his comments. “One of the (designated crisis responder’s) had told me that unless we hear him say he wants to kill himself to us, or unless we hear it with our own ears, we cannot just take anybody’s word for it.”
The next thing she knew, police were surrounding her car. The 911 operator told her that they would contact the designated crisis responder to come out. Instead, they arrested him and charged him with domestic violence, which prohibited him from contacting Leone. She had told the officers that she wasn’t in danger. “I am not afraid of my son,” she recalled telling them. “I called you to help him.”
“It was unbelievable,” she said. “I am his only support system. He doesn’t have a dad, he doesn’t have any other family or anybody else who advocates for him. So they alienated him from his sole support network.”
After he was taken to jail, Leone called the crisis line back. 
That’s when she was told about Joel’s Law. She says she “thought it was going to be the answer we were looking for.” 
Families have 10 days after a designated crisis responder evaluates their loved one to file a Joel’s Law petition with a judge. The petition includes the reasons the family believes someone should be detained. That often provides a more comprehensive look at someone’s history than what a designated crisis responder can necessarily see at the moment, said  Vyhlidal, the Kitsap crisis outreach manager. 
“I’ve seen petitions go back to childhood photos,” she said.
When a judge grants a Joel’s Law petition, the same process follows as when a designated crisis responder detains someone. They are held for a maximum of 120 hours (plus holidays and weekends) during which a mental health professional decides if they need to be committed for longer. 
The day after Leone’s son was taken to jail and she learned about Joel’s Law, she started gathering the hundreds of documents she was told she needed to file the petition, including documentation of hospital stays, jail stints and admittance to crisis care. The process was arduous.
She was told she had to file the petition in person in Tacoma, but she couldn’t get out of her driveway due to snow. She took an Uber to a FedEx store in Bremerton and spent $200 faxing the documents to the court.
They ultimately approved her petition and served him the paperwork when he was in jail. She said it was painful not to be able to reassure him given the protection order stemming from the DV charge. When she finally spoke to him, he was rightfully upset, she said.
“He thought that I was just out to get him and take him down, which was part of his symptoms, too,” Leone said. “Which kind of makes sense looking back, because his intuition is telling him something was wrong, and he doesn’t know where to look for the source of this feeling, and so everybody becomes a suspect.”
After three days in the hospital and one day back in jail, he was released, and Leone felt like she was back to square one. “I thought they had said that they were going to keep him until he was stabilized,” she said.
Skepticism remains
Silvia Riley, the director of crisis services at Multicare, is lukewarm on Joel’s Law. It is not a bad policy, she said. Designated crisis responders, while highly trained, make mistakes. But she wants judges to apply the same scrutiny to petitions that designated crisis responders do to their evaluations. Detention should be a last resort.
“We show up with the intention of [involuntary commitment] being the last thing we want to do,” she said. “It’s not always a popular decision, but we take it very seriously.”
Judges, she argues, feel compelled to help individuals experiencing severe mental illness, often receiving thick petitions documenting someone’s whole and often traumatic history. But while many people need behavioral health treatment, designated crisis responders often disagree that an involuntary approach is the best method for that care.
For example, MultiCare was once asked to detain someone but could not serve them because they were at work every day.
“That itself tells me that this person is not a good candidate for involuntary commitment, because he’s living productively,” she said, adding later: “It makes me question, is this the best way to get them help? Or are we missing some opportunities in the community?”
The practice of involuntarily detaining someone at a mental hospital has a dark and not-so-distant history. For example, women were frequently institutionalized in mental hospitals for not being submissive enough to their husbands. It’s why the bar is so high for committing someone, Urs said.
Urs wants to see a more holistic approach to mental health treatment and sees the conversation mainly focused on “how open or closed” the door to the hospital should be. Some efforts have given her hope, like King County’s Program of Assertive Community Treatment, coined the PACT program. The program, which Urs describes as a “hospital without walls,” is tailored toward people with psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia and schizoaffective bipolar disorder. Still, the program only scratches the surface.
“We don’t have nearly enough PACT teams in King County to meet the needs of the people in our community who are experiencing disorders of psychosis,” she added.
Mental toll on families
Any time it snows, Leone is always out searching for her son in Seattle, distributing food and supplies to other unhoused people during the process. When he calls from a borrowed cellphone or from jail, she begs him to call more to let her know he’s OK. If there’s time, she tries to convince him to go to a crisis care center. She said he feels trapped at treatment centers and has lost faith that medication will help.
Leone isn’t sure whether she would file another Joel’s Law petition again, but she hasn’t completely ruled it out. 
“The hope was that he would be able to obtain some relief from his symptoms and then be able to develop some appreciation for knowing what it felt like to not be suffering from those symptoms, and then building that rapport with him would help him be more receptive to staying in compliance with the treatment plan,” Leone said.
She understands why Joel’s Law is controversial. It’s something she has to grapple with frequently.
“They can’t just go around taking people’s rights away” or “involuntarily medicate people,” she said. 
Ultimately, she wishes they had better access to mental health services before it got to the point of using a Joel’s Law petition. Or, that there were court advocates available to help families navigate the Joel’s Law petition process.
She said each time they tried to get help — whether it was at the hospital or through a designated crisis responder or crisis care center — the relief was fleeting and the web of bureaucracy pushed her son further away. “He wanted the help, but he was also able to see that every time somebody was promising to help him, it was only hurting him,” she said.
It’s all taken a toll on Leone.
“I get a lot of ‘Just let it go. He’s choosing this. Just let it go. He likes this lifestyle. He’s choosing this lifestyle.’ And it’s infuriating because it’s like, no, he’s just as in need of help and support and unconditional love as anybody who has got some physically evident disability or impairment or illness.”
Anytime Leone is able to find her son on the streets of Seattle, he is always happy to see her and his little brother, Leone said. 
“He’ll open his coat, and he’ll bust out a Batman action figure, and he’ll be like, ‘I’ve been carrying this around for you.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tatiana-Leone-Portrait-01-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-03-30 12:04:31.558324

(Photo by Dugan Meyer)Phoenix will be hosting a convention featuring President Donald Trump’s “border czar,” as well as hundreds of military and tech companies bidding for government border contracts, including a company involved in the torture in Abu Ghraib.
The Border Security Expo at the Phoenix Convention Center April 8 and 9 features panel discussions, as well as an expo floor where vendors can hawk their wares to government officials from around the world.
“It is just a big marketplace of companies — mostly tech companies — trying to sell things to the government,” Dave Maass, director of investigations for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told the Arizona Mirror about the event. The EFF has previously catalogued the vendors who attend the annual conference, with a focus on technologies such as AI, infrared cameras and more.
The Trump administration has made border security a top priority after campaigning on immigration as a major issue. The administration’s actions have faced scrutiny for their lack of due process and they have consistently tried to keep their mass deportation plans a secret.
The Mirror attempted to get press credentials to the Border Security Expo but was told that the event is closed to the press “this year.” The event website lists “media partners,” which include online pro-law enforcement trade publications like Border Security Report, Homeland Security Today and Officer.com. Homeland Security Today is run by a group of CEOs whose companies are on the expo floor.
The event will feature a number of high ranking officials from Customs and Border Patrol, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Drug Enforcement Agency and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The most high profile is Trump’s “border czar,” Tom Homan.
Homan served as the acting director of ICE in Trump’s first term. He backed the controversial “zero tolerance” policy at the southern border and has been connected to far-right extremist and conspiracy theorist groups. Homan is scheduled to give the opening remarks at the event as part of a “State of the Border” discussion.
Cochise County Sheriff Mark Dannels will also speak at the event on a panel to give local perspectives to border issues.
While the event will feature a number of panel discussions and high profile speakers, it will also feature a litany of companies who will be aiming to impress government officials at the event in the hopes of securing a government contract or continuing an existing one.
The Mirror examined the list of companies set to be in attendance to highlight some of the key trends as well as noteworthy companies seeking the attention of the government officials.
The military industrial complex 
Many, if not most, of the vendors at the expo also serve the United States military and militaries overseas.
For example, Thales Defense and Security Inc. is a subsidiary of Thales Group, a French multinational aerospace and defense corporation. Its subsidiary has primarily done work on radio upgrades for the US Army and NATO forces and will be present on the expo floor.
When it comes to immigration and border enforcement, the company has supplied the systems the United States uses at ports of entry that involve biometric data. Other companies known for their large military contracts, such as BAE Systems, also will be present.
One particular military contracting company with a dark past also will have a booth on the expo floor. In November 2024, a jury found that Caci International shared liability with the U.S. Army for the torture of three Iraqi men at the Abu Graib prion in 2004, awarding the men $42 million.
The Virginia-based defense contractor has long gotten a number of contracts from the Department of Homeland Security.
Caci International is not the only government contractor with a controversial past.
Journalists at ProPublica recently exposed how private prison company GEO Group, an ICE contractor, has been refusing to pay detainees more than $1 a day for cleaning the governmental facilities at which they live. GEO Group’s stocks have skyrocketed under the Trump administration to $4 billion.
Another group with ties to Trump and a controversial backstory that will be present on the expo floor is Constellis, part of the private security company known as Triple Canopy.
Triple Canopy is a formation of what were once rival private security companies, Blackwater and Constellis. Guards from that company were spotted outside various federal agencies that were being taken over by billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency.
Also present will be Anduril Industries, which has ties to Palantir, and whose director of defense technology was nominated by Trump to serve as the Army’s No. 2 official.
Military grade equipment 
The expo floor will be full of vendors showing off their products which range from physical products like cameras and ground sensors to software that can be used to process data obtained by law enforcement.
Much of that equipment is also military grade.
Groups like ProTech Defense, Soal Marine Group and QuickSet Defense Technologies make military grade equipment that is marketed not just to federal agencies patrolling the border, but military customers.
Other tech is similar, often showcased being used by armed forces in online literature or described with military jargon.
Many of the surveillance camera platforms are similar or the same as those used on military aircraft, naval vessels or ground vehicles. Some firms, like Controp USA, boast about the capabilities of their surveillance platforms for both local law enforcement and military.
The militarization of police and border enforcement has long been a point of debate among privacy advocates, with research suggesting that law enforcement that has more access to military grade equipment are more likely to have violent encounters with the public.
Strongwatch will have a presence at the expo and it already has some of its tools in the hands of local Arizona law enforcement. The Phoenix Police Department has one of Strongwatch’s “Freedom on the Move” surveillance truck platforms, which are frequently deployed at parades and protests.
Anti/pro-drone
This year’s expo also features a number of companies focused on anti-drone technology, something local lawmakers and Attorney General Kris Mayes have been focused on lately, as well.
House Bill 2733 by Rep. David Marshall, R-Snowflake, would give local law enforcement immunity from liability for damage to personal property if they are shooting down a drone they believe is engaged in criminal activity.
The bill comes amid an increase in drug cartel drones flying over the states’ southern border, GOP lawmakers and Mayes say that local police should be able to shoot them out of the sky without fear they’ll be sued. A large number of tech companies at the expo this year are offering their own solutions to this problem.
Fortem Technologies has provided its counter-UAS (unmanned aerial systems, a technical term for drones) equipment to Ukrainian forces, leading to it being sanctioned by Russia in response. The company has already been attracting interest from DHS, but other competitors have been vying for what appears to be a burgeoning market.
The Mirror found four other companies that will be on the expo floor selling anti-drone tech, with another that has sent one of its devices to frontline forces in Ukraine. But there are just as many companies, if not more, wanting to put eyes up in the sky as there are that want to remove them.
Aerial surveillance is a major strategy of CBP and DHS, who deploy aerial assets to the border daily to follow suspects or surveil areas where border crossers are known to frequent or smugglers are known to go.
A number of companies focused on different forms of aerial surveillance are also present at this year’s expo including multiple manufacturers of aerostats, a type of blimp. Recently, one of CBP’s blimps became untethered in Texas, leading to it flying miles away after being blown away by gusts of wind.
QinetiQ, the UK firm behind the Zephyr “pseudo satellite,” a high flying unmanned aircraft that can stay aloft for months at a time, will also be at the expo. Ascent AeroSystems, a subsidiary of Robinson Helicopters, will be at the expo and is currently promoting a new drone that it says is “advanced aerial surveillance in the palm of your hand.”
A number of new drone technologies appear to be on display at this year’s expo, including a hydrogen powered drone and a tethered drone as well.
AI and more 
Another trend this year is the promotion of artificial intelligence. Many of the companies tout the use of AI either to boost already existing programs or to be used in new ways.
One such company is Overland AI, which recently raised $32 million in funding. The company aims to create fully autonomous ground vehicles for the military and Overland is partnered with L3 Harris, one of the largest defense contractors in the world, who will also be present at the expo.
Other uses for AI are for surveillance gathering and analysis, such as with Australian-based FiveCast, which has previously signed contracts with DHS to use AI to look for open source intelligence threats.
Social media monitoring tools that have alarmed privacy advocates, like ShadowDragon, will also be present at the expo.
Other software companies that will be on the sales floor have faced controversy in the past.
One company, Perceptics, which has gotten contracts with the federal government for biometric data collection and automatic license plate reader collection, was part of the reason for a major breach in biometric data related to a facial recognition pilot program.
“A subcontractor working on this effort, Perceptics, LLC, transferred copies of CBP’s biometric data, such as traveler images, to its own company network. The subcontractor obtained access to this data between August 2018 and January 2019 without CBP’s authorization or knowledge. Later in 2019, DHS experienced a major privacy incident, as the subcontractor’s network was subjected to a malicious cyber attack,” the Office of the Inspector General wrote in a 2020 report.
Sponsors
While the event is closed to the press and largely to the public, those who can afford it can opt to pay $1,395 for the full conference. Those with government email or .edu email addresses can get in for free, and the expo offers a guide to those seeking to “justify” the event’s cost to their employer.
Akima, who got nearly a billion dollars in contracts with the United States Space Force last year, is the expo’s top sponsor. However, under the “Supporting Organizations” banner of the event are some more notable organizations.
The Texas Public Policy Foundation is a conservative think tank whose members have been promoted by Trump in the previous administration and have denied climate change, pushed school vouchers and received funding from both the GEO Group and Koch Industries.
The Texas Public Policy Foundation was also on the advisory board of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025.
Project 2025 is a collection of right-wing policy proposals from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, to reshape the United States federal government and consolidate executive power under the Trump administration. The list of policy plans was largely created by former Trump aides and allies.
Another “supporting organization” is the Border Patrol Foundation, whose president in 2018 garnered controversy for defending the use of pepper spray on migrants at the border by saying that a person could put it on nachos and eat it. That man, Ron Colburn, is on the advisory board for the expo.

Around the nation, doctors, lawmakers, advocates and patients are ringing alarm bells over congressional Republicans’ proposals to slash billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding, which could especially hurt older Americans. (Rick Kern/Getty Images for National Council on Aging)Dr. Fred Levin has been watching with growing alarm the national debate around federal cuts to Medicaid. He’s responsible for the medical care of about 100 older adults at the Community PACE center in rural Newaygo, Michigan. For his patients, Medicaid isn’t just a safety net — it’s a matter of life or death.
“If left to see to their own needs, a lot of them would stay in their homes and would slowly die,” he said. “They wouldn’t be able to get to their doctors’ appointments unless they had a family member to help. They wouldn’t get social care. They wouldn’t have people coming into their homes and seeing the bed bugs or the lice in their hair. They wouldn’t get their medications.”
The care at Community PACE is paid for by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities, and Medicare, the federal insurance program for people 65 and older. The center is a one-stop shop that provides medical and social services to older adults during the day, allowing them to continue living safely in their homes.
If Congress cuts funding to Medicaid, Levin expects his center would probably close. Unlike traditional nursing home care, which state Medicaid programs are required by federal law to cover, the services at PACE centers like his are an optional benefit that 33 states have opted to cover.
Around the nation, doctors, lawmakers, advocates and patients are watching anxiously as Republicans in Congress consider proposals to slash billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in proposed tax cuts. The specific nature of the funding cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states.










If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved.


– Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy, Justice in Aging


The additional financial burden could blow billion-dollar holes in state budgets, forcing state lawmakers to slash health benefits or restrict who’s eligible for them. Nearly a fifth of Americans rely on Medicaid, and the percentage is even higher in some states.
“There are a lot of people who don’t pay attention to this because they think it doesn’t affect them personally,” Levin said. “But 1 in 4 people in Michigan are on Medicaid. It’s very likely you have friends or family on Medicaid.”
Nearly all Americans over age 65 are covered by Medicare, which Republicans have pledged not to touch. Medicare doesn’t cover most nursing home or other long-term care, however. Neither does most private insurance.
But Medicaid does.
“If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved,” said Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy for Justice in Aging, an advocacy group focused on addressing poverty among older people.
“Many of us have a connection to the program or will one day,” she said.
 A divided front

Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But policy experts say that reducing coverage for some Medicaid recipients, such as the working adults who got coverage under expansion programs, will have ripple effects on vulnerable groups such as children and older adults.
Republicans aren’t united in a desire to see massive cuts.
Last month, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican governor in a purple state, publicly called on Congress not to slash Medicaid funding.
Earlier this week, Washington Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier wrote a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider cuts to Medicaid and expressing her concern about the large number of military retirees and senior citizens in her district.
Caldier, a dentist who has worked with nursing home patients, told Stateline she believes the most likely cuts would be a reduction in the amount the federal government matches state spending for working adults who are covered under Medicaid expansion. That, she said, would have little impact on older adults.
“The only caveat is that I am very worried that the leadership in our state does not have a good relationship with our president,” Caldier said. Democrats control the offices of governor and both legislative chambers in Washington state. Caldier worries that if Washington lawmakers defy the president over issues such as gender-affirming care for transgender youth, the feds could retaliate by slashing their Medicaid payments to the state.
“If we got into a political match with the president, we would lose, no matter how you slice or dice it,” she said.
In Idaho, Republican state lawmakers shot down a bill that likely would have repealed Medicaid expansion, before passing one that will introduce sweeping policy changes in an effort to control costs.
Even in Congress, some Republicans are balking, publicly defending Medicaid and warning about the consequences of deep cuts. Some who have high percentages of Medicaid recipients in their districts have urged party leaders not to cut funding for the program and have vowed to vote against any budget plan that does so.
Medicaid covers 72 million Americans. A majority of American adults, including two-thirds of Republicans, say they want Congress to either maintain current Medicaid spending or increase it, according to a February 2025 poll from KFF, a health policy research group.
President Donald Trump has said in recent months that he won’t touch Medicaid. But last month, U.S. House Republicans pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that calls for about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help counterbalance the Trump administration’s desired $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.
Facing cuts that large, states would have to figure out which benefits to chop in order to keep their budgets balanced, which is a constitutional requirement in most states.
Older adults and people with disabilities already account for more than half of states’ Medicaid spending, on average. In some states, including Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi and North Dakota, those groups account for two-thirds of state Medicaid spending.
Idaho state Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Democrat on the state Senate Health & Welfare committee, said her biggest concern is Congress reducing the federal match rate. This is the amount of money the federal government chips in to help states pay for Medicaid. How much a state receives mainly depends on how wealthy its residents are. Richer states such as California and Connecticut get less help, while poorer states get more.
In Idaho, on the poorer end of the spectrum, the feds pay about 67% of traditional Medicaid costs and 90% of Medicaid expansion costs.
“It is all a domino effect,” Wintrow said. The federal government covers about $3 billion of Idaho’s $4.2 billion Medicaid budget. “If the feds start chopping that off, it’s going to impact everything.”
 Cutting care at home

All state Medicaid programs have opted to cover at least some home-based and community care, such as home health aides who assist people with bathing, toileting and other daily living activities, transportation and adult day care.
Kean and other experts worry that because federal law doesn’t require state Medicaid programs to cover home-based care, state lawmakers might sharply reduce spending on those services — or even eliminate coverage.
“When states have budget shortfalls, they start to tighten eligibility for the home-based programs,” said Kean. “We’re certain those would be the first to go if federal funding is cut for Medicaid.”
Paying for home-based services out of pocket would exhaust the median Medicare recipient’s savings in less than two years, according to KFF.
The median cost of a year of a full-time aide to help is about $62,400, far above the median income for Americans over 65, which is about $36,000. The median life savings for Medicare beneficiaries was $103,800 in 2023.
Home-based services are a popular benefit for state Medicaid programs, because most enrollees prefer to remain in their homes. And despite the expense, home care can be more cost effective than nursing homes — about $38,000 vs. nearly $54,000 per year in 2021, according to a KFF analysis.
Cutting Medicaid also could make it harder to recruit and keep a workforce of nursing home and home health employees.
Over the past two years, most states — even those led by Republicans — increased their Medicaid payment rates for those services, in an effort to combat the nationwide shortage of long-term care workers.
But federal funding cuts could jeopardize what states are able to pay those workers.
“There’s already a direct-care workforce crisis,” Kean said. “Even if eligibility isn’t directly cut or programs aren’t cut, there wouldn’t be enough workers to provide that care. At home and in nursing facilities, the quality of care will go down.”
In rural Michigan, Levin said the PACE center where he works employs about 100 people. Its closure would impact not only those workers, but also would mean his patients would be left to find transportation and other health services on their own, even if those services are still covered by Medicaid.
“Without access in rural areas, how are these individuals going to get to the bigger cities where they can get to their health care? It’s going to overwhelm other parts of the health care system,” Levin said.
“Everybody’s going to be responsible for taking care of the people who don’t have health insurance, in some indirect way or another. It’s going to affect us all.”

American Indian and Alaska Native tribes are fighting for equal governance and sovereignty over their own health data. (Kris Hanning/University of Arizona)When Stephanie Russo Carroll, a citizen of the Native Village of Kluti-Kaah in Alaska, set out to earn her doctorate in tribal health 15 years ago, she focused her research on tribal cultural and health programs within six tribes.
She needed vital statistics data, such as birth and death rates, for each of them. But getting that data from the state, which houses vital statistics, was difficult — and in some cases, the data she needed was missing.
“Health outcomes data were unobtainable,” Carroll recalled. In one case, her team had to try using breastfeeding rates as a proxy to estimate birth rates. But even getting those for all six tribes was impossible.
For the next two decades, Carroll would continue to push for U.S. tribes — which are sovereign nations — to own and maintain control over their data, including health statistics.
The concept, known as data sovereignty, is important amid the harrowing health disparities seen in tribal people, rooted in forced assimilation dating back more than a century. Often, data gathered by and about tribes has been shared with state and federal agencies; but those same agencies haven’t always shared their tribal-related statistics in return.
The reasons vary, from systemic issues within the health care system to mistaken assumptions by some federal officials about what data be securely sent to tribes without risking privacy violations.
The lack of tribe-specific data has hindered tribes from fully taking care of their members and clouded their work on public health responses to disease outbreaks such as syphilis and COVID-19, on maternal and infant health outcomes, and on chronic issues such as diabetes, heart disease and substance use.
Data sovereignty is especially relevant now, as the Trump administration scrubs federal health websites of data that recognizes and tracks metrics among the country’s various racial and ethnic groups, including what little data there is on tribal members.
States govern their own health data systems. But the same isn’t true for the nation’s 574 federally recognized tribes.
For Indian Country, federal cuts decimate core tribal programs

Now an associate professor of public health at the University of Arizona, Carroll co-founded the U.S. Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network and directs the Collaboratory for Indigenous Data Governance. Both are groups that work to research and strengthen Indigenous data governance, accuracy and data-driven policy.
“If you don’t know who has been sick or hospitalized,” Carroll said, “how can you make sure you have the right care systems for your community?”
Withholding tribes’ data
As part of its slashing of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, the Trump administration removed numerous racial, ethnic, adolescent and maternal health datasets from the websites of several federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While some of the data has been reinstated, the swift deletions raised alarms in tribal communities.
Abigail Echo-Hawk, a member of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma and director of the Urban Indian Health Institute, said the youth behavioral risk surveys were reinstated, but were missing key race and ethnicity search features that tribes use to track mental health conditions in American Indian and Alaska Native teens.
“Now, we can’t search, disaggregate by Native youth,” she said. “That information is about our children, and it is the legal right of both now the tribal epidemiology centers and the tribes to have access to that previously gathered information.”
Despite their public health authority, tribes and tribal epidemiology centers, which support tribes with health data tracking, say federal and state health officials have long withheld or denied requests to direct access of health data related to their tribes, including coronavirus data during the pandemic.
Such data is tied to treaty rights obligations and shouldn’t be lumped together with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently under attack by the Trump administration, Echo-Hawk said.
“Our treaty rights are tied to having information around tribal people. So, if you’re going to uphold our treaty rights, you need to say: ‘This number of Native people are experiencing this issue,’ or ‘This number of Native people exist,’” she said.
It wasn’t until 2021 that the CDC conducted its first comprehensive life expectancy profile of American Indians and Alaska Natives; it showed that in 2019, their life expectancy was seven years lower than that of white people.
“All of the data is a story. It’s a grandmother, it’s a son, it’s a story of a community’s well-being,” Echo-Hawk said.
When tribes receive federal grants — whether for transportation, housing or education initiatives — there are grant reporting requirements.
Under those rules, tribes send raw data to federal agencies, but they often don’t get that data back, said social demographer Desi Small-Rodriguez, an assistant professor of sociology and American Indian studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, who co-founded the data sovereignty network with Carroll.
“It’s a one-way data highway coming from tribal governments — leaving tribal governments and going into the feds — and it’s not coming back,” said Small-Rodriguez. She also directs the Data Warriors Lab, working with tribes — including her own Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Montana — to develop legal mechanisms to ensure data ownership.
She said the federal government should provide funding, as part of its treaty obligations, to pay for expensive data support such as secure storage systems, high-performance computers and analytics staff.
“As part of our treaty rights, we have a right to health care and education. We have a right to clean water and air — and data form the basis for all of that,” she said.
State data agreements
In January, the Tulalip Tribes in northwest Washington state secured a data-sharing agreement with the state department of health. It gives the tribes access to the state’s disease reporting system, allowing them to extract some data directly. Tulalip plans to eventually secure access to more datasets.
It’s the first agreement of its kind in the state, said Summer Hammons, legislative policy analyst in the Treaty Rights and Governmental Affairs Department of the Tulalip Tribes, which has at least 5,000 members. Hammons grew up on the reservation.
She hopes it will help the tribe direct resources and funds where they’re needed — whether it’s more cancer screenings or vaccinations against diseases such as measles, as other states grapple with outbreaks of the virus.
“It allows us to collaborate and lead on outbreak investigations related to tribal members,” Hammons said. “It’s a clear outline that tribes own their data in partnership with the state, because the state’s the one that’s collecting it. But we want to tell our story, and we want to be able to work with DOH [department of health] to be mindful of our stories and to also get better access to the statistics.”
A few other states — Alaska, Arizona, Oregon and South Dakota — also have limited-scope agreements with tribes.
Gary Ferguson, Unangax (Aleut), is the director of integrative medicine at Tulalip Health Clinic. He said he hopes the data will help the tribe track health care interventions over time.
“We don’t know what’s working. We don’t know what’s not working,” he said. “We want to celebrate our wins.”
Tracking disease
In recent years, the nation has seen alarming surges in congenital syphilis, a preventable infection passed through pregnancy to newborns. Nearly 40% can be stillborn or die as a newborn. Babies can also suffer lifelong blindness or deafness. Tribal babies suffer the highest rate.
Officials at the Great Plains Tribal Epidemiology Center, which tracks tribal public health across four states, were denied syphilis data from local public health departments for years until the group leaned on the CDC for assistance.
It wasn’t until then that, finally, last year, one state — South Dakota — agreed to share American Indian and Alaska Native syphilis cases as soon as they’re reported, said Sarah Shewbrooks, the group’s lead tribal epidemiologist.
Shewbrooks hopes the access in South Dakota will pave the way for more agreements in the other Great Plains states.
‘We needed this yesterday’
During COVID-19, American Indian and Alaska Native people were more likely to be infected and compared with white people, had double the risk of in-hospital death and three times the rate of severe infection, research shows. Yet even then, data weren’t telling the whole story.
Echo-Hawk’s organization published a report card in 2021 that scored each state’s collection of Natives’ COVID-19 cases. In total, the nation averaged a D+. This year, she published a follow-up for epidemiologists on addressing the misclassification of Native people, who often are listed as “white” or “Hispanic” in health settings and death certificates. Many states also inconsistently or don’t report tribal affiliation on death certificates, which can make tribe-specific death rates elusive.
A report in 2021 from the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office found that some officials from the CDC and the Indian Health Services agency didn’t recognize that they were required by law to share data with tribal epidemiology centers, the centers told investigators.
In the GAO report, investigators detailed logistical barriers, including federal agencies’ reluctance to share COVID-19 data because of concerns around privacy and security in data transmission.
“This is one of the best examples of what structural racism looks like,” said Shewbrooks. “Because when you look at the infrastructure for public health systems and public health data, tribes and [tribal epidemiology centers] were never included in that infrastructure.
“COVID really put it up there as: No, we needed this yesterday.”
Lackluster investigations may perpetuate high Native infant mortality rate

Shewbrooks said that as part of her work she’d go to funeral directors, who may fill out death certificates, throughout the region to educate them on proper classification of American Indian people. “I even had one say to me once, ‘I just always code them by how they look. I never ask what their race is.’”
“A lot of them didn’t know that this is data that gets really used,” she said. “Vital records data is just super important, foundational work in a lot of epidemiological work.”
There is no national standard for tribal health data, explained Cheryl Ellenwood, who is a citizen of the Nez Perce Nation and also Diné (Navajo).
Ellenwood, an assistant professor in Washington State University’s School of Politics, Philosophy and Public Affairs, experienced firsthand the data disconnect when both her parents died of COVID-19.
Four years ago this month, her mother, Annie Benally Ellenwood, an enrolled Navajo tribal member from New Mexico, died at age 71 in a hospital in Idaho. Annie Ellenwood’s death, however, wouldn’t show up in primary statistics of COVID-19 deaths in Navajo people — her tribe isn’t listed on her death certificate.
“I was very hurt by this, because my mother died because of COVID-19, and I wanted her death to count and mean something,” Ellenwood said.
“It still feels very life and death, like we are fighting to demonstrate the impact of so many things on our people,” she said.

(Photo by Scott Eisen/Getty Images)Nearly 20 years ago, my wife and I were lucky enough to study abroad in England. We had been awarded graduate scholarships and obtained our student visas from the British government. At the time, there was a heartbreaking genocide happening in Darfur. As concerned students invested in the moral standing of our university, we joined peaceful protests calling on Oxford to divest from companies that profited from the genocide and urged the British Parliament to intervene.

I never feared that my exercise of free speech would get me arrested and kicked out of what I took to be the second freest nation on earth, after my own. And I certainly could not have imagined a swarm of British agents abducting me on the street and deporting me without cause. Perhaps in the time of King George III but not the age of constitutions.



On Tuesday, Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish graduate student at Tufts University in Boston, was walking peacefully to the university’s Interfaith Center to break her Ramadan fast when six government agents in masks and hoodies surrounded her and took her away screaming in an unmarked SUV.
For a day or more, according to Fox News, Rumeysa’s family and lawyers had no idea where she was and were unable to contact her. No charges were filed against her. A federal district judge even ordered the government not to move her out of state. But she was moved anyway — to a detention center in Louisiana, awaiting deportation.
Rumeysa had a valid student visa, as Fox News also reported. She was awarded a prestigious Fulbright Fellowship to complete her Ph.D. at Tufts’ Department of Child Study and Human Development, where she researches children and media. No charges were filed against her and there was no warrant for her arrest; warrants are issued by judges who require the government to show cause.
The best guess for why she has been detained is that her name appeared with several others on an article in the student newspaper last year calling on Tufts University to “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide” and divest from companies with ties to Israel. The op-ed never mentioned Hamas, which the U.S. government rightly considers a terrorist organization. There is no evidence that she harbored any sympathy for, much less aided and abetted, Hamas or other organizations opposed to the United States. It seems her only “crime” was to peacefully speak out, as a concerned student, in a manner disfavored by the current administration.
Americans may freely disagree about the heartbreaking conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, which has left thousands of innocent Israelis and hundreds of thousands of innocent Palestinians dead or injured in recent years. For my part, having traveled to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, and believing in the state of Israel as a necessary response to the evils of the Holocaust (in which Jewish family members of mine were killed), I take seriously the conclusions of the International Criminal Court and Amnesty International that Israel’s war in Gaza is a “plausible” genocide.
But regardless of what we believe about Israel and Palestine, there is one thing on which Americans overwhelmingly agree: our constitutional right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment is sacred and immigrants who lawfully reside among us are not without rights of their own. As you uphold my right to call the war in Gaza genocidal, I defend your right to call Hamas an evil terrorist organization. In fact, I’ll join in that because it is also true.
Freedom of speech is as American as apple pie. It’s what has attracted many of the brightest minds from foreign lands to come here legally as students and help make America the richest, most innovative nation on earth — including Elon Musk.
Sadly, Rumeysa is not alone. She is one of hundreds of lawful immigrants so far who have been targeted for deportation by the Trump administration in recent weeks, without any pretense of due process. Their abductions on American streets by unmarked and unidentified “law enforcement” agents are being funded by our tax dollars to the tune of untold millions.
So far we have seen at least seven other students detained for showing sympathy for Palestinians; hundreds of Venezuelan migrants deported to a Salvadoran prison camp against the orders of a federal judge, and extended detentions and physical abuse of lawful migrants at the American border. These and countless other acts represent an unprecedented abuse of federal power against individuals whose lack of citizenship gives them limited legal recourse, in spite of their legal status in this country.
Given the choice, I still believe my fellow Americans would choose the Constitution over a man who would be king. It’s time we make that choice — not just for Rumeysa but for this country we love.

Gov. Leslie Rutledge preside over a joint session of the Arkansas House and Senate on Jan. 14, 2025. (Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas legislative leaders say they expect long days at the Capitol during the home stretch of the 2025 legislative session, which they anticipate ending by April 16.
“We’re going to start earlier in the day and we’re going to work late in the day” to move bills through committees and through the House and Senate, Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, said in an interview Wednesday.
For any Senate bills that don’t pass Senate committees this week, “it’s going to be very, very difficult for them to move forward,” he said.
House Speaker Rep. Brian Evans echoed those sentiments Friday, noting that Monday and Tuesday will likely be heavy bill filing days because waiting to file beyond that will make it really difficult for legislation to make it all the way through the process. Many bills already have been delayed due to drafting, amendments and last-minute changes, as well as waiting on fiscal impact statements, according to Evans, who said he wasn’t aware of any urgent or controversial bills that have yet to be filed. 
The Cabot Republican said he’s been speaking with House committee chairs about how to clear their calendars and ensure bills that will be heard are placed on the active agenda. The latter is important for transparency and ensuring constituents have time to make arrangements to speak for or against legislation, he said.

In addition to finalizing the state’s fiscal year 2026 budget, the Legislature is expected to consider some of Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ policy priorities for the session that have not yet become law.
Two such bills are sponsored by Hester: Senate Bill 377, which would eliminate the state’s 0.125% grocery sales tax, and Senate Bill 426, the Defense Against Criminal Illegals Act. The latter would mandate that Arkansas law enforcement agencies participate in a federal program that deputizes them to help U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the apprehension and deportation of undocumented migrants held in local jails and state prisons.
Hester said he hopes to present SB 426 for a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday. SB 377 is on Monday’s Senate Revenue and Tax Committee agenda.
Regulating minors’ access to cellphones and social media has also been a priority for Sanders. Two bills modeled after federal legislation passed the House with bipartisan support this month: House Bill 1717 is the Arkansas Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act, and House Bill 1726 is the Arkansas Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA).
Arkansas panel advances children’s online safety and privacy bills modeled after federal efforts

Senate committees will make time to consider both bills even if special orders of business are necessary, Hester said. A special order of business compels consideration before other items on a committee agenda. 
Sanders said in January, during her State of the State address, that the Legislature should amend the Social Media Safety Act of 2023 “so that it’s no longer held up in court and can begin to be enforced.” The enjoined law would have been the first in the nation to require minors to receive parental permission before signing up for a social media account.
So far no such amendments to the law have been proposed, but Hester said he expects it to “happen one way or another” since the governor said it is important to her.
“It may be something we don’t have to handle because it’s getting handled in other ways,” Hester said. “Maybe we’re confident that we’re going to end up winning in court. Maybe we’re confident that… President [Donald] Trump’s executive orders will handle it or something that they’re doing on the federal level.”
Compensation, prisons and China
The Senate is set to take up a proposed revamp of the state employee pay plan Monday, which passed the Joint Budget Committee on March 20. Sanders announced the plan in November and said it should make most state employees’ salaries competitive with the private sector and improve recruitment and retention.

Arkansas lawmakers advance $750 million appropriation bill for prison construction

 

The pay plan has not been controversial, unlike Sanders’ plan to build a 3,000-bed prison on 815 acres the state purchased in Franklin County. Earlier this month, the Joint Budget Committee approved a $750 million appropriation for the project, which has sparked frustration from some lawmakers and Franklin County residents.
Evans said he anticipates the prison appropriation legislation, Senate Bill 354, will continue generating discussion and could take a couple of tries to meet the required vote threshold in the House. Most bills need a simple majority of lawmakers’ support to pass, but budget-related bills need three-fourths of the support of each chamber, or 76 House votes and 27 Senate votes.
“When you’re talking about 100 members, it’s a lot of different opinions, a lot of different ideas, last-minute questions that come up,” he said. “Maybe there’ll be some folks not vote for it the first time just so that they get some extra time, make sure they have all their questions answered.”
Hester said he expects the bill to come before the full Senate on Tuesday. He said he could not predict how the Senate will vote; there is no limit on how many votes an appropriation bill receives before it reaches the three-fourths vote threshold.
Sanders urged passage of the appropriation in an Arkansas Democrat-Gazette op-ed Friday and called on state lawmakers to “[r]eject the tired excuses of politicians who don’t want criminals behind bars. Fund the prison, public safety, and a better future for all Arkansans.”
Sanders has also expressed support for a package of bills that will ban certain interactions between state entities and the Chinese government. She and other Republicans have criticized China’s activities in the state, including its past ownership of farmland in Craighead County.
Only one of the six bills has been signed into law and the rest are at various stages of the legislative process, but Hester said there is “nothing more popular with constituents than pushing back on China and what they’re doing to us.”

Constitutional amendments and education
Prior to last week’s recess, the House State Agencies Committee spent three weeks considering 20 proposed constitutional amendments. Evans anticipates the committee will begin ranking the proposals this week and likely send the top five to the House for further consideration. The Senate has 24 proposals to consider.
The Arkansas Legislature can refer three proposed constitutional amendments to voters during a legislation session, with each chamber generally selecting one and jointly selecting a third, Evans said. However, it’s not a requirement that lawmakers always refer three amendments, he said. 
“I think it’s really, really important to understand that just because we can do three, does not mean that we have to do three,” he said. “But also with the understanding that if we are going to present something forward, refer something out to the public to vote, I think it needs to be something that is really important statewide.”
Also this week, Evans said he anticipates Rep. Keith Brooks, a Little Rock Republican who succeeded him as chair of the House Education Committee this year, will run the biannual public school funding bill, which dictates per-student funding. House Bill 1312 was expected to be considered prior to the break, but was held up because it was awaiting a fiscal impact statement, Evans said. Fiscal impact statements explain how much money a bill would cost to implement, and they are compiled by either the Bureau of Legislative Research or the Department of Finance and Administration.
The per-pupil funding amount for the current school year is $7,771. If lawmakers approve HB 1312, the amount would increase to $8,162 for the 2025-2026 school year and $8,371 for the following academic year. 
New bill would dissolve Arkansas State Library and its board, set new library funding criteria

Overall, the session has been “very smooth,” according to Evans, who said he’s noticed “a different feel, a camaraderie in the House” when it comes to “good policy for all Arkansans.”
“Where things tend to get difficult is when you start looking at policy that’s more culture-driven,” he said. “So while we’ve had a few of those things that have crept up this session, there hasn’t seemed to have been as many. And so the body has really been able to just focus more on policy and members representing their districts, and how that policy’s going to affect their district rather than the culture of the district.” 
One such “culture-driven” bill is Senate Bill 536, which Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro, filed March 20. It would dissolve the Arkansas State Library and its board after the board did not take what Sullivan said were appropriate actions to keep “age-inappropriate” materials away from minors.
Hester supports SB 536 and has expressed support for Sullivan’s past promises to abolish the library board, which has repeatedly refused to divest from the American Library Association and to withhold funding from libraries where “sexually explicit” materials are within children’s reach.
“I don’t know how clear we could have been with the library board that they need to take stances to not provide pornography to kids, and they are insistent on it,” Hester said Friday.
The General Assembly resumes its work Monday morning. Meeting schedules, agendas and livestreams are available on the Arkansas Legislature’s website.

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)This is Kansas.
Imagine. It’s late at night and you’re fiddling with the tuning dial of an old shortwave radio that’s been in your garage since your eccentric old uncle died and left you a pile of his favorite stuff. You haven’t given much thought to any of it for years, but then one of your neighbors disappeared last month, hustled away by masked individuals with badges and thrown into an unmarked black SUV.
Today is the sixty-ninth day of…
The signal begins to fade, then is lost in the static. Bathed in the glow of the tuning dial, you lean close and turn the knob ever so slightly until the voice of the announcer returns. She speaks well, confident and knowing, and you can almost see her expression as she continues.
We’re broadcasting tonight from — well, we can’t say exactly where, but we can tell you we were in Council Grove last night and Garden City the night before that. 
It’s a bright night in April under a full moon, but you take comfort in the dark of the garage, which smells of grease and ozone from the big transformer in the back of the old radio receiver. It took you a week to figure out how to hang the wire antenna beneath your eaves so you could pick up a broadcast and another night or two to learn how to tune a signal. It all was so strangely analog, but luckily your uncle left you some books about how to do it.
We don’t know where we’ll be tomorrow.
The rumor on the block was that your neighbor was a terrorist, but you hadn’t seen anything to support that. Sure, she had some outspoken opinions about American foreign policy in the Middle East, but she also had had a good job and a family here. You worried about her kids. When you called the regional ICE detention center, run by a private prison, you were told coldly the detainee was no longer in U.S. custody. You asked if that meant she was no longer in the country. There was a pause, and then the voice on the other end of the line asked for your name.
We are here to tell you the news. The news may be good or bad, but we will always tell you the truth. Topping the news is that several hundred American deportees remain in foreign jails, expelled from this country and charged with no crime other than dissent. At least 40 of those individuals are Kansans. A prayer vigil was held at the Capitol Building rotunda in Topeka for the release of the unnamed deportees, but the interfaith gathering was disrupted by authorities citing new policies that make such protests illegal. 
You’ve never paid much attention to the regular news, preferring to get your information from podcasts that make you laugh. Newspapers are dead, magazines seem as old-fashioned as Christmas catalogs, and you haven’t read a book since you were forced to in high school. Television? Who watches fake news when there’s social media. Things that others say they care about — equality, progress, democracy — are just words. You didn’t vote in the presidential election last year because you couldn’t relate to either of the major party candidates. One was a clownish old man and the other was like that teacher in government class during senior year who made you feel guilty because you didn’t know the Bill of Rights.
In world news, NATO alliance helicopters are attempting to airlift the last resistance fighters from Kiev as the fall of the Ukrainian capital to advancing Russian forces appears imminent. A war predicted to last three days when it began in 2022 has lasted more than three years. The turning point was when the United States suspended military assistance in March 2025, the U.S. later withdrew from NATO, and Russia broke the resolve of Ukrainian and European defenders by threatening the use of tactical nuclear weapons. There is no word on the fate of the Ukrainian president, who vowed never to abandon the capital. 
Lately you’ve discovered that it’s more difficult to find on your devices information you used to take for granted: how to file your taxes, how fast the measles outbreak is moving in southwestern Kansas, what the local weather’s going to be for the rest of the week. You’ve also become irritated by the ads showing up on your social media feeds, from the “one weird trick” to getting rich in crypto to the constant appeals for seven “supernatural blessings” for just $1,000.
Now to finances. The global tariff war continues, with Americans paying substantially higher prices for consumer goods ranging from Scotch whisky to imported cars and automobile parts. The average price of a new car is now $49,000, which for a typical family means a monthly payment of up to $1,000, not counting the cost of gas, taxes or insurance.
Worried about your neighbor, you went to your local newspaper office, believing the reporters there might be able to help, but discovered the door to the building was locked and a sign said it had ceased publication. You sort of remember that a local police department had raided a newspaper office somewhere in Kansas not so long ago, but you can’t recall the details. Your parents had always subscribed to the town paper, but it had never occurred to you because news was something you could get on the internet for free.
Where to go now? The nearest television station, the one that had not yet had its operating license revoked, was in Topeka. There used to be a local radio station here, but it went off the air years ago, after refusing to be bought up by a chain. The NPR station broadcasting from the local university was taken off the air a few weeks ago because some lawmakers called it “un-American,” followed by the  closing of most of the campus when the school lost its federal grants for promoting diversity and improper ideology.
Closer to home, Canadian armed forces conducted war games along the 49th Parallel, meant as a show of strength against continued threats from the American president to annex our northern neighbor as the 51st state. While long considered an absurd idea, the threats were taken seriously after American troops last week seized Greenland, declared it a U.S. territory, and gave its 57,000 citizens just five days to renounce their Danish citizenship or face deportation. The Folketing, the Danish parliament, has appealed for defense under Article 5 of the NATO treaty.
Wary of going to the police or other authorities for help, you went to the public library and were directed to an old-fashioned bulletin board where names, photos, and details of the missing were thumbtacked. There were a dozen from your town alone, fathers and mothers and students. Your neighbor wasn’t among them, so you took an index card from a nearby stack and wrote her name and description and added it to the others. You wished you had a photo, but you didn’t. Perhaps somebody else, her family or one of her friends, would add it. On your way out of the building, a librarian wearing a rainbow button on their sweater vest stopped and asked if you had a library card.
“Here,” they had said, and pressed a slip of paper into your hand. “Take it with you.”
But it wasn’t an application for a library card. It was a handwritten note:
“Radio Free Kansas, 10 p.m. nightly, 4960 MHz AM.”
Let us now recall the words of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who in September 1939 told the American people this: “For four long years a succession of actual wars and constant crises have shaken the entire world and have threatened in each case to bring on the gigantic conflict which is today unhappily a fact. … You are, I believe, the best informed and most enlightened people in all the world at this moment. … At the same time, as I told my press conference today, it is of the highest importance that the press and the radio use the utmost caution to discriminate between actual verified fact on the one hand, and mere rumor on the other.”
You stare at the glowing dial of the shortwave receiver as if it were the secret to decoding a mystery. What historical event happened in September 1939? You had this in history class. What was the significance of the date? Ah, Germany invades Poland. It marks the start of World War II in Europe.
Now, for our final segment, we rebroadcast something from Voice of America, disbanded in March 2025. The new chief responsible for VOA and Radio Free Europe and other broadcast initiatives had accused the agency of harboring spies and terrorist sympathizers, of widespread corruption, and of spending hundreds of millions on fake news. But the real issue with VOA is that it brought the world the truth, good or bad. This segment is about the monarch butterfly migration in Kansas, a journey that takes the colorful migrants from Mexico to Canada. It is from the VOA Learning English Broadcast of three years ago:
“The migrating monarch butterfly is considered an endangered species. Scientists say the dropping numbers of monarchs are due to climate change, loss of habitat and the use of pesticides — chemicals that kill insects — and herbicides — chemicals that kill plants. But there are things that people living in the United States can do to help the beloved black-and-orange insects.”
You think about all the butterflies that fluttered through your back yard this time of year when you were a kid. You think of all of them you caught in a net, all the ones you accidentally crushed, the ones you put in a mason jar and then forgot about. You get tearful, wishing you had urged your parents to plant milkweed.
We hope to see you here again tomorrow night. Stay safe. Ad astra! This is Radio Free Kansas signing off.
A few tinny bars of “Home on the Range” follow.
Then silence.

Weisman and Reporter Alexander Castro. (Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island Current took the region’s top award for local election coverage by an online news outlet, and Senior Reporter Nancy Lavin received two first place awards in the annual New England Better Newspaper Competition on Saturday night.
The morning newsletter Swell earned third place in the outstanding newsletter category among online news sites at the New England Newspaper Convention held at the Portland Regency Hotel & Spa in Portland, Maine.
The competition held by the New England Newspaper & Press Association is a chance for the region’s news outlets to showcase the best efforts of their teams and share their achievements with readers. Work published between Aug. 1 2023, and July 31, 2024, was eligible.
Rhode Island Current staff received a first place award for their work covering the November 2023 special election to fill the open 1st Congressional District seat, which was won by U.S. Rep. Gabe Amo. 
A total of 35 candidates turned in paperwork declaring their intention to run, but only 15 collected the minimum 500 validated and certified signatures from voters to run in the September primary. Thirteen candidates were Democrats, including the early frontrunner, Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos, whose campaign was ultimately derailed by a signature scandal involving her nomination forms.
Rhode Island Current’s election coverage also looked at what shapes this congressional district made up of 19 communities. While the Democratic race drew most of the attention, the team’s coverage included why the two Republican primary candidates stayed quiet. A Primary Day blog was active with regular updates on the candidates as the team fanned out to cover the campaigns and the results that night.
Lavin won a first place award for Business/Economic reporting for her investigative profile of a solar panel company CEO accused of predatory sales tactics. Lavin outlined the loosely regulated legal and business environment that allowed the company to flourish before being sued by the Office of Attorney General and laying off a third of its staff.
An in-depth story on a small but contentious oyster farm project proposed for Tiverton’s Sapowet Cove won Lavin another first place award. Lavin examined how the proposed project illuminated the curious alliances and growing discontent surrounding Rhode Island’s aquaculture industry more broadly.

(Photo by Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images)In a stunning rejection of Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, Louisiana voters turned down all four of his constitutional amendments Saturday, including the governor’s plan to overhaul the state’s tax and budget laws. 
With votes still being counted, nearly two-thirds of voters had refused all of the amendments in an election that could have broader political implications for the rest of Landry’s term. 
The governor, who has sometimes relied on strong-arm tactics to get his agenda through the Louisiana Legislature, could become more vulnerable to pushback after failing to pass his most ambitious policy proposal at the ballot box. 
Landry’s priority for the election, Amendment 2, would have lowered the maximum income tax rate the state could enact and limit annual state budget increases. It also would have made it more difficult to enact new tax breaks.
The proposal was expected to produce a financial windfall for Landry and state legislators later this year. Amendment 2 would have moved hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue from state savings accounts into Louisiana’s general fund, where Landry and state legislators could have spent it more easily. 
Landry had attempted to sweeten voters on Amendment 2 by tying it to compensation for public school teachers. Had it passed, temporary stipends worth $2,000 and $1,000 that teachers and school support staff have received for the past two years were expected to become permanent. 

Now, the educators are at risk of a pay cut since Landry hasn’t included money for their stipend in his current budget proposal. 
Opponents of Amendment 2 celebrated its defeat Saturday night. They include William Most, an attorney who unsuccessfully sued to have the proposal removed from the ballot. He has argued that the language put before voters was convoluted and misleading, making it illegal.
“I think this is a full-throated rejection of attempts to trick Louisiana voters into voting for something they don’t want,” Most said. “… This sends a clear message that if state officials want to change our constitution, they can’t do it through trickery or deceit.”

Landry and the Republican-dominated legislature might have inadvertently stirred up public opposition to Amendment 2 by putting it on the same ballot as Amendment 3, a juvenile justice measure that drew the ire of Democrats and national anti-incarceration groups. 
Amendment 3, which 65% of voters opposed, would have made it easier to send more minors to adult jails and prisons for longer sentences. It spurred national criminal justice reform organizations, such as the Southern Poverty Law Center and Vera Institute of Justice, to spend more than $500,000 to turn voters against it. 

While those organizations focused on defeating Amendment 3, they also became the backbone of a “No on All” campaign working to vote down all four of the constitutional amendments Landry was pushing. 
Supporters of the tax proposal in Amendment 2 said they believed the criminal justice issue had a negative effect on their measure in interviews earlier this week. 

“[Amendment 3] is a huge motivation of the groups that are saying no to everything. That seems to be the motivating factor,” said Daniel Erspamer, CEO of the Pelican Institute, a conservative think tank who helped push the tax and budget amendment. 
Landry’s team started to see trouble during the early voting period for the election. John Couvillon, an experienced Louisiana pollster, said Democrats and Black voters showed up in far greater numbers than Republicans during the early voting period. 

“I have just never seen an early vote this strong [for Democrats],” Couvillon said. 
In addition to Amendment 3, Couvillon said left-leaning voters may also be motivated to vote because of concerns about President Donald Trump. Landry is closely aligned with the Trump administration. 
However, opposition to Amendment 2, and the budget and tax changes, also came from some conservative activists. Religious groups and nonprofits were unhappy the amendment would have weakened constitutional protections for property tax exemptions they enjoy. 

Woody Jenkins, chairman of the East Baton Rouge Republican Party and a former state representative, was among those who opposed the amendment. 
The defeat of Amendments 2 and 3 also likely led to the downfall of Amendment 1, which failed with 64% of voters against the proposal. It would have allowed the formation of specialty courts in Louisiana with jurisdiction outside current parish and judicial districts. 
Amendment 4 also failed, with 62% of voters. It would have adjusted the rules for special elections to fill vacant or new judgeships, primarily on the Louisiana Supreme Court.

(Washington State Department of Transportation)A divided Washington state Senate on Saturday approved a hike in the state’s gas tax and a two-year budget that hinges on billions of dollars from new taxes on the state’s wealthiest residents and largest companies.
The Senate, on a 31-18 vote, endorsed raising the tax 6 cents per gallon on July 1 and increasing it 2% annually to account for inflation starting the following year.
It is the anchor of a barge full of new and higher taxes and fees that will generate around $500 million a year for transportation from users of cars, boats, planes, electric bikes and ferries. Those dollars will ensure the state can complete projects underway and do ones that have been long promised to residents.
“We are billions of dollars behind in maintenance and preservation. We have a ferry system that is in shambles. We have citizens dying at a record pace on our roads,” said Sen. Curtis King, R-Yakima, the lead Republican on the Senate Transportation Committee who helped craft the package. “We had to respond, and that’s what we did.”
Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, chair of the transportation committee and the chamber’s lead transportation budget writer, said the revenue “will unlock investments in every corner of the state. It will fill potholes and fix bridges in urban communities and in rural communities, and it will keep promises that we have made.”
An even bigger challenge
Also Saturday, the Senate passed the Democrats’ two-year $78.5 billion operating budget on a 28-21 vote. Democrat Sens. Mike Chapman of Port Angeles and Deb Krishnadasan of Gig Harbor joined Republicans in opposition. 
Sen. June Robinson, D-Everett, chair of the Senate Ways and Means Committee and lead budget writer, said a looming budget shortfall resulted in some hard choices, such as delaying expansions of early learning programs, furloughing state workers, and draining the state’s reserves. But she noted the budget boosts funding for special education and preserves critical public services.
“The core of this budget is a commitment to the people of Washington,” she said.
It spends about $5.4 billion more than the current budget. Of the increase, $1.6 billion is for education and new collective bargaining agreements for state workers. The rest is to cover increased expenses for existing programs and services, also known as maintenance-level spending.
Robinson said it shaves around $3 billion in spending in the next budget, and $6.5 billion over four fiscal years. Slashing deeper would have been “devastating,” she said.
“None of these choices was made lightly,” Robinson said of the cuts. “That is why this budget bill pairs reductions with smart, necessary and progressive revenue options. This balance of cuts and new revenue allows us to protect services and stay fiscally responsible for years to come.”
The two-year Senate budget relies on roughly $6.2 billion from a four-year, $17 billion package of tax changes that did not get voted on.
Those include lifting the cap on annual property tax growth along with new taxes on the assets of wealthy individuals and the payrolls of large companies. Hearings on the proposed tax legislation will be held Monday in the Senate Ways and Means Committee.
Sen. Chris Gildon, R-Puyallup, the lead budget writer for Senate Republicans, said the alternative budget he wrote would have spent $75.3 billion and been balanced without new taxes.
“We can do it without all the drastic cuts that people have been talking about. We can do it without any of the harmful taxes,” he said.
He criticized Democrats’ draining of the emergency reserves, saying it puts the state in a precarious fiscal position in a period of uncertainty over how decisions by the federal government might impact the state. And he said the document was confusing because it spends money to fund state worker pay raises and then seeks to save dollars by furloughing them for up to 13 days.
The House is slated to vote on its proposed budget Monday. Like the Senate, it counts on money from that chamber’s $14.8 billion tax package that has not yet been acted on. If passed, negotiations will begin in earnest to reconcile differences in the two spending approaches.
In the meantime, House and Senate budget writers will need to work with Gov. Bob Ferguson, a first-term Democrat, who has said he wants all cost-cutting options explored before considering any new taxes. 
‘Everybody is being asked to contribute’
The current two-year state transportation budget is $14.6 billion and includes money for road maintenance, ferries, bike and pedestrian projects and more. 
The budget blueprint passed by the Senate on Saturday lays out $16.2 billion in spending in the next biennium, made up of $6.2 billion in operating costs and $10 billion for capital projects.
The plethora of new taxes and fee increases is projected to bring in $3 billion in the next six years, of which a little less than a third would be available in the next budget. 
In the floor debate, Liias said they faced a $1 billion shortfall in the next budget, growing to $4 billion to meet current obligations over the next six years. 
To address it, the Senate came up with the revenue plan. It also shifts $5 billion of future expenses tied to replacing culverts to the state’s capital budget. Details on that move will be released Monday morning. And the Senate is directing 0.3% of sales tax collections from the operating budget to transportation starting in the 2027-2029 biennium.
Absent these moves, the Legislature would have been forced to halt some undertakings and postpone “every single improvement project that is not currently under contract,” Liias said Saturday.
The revenue package is intended to spread the burden across all users of the transportation system.
“It’s not the folks who drive a car are going to pay more or folks who bike are going to pay more,” Liias said. “Everybody is being asked to contribute more to the infrastructure that we all depend on.”
Fares could rise 1.5% each year on Washington State Ferries and a new surcharge would be added for credit card transactions. Tolls could be collected on the entire Highway 520 corridor instead of just the floating bridge. Police could issue $150 tickets for cars parked with expired tabs in the public right-of-way.
There’s a new 10% luxury tax on motor homes, recreational watercraft, and non-commercial aircraft costing over $500,000. The tax would be levied only on the amount of the sale, lease, or transfer value exceeding $500,000.
Other measures include raising registration fees on electric vehicles and hybrids, increasing the tax on rental cars and adding a $10 assessment on traffic infractions starting Jan. 1, 2026. 
And there could be a new $1 fee tacked onto tickets for sporting events and concerts with a crowd of more than 20,000 people. The assessment would be levied on the operators of venues with a capacity of more than 20,000 attendees, such as T-Mobile Park, Lumen Field and the Tacoma Dome.
Sen. Leonard Christian, R-Spokane, opposed the gas tax increase, saying his constituents will drive to Idaho to pay less to fill up and spend on other items while there.
“This is going to be another boon for Idaho,” he said.
In its final action Saturday, the Senate voted 35-14 to pass a bill to issue up to $7 billion of bonds to pay for the design, right-of-way purchases and construction of highway projects. Senate Bill 5800 also increased the bonding authorization for the State Route 520 project by $500 million.
Meanwhile, the House is expected to vote on its transportation budget next week. And it has a bill to raise the state gas tax 9 cents, and then index it to inflation. That too could be acted on.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/sr-520-bridge-montlake-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-29 20:58:59.824721

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)As some lawmakers complain about the amount of money influencing ballot measures in South Dakota, new numbers indicate that 2024’s ballot question campaigns were among the most expensive in state history.
Ballot question committees recently filed their year-end campaign finance reports. Those and earlier reports show the total amount spent to support and oppose the seven measures in last fall’s election was about $12 million. There are no limits on contributions to ballot question committees.
South Dakota’s campaign finance system makes compiling and comparing campaign finance data difficult. Rather than entering information directly into a centralized system, candidates, committees and independent spenders submit scanned forms to the South Dakota Secretary of State’s Office that have to be viewed one-by-one, which is what South Dakota Searchlight did to compile its analysis.


 Only the state’s 2006 and 2016 elections had more expensive ballot question campaigns, reaching nearly $13 million each of those years, according to historical data maintained by the national nonprofit Open Secrets.
Republican legislators cited last year’s spending as part of their motivation to file bills this year that would tighten restrictions on citizen-initiated ballot measures. 
One major bill that passed will move the deadline for submitting petition signatures from May to February, shortening the petition-gathering window by three months. Gov. Larry Rhoden vetoed a bill that would require constitutional amendment petitions to have signatures from registered voters in every state Senate district, and legislators will consider that veto on Monday. Legislators put a measure on the 2026 ballot that will ask voters to raise the approval threshold for constitutional amendments from a simple majority to 60%.
Governor vetoes effort to restrict constitutional amendment process with geographic rule

Rep. John Hughes, R-Sioux Falls, sponsor of the 60% proposal, said during the legislative session that last year’s ballot measures resulted in “millions of dollars in out-of-state money coming for deceptive, emotionally charged ads stating half-truths.”
Open Secrets reports that about 70% of the money contributed to last year’s South Dakota ballot measures came from South Dakota residents.
Last year’s most expensive ballot measure campaign in the state appears to have been Amendment G, an abortion-rights measure that voters rejected. 
It’s difficult to determine exactly how much was spent in the Amendment G campaign, because the main group supporting the amendment, Dakotans for Health, also supported another unsuccessful ballot question that would have repealed sales taxes on groceries. Dakotans for Health spent a combined $1.32 million on those campaigns and did not separate expenses in its reports.
Opponents spent $2.74 million against the abortion-rights measure.
The grocery tax measure was Initiated Measure 28. Besides the amount spent to support it by Dakotans for Health, groups spent about $240,000 against it. 
Another big-dollar campaign was Referred Law 21, a set of carbon dioxide pipeline regulations that voters rejected. Spending totaled $3.15 million, with $2.87 million by supporters and $275,000 by opponents. The majority of funds in support of the measure came from ethanol producers hoping to build a multi-state pipeline to capture and sequester carbon emitted by their production plants. 
An unsuccessful effort to legalize recreational marijuana use, Initiated Measure 29, was nearly a $2 million campaign with $1.4 million in spending by supporters and about $468,000 by opponents.
Constitutional Amendment F, which legislators sent to the ballot and voters approved, authorized the state to consider imposing work requirements on people eligible for expanded Medicaid benefits. All $587,000 of spending on the amendment was by the no side.
Amendment H, which would have established open primary elections but was rejected by voters, was a $1.95 million campaign with most of that amount spent by supporters.

(Courtesy of Phil Larkin)Selling, exchanging or transferring Washington State Department of Natural Resources land is serious business. These decisions have long-term implications and require comprehensive information and thorough review of all potential options and should not be rushed.
It appears that the Jan. 7 decision by the Board of Natural Resources agreeing to sell the 200-acre Thorpe Property in Spokane’s Latah Valley in exchange for a Bellingham property fell short of that standard. New information raises questions about whether the board had all the information it needed to make the best decision.
I should know because I served on Washington’s Board of Natural Resources for eight years, and thus am very familiar with the process, motivation, and history surrounding DNR’s land sales and exchanges. Never during my tenure on the board do I recall any land sale or swap that was expedited in a manner similar to this exchange. The process lacked transparency, failed to engage important stakeholders, and ignored a viable alternative to achieve the agency’s goals.
Since 1957, the board has set policies to guide how our state’s trust lands are managed, including approving the sustainable harvest of timber sales and the sale or exchanges of trust lands while meeting a constitutional obligation to act in the best interest of the trust beneficiaries for which those lands are managed (e.g., K-12 schools, higher education, roads, fire departments, hospitals, and other county services). 
DNR manages trust lands to provide jobs, commodities, clean water, wildlife habitat and recreational opportunities while maintaining the primary goal of trust revenue production.
The January decision agreed to sell off the Thorpe Property (valued at $8.4 million) to a development company in addition to paying $7 million in exchange for a property currently housing a Haggen grocery store in Bellingham that the agency has stated has a value of $15.4 million.  At first blush, it would seem those numbers add up, except that a look at the Whatcom County assessor’s valuation of the Bellingham property comes in at $11.4 million.
Commercial real estate can be a risky business these days, as any of us can tell by the number of vacant storefronts in our cities and towns since the pandemic. Add to this that the grocery store in question was one of the stores put on a list for divestiture as part of the recent Kroger-Albertsons merger. Large companies put underperforming stores on such lists before they can gain additional stores in a merger.
What makes this agreement even more puzzling is that the board ignored that DNR had already approved a trust land transfer option that would have transferred the Thorpe Property to the city of Spokane to create a city park and community and education center for residents in the Latah Valley. This would be a much simpler approach and allow the Legislature to compensate the trust for transferring the land with $8.4 million, which would be used to buy replacement lands to benefit the trust beneficiaries.
Only after that process concluded, the previous public lands commissioner rushed through a hasty public hearing and public comment period from late October through mid-December last year. The results of that process were overwhelmingly supportive of the trust land transfer option and critical of the sale option to Blue Fern Development. The Spokane City Council passed a resolution calling for the board to delay the vote to ensure the right decision. This is all well chronicled in more than 15 local print, television and radio stories.
Current Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove did not get a chance to examine or vote on the Thorpe sale that came before the board on Jan. 7 because it was a week before he took office. However, he and the Board of Natural Resources can exercise a provision in the sale agreement to terminate the contract before April 6, 2025. This would allow a real discussion and conversation to occur about what is the best option to sell or transfer the Thorpe property to benefit trust beneficiaries, DNR, the city of Spokane, and local residents.
More than 25 local Spokane organizations, businesses, and elected officials, including the Spokane City Council, are calling for a reexamination of the agreement at the upcoming April 1 BNR meeting. Upthegrove and the board should join them.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/thorpe-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-03-29 13:04:52.155390

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Even if the Montana Supreme Court decides to suspend Attorney General Austin Knudsen for 90 days, the penalty doesn’t mean he needs to lose his elected office — that’s one thing his lawyer and the lawyer for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel agreed on.
Friday, the Montana Supreme Court, including district court judges sitting in for recused justices, heard arguments about whether Knudsen should be punished for statements he and lawyers under his supervision made that disparaged the court and for defying a court order.
At the hearing, newly sworn in Chief Justice Cory Swanson peppered both lawyers with questions, as did Justice Katherine Bidegaray and some of the five judges sitting in for recused justices.
Christian Corrigan, on behalf of Knudsen, argued the court should dismiss the complaint, a “highly irregular and unprecedented” one, and he said a more appropriate action from the court would be a “letter of caution” to his client.
“This entire process, from investigation, complaint to hearing, has been tainted by persistent due process violations,” Corrigan said.
However, Timothy Strauch, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, urged the court to find suspension appropriate to protect the integrity of the court and the rule of law.
“No lawyer is above this court’s constitutional regulatory authority,” Strauch said. “We do not have here a contrite or apologetic respondent, but a defiant one, to this day, who blames the court, the Commission (on Practice), myself and my predecessor.”
The lawyers argued and judges fired questions in front of a full house, including high-profile Republican legislators and members of the public. Speaker of the House Brandon Ler, former state Sen. Keith Regier, and Montana Family Foundation President Jeff Laszloffy were among those in the gallery.
Swanson, who pointed out Knudsen likely supervises more attorneys than anyone in the state, also questioned the process, and he asked the lawyers where to draw the line.
Lawyers pledge to adhere to their rules of professional conduct, and the Commission on Practice, which regulates the profession, upheld 41 separate ethics violations against the Knudsen last year.
“It would seem strange for us to just rule the attorney general is not subject to those rules in some regard,” Swanson said. “So help us figure out where that line is.”
The case is unusual.
It raised questions about how the state’s top attorney, also head of an agency, should conduct himself, and it fueled a simmering dispute between the legislative and judicial branches in 2021 that has continued in Montana.
In the September 2023 complaint, the Office for Disciplinary Counsel, which handles discipline against members of the state bar, alleged Knudsen broke rules of professional conduct for lawyers— allegations one of his lawyers initially described as a “political stunt.”
A hearing took place in October 2024, and Knudsen acknowledged he might have refrained from the “sharp” language he used in his representation of the legislature in 2021.
In fiery letters from the Attorney General’s Office about the dispute, Knudsen said he saw evidence of “judicial misconduct,” “self interest,” “actual impropriety” and “bias” by the court, according to court records.
Records also show Knudsen and a lawyer under his supervision both said they would not follow orders: “The legislature does not recognize this Court’s … order as binding and will not abide it.”
Bidegaray said defying a court order goes to the heart of the matter. During the 2021 fight, the legislature sought to subpoena judicial records, the court quashed the subpoena, but Knudsen didn’t immediately return records.
Bidegaray wondered what the consequences would be if the top lawyer in Montana was allowed to disobey a court order simply because he considered it invalid.
“Does that not set the tone, or the trickle down of behavior, to the attorneys?” Bidegaray said. “ … Does that not then set some sort of standard that allows every other attorney to disregard court orders?”
Corrigan said the court was on notice that Knudsen disagreed with the order, and the situation veered into unanswered questions of law. Swanson said one problem was that the issue wasn’t dealt with in real time, such as with a motion to compel filed by the other party.
Bidegaray, though, said it might have been more prudent, when traversing new legal terrain, for the AG to have sought a “stay,” or pause, “instead of just disregarding a court order.”
In October 2024 following the hearing, the Commission on Practice unanimously recommended the Montana Supreme Court suspend Knudsen for 90 days for multiple violations of rules.
Corrigan, though, argued the Commission on Practice botched the proceedings in numerous ways, and as a result, he said the Montana Supreme Court should toss the recommendation for a suspension.
Corrigan, with the Attorney General’s Office, said Knudsen acknowledged he would have done some things differently, but he also was acting in a “narrow scenario,” where he was discharging other professional duties.
As such, Corrigan suggested the court at most issue a “letter of caution” that Knudsen walked right up to the line, and he said such an outcome would “turn down the temperature.”
Corrigan also warned the Montana Supreme Court that it shouldn’t make an example of Knudsen, and he said punishing the attorney general wouldn’t help people have faith in their branch of government.
“Obviously, disciplining the Attorney General on this record would not do anything to increase confidence in the judiciary,” Corrigan said.
If the court just tried to turn down the temperature, though, Judge Luke Berger said he wondered if the court would leave the door open for more of the same, without some strict guidance: “What is to stop it from happening in the future?”
On behalf of the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, Strauch said he understood the legislature felt strongly that the court had engaged in misconduct, and it retained the “strongest advocate” in the state in Knudsen.
“There’s no doubt in my mind that he fought vigorously for his client,” Strauch said.
But he also said Knudsen crossed the line when he attacked the integrity and qualifications of the court “completely unnecessarily,” and he requested the Montana Supreme Court draw that same line and follow the commission’s recommendation.
“Do we live in a world where these rules are just sort of a quaint reminder about concepts like respect for the rule of law and professionalism?” Strauch asked. Or is it a world where lawyers who swear to protect and defend the constitution and follow the rules are treated equally?
Strauch said he and the AG agree that the suspension would not set up a vacancy in the office, or a situation where Knudsen would need to be replaced.
According to briefings in the case, state law says the office becomes vacant if the attorney general fails to discharge duties for three consecutive months, but a suspension of even 90 days doesn’t need to run consecutively, and the court could also set a period that would ensure it wouldn’t equal three months (August 1 through Oct. 29, for example).
Also, the attorney general must be a lawyer in “good standing,” but a court briefing from Knudsen’s team said that is a qualification for running for office, not for continuing tenure. It also said the state Constitution allows for the removal of a judge, but not for an officer of another branch, and Montanans “overwhelmingly reelected” Knudsen while the case was pending.
“Any other act by one branch that purports to remove a constitutional officer of another branch would exceed constitutional bounds and raise grave constitutional concerns,” said the court filing.
Strauch said a suspension would preserve the rule of law.
Judge Gregory Bonilla, however, said the integrity of the judicial process is important, and key in the case. Bonilla said candidly, if he had worked with Knudsen, he would have cautioned him over his actions, but he said that’s just one question.
“There’s conduct,” Bonilla said. “And then there’s, ‘Did we do it right?’” In other words, he said, he might be certain someone engaged in criminal conduct, but if the search and seizure process was compromised, it doesn’t matter.
“This is what the attorney general is essentially saying, right?” Bonilla said.
Strauch, though, said both jurisprudence and due process are “sacrosanct,” and both were followed.
Swanson, who took office in January, told Strauch he didn’t like the statements that came from the attorney general and his team, but he didn’t like the way the process unfolded either.
“This thing is a mess from start to finish,” Swanson said. “I agree with you. A whole bunch of their statements and conduct on the front end look bad. But the proceeding, ruling on things without him having a chance to respond, and issuing this immediately before the election? … That looks political.”
Strauch agreed the timing could appear political, but he said the timing was due in a large part to the request from the attorney general’s team to delay the proceeding.
Strauch agreed the court had a range of options, from remanding the case for more information to full suspension, but Corrigan said a remand, or “third bite at the apple,” would not be fair to Knudsen.
“It would be inequitable for the Attorney General to have to go through this process again,” Corrigan said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/knudsen-hearing-day1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-29 13:04:52.155390

Lawmakers are getting ready for the last day of the 2025 legislative session on Friday, but they still drop some nuggets everywhere they go.
This week: Democratic discontent comes to the dome, a ride-or-die always Trumper gets rewarded with a new gig and some funny money, and state leaders try to decide whether to add more real money into their yearly salaries. 
Pay bump flop
House lawmakers quickly swatted down a last-minute Senate plan to give the governor and other statewide officials pay raises. 
The Senate had added the salary bumps Thursday to a bill adjusting the pay of judges at higher levels in Georgia. Under the plan, Gov. Brian Kemp would have been tied with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul for the highest earning governor in the country. 
  Rep. Rob Leverett. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“You may have seen a little something about the amendment in the news over the last 24 hours,” the bill’s original sponsor, Elberton Republican Rep. Rob Leverett, said to his colleagues Friday. 
“I think that is a discussion we as a body need to have at some point, but we shouldn’t have it as an amendment to a bill in the last two or three days of session,” Leverett said. “I believe it needs to be thought through a little more and it needs a little more study.”
Some senators also tried to increase lawmaker pay in another judicial pay bill focused on superior court judges.
Critics argued that the legislative pay amendment would sabotage a bill intended to create uniform statewide pay for Georgia Superior Court judges. The proposed pay raise amendment to House Bill 85 would have increased the salaries of lawmakers from $24,341 to about $55,000.
Sen. Randal Mangham, a Stone Mountain Democrat, argued it would put Georgia lawmakers in line with the national average of $44,320 in 2024, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
He referenced the limited funding he receives for his staff. 
“$7,000 for an entire year with my budget for expenses to run the people’s business. It’s a $40 billion enterprise,” Mangham said, referring to the state budget.
Sen. John Kennedy, a Macon Republican, urged senators prior to voting to consider how passing the amendment would come across to the taxpayers.
“Colleagues, are you willing to look at your constituents in the eye and tell them you need more of their tax dollars in your pocket and out of their pocket?” Kennedy said.
The debate ended with the legislative pay amendments failing 33 to 18 before the superior court legislation passed with nearly unanimous support.
Dems in disarray
In the wake of a bitter loss to President Donald Trump, Democrats across the country are trying to figure out where it all went wrong. 
A recent Politico analysis of a Quinnipiac poll found that for the first time in the poll’s history, a majority of Democrats view members of their party in Congress unfavorably. Just 40 percent of Democrats polled said the party is doing a good job, compared to 49 percent who said the opposite. 
A March NBC News poll found 65% of self-identified Democrats want the party to fight Trump rather than seek compromise, even if that leads to gridlock in Washington. Around this time in Trump’s first term, only 33% of Democrats felt that way, the pollster found.
That discontent could be springing forth at the state level as well. 
The Forsyth County Democrats released a statement castigating Democrats in Congress and the state Legislature for “voting like Republicans.”
“With democracy itself at stake – and with the public’s frustration with figures like Donald Trump and Elon Musk high – we cannot afford to hand political or legislative victories to Republicans or to validate their agenda while our constituents and values hang in the balance,” the statement reads. “Likewise, here in Georgia, amid widespread discontent with Governor Brian Kemp’s hard-right legislative push, it is imperative that Democrats stand together rather than bolster Kemp’s initiatives that harm the public interest.”
The statement lists three pieces of legislation where some Democrats broke rank – Senate Bill 68, Kemp’s priority lawsuit overhaul bill, supported by three Democrats; Senate Bill 144, liability protections for fertilizer and pesticide manufacturers with the support of nine Democrats and House Bill 267, which bans transgender girls from playing on girls’ school sports teams and got votes from three Dems.
Trump U.S. Treasurer Legislature’s newly popular kid

Republican Sen. Brandon Beach’s selection as President Donald Trump’s choice to become the next U.S. Treasurer has boosted his popularity.
Beach signed fake currency featuring the face of Senate Majority Leader Steve Gooch reading “In Goochie We Trust” that was passed around the Capitol last week. The 63-year-old Beach’s signature as U.S. treasurer could soon be emblazoned on the front of real legal tender in the future.   
The senator’s role in state government will end shortly after the Legislature gavels out on April 4 for the final day of the 2025 session.
Beach will act as a liaison between the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, as well as oversee the U.S. Mint and Fort Knox. The president is boosting a conspiracy theory these days that some of the gold is missing from Fort Knox and says he plans to go to Kentucky to see for himself if the country’s treasure is still secured. 
Inside the Senate chamber Wednesday, fellow Trump loyalist GOP Lt. Gov. Burt Jones celebrated Beach’s new job opportunity. 
Jones recalled that not long ago they were part of a small cadre of hardline Trump supporters in the Senate who were persona non grata, even among fellow Republicans.

(File photo from iStock / Getty Images Plus)Colorectal cancer is a formidable adversary, ranking as the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States.
In 2024 alone, the American Cancer Society estimated 53,000 lives were lost nationwide to this disease, with 2,580 new cases and 920 deaths in South Carolina alone.
The stakes are high — but the prognosis is far more optimistic when the cancer is detected early, thanks to screening tests.
The five-year survival rate for colorectal cancer is 91% when caught in early stages, then plummets to 13% when it’s discovered in late stages after symptoms usually begin to show.
Yet, more than one in three adults in the U.S. age 45 and over — that’s 50 million Americans — are not up to date with recommended screening.
Health care providers play a crucial role in improving colorectal cancer screening rates, with primary care providers on the front lines.
As a primary care physician, I take a whole person approach to patient care that prioritizes both treating illness as it arises and proactive care aimed at maintaining overall health and preventing diseases.
Cancer screening is a critical tool in this effort, and I am committed to ensuring that my patients not only get screened for colorectal cancer and other cancers but are educated about the choices they have for effective screening options.
Recently, I saw results from a national survey that explored attitudes about screening in the lead-up to National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month this March.
The survey findings are both alarming and hopeful.
Nine out of 10 physicians surveyed are, understandably, worried about the high percentage of
patients who do not complete colorectal cancer screenings. The reasons for this are multifaceted, but one of the most prevalent is fear and anxiety.
According to the survey, 74% of primary care physicians and close to a third of patients (29%) report that fear or anxiety is a barrier to completing screening.
But there is promising news. Last summer, the Food and Drug Administration approved a new blood test, Shield, which offers a simpler alternative to traditional screening methods. It requires no preparation or procedures — just a quick blood draw, which may make it a more appealing option for many patients.
The potential impact of blood-based testing is significant. The survey found that 93% of physicians and 86% of Americans believe avoiding or delaying colorectal cancer screenings is less likely if patients are presented with an FDA-approved blood test option.
Moreover, 92% of Americans are more likely to get a colonoscopy if they have a positive result on a blood screening test first.
These statistics underscore the potential of a blood-based screening option to increase overall screening rates and save lives.
The introduction of blood-based screening can play a crucial role in bridging the CRC screening gap. By offering more and easier screening options to patients, providers can help ensure that more patients get the test they need.
By integrating blood-based screening into our practices, primary care providers can help more South Carolinians stay up to date with their colorectal cancer screenings and ultimately save more lives.
Together, right here in the Palmetto State, we can make a difference in the fight against colorectal cancer.

(Courtesy CT DEEP)A proposal to allow hunting of Connecticut’s black bears is no more.
On Friday, members of the legislature’s Environment Committee unveiled new language for Senate Bill 1523, a proposal that would have allowed the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to establish and regulate a bear hunting season. Instead, the new bill stripped out much of that language and replaced it with new rules that expand the circumstances under which farmers may be allowed to kill bears for damaging their crops.
“Despite the title of this bill, an ‘Act Concerning Bear Hunting,’ this bill is not moving forward a bear hunt,” said state Rep. John-Michael Parker, D-Madison, who serves as co-chair of the committee.
The move marked the latest time that lawmakers in Connecticut have pulled back on proposals to allow bear hunting, which is practiced in most surrounding states with the exception of Rhode Island.
A black bear hunt in Conn.? Legislators are considering it, again.

Proponents of a hunt say it would help reduce conflicts with the state’s growing population of black bears, which DEEP estimates ranges from 1,000 to 1,200 bears. Opponents, however, argue that hunting would do little to deal with the most problematic bears — which are often found roaming away from the woods into populated areas — and that it does not align with the state’s values.
“It’s getting through to elected officials that hunting is not a solution to resolving bear conflicts,” Annie Hornish, a co-founder of the CT Coalition to Protect Bears, said Friday.
Hornish said she was disappointed lawmakers opted not to provide funding for bear-resistant trash cans and a more robust public awareness campaign to encourage people to take steps to avoid attracting bears as part of the legislation.
“That would have been the best outcome, but we’re happy that they’re not moving forward with hunting,” she said.
After announcing their revisions to the bill Friday, members of the Environment Committee voted 27-6 to advance the legislation to the Senate. All six opposing votes came from Democrats.
One of those voting no, state Rep. Mary Mushinsky, D-Wallingford, said the bill still did not do enough to find non-lethal solutions for dealing with bears that forage on crops, such as using packs of specially trained dogs to harass bears away from farms.
“We’re basically laying out a buffet for these bears and then we’re kind of shocked when they show up and eat it,” Mushinsky said.
Other lawmakers lamented the decision to back off of a hunt, which they noted had the support of DEEP and Gov. Ned Lamont.
“We constantly find ways to negate a real bear management plan,” said state Rep. Karen Reddington-Hughes, R-Woodbury. “For the record, the bill was not about a trophy hunt… it was about public safety that is presently in danger because of our inaction.”
The last time legislation was seriously considered to allow a hunt, in 2023, it was similarly amended by the Environment Committee to remove hunting provisions. Instead, that bill set up a process by which farmers could apply for a permit from DEEP allowing them to kill nuisance animals damaging their crops, livestock or bee hives.
Those rules allowed farmers to kill 15 bears last year, according to DEEP.
But state Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, said the process has moved too slowly for some farmers who find the bears gone by the time they get approval from wildlife officials. Horn helped draft the revisions to S.B. 1523 that would allow farmers to get permission to kill a bear up to a year after it is documented damaging crops if it returns to the same property.
“Bears can destroy acres of crops in a short period of time,” Horn said Friday. “If they have to watch that happen, get a permit, and then come back for the bear, by that time the bear is gone. You’ve lost the crop for the season.”
Hornish said on Friday that the Coalition to Protect Bears has concerns about how farmers will verify whether a bear is the same individual they’ve have problems with in the past. Lawmakers said Friday they will continue to work on the exact language of the bill as it moves forward.

Senate Bill 93 would boost funding for school districts that are currently enrolled in early education programs under the Alaska Reads Act. The bill would increase per-student funding from half funding to the full amount for other students within the state’s public education funding formula. 
The Alaska Reads Act program supports early literacy for pre-K through grade 3 with the aim of improving reading. 
“The concept isn’t new,” said Sen. Löki Tobin, D-Anchorage, the bill’s sponsor, citing a body of research supporting improved lifelong learning outcomes following pre-K programs. “For every dollar we invest in high quality early learning, we see a $32 return on investment in increased earning potential, higher graduation rates, higher engagement and post-secondary opportunities.”
She explained with the outmigration of families and children from Alaska, funding early learning programs would encourage young student enrollment. “Last year, the Legislative Finance Division indicated about 3,700 kids left our public education system in total,” she said. “So what our hope is, is not only to provide districts with full funding to maintain their pre-elementary programs, but also to help balance out that outmigration with incoming students.”
School districts can choose to offer prekindergarten in Alaska, and districts’ enrollment in early learning programs under the Alaska Reads Act is also voluntary. Currently the participating districts are Anchorage, Skagway and Valdez.
The Department of Education estimates the funding increase would cost roughly $7.6 million, already requested in Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s budget proposal for next year, going towards funding the Alaska Reads Act, according to a fiscal note to the bill. 
State Education Commissioner Deena Bishop said that the governor’s budget includes roughly $4.7 million to sustain funding for existing early education programs and $3 million to expand the number of districts with these programs. The Alaska Reads Act planned for annual increases in funding and programs, Bishop said in a text statement through a spokesperson.
“We look forward to all Alaska school districts who desire to serve their communities with pre-schools, can do so,” she said. “The Alaska Reads Act was a transformational piece of legislation. The present bill builds on its success.”
Tobin said the increased funding could also help alleviate child care costs for families. “We know those pre-K kids are in their communities, their parents might be struggling to braid together support for child care, or for babysitting,” she said. “And by not only providing stability for districts to offer these programs, we also are helping them in stabilizing their school population, and also helping families that are looking for child care options that are high quality and available.”
The bill now is set to be heard in the Senate Finance Committee, where Tobin hopes lawmakers support the education investment. “We know it’s not going to have an impact on our budget. And we do know the fiscal notes of the Alaska Reads Act were adopted when the bill was passed in 2022, so it’s not going to have a discernible impact on our current budget projections.”

1/2
— Josh Parsons (@Josh__Parsons) March 26, 2025
The Democratic victory drew national attention as the latest in a string of special election wins across the country. Although it did not change control of the Senate, it reduced Republicans’ majority in the Senate to 27-23.
Ryan Aument, who ran unopposed for the seat in 2022, resigned last year to work for U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick.
Democrats attribute the win, in part, to voters who feel betrayed by what they describe as President Donald Trump’s draconian and tumultuous first months in office.
“Folks are not happy with the chaos that we’re seeing in Washington and are not happy with Parsons,” Malone said, recounting what he heard from voters as he knocked on doors across the district, which President Donald Trump won by more than 15%.
Parsons campaigned on his reputation as a conservative firebrand who defied the state-ordered lockdown during the COVID-19 emergency, an abortion opponent and Trump ally.
But he also drew national attention for his harassment of a reporter at Lancaster Online/LNP and stoking anger over a drag queen story hour at Lancaster Public Library. The library ultimately canceled the event when a bomb threat and suspicious package shut down downtown Lancaster in March 2024.
“A lot of what we heard was they didn’t like his negativity and they didn’t like that he was voting against them,” Malone said.
Efforts to reach Parsons on Wednesday through his campaign’s website, Facebook page and campaign officials were unsuccessful.
A Republican official blamed Parsons’ defeat on a loss of focus after the 2024 election.
“This is a wake up call. We can’t rest on the laurels of last November’s great victories,” Pennsylvania GOP Chairman Greg Rothman said in a post. “We can’t be complacent and we must be unified. We need to keep the intensity of 2024 and fight together for every vote.”
Franklin & Marshall College pollster Berwood Yost said the outcome was both surprising and followed a trend so far in 2025.
“When you have a Republican who loses the district with a 23 point registration advantage, that qualifies as a surprise,” Yost said.
At the same time, Democrats have won five special elections across the country this year, Yost noted. That has a lot to do with the electorate in special elections, when turnout is typically low. In Lancaster county, 29% or about 54,000 registered voters participated.
The emphasis for national Democrats on Tuesday was the special election for the 35th House District in Allegheny County, where the party focused efforts to defend the one-seat majority it won in November. The seat was left empty in January when Rep. Matthew Gergely died after suffering a medical emergency.
Democrat Dan Goughnour won the election with 63.4% of the vote, according to unofficial results.
Special election voters tend to be more tuned-in and have more education, which favors Democrats, Yost said. It also tracks trends following presidential elections, when there is typically a swing toward the party not in the White House or in the majority in Washington.
“When you look back to Trump’s first term, there was a big swing toward Democrats in special elections at that time,” Yost said.
State Rep. Nikki Rivera, D-Lancaster, said Malone was a perfect foil to Parsons, who espoused many positions of the MAGA movement.
As the mayor of East Petersburg, a borough of about 4,500 people a short distance from Lancaster, Malone earned a reputation as a person who leads by example and shows genuine concern and compassion for people.
“He’s known for being personable and connecting with people on all sides of a topic,” Rivera said. “He is truly able to cross party lines to understand and be understood.”
But outside his small community, Malone had “almost no name recognition,” Sexton said. That called for a grassroots effort to introduce him to voters in more than two dozen municipalities.
Iowa inspiration
Sexton said she found inspiration in Iowa Democrat Mike Zimmer’s victory, flipping a state Senate seat in January.
“I reached out to them and said we have to know how you did it,” Sexton said. “They gave us their whole plan.”
Lancaster Democrats enlisted phone banking help from county committees across Pennsylvania and launched a ground game that included “obsessively” tracking mail ballots and dispatching volunteers to retirement communities to follow up with voters, Sexton said.
She said Malone worked hard, meeting voters and attending a League of Women Voters forum that Parsons skipped. Libertarian Zachary Moore of Mount Joy was there too, and won 480 votes, almost exactly the margin by which Parsons lost, Sexton noted.
Sexton said Malone’s campaign spent about $215,000, an amount she estimates is tied with or slightly greater than Parsons’ spending. Campaign finance reports show money continued to flow to the candidates in the final 24 hours of the race.
Parsons’s campaign was supported by GOP activist Scott Presler, who helped turn out Amish voters in the 2024 general election. Presler, who has drawn criticism for his anti-Muslim language, rung early alarm bells about a possible Democratic victory, drawing the attention of billionaire megadonor Elon Musk, Lancaster Online reported this week.
Sexton said Musk’s post came too late to help Parsons’ fundraising. But it reinforced Malone’s message.
“Parsons was really being supported by billionaires and ours was a grassroots campaign and that was really a contrast that resonated with people,” Sexton said.
When Pressler posted on X late Tuesday night lamenting Parsons’ apparent loss, Musk replied with a one word post: “Damn.”

“It is scary to be a college student right now because of the attacks by the Trump administration against DEI, the cutting of funding, and immigrant students being abducted by ICE.

The rally coincided with the elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion offices by the University of Michigan, following new policies from Washington that are affecting DEI offices at universities across the country. It also followed the arrest of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish student at Tufts University, by U.S. Department of Homeland Security agents, one of the last of the nearly dozen international students arrested so far.

Fundamentally, that’s a problem because we need to prioritize diversity and education,” Schaefer emphasized.
In an interview with The State News, MSU president Kevin Guskiewicz emphasized that ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts will remain a priority despite threats from Washington.’ Although vacant positions and building projects could be rethought amid budget riskiness, Guskiewicz said he and his team will analyze the university’s financial situation concerning potential funding cuts.
Jesse Estrada White, 21, a Comparative Cultures and Policies student and member of the Sunrise movement, who, along with four other students, was arrested on Oct. 25, 2024, after a sit-in demonstration inside the Hannah Administration Building as part of a pro-Palestinian action, emphasized the importance of a clear position from MSU.

“Now, the situation isn’t as bad as U of M, but the university has given us nothing so far. They say that all students are safe and welcome on campus, but they haven’t explicitly said anything against Trump’s policies, especially against the abduction of immigrant students. Silence and platitudes, that’s what we got,”Estrada said.
The rally proceeded without major incidents. The protesters remained at the main entrance of the administration building for about an hour, as the sky cleared after the rain.
Posters against the Trump administration, Elon Musk, and fascism, with slogans such as ‘MSU rejects Fascism’ and ‘Student Power,’ were held up, along with chants and screams including “This is what democracy looks like” and “We want divestment now”.
A series of speakers, including student activist leaders, student associations, and members of Sunrise, led the demonstration.
“We are calling on this university to take a stand against state crimes. This university has an active role to play, making sure that students on this campus are safe and that students across the state, and the country are safe as well,” Estrada said.

“We fight fascism,” all the participants shouted together as the rally concluded.
“This rally is just a step, a step in the right direction. Even though they ignored us before, we’ll keep demanding the university authorities to talk to us”, said Omar Anasara, 19, Philosophy student and member of Students for Justice in Palestine at MSU.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA, Kan. — The bullhorn-powered war of words between satanists and Catholics boiled over into brawling and a handful of arrests Friday during an extraordinary event at the Kansas Capitol that pushed boundaries of free speech and the separation of church and state.
After about two hours of speeches, prayers and sign waving among hundreds of people mostly segregated by barricades staffed by law enforcement officers, Satanic Grotto president Michael Stewart, with supporters and reporters in tow, entering the Statehouse to conduct what he had described as a black mass. He was warned at the door to the visitors’ center that any formal protest inside the building that violated a permit limiting his religious expression to the lawn or steps of the Capitol would result in his arrest for trespassing.


In the rotunda, Stewart began delivering the rebellious alternative mass and was interrupted by three people intent on stopping what could be interpreted as a mockery of their faith. An unidentified man and woman, with young kids at their side, physically intervened to interrupt Stewart. He spun away from them. Counter-protester Marcus Schroeder joined the fray and twice reached to rip papers from Stewart’s hand. Stewart responded by punching Schroeder in the face twice. More than half a dozen Capitol Police wrestled Stewart to the floor to make the arrest.
“I’m not resisting. I’m not resisting. I’m not resisting,” Stewart repeatedly yelled.
Schroeder, who wore a shirt declaring “death is not welcome here,” wasn’t arrested by Capitol Police. In an interview, he defended his intervention to thwart Stewart.
“He was trying to give a satanic chant. I tried to take his paper out of his hand and he punched me twice in the face,” Schroeder said.

After the area cleared, two other satanists tried to pick up where Stewart left off and were taken into custody. One other person was cuffed and led away by law enforcement outside the Capitol. An individual had grabbed Stewart by the legs in a bid to stop Stewart from stomping on crackers intended to represent those used in a Catholic mass. In that brief exchange, Stewart also punched the guy before law enforcement ended the fracas.
“He was was trying to tackle me to get to the cracker underneath,” Stewart said. “I was able to kind of fend him off. I do think he may have picked up the crumbled cracker and ate it. Did I get physical with him? Yes.”
  Hundreds of Christians upset with an organization’s plan to conduct a satanic black mass at the Kansas Capitol delivered a robust counter-protest to emphasize their disdain for followers of Satanic Grotto. Both sides of the debate used bullhorns to punctuate their messages, creating a blended sound that was difficult for anybody to hear clearly. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)
The opposition
The colorful display of affection and affliction for organized religion culminated attempts by Gov. Laura Kelly, Attorney General Kris Kobach, leaders of the Kansas Legislature and Archbishop Joseph Naumann of Kansas City, Kansas, to restrain or derail the demonstration planned by Satanic Grotto.
Kelly had the group’s permit amended so no protest could transpire inside the Capitol. Legislative leaders modified policy regarding use of the Capitol to target Satanic Grotto. Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Wichita, said the First Amendment didn’t protect offensive speech or violations of law.
Francis Slobodnik, a Topeka representative of the American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property, told hundreds of Catholics gathered on the south side of the Capitol that public officials shouldn’t have allowed satanists to assemble on public property. He said the process showed a misguided understanding of freedom of speech and religion and a lack of appreciation for how a black mass represented worship of Satan.
“Today’s horrific event, the first of its kind in the history of Kansas, is a sacrilege,” said Slobodnik, who urged people to engage in a peaceful rally. “Of course, there have been terrible crimes and injustices that have happened in our state over the years. However, nothing in our past compares with what is happening today where God is being directly challenged on the state Capitol grounds. The state Capitol represents all of us.”
He praised people at the rally who were standing in opposition to Satanic Grotto, and referred to them as the Navy Seals of the Catholic faith. He said these activists were willing to confront God’s enemies head-on as if on a field of battle. He said the great sin perpetrated by Stewart and other worshipers of Satan meant that others had to step into the void.
“Satanists do not realize that Satan hates all of God’s creation, including them,” Slobodnik said. “Their reward for worshiping and serving him will be eternal fire.”
  Cure Church member Daniel Casteel, center with megaphone, was among Christians who used amplified equipment Friday, March 28, 2025, at the Kansas Capitol to broadcast invitations for people to renounce Satan and welcome Jesus into their lives. He proclaimed to his target audience across a law enforcement barrier: “Any time you’re ready, you can step this way. We will make sure you get saved.” (Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)
And, an exorcist
Former U.S. Rep. Tim Huelskamp, who served in the Kansas Senate before elected to Congress, said he consulted with a priest with experience in exorcism when considering whether to participate in a television interview with Stewart.
“Father had a simple question: ‘Why would you do this? What do you hope to gain?’ I stumbled around in my answer,” Huelskamp said. “I wanted to share the truth about Christ. The truth about the Eucharist. His summary response was quite stunning to me. He said, ‘There is no good that could come from being in the same room with a satanist.’”
Huelskamp said it was suggested his participation in the interview with Stewart might advance the interests of Satan. The former Republican congressman woke ill the next day, and cancelled the interview. In the end, Huelskamp said he decided it was important to run to the fire created by Satan rather than shrink from it. He said it was the same as making his views known about the evil of abortion or defending the sanctity of marriage between a man and woman.
“I am quite stubborn and hardheaded,” he said. “We cannot be silent. We are required, if we call ourselves Christians, if we call ourselves Catholic, we are publicly required to defend the faith and to stand up for the truth.”
In an interview amid calm before the storm of his arrest, Stewart said he was convinced Catholics assembled around him didn’t understand why Satanic Grotto was at the Capitol to talk about religious oppression.
“What we only want is the rights that every American has,” Stewart said. “I’ve heard people say we’re setting a precedent. Well, if the precedent is freedom of religion for everyone in public spaces, yes, that’s what we’re trying to establish. We are dragging this issue out in the light and we’ll let the people look at it. The issue is that we’re not all being treated the same here.”
  Mike Trapp, of Leavenworth, Kansas, said he took part in rallies outside the State Capitol on Friday, March 28. 2025, to express his view that government needed to respect the constitutional mandate of a formal separation between church and state. He said the rise of Christian nationalists represented the greatest threat to democracy. (Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)
Other voices in crowd
Eudora resident John More, a Christian who carried a call-to-heaven New England pine tree flag, said he was motivated to attend because he viewed the satanists’ criticism of Catholics as an assault on religion in general. He joined with Julie Britschge of Burlingame for a “Jericho Walk,” or prayer walk, by circling the statehouse grounds seven times. Britschge said the walk was patterned after the biblical story of the Israelites’ march aimed at bringing about spiritual change.
“We’re hoping that whatever evil there is today, that He will take care of it,” More said. “I was just planning to add a measure of divine protection.”
Daniel Casteel and Shawn Velasquez, both with the Cure Church, made their views heard with the aid of megaphones. They prowled the security-line perimeter sharing perspectives on religion before taking part in back-and-forth exchanges across the barrier with supporters of Satanic Grotto.
“Jesus loves you,” Casteel bellowed. “Any time you’re ready, you can step this way. We will make sure you get saved. Come give your life to Jesus, please. Break the stronghold.”
In an interview, Velasquez and Casteel said their intent was to convince one or two satanic worshipers to find solace in God.
“They’re just misguided and uninformed,” Velasquez said. “They’re worshiping a false god.”
On the other side of that line, Mike Trapp of Leavenworth quietly held a sign that emphasized his belief the United States was best served by adhering to the constitutional principle of a formal separation between church and state.
“We wouldn’t be standing here today if there weren’t Christians flaunting their religion in the Capitol,” said Trapp, who considered the rise of Christian nationalism to be “the biggest threat to democracy.”
Wichita residents Kyle Francis and Sam McCrory, who were armed with a gun, flag and a collection of religious symbols, said they were present to stand up for Christ.
“Any time that people who oppose Christ show their head, you know, they should be opposed publicly,” McCrory said.
He said separation of church and state was originally the product of a homogenous Christian population. Satanists and others who diluted that national unity often used constitutional freedoms as a weapon against well-meaning people, he said.
“These sorts of things need to be brutally tamped down,” McCrory said. “Let’s set an example. I think that the United States should be an explicitly Christian nation. If you want to be something other than Christian, I think that’s fine, to an extent. I think they (non-Christians) should have to pay an extra tax.”

The firing squad chair (left) was added following a 2021 state law that made death by firing squad an option. The electric chair is under the cover. (Provided by the S.C. Department of Corrections)COLUMBIA — Death row inmate Mikal Mahdi chose to die by firing squad, making him the second person in the state to do so since executions resumed, his attorneys said Friday.
Mahdi, 42, was sentenced to death in 2006 for shooting and killing off-duty police officer James Myers with his own rifle as part of a multi-state crime spree. The only remaining man on death row with no remaining appeals, Mahdi is scheduled to die at 6 p.m. April 11.
Brad Sigmon, executed March 7, was the first inmate in the state to die by firing squad, which legislators made an option in 2021. The three other inmates executed since September selected lethal injection.
By law, death row inmates have until two weeks before their execution date to choose whether they will die by firing squad, lethal injection or electrocution, which legislators made the default method in 2021. Mahdi chose “the lesser of three evils,” his attorney, David Weiss, said in a statement Friday.
“Mikal chose the firing squad instead of being burned and mutilated in the electric chair, or suffering a lingering death on the lethal injection gurney,” Weiss said.
SC inmate executed by firing squad, a first nationwide since 2010

Legislators added firing squad as an option after years of struggling to get the drugs used for lethal injection. Inmates challenged the method, as well as electrocution, arguing it violated the constitutional right to avoid cruel and unusual punishment.
The state Supreme Court ruled last year that firing squad and electrocution were constitutional methods of execution, allowing the process to resume after a 13-year hiatus. By that point, lethal injection was again an option, after Department of Corrections officials were able to restock their supply thanks to a law keeping everything about the drugs and the companies selling them a secret.
Inmates have challenged that secrecy law, arguing inmates have a right to know more about the drugs that would kill them. But the state Supreme Court and a federal judge have both turned down those arguments, ruling officials have disclosed everything the law requires for an inmate to make his choice.
Barring intervention from a court or the governor, Mahdi would become the fifth in the nation to be executed by firing squad, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Other than Sigmon, the remaining three took place in Utah, which last conducted a firing squad execution in 2010. Utah’s next death row inmate in line for execution, Ralph Menzies, also faces a firing squad, pending the outcome of his competency appeal.
Mahdi will be strapped to a chair, facing three rectangular openings 15 feet away. Three firing squad members will shoot through those openings, using .308 Winchester bullets, which expand and fragment on impact, causing a more instantaneous death, corrections officials have said previously.
“Before Mikal committed these tragic murders, he was a child in desperate need of care and support,” Weiss said in a statement. “We will continue to fight for the child Mikal was and the man he is today. Executing Mikal on this record would ignore the many ways we failed him in favor of one final injustice.”
Mikal Mahdi
On July 14, 2004, in his hometown of Lawrenceville, Virginia, Mahdi stole a car and a gun before fleeing south. Stopping in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Mahdi shot gas station clerk Christopher Boggs point-blank in the head while Boggs was verifying his ID to buy a beer, according to court documents.
Mahdi continued on to South Carolina, where he carjacked a man in Columbia and drove to Calhoun County. He stopped at a gas station, where a clerk seemed to grow suspicious after the gas pump declined his card. Mahdi fled on foot to a nearby farmhouse, where he hid out in Myers’ workshop.
When Myers, a captain for the Orangeburg Department of Public Safety, returned home at the end of the day, Mahdi shot him nine times with one of the rifles Myers kept there, according to court documents.
Mahdi lit Myers’ body on fire and stole his police truck, which he continued driving south. Police arrested Mahdi in Satellite Beach, Florida, on July 21, 2004, a week after he stole the first car.
Mahdi pleaded guilty to the crimes in 2006, at which point Judge Clifton Newman sentenced him to death.
SC death row inmate’s attorneys ask court to halt execution over traumatic childhood

Mahdi’s attorneys have asked the state Supreme Court to halt his execution, claiming a traumatic childhood influenced his development and led him to a life of crime.
Mahdi’s original defense attorneys hardly touched on his past, which could have convinced Newman to sentence him to life in prison instead of death, Mahdi’s current attorneys argued in court filings.
As a child, Mahdi struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts, his attorneys claimed. He entered the juvenile justice system at age 14 for committing property crimes and spent most of his life in jails after that point, often in solitary confinement, his attorneys said.
Mahdi had been out of jail for about two months when he committed the crimes that landed him on death row.
“When we think of Mikal choosing his method of execution, we’re reminded of the tormented child who, at nine years old, told his teacher that he wanted to shoot himself. Or, on another occasion, to electrocute himself. Or, another time, to hang himself,” Weiss said in a statement Friday.
But Mahdi’s attorneys didn’t show anything the court hasn’t already considered and dismissed during the appeals process, the Attorney General’s Office responded in a filing this week. Mahdi’s difficult childhood and the impact it may have had on him have no legal bearing on his crime, the attorneys continued.
The state Supreme Court has not yet given a decision on the arguments.
The state’s highest court, as well as the U.S. Supreme Court, has yet to rule in favor of stopping a South Carolina inmate’s execution in the past six months. Mahdi can also appeal to Gov. Henry McMaster for clemency, which no governor has granted in the modern era.

Great Lakes Day is an annual summit where politicians and officials of all stripes gather in Washington, D.C., to demonstrate their commitment to the region home to the largest freshwater ecosystem on the planet. For years, leaders from the United States and Canada have met at the event without incident. But earlier this month and amid a tariff dispute between the two nations, the Trump administration abruptly disinvited two Canadian mayors from the long-standing White House meeting.
The last-minute exclusion of Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante and St. Catharines Mayor Mat Siscoe came just 48 hours before the event due to “diplomatic protocols,” according to Christine Maydossian, a spokesperson for the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Initiative, which coordinates the meeting and submitted the names of the two Canadian mayors and one American to White House officials a month earlier.
Neither Canadian mayor responded to a request for comment.
Since taking office in January, President Donald Trump and his administration has repeatedly stoked tensions with Canada, once considered the United States’ closest ally. Along with trade and tariffs, this strife has also raised questions about how the region’s water resources will be managed. Amid the escalating political tensions, some Great Lakes advocates worry the diplomatic snub is a warning sign that one of the world’s most successful examples of water-sharing could become collateral damage in a geopolitical rift.
“We are worried that maybe behind all this is the idea that a country one day will be able to take water out of the Great Lakes and manage water not as an ecosystem that needs to be preserved in its watershed, but as a resource, as a commodity,” said Jérôme Marty, speaking as the director of the International Association for Great Lakes Research.
The New York Times reported earlier this month that in calls with then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Trump had “mentioned revisiting the sharing of lakes and rivers between the two nations.”
“President Trump has made clear the need for Canada to stop ripping off the United States on trade. President Trump will explore any and all actions that put the interests of America first,” said Brian Hughes, a spokesperson with the National Security Council, in an emailed statement to Grist. (The White House did not respond directly to Grist’s questions about cooperation between the two countries concerning the Great Lakes.)
For over a century, the United States and Canada have worked in tandem to manage four of the five Great Lakes that straddle both countries: Superior, Huron, Erie, and Ontario. That cooperative arrangement — with which the countries settle everything from water use to navigation to invasive species to pollution — may now be on the line.
“We cannot let this be sacrificed,” said Rachel Havrelock, a professor at the University of Illinois Chicago who directs the Freshwater Lab, an environmental research initiative focused on the Great Lakes and environmental justice.
“This is the most stable, productive, and mutually beneficial form of binational water governance on Earth,” she added.
The lakes provide drinking water for more than 30 million people spread across both sides of the border. The U.S. and Canada, then under British rule, signed the Boundary Waters Treaty in 1909, a highly-praised water sharing agreement that formed the International Joint Commission, or IJC, a binational organization that aims to prevent and resolve disputes over shared lakes and rivers.
(The arrangements between the two countries long sidelined Indigenous nations, some of which the U.S.-Canada border artificially bisected. For example, the IJC did not invite Indigenous representatives to participate until the 1980s, despite the sovereign rights of those nations. Indigenous communities often face disproportionate impacts from pollution and climate change, and recent IJC assessments have acknowledged that strengthening relationships with Indigenous governments is key to improving its response to those threats.)
The relationship was further cemented by the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, established in 1955, which coordinates how invasive species and fisheries are managed, and again by the 1972 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, which committed the two nations to “restore and maintain” the health of the lakes.
Those are just three among a layered patchwork of treaties and other agreements between local, state, federal, and tribal governments that determine Great Lakes management. Some don’t necessarily rely on federal involvement, such as the Great Lakes Agreement and Compact, which protects the water from being shipped to other states and regions.
Trump has cast doubt on the stability of these agreements by breaking a series of diplomatic taboos, including calling Canada the “51st state” and halting negotiations on the Columbia River Treaty, after referring to the British Columbia river as a “large faucet” that could be used to solve California’s water crisis last year.
Policy experts say Trump’s recent tack raises a red flag for the future of the Great Lakes.
“The water and the resources don’t recognize international boundaries,” said Mike Shriberg, a faculty member at the University of Michigan who specializes in Great Lakes policy. “You can’t manage things like invasive species from only one country and not the other. You can’t manage harmful algal blooms from one country or the other. The information on the flow of ice and what that means for shipping has to be shared across borders.”
Shriberg said the Trump administration’s funding freeze and staffing cuts related to management of the lakes are impacting how the U.S. will protect them and meet its obligations with Canada — concerns that prompted him to write an op-ed making the case for politicians to unify to protect the Great Lakes.
Some areas have shown signs of revival; the Great Lakes Fishery Commission’s sea lamprey program can begin rehiring U.S. federal workers to control the invasive species, which can wreak havoc on other fish. That means the program will move forward, albeit weeks behind schedule.
But other threats are visible, according to Shriberg: There are more bureaucratic roadblocks to federal scientists working with their Canadian counterparts on everything from harmful algal blooms to flooding — work he said had until this point been “seamless.”
“It’s often not happening because of the chaos within the agencies that’s being caused by all the cutbacks,” Shriberg said.
Those cutbacks have reached the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, which has been rocked by staffing upheavals, with a fifth of their employees reportedly retiring, resigning, fired, or on leave, including the communications team.
“You’re already seeing a breakdown in capacity to do the basic work that we need to protect the lakes,” he said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greatlakescanadaIMG_9122-1024x576.webp,,,2025-03-29 08:03:23.325072
