(Photo by Brent Stirton/Getty Images)Their cases were different. One faced a four-year prison sentence in a $675 million fraud case for marketing an electric truck that wasn’t drivable. Another tried to overthrow the government. A tax cheat avoided prison and $4.4 million in restitution after his mom donated $1 million to the president.
Their cases have two things in common. President Donald Trump pardoned them all in the early months of his second administration. And those pardons violated long-standing Department of Justice policies that reward people who show remorse, pay restitution and can contribute to society. Since returning to the White House, Trump has pardoned more than 1,600 people and at least two corporations in his first six months in office. Many of those pardons have violated standards designed to ensure fairness and to protect the public, attorneys and legal experts say.

This story is part of “Trump Two: Six Months In,” a Marshall Project series taking stock of the administration’s efforts to reshape immigration enforcement and criminal justice.

The changes began immediately. Hours after taking the oath of office, Trump pardoned more than 1,500 rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. That included men who used bear spray, bats, batons and poles to assault police officers.
Past presidents have issued controversial pardons, usually in their last days in office: Bill Clinton pardoned financier Marc Rich, Joe Biden pardoned his son Hunter despite promising not to, and George H.W. Bush pardoned six prominent officials for their roles in the Iran-Contra scandal.
But legal experts say no president has started a term with so many pardons that violate long-standing policies and norms.
Lee Kovarsky, a University of Texas law professor, describes Trump’s Jan. 6 action as “patronage pardoning” — highly publicized actions that send the message that Trump will protect allies who break the law to advance his agenda. “It’s mafia stuff,” Kovarsky said. “They won’t break your legs, but they’ll publicly pardon the person who does.”
Article II of the Constitution gives the president the power to pardon anyone for federal crimes. The Supreme Court’s 2024 decision about presidential immunity made it clear that the president has broad leeway when exercising core powers of the office.
“The Supreme Court decision makes it hard to even get a grasp on just how blatantly corrupt presidential conduct would have to be to overcome immunity,” said Brandon Garrett, a Duke University law professor.
In her dissent in the immunity case, Justice Sonia Sotomayor specifically cited pardons when listing crimes that future presidents could commit without consequences. “Orders the Navy’s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune.”
The Justice Department has housed the Pardon Attorney since 1894. Over the years, the practice of processing applications for pardons and commutations has been codified in the Justice Manual, which lays out how clemency is supposed to be administered.
One of the two main purposes of the Justice Manual is to ensure that all applications are judged by the same set of rules regardless of who you are or who you know, said Liz Oyer, who served as Pardon Attorney for three years. The second is to “ensure that it is granted to people who are truly deserving of a second chance and who will not present a danger to the community in the future.”

In March, actor Mel Gibson, a friend of Trump, sought to have his criminal record cleaned up so he could own a gun again. Oyer declined to recommend a pardon due to Gibson’s history of violence against women. She was fired several hours later, with no reason given. She is suing to get her job back.
The Justice Department issued a statement saying that it follows the Justice Manual in reviewing pardon applications and making recommendations.
One of the pardon office’s first tasks is to seek input from the people with a stake in the conviction: prosecutors, sentencing judges and crime victims. The office can request an FBI background check. The Jan. 6 pardons were announced hours after inauguration, so no input was solicited in the 1,500 cases.
Among the people Trump pardoned for Jan. 6 was David Daniel of Mint Hill, North Carolina. Had the rules been followed, the pardon office would have learned that Daniel faces charges of child pornography and the sexual assault of a preadolescent girl.
In serious crimes — violence or expensive white collar crime, for example — the Justice Manual recommends that a suitable length of time should elapse before a pardon is even considered to avoid denigrating the seriousness of the offense.
That stipulation didn’t apply to Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the Oath Keepers — a far-right anti-government militia — who was sentenced to 18 years for trying to overthrow the government. He served less than two years before Trump commuted his sentence to time served. Trump has also pardoned at least nine people before or shortly after they reported to prison, including one person before sentencing.
Another important policy in the Justice Manual on pardons is whether the person has accepted responsibility and is remorseful: “A petitioner should be genuinely desirous of forgiveness rather than vindication.”
Trump pardoned Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys and an architect of the attack on the Capitol, who had been sentenced to 22 years. Afterward, Tarrio and other Proud Boys sued the Justice Department for $100 million, claiming they were the victims of wrongful prosecution.
Another important condition for a pardon is restitution: Have the pardon seekers paid money to make their crime victims whole?
This brings up what Kovarsky, the Texas law professor, calls the “open for business pardon,” in which Trump grants pardons to people who have politically supported him or who may owe large sums in restitution.
A jury convicted Trevor Milton, the founder of electric truck startup Nikola, on fraud charges; a judge sentenced him to four years in prison. He notably had made a video in which a prototype truck that appeared to be driving down a highway was actually a nonfunctioning truck rolling down an incline.
In October, Milton and his wife each donated $900,000 to Trump political committees. In March, federal prosecutors urged the trial judge to order Milton to pay $675 million in restitution. Two weeks later, shortly before Milton was to report to federal prison, Trump granted him a pardon that eliminated his prison sentence and wiped away his restitution to the victims of his fraud.
Milton has maintained that he is innocent, that he was the victim of dishonest Biden administration prosecutors, and that his political contributions had nothing to do with the pardon. He said he donated to Trump out of opposition to Biden’s economic policy. “I just wanted some fiscal responsibility,” he told a Phoenix TV reporter.
In late 2024, Paul Walczak, a Florida nursing home executive, was sentenced to 18 months in prison and ordered to pay $4.4 million in restitution for stealing his employees’ tax payments. Just three weeks after Walczak’s mother attended a $1 million-a-head fundraiser for Trump at Mar-a-Lago, the president pardoned Walczak, wiping out the prison term and restitution.
Trump’s pardons have proved costly for taxpayers and crime victims. Besides the group pardons of Jan. 6 defendants and anti-abortion protestors, the president has pardoned 46 individuals. Of those, more than half have been freed of fines and restitution.
Oyer, the former pardon attorney, has set up a “pardon tracker” on her website that tallies the price of Trump’s pardons of people and companies that owed restitution and fines. As of July 23, the cost to taxpayers and crime victims is more than $1.3 billion.
Oyer’s tracker also shows a growing backlog of pardon applications from ordinary Americans. The queue was just under 5,000 when Trump entered office. The count on July 15 had more than doubled, to 11,664.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)Members of a task force aiming to reduce the property tax burden for South Dakota homeowners are considering proposals to reduce or replace property taxes by relying on sales or transaction taxes.
The task force dug into two proposals and heard a new idea from a former lawmaker at its latest meeting in Rapid City earlier this month. The Legislative Research Council also prepared other options to reduce or replace property taxes.
“It takes a lot of courage to try and digest all of this,” said task force member and state House Majority Leader Scott Odenbach, R-Spearfish. “For too long, because it’s such a beast, people have had trouble getting their hands around property taxes, what they fund, and increased spending, until people get forced out of their homes.”

The Comprehensive Property Tax Task Force aims to recommend ways to cut the average South Dakota homeowner’s property taxes by at least 50%. Lawmakers already adopted Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden’s proposal earlier this year to slow property tax increases with multifaceted reforms including a five-year, countywide 3% cap on growth in owner-occupied home assessments.
Property taxes go to schools, counties, cities and other local taxing entities, such as water and fire districts. Sales taxes go to cities and the state. The state does not receive any property tax revenue.
The total, statewide amount of property taxes paid on owner-occupied homes grew by 64% from 2017 to 2024, according to state Department of Revenue data. A public outcry about rising tax bills led legislators to appoint the summer task force, which aims to propose legislation for the annual winter lawmaking session.
The task force has heard public comment not only in Rapid City but also in Sioux Falls and plans to meet three more times, including in Aberdeen and Pierre.
“I think we’re at a point where we need to start coalescing ideas and presenting them,” said the chairman of the task force, state Senate President Pro Tempore Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls.
Task force hears new proposal
The newest proposal pitched to the task force this month would add a flat $1.50 tax on transactions of $15 or greater, and add a tax of 10% on smaller transactions. The new tax, said former state Sen. Julie Frye-Mueller, R-Rapid City, would replace property taxes entirely by generating $1.75 billion in revenue.
“Our ultimate goal is to remove the threat of government or others from taking our properties with a tax lien,” Frye-Mueller said.
A tax lien is a legal claim that local governments can place on a home when property taxes are delinquent. It triggers a process that can ultimately lead to the seizure and sale of the property.

The transaction taxes would be added on top of the state’s current sales tax structure, which includes the state 4.2% sales tax, up to 2% city sales taxes, and up to 1% additional city taxes on alcohol, restaurants, event admissions and lodging. 
With all of those rates applied, the current tax on a $15 purchase would be $1.08. With the additional flat transaction tax, it would grow to $2.58.
Frye-Mueller said the transaction taxes would also be applied to purchases that are currently exempt from sales taxes. She and other speakers said it would not be regressive since property taxes would no longer exist or be figured into monthly rental amounts.
The proposal uses a calculation relying on visitor spending from 15 million people, which made some lawmakers skeptical. The state Department of Revenue would collect the tax and distribute it among local governments, based on their budgeting needs, according to the presentation. The proposal would allow the Legislature to increase the flat rate by up to a nickel each year.
The group backing the proposal, Abolish Property Taxes South Dakota, plans to ask legislators to put the plan on the ballot for voters to consider. If that fails, they plan to submit it as a citizen-initiated ballot measure for the November 2026 election.
More details on governor’s proposal
Gov. Rhoden has proposed an optional county-level sales tax of a half-percent to offset participating counties’ property taxes on owner-occupied homes. A “homeowner tax credit” would be applied to property taxes from the revenue generated from the half-percent sales tax, according to proposal documents. A homeowner’s tax bill would show the amount of tax credits applied to the property.
If funds from the optional sales tax fully offset owner-occupied property taxes in a county, remaining funds would be used to lower property taxes for agricultural and commercial properties. The tax relief option could be referred to a public vote if residents don’t agree with their local county commission’s decision to impose it.
Some lawmakers worried that the sales tax idea would shift the tax burden from property to sales and South Dakotans wouldn’t see an overall reduction in taxes they pay. Bureau of Finance and Management Commissioner Jim Terwilliger and Sen. Randy Deibert, R-Spearfish, said homeowners would save money.
“I’d have to spend $50,000 before I matched my local county taxation with a 0.5% sales tax,” Deibert said. “That’s just in my district.”

Statewide, a half-percent sales tax would replace, on average, 94% of a county’s share of owner-occupied property taxes, according to estimates from the governor’s administration. The proposal would not affect the property taxes received by cities, schools and other local taxing entities.
In Minnehaha County, the half-percent sales tax would cover an estimated 98% of owner-occupied property taxes. The strategy would cover an estimated 76% in Pennington County.
Counties that share jurisdiction with tribal land would see the largest potential increase in funds to offset property taxes, largely because tribal land is not subject to property taxes. The counties that would see the lowest benefit, based on the estimates, would be Turner, Clay and Meade counties at 48%, 52% and 56% of owner-occupied taxes, respectively.
LRC studies other options
In a white paper prepared by the Legislative Research Council, eliminating the county portion of owner-occupied taxes would, on average, reduce homeowners’ property taxes by 20%.
South Dakota schools rely on three education levies collected through property taxes: general education, special education and capital outlay. Eliminating the special education and general education levies would reduce average owner-occupied property taxes by 25%.
Eliminating two education and the county levies would cost $430.8 million to counties and schools, unless the loss is replaced with different revenue sources.
The white sheet explored different ways to replace property taxes wholly or in part by increasing local governments’ other revenues or capturing more state funding for local use, including cutting state government across the board, raising sales tax rates, increasing the contractor’s excise tax rate, redirecting a portion of Future Fund economic development dollars toward property tax relief, increasing the state’s share of video lottery revenue, removing some sales tax and property tax exemptions, and placing a new tax on vaping. Each proposal would put some or all of the savings or gains toward local governments for property tax reductions.

The research also dug into a tax that state Senate Majority Leader Jim Mehlhaff proposed at a prior meeting. Mehlhaff, R-Pierre, proposed an additional 1% tax on all sales in the state including currently exempt sales, except for items intended for resale and items that, constitutionally, cannot be taxed. 
Originally, the proposal was thought to be able to replace education property taxes paid across all types of property, which was $928.6 million in 2023. Owner-occupied property taxes paid for $382.4 million that year. Based on the latest LRC estimate, the tax would generate about $698 million in revenue for education.
Odenbach, who chairs the task force’s school funding work group, said the revenue replacement would have to be “iron clad” and not allow local governments to increase budgets through property taxes later. He added that some exemptions in the state tax code could be repealed and cuts could be made across state government, among other things, to raise money that could be applied to reduce property taxes for South Dakotans.
“I think these things are all in the mix,” Odenbach said.
South Dakota homeowners paid about $792 million in owner-occupied property taxes in 2024. South Dakotans across all types of property paid nearly $1.8 billion in property taxes.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_2702-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 10:56:20.335256

(Photo by Cressandra Thibodeaux, with the background artificially expanded by Source for publication purposes).On July 29, New Mexico legislators on the interim Science, Technology & Telecommunications Committee are slated to meet in Los Alamos and hear testimony on “responsible artificial intelligence” from several experts, including Santa Fe Institute Professor Cris Moore.
A computer scientist, Moore’s interest in AI dates to at least 2016, when he noted an uptick in discussion about its rising use. Computer scientists, civil rights advocates, legal scholars and others were concerned about using algorithms to make decisions in the criminal justice system, he says, but also about their rising use for myriad “consequential decisions, things that really affect people’s fundamental rights, their lives, their livelihoods, their opportunities: hiring, loans, leases, home-buying and so-on.”
Moore had initially thought he’d contribute to that discourse as an academic, but conversations with State Sen. Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) connected Moore to the late state Supreme Court Judge Charles Daniels, who in turn put him in touch with New Mexico’s Administrative Office of the Courts. From there, Moore worked with the University of New Mexico’s Institute for Social Research to evaluate an algorithmic criminal justice assessment tool used widely in the state. That led to data-driven work published in 2022 assessing the potential outcome of ongoing proposals to expand pretrial detention. That research found those proposals would lead to a very high percentage of defendants being unnecessarily and unfairly detained.
In an interview with Source, Moore said decision makers and society need to consider both sides when thinking about the use of algorithmic tools in criminal justice.
“We need to think about the false positives — where we think that someone is dangerous even though they’re not — and we detain them, and the false negatives, where we release somebody, and then they do something really serious.”
As he’s worked on these issues, Moore said, he’s learned “just how complicated the system is, and the stakes of the debate…This started out as a question about mathematics and statistics, and it’s turned much more into a question about human beings and human systems, including the judicial system. How should the systems be run, and what does it mean for those systems to be fair? What does it mean for those systems to be transparent?
This week’s AI legislative hearing comes amid ongoing government discussion of AI, near and far. In May, New Mexico’s Public Education Department published its AI guidance for K-12 education. Last week, the Trump administration released its AI “action plan.”
The following interview has been edited for concision and clarity.
 
You delivered a presentation to lawmakers five years ago and listed four questions to help evaluate the fairness and transparency of AI. Does that list still hold? [The list, summarized: How does the algorithm work? Can we validate its performance independently? When should humans be in that process? And what does the data really mean?]
Cristopher Moore: Often now, what I lead with is: ‘What data does the algorithm use?’ Because that already raises a lot of issues. Is it using my social media? Does it know I’ve applied for a job? For an apartment? That gets into lots of questions, including privacy. I think I would like to know something about what it does with this data, which, in some cases, gets into more technical questions about its inner workings. And yes, I would like to know, ‘Hey, does this thing actually work?’ Has any independent entity tested the vendors’ claims?’ There are a lot of AI systems out there being used to make important decisions, or to advise human decision-makers about important decisions, that have never been independently tested by anybody— we’re just relying on the vendors’ claims, and I think that’s a pretty dangerous situation.
The good thing about AI is we can measure it and observe it and get a clear sense of what mistakes it makes. But again, that’s something vendors are not incentivized to advertise.
What do you plan to tell state lawmakers?
There are things that state legislatures can do to try to ensure that AI is used properly, that it is accountable, and that it has some degree of transparency. I’m not against AI, but I am against opaque systems that their users and the people affected by them don’t understand; [whose] vendors are not willing to open up and tell you how they work; and where they haven’t even been independently tested by anybody. 
I think it’s appropriate for state legislatures — and a lot of them are doing this — to draw some guardrails and to say, ‘Well, you know, if you’re going to make these so called consequential decisions about people, then you should be open to having some independent studies done.’ Or at the very least: You should make people aware that they’re interacting with an AI. One of the things that it would make sense to ask for is just disclosure. If you’re going to apply for a job, and the company you’re applying to is going to use an AI to screen the job applicants — maybe you’re applying for a job with particular skills and maybe they will use an AI to read your resume to try to certify you have those skills — at least let the applicant know that’s happening. That’s the least, to me, that’s the floor: Don’t hide the fact that an AI is being used to make a decision about you.
President Trump’s new AI ‘action plan’ intimates that states with burdensome AI regulation could lose out on federal funding. Is it worth it for New Mexico to lose funding to create those guardrails?
Well, of course, I’m strongly against that policy. You probably know that in the Big Beautiful Bill, [Republican Texas U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz] had proposed a 10-year moratorium on state AI laws and, after some back and forth with [Republican Tennessee U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn], that moratorium was removed by a 99-to-one vote. So I think the good news is: This is not a partisan issue, at least not yet. I’m worried that it’s becoming partisan, but it shouldn’t be partisan. In fact, some of the model laws we’re looking at come from Utah. Utah put together an AI policy office. A friend of mine works there, and one of the things that they were tasked to do is develop guidelines for mental health chat bots. So, it’s like: ‘We have a hideous shortage of mental health providers; Is this maybe a good kind of frontline thing to help people?’ Some people are like, ‘Yeah, that’s a great idea.’ And some people are like, ‘Oh, my god no.’ But it seems clear that if these things are going to be used, they should make it absolutely clear to the patient that they were talking to an AI and not to a human. And moreover, the AI should look out for things where [it will say]: ‘OK, this is above my pay grade. You really need to talk to a human about this.’
Trump’s AI Action Plan removes ‘red tape’ for AI developers and data centers, punishes states that act alone

Colorado’s law is considered one of the most comprehensive and requires developers to disclose information about their AI systems as well as its potential risks of discrimination. Would New Mexico benefit from a similar law?
Our House Bill 60 in the last session was inspired by the Colorado law, and the Colorado law is still on the books, although some people tried to get rid of it in their last legislative session. I think there are things we could do to make that kind of bill better. One of the objections to the Colorado law is that it puts some responsibility on the developers of these tools, but it also puts a lot of responsibility on the deployers — the users of these tools. I think there was some legitimate concern about, ‘What if I’m a small school district using some AI, or what if I’m a rural clinic using AI? Are you saying I need to do some big, complicated study that I don’t have the expertise to do?’ I think putting more of the responsibility on the developers is probably a good idea.
New Mexico’s Public Education Department recently published its K-12 AI guidance, which includes ethical awareness as one of its literacy points, but also notes the use of AI to help with building lesson plans and such. Is this potentially problematic given the degree to which some AI systems tend to fabricate information?
It’s vitally important for people to understand that these chat bots are not trying to tell the truth. They’re also not trying to lie. They’re not trying to be deceptive. They’re also not trying to say accurate things about the world. They are simply emitting strings of words that look statistically like the strings of words in their training data.
There are basic skills of writing a book report; or reading something and synthesizing it; or reading two opposing essays on a topic and synthesizing an understanding of the arguments. If humans lose those skills, I think we’re in real trouble. I don’t mind outsourcing long division to a calculator — I’m not quite so old fashioned as to think that everybody needs to know long division. But as we outsource more and more of what it means to learn, to explore, to distinguish truth from falsehood…that certainly makes me nervous.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/CrisMooreSFIscientist-1024x512.jpg,,,2025-07-28 10:56:20.335256

Roy Cooper formally launched his campaign for U.S. Senate on Monday morning, making a long-rumored candidacy official and cementing himself as the all-but-certain Democratic nominee in 2026.
In a video announcement, Cooper says he “really never wanted to go to Washington.” But now, he’ll seek to head there as the successor to retiring U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican — hoping to flip the seat blue.
“Right now, our country is facing a moment as fragile as any I can remember,” Cooper said. “And the decisions we make in the next election will determine if we even have a middle class in America.”
Cooper served two terms in the governor’s mansion, with prior stints as attorney general and a state senator. He’s a Nash County native and attorney. His launch comes just days after he teased his run in front of state Democrats at the party’s annual fundraising dinner.
He is currently joined in the Democratic field by former U.S. Rep. Wiley Nickel, who is reportedly set to suspend his campaign. And his Republican opponent will most likely be Michael Whatley — the Republican National Committee chairman and former head of the North Carolina GOP.
Early campaign messaging from Cooper and Democrats signal that he will lean on his reputation and accomplishments in elected office — including working with lawmakers to expand Medicaid and raise teacher pay.
North Carolin Democratic Party chair Anderson Clayton said in a statement she was “confident he will flip this seat in 2026.” And Senate Majority PAC, one of the main campaign fundraisers for Senate Democrats, said Cooper’s entry “confirms the state is a prime pick-up opportunity.”
Republicans, meanwhile, see him as a frequent target of criticism and controversy, which they’ll seek to capitalize on.
U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, who chairs congressional Republicans’ campaign operation, said Cooper “spent decades dragging North Carolina left, and now he wants to do the same to America.”
Senate Republicans’ campaign arm called him a “wreck” in a digital ad criticizing his record. And the Senate Leadership Fund, a PAC for the Senate GOP, blasted him for the state’s hurricane response and key vetoes on transgender rights and immigration.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_9728-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 10:56:20.335256

Dorothy Barnett, executive director of the Climate + Energy Project, became interested in climate science and energy through working in community and economic development in rural areas. 


Reflector Podcast · Federal green energy u-turn, natural gas costs concern environmentalist

“I wanted to see how rural Kansas could really take advantage of the clean energy economy and how that could help the areas I had grown up in,” she said. “But as I learned more about climate change, about the environment, as I began to be a grandmother, much of the mission to equitably reduce greenhouse gas emissions resonated with me.”
Today, she’s watching with concern as federal policy encourages the country’s energy reliance on fossil fuels and reduces incentives to move toward green energy. 
“My primary concern about what’s happening is how the inaction we’re taking will impact climate change,” she said. “Every report that we read, every bit of scientific data, says this is the decade that we should be scaling up large-scale renewable energy projects and cutting greenhouse gas emissions if we’re going to stay within a reasonable amount of global warming.”
Barnett pointed to climate change effects, including recent flooding and heat waves. 
“I was reading an article yesterday that was talking about every degree it gets hotter is impacting crop yield, and that should concern every Kansan as the breadbasket of the world,” she said. “Climate change is an economic issue. It’s a health issue. It’s a resiliency issue.”
Along with those concerns, Barnett also highlights the pocketbook effect for most Kansans, who will be paying more for energy. The federal government changed or eliminated incentives to build large-scale wind and solar farms, which do a lot to help Kansans offset costs associated with gas and coal, she said. 
Barnett listed other changes that cut support for the federal weatherization program that helps people with low incomes make their homes more energy efficient and safe. 
Kansas Corporation Commission Chairman Andrew French at a hearing last week talked with Evergy officials about potential inequities in the energy system. 
“You’ve probably got a lot of higher-income folks that have newer housing stock, efficient appliances, their bills are on autopay, so they may be experiencing lower bills, even if they have a larger house,” French said. “And they’re not as price sensitive. Then you’ve got a pretty good segment of the population that’s lower income. They have less efficient housing stock, they have less efficient appliances and probably don’t have the means to upgrade those.”
French said that there’s an argument to be made that offering the same rates for such vastly different residential consumers could be seen as “not just and reasonable or unreasonably discriminatory.”
Such discussion isn’t a surprise to Barnett. 
“We’ve seen decades of disinvestment in marginalized communities,” she said. “Folks that are in those older homes oftentimes are dealing with really hard choices. Am I going to pay the electric bill so that I can maintain some sort of cooling in these high temperatures that we’re facing, or am I going to be able to buy some medicine and put some food on the table?”
 
Aging infrastructure
Keeping energy costs down is an important consideration for infrastructure expansions in the state. Evergy recently received KCC approval to build two natural gas plants and a solar plant. Barnett is concerned about the gas plants, which she refuses to call “natural.”. 
“That’s a fossil fuel talking point, so let’s call it what it is,” she said. “It’s fossil gas, and it may not be as bad from a greenhouse gas emission standpoint or from a carbon pollution standpoint as coal, but it does emit methane, which is a very strong greenhouse gas.” 
Climate + Energy Project intervened in the KCC docket about building the new plants, Barnett said. 
“We oppose them on two fronts,” she said. “Again, it’s completely against our mission to reduce greenhouse gas emissions equitably. From a more practical standpoint and going back to what I said about energy burden, we have some real concerns that fossil gas is a risky financial investment for Kansans.”
Barnett said the cost of gas has been “low-ish” for a decade, but according to predictions that won’t continue. Specifically, she said, the federal government is pushing for more gas use and is incentivizing exporting it to other countries, all of which are likely to drive up costs. 
She said she remembers talking with an executive in the utility industry early in her career who had begun investing in wind energy. 
“He was like, ‘We didn’t do this because we care about the environment, because we care about clean energy,’” she said, recalling his words. “‘We were really dependent on gas and our portfolio had a lot of gas and people couldn’t afford their bills. So we needed to diversify our fuel mix.’”
Energy future
Barnett said she hopes to see investment in battery energy storage systems and other innovative strategies to address utility needs. 
Battery technology and energy storage tax credits survived the federal government’s changes, she said. 
“What I’m hearing is we may begin to see a big investment in battery energy storage, while wind and solar are kind of on the back burner,” Barnett said. “Geothermal technology actually also fared well in the ‘big, beautiful bill.’”
Kansas has limited opportunities in geothermal, she said, because it uses so much water. 
“Kansas has such a robust wind resource that almost nothing can compare economically,” Barnett said. “For so many years, the mantra was, ‘Let’s let the market decide.’ Well, the market decided that wind and solar were the most cost-effective ways to generate electricity in the United States. And now, what market, right? It has been some of the most interesting times I’ve ever been a part of around wind and solar for the last almost 20 years.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Dorothy-Barnett1-1024x576.png,,,2025-07-28 10:56:20.335256

So in 2023, the state Department of Health mandated that all medical practitioners screen for the disease in pregnant mothers, and it has been running advertisements to spread awareness.
Annual congenital syphilis cases in Mississippi rose from 62 in 2021 to 132 in 2023, according to state data. The number fell to 114 last year. There have been 33 cases so far this year.
That work won’t stop despite potential budget cuts, Dr. Daniel Edney, Mississippi’s state health officer, said in an interview. “We’re going to keep doing what we have to do, you know, to keep it under control.”
State by state, public health departments take a similar approach: They monitor, treat and try to stem preventable diseases, alongside their host of other duties. But in the coming year, health department officials — with their agencies already strapped for cash — fear they’ll find it much more difficult to do their jobs.
President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 would cut the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by more than half, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion. The proposal serves as a wish list from the administration, a blueprint for the Republican-controlled Congress as it works through upcoming spending legislation.
If lawmakers hew to Trump’s vision, then state and county public health departments would be hit hard. States contribute to their own health departments, but a lot of them rely heavily on federal funding.
And around half of local public health department funding comes from federal sources, primarily the CDC, as noted in a 2022 report from the National Association of County & City Health Officials.

“The federal government provides a lot of funding, but the actual implementation of public health programs happens at the state and local level,” said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF, a health policy research group. “Each state has its own approach, in many ways, to how public health programs are overseen, how they’re funded, how they are implemented.”
In announcing his department’s share of the proposed budget, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Trump’s goals align with “new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic.”
But many local health leaders point to the longtime mission of state public health departments in preventing the spread of disease.
“Local public health is on the front lines preventing communicable disease, operating programs to prevent chronic disease, ensuring our septic and well water systems are safe,” said Dr. Kelly Kimple, acting director of North Carolina’s Division of Public Health within the Department of Health and Human Services.
“I’m very concerned,” Kimple said, “especially given the magnitude of funding that we’re talking about, as we can’t keep doing more with less.”
Clawing back COVID-era grants
Other federal budget cuts also have states worried.
Many state public health departments grew alarmed when the Trump administration announced in March that it would be clawing back $11.4 billion in COVID-era funding for grants that were slated to extend into 2026.
Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia sued. A federal district court in Rhode Island temporarily blocked the cuts, and the case remains tied up in court.
The court’s preliminary injunction may not protect temporary staff or contractors, though. Public health departments have been laying off staff, cutting lab capacity and reducing immunization clinics, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.

Historically, public health departments receive funding in “boom and bust” cycles, meaning they tend to get more federal support during emergencies, said Michaud, of KFF. But “since the Great Recession of 2008, there was a general decline in public health support funding until the COVID pandemic.”
For example, KHN and The Associated Press reported that between 2010 and 2019, spending on state public health departments declined by 16% per capita and spending for local health departments fell by 18%.
Nationally, syphilis cases reached historic lows in the 2000s, thanks to robust prevention efforts and education from public health officials. By 2022, however, cases reached their highest numbers nationally since the 1950s.
“In the wake of the COVID emergency, you’ve seen a sort of backlash to what people had been calling the overreach of public health and imposing vaccination requirements and lockdowns and other public health measures,” Michaud told Stateline.
Smallpox, cholera, and typhoid
Public health departments and officials go back to the 19th century, when there was a greater emphasis on sanitation efforts to prevent spread of diseases such as smallpox, cholera and typhoid, which were rampant at the time.
By the end of the century, 40 states had established health departments, which to this day are responsible for water sanitation, tracking the spread of disease, administering vaccinations, furnishing health education, providing screenings for infants and some prenatal care for moms at local clinics, offering family planning services, and tracking and treating sexually transmitted infections, among other things.










What we're seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.


– Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF


Kimple pointed to measles as a current example of a disease that’s spreading fast. When North Carolina’s health department detected a case in the state, she said, the department “identified and contacted everyone who might have been exposed, helped people get tested, worked with doctors to make sure they knew how to respond.”
That’s the legacy of local public health, Michaud said.
“The federal government cannot decide, ‘This public health program will happen in this state, but not that state,’ that kind of thing. And cannot declare a national lockdown. The COVID pandemic tested a lot of those boundaries. It really is a state and local responsibility to protect public health. And that’s always been the case, since the beginning of our country,” Michaud said.
“And what we’re seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.”
A major cut in services
Kimple said she’s seen recent progress in her state in the support for funding public health.
“North Carolinians viewed our work as highly important to improving health and well-being in the state, and appreciated the local presence, the reliable information, the role in prevention and efforts to protect, in particular, vulnerable communities,” she said.
Similarly, Edney said that Mississippi state lawmakers were showing more support, despite some setbacks in 2016 and 2017. New federal cuts could throw a wrench in the health department’s economic plans and its ability to reach small communities.
“Now the federal rug is being pulled out from under us,” he said.
Edney said he expects the federal share of his department’s public health funding to fall from its current 65% to around 50%.
Edney said he’s been trying to strengthen Mississippi health department’s longevity by diversifying its revenue streams by, for example, accepting private donations.
The state will not stop doing its “core” work, he said, regardless of federal funding.
“We’re not going to cut back on services at the county health department, because what we do now is all mission critical,” Edney said.

Several states have passed new laws regulating these machines, which officials say are increasingly being used to scam consumers. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)They may resemble other ATMs, but officials are increasingly warning about the potential for fraud with the expanding fleet of cryptocurrency ATMs popping up across the country.
The National Consumers League says the largely unregulated machines have become favored by scammers for their anonymity and irreversibility — once a user transfers or deposits funds, that money is essentially gone.
While officials say the machines can be used for legitimate purposes, red and blue states are increasingly imposing new regulations to protect consumers: AARP says 11 states have recently passed new laws or regulations of the machines.
“In state after state, AARP found lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and local law enforcement eager to work on commonsense rules that balance innovation and consumer safety,” Nancy LeaMond, AARP’s executive vice president and chief advocacy and engagement officer, said in a news release.
Last year, the FBI reported nearly 11,000 complaints of cryptocurrency ATM fraud. Those cases disproportionately affected older Americans and cost victims $246.7 million.
Cryptocurrencies are digital assets, including bitcoin, that offer an alternative payment or method without control of a central bank or government like other currencies. Crypto ATMs, sometimes called crypto kiosks, allow users to insert cash or use debit cards to convert currencies such as U.S. dollars into cryptocurrencies.
The Federal Trade Commission says crypto ATM scams often start with a call or text message warning of a supposed problem, such as unauthorized bank charges or suspicious activity on an Amazon account.
The FTC says consumers should contact banks or other institutions directly about any account issues. And it warns consumers not to believe anyone who says they must use a crypto ATM to address a financial problem.
“Real businesses and government agencies will never do that — anyone who does is a scammer,” the agency said.
States look at shoring up consumer protections as Trump hobbles federal watchdog

After signing a bill with new regulations, Nebraska Republican Gov. Jim Pillen was clear that the state would continue to welcome cryptocurrency businesses as it aims to become a hub for the industry.
The Nebraska law requires ATM operators to acquire state licensure, warn customers of the potential for criminal exploitation and take “reasonable steps to detect and prevent fraud.” The law also limits transactions to $2,000 per day for new customers and $10,500 for existing customers, and requires operators to issue refunds for properly reported fraudulent transactions.
At least 40 states have introduced legislation regarding cryptocurrency, digital or virtual currencies and other digital assets in the 2025 legislative session, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Those measures include ATM regulations, prohibiting the use of digital currencies by governments and allowing state investment in digital assets.
Federal lawmakers are also taking action on the issue. The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives declared the week of July 14 “Crypto Week,” when lawmakers considered several pieces of legislation.
At the end of that week, President Donald Trump signed into law the GENIUS Act, the first major law governing digital currency. It establishes a regulatory framework for the industry.
Trump hopes the bill will instill confidence in the industry that spent heavily to strengthen its legitimacy and political might, The Associated Press reported.
“This signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit,” the president told crypto executives.
In state legislatures, new bills regulating crypto ATMS have enjoyed bipartisan support. AARP tracking shows new bills have been approved in Arkansas, Iowa and Oklahoma, as well as in more liberal states such as Maryland and Vermont.
In May, Arizona Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed Republican-sponsored legislation that sets daily transaction limits and mandates crypto ATM operators provide customers certain disclosures and warnings.
The legislation followed local news coverage of at least two dozen crypto scams, including one that cost an Arizonan $28,000.

(Photo: Screenshot from video feed)North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs will talk about protecting the right to vote and her opponent’s attempt to overturn her 2024 election victory at an upcoming forum hosted by U.S. Senate Democrats.  
Republican Appeals Court Judge Jefferson Griffin tried to overturn Riggs’ narrow win by challenging more than 60,000 votes in protests before the state Board of Elections and in lawsuits. 
He wanted to throw out votes cast by military and overseas voters, people he called “never residents,” and those he claimed did not provide identification numbers when they registered. 
A federal judge in May ruled Griffin’s attempt to throw out votes unconstitutional and represented an effort to change voting rules after the election. 
Riggs will talk Wednesday about the attempt to disenfranchise military voters, her experience as a judicial officer and as a former voting rights attorney, and protecting the right to vote, according to a news release. 
The forum will focus on voter suppression tactics nationwide and is the second in a series hosted by U.S. Senate Rules Committee Democrats on protecting the future of America’s elections, according to the release,
Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, Loyola Marymount University Law School Professor Justin Levitt, and Janessa Goldbeck, CEO of the Vet Voice Foundation. 
U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), and U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), will host. 
Riggs’ appearance will be the second time in two weeks that a recounting of Griffin’s attempt to overturn election results will reach Congress.

Almost half of the 63 million Americans who care for a family member say they struggle financially to do so. (Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)More than 63 million Americans are caregivers for a family member with complex medical needs, a 20 million increase over the past decade, according to a new report.
But state policies, workplaces and the American health system haven’t kept up with this surge in family caregiving responsibilities, said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, a physician and the CEO of the AARP, which released the report with the National Alliance for Caregiving, a nonprofit policy and research organization.
“Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences, draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing,” Minter-Jordan told reporters on a call this week.
One of the biggest reasons for the surge in family caregivers is that Americans are living longer, yet they’re not necessarily healthier. There’s a 12-year gap between the average number of years that Americans live and the number of years they’re healthy.
‘A purpose in this world’: Older adults fear elimination of program that helps them find work

The caregiving role typically involves helping a family member with daily tasks like bathing, dressing and eating. But more than half of caregivers also perform more complex medical tasks, such as managing catheters or administering injections, the report found.
A growing number of caregivers are so-called “sandwich caregivers” — parents caring for their children as well as for an adult family member, such as an aging parent. About 17 million people are sandwich caregivers, compared with 11 million a decade ago. And most caregivers are also working a job.
And while the bulk of caregiving still falls on women, 40% of American caregivers are men.
Some states have heeded the growing calls for action.
Earlier this year, Maine lawmakers created a state program to provide respite care, which includes services such as adult day care that give family caregivers a temporary break.
Also this year, Tennessee extended its pilot program that provides respite care for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients. The state’s legislature also passed a bipartisan bill that directs the state Medicaid program to develop guidelines to allow family caregivers to be paid for their work.
Last year, Nebraska passed a tax credit for family caregivers. Oklahoma passed a similar law the year before.
And while the United States is one of few countries that doesn’t mandate paid family leave at the federal level, 13 states and the District of Columbia have established their own paid family leave rules.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Last year, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled in a 4-1 decision that Eric Hafner, an imprisoned felon in New York state, could remain on Alaska’s U.S. House ballot despite a lawsuit challenging his eligibility.
On Friday, the court issued a 22-page opinion explaining that its decision came down to the definition of the word “fifth.”
When Alaskans approved 2020’s Ballot Measure 2, they installed an open primary election and a ranked choice general election. The top four vote-getters in the primary election, regardless of party, advance to the general election.
If one of those top four candidates withdraws after the primary, a section of that ballot measure says that the Alaska Division of Elections should replace the withdrawn candidate “with the candidate who received the fifth most votes in the primary election.”
But in 2024, two Republican candidates withdrew after the primary, seeking to consolidate support behind fellow Republican Nick Begich III, the eventual winner.
That meant the sixth-place candidate, Democrat Eric Hafner, was promoted to the top-four general election. 
Hafner had never lived in Alaska at the time of his candidacy and, if elected, would have been ineligible to serve in office because he was not a resident of the state at the time of his election, something required by the U.S. Constitution.
Alaska Democrats, fearing a split vote between then-incumbent Rep. Mary Peltola and Hafner, sued, arguing that the ballot measure allowed the Division of Elections to promote the fifth finisher to the top four, but not anything beyond that. 
The Division of Elections and the Alaska Republican Party disputed that interpretation. An Anchorage Superior Court judge and the Supreme Court sided with the division, preserving Hafner’s candidacy.
In the end, it didn’t matter — Peltola lost to Begich by a margin that was wider than the number of votes Hafner received. Even if every Hafner voter had gone with Peltola, she still would have lost.
Writing after that result, four of the Supreme Court’s justices concluded that the plain language of the Ballot Measure 2 law “is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation” and is “ambiguous” about what happens if more than one winning candidate withdraws after the primary.
Given that, the justices relied on logic, prior case law and their view of voters’ intent when Alaskans approved Ballot Measure 2 in 2020.
Historically, the justices noted, they have issued orders that favor candidates’ access to the ballot.
Additionally, the language and context of Ballot Measure 2 support the idea that voters wanted to have four options in the general election.
“The language and purpose of Ballot Measure 2 favor the division’s interpretation: Allowing successive replacements aligns with the ballot measure’s goal of furnishing greater candidate choices for voters,” wrote Justice Jude Pate, an appointee of Gov. Mike Dunleavy, for the majority.
Under the Alaska Democratic Party’s interpretation of the law, the justices wrote, there could be a situation where three candidates withdraw after the primary election, leaving the remaining candidate unopposed in the general election, even if there were more candidates in the primary.
“We doubt that voters and the drafters would have intended such results,” Pate wrote of that hypothetical.
Writing in dissent was Justice Susan Carney, who said that the other four justices were wrong and that the plain language of the law is clear.
“It is hard for me to imagine plainer language than this statute uses to describe the candidate who will fill a vacancy on the general election ballot,” she wrote.
Carney wrote that “Ballot Measure 2 greatly increased Alaskans’ choices for representation” but that the plain meaning of “fifth” is clear and unambiguous.
Because of that fact, “the lengths to which the court has reached to conclude otherwise are unnecessary and unreasonable.”

One of California’s largest health care providers said it will stop providing gender-affirming surgeries for patients under 19 beginning Aug. 29 — a move that was criticized by members of the LGBTQ community and praised by parental rights groups.
Kaiser Permanente serves 12 million patients in eight states, including more than 9 million in California. In a statement, the health care giant cited actions by President Donald Trump’s administration to restrict gender-affirming care, including issuing subpoenas to doctors and clinics that provide care to transgender youth.

Kaiser: “After significant deliberation and consultation with internal and external experts including our physicians, we’ve made the difficult decision to pause surgical treatment for patients. … All other gender-affirming care treatment remains available.”

Kaiser’s move follows decisions by two other California hospitals to limit transgender health services: Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, which closed its health clinic for transgender youth last week; and Stanford Medicine, which paused services earlier this month.
Some members of the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus expressed disappointment in Kaiser’s policy while slamming the federal administration.

Assemblymember Christopher Ward, a San Diego Democrat and chairperson of the caucus, in an email to CalMatters: “While we recognize the impossible position Trump’s threats have put Kaiser in, it’s devastating that yet another barrier now stands between families and the care they know their children need. … It’s simply cruel.”

Jonathan Zachreson, a Roseville school board member who led an unsuccessful campaign last year to require California schools to notify parents if their children identified as transgender, told CalMatters that Kaiser’s decision was “a win for California and the nation.”

Zachreson: “This is protecting kids from mutilation. … It’s been very positive and we’re grateful for the federal actions that have taken place.”

Trump withholds AmeriCorps funding

From CalMatters higher education and workforce reporter Adam Echelman:
AmeriCorps’ public service programs face yet another obstacle in California. Last week the state amended one of its lawsuits against the federal government, saying AmeriCorps is withholding millions of dollars in congressionally-appropriated funds for new projects that were scheduled to start this summer. 
It’s the latest development in a months-long saga. In April the Department of Government Efficiency, better known as DOGE, pushed the federal volunteer service agency to slash programs, effectively laying off more than 5,600 California public service workers and leaving the schools that depend on AmeriCorps in a lurch. 
A few months later, a judge ordered AmeriCorps to temporarily reinstate California’s programs until the lawsuit is concluded. Despite the court order, only about half of those workers have actually returned to finish their jobs, CalMatters reported.
Now, many of the new AmeriCorps programs, which typically start in July or August, are unable to access their next round of funding. 

California Attorney General Rob Bonta, in a statement: “Last month, I secured a court order stopping the illegal dismantling of AmeriCorps. … But now, President Trump is trying a different, yet similarly, illegal tactic to withhold funding.”

The federal government has yet to respond to the amended lawsuit.



Janitorial services company settles

From CalMatters economy reporter Levi Sumagaysay:
CleanNet USA sold janitorial franchises to Californians using unfair and deceptive practices, then misclassified janitors and denied them employment rights such as minimum wage and reimbursement for supplies, the state alleged last week after an investigation by the attorney general’s office. 
The national company and its four California operators in the Bay Area, Sacramento, Southern California and San Diego must pay $1.7 million in restitution to more than 200 workers and $150,000 in civil penalties under a settlement with the state. 
The company must change its franchising business model and will be prohibited from selling franchises to sole proprietors or entities with fewer than two employees. It will also be monitored by the state Justice Department for at least three years to prove it’s complying with the settlement, which is pending court approval. 
The settlement says CleanNet denies all allegations. Robert Erickson, national director for the company, said in an email that CleanNet was “pleased” that its talks with the state led to an agreement.

HOST: Jennifer Smith
GUEST: Todd Kaplan, senior attorney at Greater Boston Legal Services







AS MASSACHUSETTS BRACES for September, and the rush of apartment turnover that comes with the start of the university term, renters and landlords alike will be navigating a new law that changes the way the state handles broker’s fees. Starting on August 1, renters cannot be forced to directly pay the fee for brokers working for landlords, though there is still the possibility that the cost gets passed on to the tenant through raised rents or so-called “junk fees.” 
Licensed brokers act as middlemen between landlords and tenants, handling tasks for the landlord that could include showing the apartment or performing a background check or credit check on the would-be tenant.  
But groups like Greater Boston Legal Services and other advocates for low-income Bay Staters have long argued that the practice of having tenants pay these fees, even when the broker works for the landlord, is creating an additional hurdle for renters in an already squeezed market. 
“It is completely an imbalanced market, where the tenants have no bargaining power,” said Todd Kaplan, senior attorney at Greater Boston Legal Services, on an episode of The Codcast. “That is it in a nutshell.” 
Tenants paying broker’s fees for the landlord has never been required by law, Kaplan told CommonWealth Beacon reporter Jennifer Smith. But it’s become common practice to demand that renters shell out first and last month’s rent, plus a security deposit, and broker’s fees that often amount to one month’s rent. This can mean that renters would have to be able to hand over as much as $12,000 to secure an average one-bedroom apartment in Boston. 
The new law isn’t as simple as an outright “ban” on the fees, Kaplan noted, though lawmakers have used the word as shorthand for the changes. 
“I think in the vast majority of cases, if a broker continues to be involved, they will be paid for by the landlord,” he said. “But this law does not prohibit a tenant from engaging a broker. And it’s just a few people – the biotech person coming from out of town, the Harvard professor who’s going to be here for a semester. They can always go and hire a broker, and they should, because they have very particular needs. The rest of us need to find housing, and if the broker is working for landlord, really the landlord should pay.” 
In the episode, Kaplan discusses how costs can still be passed on to renters through other fees (6:45), why eliminating broker’s fees was a GBLS priority (13:00), and how the one-size-fits-all law could impact different types of landlords (18:40).

The next superintendent will need to respond to President Donald Trump’s funding cuts and policy shifts, including the dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education and increased immigration enforcement.




As California intensifies its fight with the Trump Administration, the race for the state’s top schools job is becoming ever more crowded.
Today, former Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon formally entered the race to succeed Tony Thurmond as State Superintendent of Public Instruction. He joins a host of other state lawmakers and local school board members vying to replace Thurmond, who terms out in 2026 after eight years on the job.
The next state superintendent faces daunting challenges. The most urgent priority may be responding to President Donald Trump’s funding cuts and policy shifts, including the dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education and increased immigration enforcement. Those policies will have a deep impact on thousands of California’s 5.8 million K-12 students, at least 20% of whom have at least one parent who lacks legal status, according to the Children’s Partnership, a policy and advocacy nonprofit.
“There’s no question the Trump administration is going to continue to weaponize K-12 education,” said Morgan Polikoff, an education professor at the University of Southern California. “The state superintendent can serve as a buffer, helping districts navigate funding cuts and policy changes while continuing to push against the Trump administration. It’s important that California keeps fighting.”
From the classroom to the Legislature
Rendon, a Democrat from Lakewood, spent 12 years in the Legislature, the last eight as speaker. While he was speaker, the state nearly doubled its K-12 funding and introduced a new grade, transitional kindergarten – a particular priority for Rendon, who started his career as an early education administrator.
A former UC regent, Rendon said he’d try to protect California schools from Trump’s policies, particularly those related to immigration, but also work at the state level to advocate for more funding and accountability.
“California has the best public universities in the world,” Rendon said. “We need to have the best K-12 schools in the world, too.”
Vague job duties
California has a murky hierarchy when it comes to schools. The governor, Legislature, State Board of Education and superintendent all share duties, but the superintendent has the least amount of power. The superintendent oversees the California Department of Education, but California also has a system of local control, which means local school boards have plenty of latitude over day-to-day operations. Superintendents often find themselves balancing the needs of at least a dozen stakeholders, with not much power themselves.
In 2023, a bill by former Assemblymember Kevin McCarty would have banned state superintendent elections altogether, turning the position into a governor-appointed role, like it is in 41 other states.  
Still, despite very limited authority, state superintendent can be an important job, said Julie Marsh, a professor at USC and executive faculty director for Policy Analysis for California Education, a research center. Despite the obstacles, the state superintendent oversees the largest, most complex school system in the U.S. and has a wide platform to “do something good.”
“They can’t create policy, but they can help set the agenda. They can use their bully pulpit to defend the policies and values that Californians overwhelmingly support,” Marsh said.
Muratsuchi jumps in
Assemblymember Al Muratsuchi, chair of the Assembly education committee, is also running for superintendent. An adjunct professor at El Camino Community College and former school board president at Torrance Unified, Muratsuchi has a long history of advocating for schools.
He’s authored numerous school bills, including AB 49, which would make it harder for immigration agents to enter schools, and AB 477, which would increase state education funding and raise salaries for teachers and other school staff. He was also the lead author of Proposition 2, a $10 billion school facilities bond that passed last year.
As state superintendent, Muratsushi said he’d continue to push for more funding while standing up to the Trump administration.
“As California’s top elected education leader, the state superintendent should have a strong record of fighting Trump’s attacks on public education and our most vulnerable students,” said Muratsuchi, a Democrat from Torrance. “I believe I’m that person.”
Newman enters race
Muratuchi’s former counterpart in the state Senate is also running for superintendent. Josh Newman, a Democrat from Fullerton who served as chair of the Senate education committee from 2023-24, said that in addition to fighting Trump he’d focus on students’ physical and mental health, boosting civics education and revitalizing the Department of Education.
 Accountability and compliance should be a priority, he said.
“We’ve increased funding substantially in California for 20 years, yet we haven’t seen a corresponding increase in test scores or a narrowing of the achievement gap,” Newman said.
“That points to a systemic issue where the superintendent and Department of Education must play a bigger role.”
Shaw looks beyond Chino
Sonja Shaw, president of the Chino Valley school board, made national headlines for her attempts to require school staff to notify parents if a student identifies as transgender. Thurmond actually attended a Chino Valley board meeting to oppose the measure, and she had police escort him out.
Now, Shaw is running for Thurmond’s job, saying she wants to take her fight statewide.
“Parents want schools to focus on reading, writing and math, not social justice and LGBTQ ideology,” said Shaw, a Republican. “I feel like we can take this fight beyond Chino.”
Several other candidates have also filed initial paperwork with the Secretary of State, including two members of the Los Angeles Community College District: Nichelle Henderson and Andra Hoffman.

Gavin Newsom was just given his first handgun. A pending California bill would ban selling new Glocks like the ones Kamala Harris owns. Will he sign it?,"In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom was just given his first handgun. A pending California bill would ban selling new Glocks like the ones Kamala Harris owns. Will he sign it? 


The Democrats who control California’s Legislature are poised to ban the sale of one of the most popular types of handguns, like the one owned by arguably the state’s most recognizable Democrat, Kamala Harris.
Assembly Bill 1127 aims to prohibit gun shops from selling new Glock-brand handguns and various off-brand imitators, because the guns can become fully automatic if a criminal inserts a converter, commonly known as a “Glock switch,” into the weapon. The switches can be made illegally on a 3D printer.
Supporters say the bill targets only a narrow category of guns that are increasingly used in violent crimes. But critics argue the proposal opens the door to broader restrictions on all semi-automatic handguns. That, they say, potentially includes other popular models like the one Gov. Gavin Newsom recently got as a gift from a conservative podcaster. Newsom hasn’t indicated whether he’ll sign the measure.
Semi-automatic handguns require a shooter to pull the trigger to fire each round. Fully automatic weapons, sometimes called machine guns, will keep firing as long as the trigger is depressed. Automatic weapons are already illegal under state and federal laws for everyone except special permit holders.
Illegally modified, fully-automatic Glock-style handguns have been used in several high-profile shootings, including a 2022 gang gunfight outside a Sacramento nightclub a few blocks from the Capitol. The shooting killed six people and wounded another 12.  
But Glocks also are among the most popular handguns sold in California. Gun rights advocates say there are already more than 1 million in circulation in California – and only a tiny fraction of them have been illegally modified. As an example of how popular Glocks are, Harris, while she was running for president, told “60 Minutes” last year that she owned a Glock and that she had shot it. A Harris spokesperson didn’t respond to interview requests or to a question about whether she still owns the gun.
The pending proposal would not prohibit Harris or others who already own Glocks from keeping theirs. They could also sell used ones to others in private-party transactions. Californians just couldn’t buy a new one. It’s unclear how many Glocks are sold in California each year since regulators and gun manufacturers don’t publicly report statewide sales numbers. 
Police widely carry Glocks in California, but they would be exempt from the restrictions.
What about Gavin Newsom’s new gun?
The measure’s lead author, Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, a Democrat representing the Encino area, told the Senate Judiciary Committee this month that if gun manufacturers don’t like the ban, they can redesign their weapons to make them less easy to convert to machine guns.
“Most handgun designs don’t have this issue, and this legislation is narrowly focused on a limited number of designs that are exceptionally easy to modify,” he said. “Sadly, certain actors in the gun industry have known about this issue for decades and have refused to do anything meaningful to address it.”

Gun rights advocates say Glock has already redesigned new models to be incompatible with the switches, but the California Department of Justice hasn’t included those weapons on its list of handguns that can be purchased in the state. 
More than two dozen states, including California, have already banned Glock switches, but California would be the first state to ban the gun. A similar bill introduced in New York has stalled in the state’s Senate.
The California bill, which has 12 Democratic co-authors and co-sponsors, has already passed the Assembly with only Republicans voting against it. It’s poised to do the same in the Senate, putting it on a path next month to go to the desk of the state’s newest high-profile handgun owner, Newsom.
This month, conservative podcaster Shawn Ryan gave Newsom a Sig Sauer P365-Xmacro handgun while the two recorded an hourslong podcast in Tennessee. 
The handgun wouldn’t fall under the provisions of AB 1127. The weapon’s mechanisms are designed differently than a Glock’s and switches made for Glocks don’t work.But Sam Paredes, the executive director of Gun Owners of California, which opposes the bill, said it’s possible someone could design an illegal converter for Newsom’s gun some day. Plus, many semi-automatic handguns can be converted to fully automatic with the right tools and know-how, if someone wants to risk a felony charge.
He said it will be up to the office of Attorney General Rob Bonta to decide what handguns to ban for sale in California, should Newsom sign Gabriel’s bill into law. Bonta supports the proposal. Bonta’s office didn’t return a message, but in a letter in support of the bill he wrote that “California has one of the lowest rates of firearms deaths in the nation and that is due to our strong common sense gun safety laws.”“These laws are effective and save lives,” Bonta wrote. “Prohibiting this dangerous design flaw is an integral step in keeping automatic weapons off our streets.”
Gun advocates don’t like Newsom 
Asked if he will sign the ban on new Glocks, Newsom’s press office said that his office doesn’t usually comment on pending legislation. 
“The governor left the firearm in Tennessee in Shawn’s possession,” said Newsom spokesperson Izzy Gardon. “He is working to ensure it is properly transferred in accordance with California law and will take possession once that process is complete.”
It would be the first firearm registered under Newsom’s name, according to The San Francisco Standard. 
If Newsom wants to legally keep the Sig Sauer, he’d have to ship it from a Tennessee gun dealer to a registered firearms dealer in California.

Once the gun arrives, Newsom would have to pass a background check, provide his fingerprints, take a handgun safety test, sign affidavits, provide a driver’s license and documents that contain his name and address, such as a current utility bill. He’d need to undergo a 10-day waiting period. Paredes said Newsom would also have to pay around $300 in fees and taxes on the $700 gun.
He’d have to do everything himself, as gun owners need to appear in person to do the paperwork. 
Paredes said he doesn’t expect Newsom to get a warm welcome if he goes to any California gun shop to make the transfer. Newsom is one of the nation’s most ardent advocates of firearms ownership restrictions, and he’s backed some of the laws that make acquiring his gun – and any ammunition he’d want to shoot – so challenging and costly. 
“I’ll bet you there’ll be 10,000 people (protesting) at that gun store the day he comes in to do that,” Paredes said.
When Ryan gave Newsom the Sig Sauer, Newsom told the podcaster that though he continues to support gun regulations that he said have made the state safer, he’s “not anti-gun at all.”
“The last thing people would expect is that I respect this gift,” he said, according to The San Francisco Standard. 
At least one gun shop employee isn’t buying it. 
Cassidy Maznio, assistant manager at Sacramento Black Rifle, a firearms dealer, said Newsom is welcome to come to the shop to process his gun transaction.
“Obviously, we’d talk trash to him the whole time,” Maznio said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/041421-Handgun-Gun-Store-REUTERS-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-28 08:56:55.938548

The U.S. Department of Education says adult students without legal status are now banned from certain courses. Teens at public K-12 districts could see changes too. 


As President Donald Trump ramps up immigration enforcement, targeting immigrants at workplaces and street corners across California, his administration is turning its attention to adult students. 
In a memo earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Education said adult students without legal status must be banned from federally funded career technical education classes, English-language programs and high school equivalency courses. Adult schools offer these courses to anyone over 18 years old, including immigrants, and many school leaders say the new policy could lead to enrollment declines. California’s K-12 districts may also need to adapt since they use federal funding to offer numerous career technical education classes that teach skills such as welding and farming.  
The new policy poses administrative challenges for these schools, which don’t require students to prove their legal status. Many students, including U.S. citizens, lack the proper verification documents.  
“It’s going to perpetuate this atmosphere of fear,” said Randy Tillery, the director of economic development for the nonprofit WestEd, which helps collect data on behalf of the state. 
Last week, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the state is suing over the new policy. 
The U.S. Education Department refused to comment on the new policy. In a press release, the department said it will enforce it starting Aug. 9.  
Adult schools ask students to voluntarily share their Social Security numbers, which are only available for those with a legal right to work in the U.S. Of the more than 500,000 adult learners taking classes in California, about 10% voluntarily share their numbers with their schools, Tillery said.
Schools across the state say that they are waiting for more guidance from state and federal agencies before barring students from any classes. 
‘What if you don’t return?’
V., a student at Huntington Beach Adult School, has been taking a beginner-level English-language class for the past two years, in-person, Monday through Thursday, for two and a half hours a day. V. agreed to be interviewed on the condition that CalMatters not identify her because she doesn’t have legal status and fears deportation. 
Her three children, who are U.S. citizens, couldn’t stand the idea of their mom going to school this summer as the threat of immigration raids loomed. “When I grabbed my backpack to go to school, my kids said, ‘Don’t go, mom. What if you don’t return?’” she told CalMatters in Spanish, her voice shaky, on the verge of tears. 
Last month, she sent a note to her teacher, saying that, because of “uncontrollable anxiety” she needed to take the class online. “I was, I am and I continue to be terrified to leave (my house),” she said later.
Normally her class has about 40 students, but this summer, it’s down to 24, according to her teacher. The class is livestreamed, and an increasing number of students are opting to take the course online, the teacher said. CalMatters is withholding the teacher’s name to ensure V.’s anonymity.
It was harder to focus while taking online classes, V. said — her kids often interrupted the livestream or something on the computer distracted her. After about two weeks of online school, V. returned to class in person, despite her kids’ fears.
Steve Curiel, the principal, said the school is allowing students without legal status to attend, at least for now, until the education department provides more guidance about its new policy.
For a month now, adult schools have been managing uncertainty over federal policy and funding. Federal funding for adult schools typically comes through on a yearly basis, with the fiscal year beginning July 1, and it provides as much as 30% of a school’s budget. The education department withheld the money for a month, leading California Attorney General Rob Bonta to sue Education Secretary Linda McMahon. On Friday, the department said it would begin releasing the money this week, but the lawsuit is still ongoing, according to Elissa Perez, a spokesperson for Bonta’s office.
“We’re feeling optimistic but we’re still holding our breath a little bit because we want to see the actual release of the funds,” said Curiel. He was about to begin making cuts on Friday to contracts at Huntington Adult School but said he will now hold off.
“It’s going to perpetuate this atmosphere of fear.” Randy Tillery, director of economic development at WestEd
Many states rely entirely on the federal government to fund English-language learning and high school equivalency programs for adults, whereas California has a financial cushion: The state provides over $650 million each year specifically for adult education, representing the bulk of funding for California’s adult schools. 
Turning teens away from classes
The education department’s new policy on adults without legal status could also affect high school students. Although much of the federal funding in question supports adults taking English classes and high school equivalency courses, career technical education is part of a separate pot of money, known as Perkins funds, and includes hundreds of high schools across the state. The education department memo says that funding for those programs should be restricted to students who are legal residents or citizens. 
An estimated 150,000 children between the ages of 3 and 17 live in California but lack legal status, according to the Migration Policy Institute. The vast majority are enrolled in school.
The U.S. Supreme Court case Plyer v. Doe requires K-12 school districts to provide all students, regardless of their legal status, with “a basic public education,” but in the memo, the U.S. education department said that career technical classes are no longer considered part of a “basic” education. The memo also says that children without legal status are now prohibited from taking college-level courses in high school.
To implement the education department’s new policy, public K-12 schools would need to tell certain students that they can’t take specific classes because of their legal status. It would create “an enormous problem for schools,” said Tillery, since schools don’t ask students about their legal status. Public schools would need to gather data about who is a legal resident and who isn’t, he said, which could deter some students from attending school at all.
The U.S. Education Department did not respond to CalMatters’ questions asking how schools should respond or what enforcement might look like. The Los Angeles Unified School District said it was “awaiting further guidance” from the state’s education department, which also declined to comment.

Many work jobs, are food insecure and yet aim to graduate. Don't count us out; we are the future.","Guest Commentary written by

Diego Rendon
Diego Rendon is a student at California State University, San Bernardino, where he is student body president.



The Coachella Valley and Inland Empire region are home to one of the largest Latino populations in California, yet for many high schoolers here, college still feels like a foreign country that they don’t know how to navigate.
I’m a first-generation college student who grew up in Desert Hot Springs. In high school, I didn’t talk to my parents about SAT scores, internships, or what the next step of my life would look like during college or after. I still remember at the age of 17, feeling completely overwhelmed with college financial aid applications and applying to college during my senior year, while balancing a part-time job to help save money for college. 
I didn’t have a roadmap to follow, but I knew I wanted more for my future. That’s why I decided to stay local and attend CalState San Bernardino Palm Desert Campus, the Coachella Valley’s only four-year public university. That decision changed everything. 
I knew I wanted to help others who came from backgrounds like mine, hardworking and full of potential, but in need of guidance and mentorship. Overall, college has pushed me out of my comfort zone and taught me how to uplift others while continuing to grow myself. 
Through it all, my family has always been my biggest motivator. Both my parents are from Sinaloa, Mexico, and my grandpa had farming roots in the Imperial Valley dating back to the 1960s. 
My dad grew up in a small town called Holtville, CA, and today works in pool construction. My mom was a stay-at-home mom and caregiver. They’ve instilled in me the value of education and taught me to chase after what I want. Growing up, my mom would always say, “La única herencia que te vamos a dar es la educación,” which translates to, “The only inheritance we’re going to give you is an education.” 
That stuck with me and still drives me today. 
After transitioning to the San Bernardino campus, I found a second home. I’ve grown more than I ever imagined. 
As student body president, I represent my peers at CSUSB and am their voice in various committees and decision-making spaces. For example, earlier this year, other students and I traveled to Sacramento to advocate on behalf of the entire California State University system. 
We shared with legislators stories about our journeys, our challenges, and how much we value our education. We reminded them that we are a true investment in the future of California and, with the right support, we’ll keep building a state we continue to call home.
That trip to Sacramento was just one part of the bigger picture. The rest is happening right here at CSUSB, where students continue to face real challenges, such as financial hardships, long commutes, demanding work hours, and food insecurity, all while giving it their absolute best. 
They’re not just trying to earn a degree; they’re trying to leave CSUSB as stronger versions of themselves and be ready to enter the workforce and build meaningful careers. These students are the true backbone of our region, but too often, they go unseen. 
I see myself in them. There was once a time in my college journey when I was juggling three different jobs, working in student government, at In-N-Out, and serving as an orientation leader. It wasn’t easy, but those experiences taught me resilience, time management, and a sense of gratitude. 
Across the Coachella Valley and Inland Empire, there are thousands of students with similar stories, students who are not just the future of California, but the ones currently shaping it.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/042224-Inland-Empire-JAH-10.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-28 08:56:55.938548

According to a statement from the Grand Traverse County Sheriff’s Office, dispatch began receiving calls at 4:43 p.m., Saturday, saying there was a man with a knife inside the Garfield Township Walmart stabbing people. 
Grand Traverse County Sheriff deputies arrived at 4:46 p.m. on Saturday and saw multiple citizens, including one armed with a pistol, confronting the suspect, and preventing him from leaving and harming other patrons.
Shea later identified the man as Bradford James Gille, a 42 year old from Afton, who was arrested and transported to the Grand Traverse County Jail where he would remain pending formal charges and an arraignment. 
The requested charges against Gille are one count of terrorism, and 11 counts of assault with intent to murder.
Grand Traverse County Prosecutor Noelle Moeggenberg said her office expects to authorize charges Monday, and that Gille will be arraigned either or Tuesday. 
The 11 individuals wounded in the stabbing were transported to Munson Medical Center for treatment. As of 3:30 p.m. on Sunday, Munson Healthcare said two patients remained in serious condition, eight patients were listed in fair condition and one patient had been treated and released, with all 11 individuals expected to survive their injuries.
Free mental health counseling for all individuals impacted will be available at Northwestern Michigan College Innovation Center Monday through Wednesday from 10 a.m. through 7 p.m. this week, with Moeggenberg noting those services may be extended depending on their use.
Twenty-four hour counseling is also available at the Grand Traverse Mental Health Crisis and Access Center at 410 Brook St. in Traverse City. Crisis services are also available by calling 1-833-295-0616.
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel applauded the efforts of law enforcement, medical service providers and the individuals who intervened, in a statement released Sunday offering her thoughts and prayers to the victims, as well as the Grand Traverse Community. 
“Grand Traverse Prosecutor Noelle Moeggenberg is a dedicated, career criminal prosecutor, and I maintain full faith in her and her office in the handling of this matter,” Nessel said. “My department has been in touch and has offered our assistance wherever it may be valuable.”

(Photo by Stephen Ausmus/Agricultural Research Service, USDA)If it rains at your house, do the cereal boxes in your pantry get wet? Of course not – because they’re under cover, protected by roof and shingle.
And when it rains on a chicken farm, the chicken litter, or manure, on the farm stays dry, too. It is also kept dry under cover, whether that’s inside the well-protected chicken house or stored in a manure shed designed to Natural Resources Conservation Service standards.
Maryland chicken farms, in fact, must follow a “zero-discharge” permit which “does not authorize discharges of pollutants, including manure, litter, and process wastewater” in day-to-day operations. (Farmers don’t want their manure to go missing, anyway; as organic, slow-release plant food, chicken manure is too valuable in the crop production cycle to be treated as waste.)

These basic facts about how chicken farms have been built and operated for decades are well-known. But apparently, Food & Water Watch is oblivious to them.
The group’s July 21 commentary demanding new regulations and burdens be placed on Maryland farmers (insulting these family-owned operations as “insidious polluters”) asserts that farms “spew” chicken manure “directly into waterways.”
It’s frankly astonishing to see a claim so divorced from reality still being made in 2025, when the scientists who study our water quality have documented that nutrient contributions from agriculture to the Chesapeake Bay have declined by 45 million pounds since the 1980s.
That’s the result of conservation practices and technological advances chicken growers, crop farmers and others in agriculture have invested in: manure sheds, pollinator-friendly buffers, stormwater management systems, litter amendments, even tweaks to chicken feed.
It’s a shame Food & Water Watch is so determined to target Eastern Shore farmers, because they are the backbone of Maryland’s biggest industry – agriculture. Maybe that’s because they only see the Shore as a vacationland, its farms as nuisances glimpsed as they speed down Route 50, not as the cherished homes of its proud year-round residents.
Their op-ed trots out a tired, old “farmers versus tourism” trope, trying to imply that the Shore’s agricultural strength puts $19.4 billion a year in tourism spending at risk. Left unsaid: $4.7 billion of those tourism dollars are spent on food that draws tourists here, like seafood, craft beer – and chicken.
Don’t let anyone tell you farming and tourism can’t coexist. 100 years of chicken-growing history here say otherwise. Living on the Eastern Shore for 41 years, being a farmer’s daughter, and teaching my girls to fish on the Choptank River says otherwise.
And don’t let a group virulently opposed to a modern, conservation-minded chicken community – a group that believes it is “time to ban” our farms – deceive you about how farms today actually work.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/chickens.jpeg,,,2025-07-28 08:56:55.938548

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)A messaging war over President Donald Trump’s big tax and spending bill made its way to Las Vegas Friday – a metro area both sides of the political aisle described as the poster child for the measure’s impacts on working-class Americans.
House Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee gathered in Las Vegas to aggressively highlight tax cuts provided by the megabill, which has proven deeply unpopular in recent surveys. 
During the committee field hearing, Republicans focused on the bill’s more popular, if less consequential, aspects, namely a new tax deduction for seniors and provisions allowing workers to deduct their taxes on tips and overtime pay through 2028.
Democrats, including Ways and Means member and Nevada Rep. Steven Horsford, hammered the legislation’s cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs, as well as a provision that increases taxes on professional gamblers. 
Trump first announced “no tax on tips” as a campaign promise in Las Vegas, making the city a prime location for Republicans to crow about its inclusion in the tax and spending bill as they head into a five-week summer recess. 
“This city leads the nation in the share of its workers who earn tips,” said Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri, the Republican chairman of the committee. 
“But what will happen here in Vegas will not stay just in Vegas, because America’s 4 million tipped workers will also benefit from no tax on tips,” he continued.
Smith said the legislation’s tax breaks would help working-class Americans and generate economic growth. He also cast Democrats as opponents of cutting taxes after they unanimously opposed the legislation.
The largest tax cuts in the bill are by far the extension of tax cuts passed during Trump’s first term in 2017, which overwhelmingly benefit the higher income earners and corporations. 
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office last week projected the measure’s tax cuts will add $3.4 trillion over a decade, mostly due to extending the 2017 tax cuts.
While Republicans hoped to use the Las Vegas hearing to kick off a victory lap for their legislation, Nevada Democrats used the hearing – held at an electric sign warehouse – to clobber the bill for hurting Nevada’s economy and Nevada households.
“Las Vegas is actually ground zero for the damage that Trump’s economy is doing to workers and families and small businesses,” Horsford said. 
One provision of the bill that has garnered bipartisan criticism limits how much professional and casual gamblers can deduct in losses, a tax increase that could hurt Nevada’s primary industry.
“Senate Republicans unilaterally thrust the gaming economy and its patrons into uncertainty with the unjust inclusion of the wagering loss penalty,” Horsford said.
Nevada Rep. Dina Titus joined Horsford at the hearing to push her Fair Accounting for Income Realized from Betting Earnings Taxation (FAIR BET) Act, a bill that would reverse the provision in the bill signed by Trump and restore the full gambling loss tax deduction.
Nevada’s hospitality industry is already facing challenges this year, as visitation numbers have fallen short of 2024 levels month after month.
“I hope that, since you care so much about Nevada families, y’all will spend some money while you’re here in some of our casinos. We would appreciate that,” Titus told committee members. 
Democratic Nevada state Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro, speaking as an invited witness at the hearing, stressed the pain that will be inflicted on Nevadans by the legislation’s deep cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs to help finance extending the Trump’s 2017 tax cuts.
Cannizzaro questioned the tax benefits of the legislation, emphasizing that deductions for taxes on tips and overtime pay are temporary while tax cuts for high-income households and corporations are permanent. 
“This temporary benefit will only help Nevada’s tipped workers if we continue to have tourists to tip them. That’s no guarantee, especially amidst a year-over-year decline in visitation from both domestic and international tourists,” Cannizzaro said. 
The six other witnesses who spoke at the closed hearing were invited by Republicans and testified about the benefits of the legislation, including a server, a DoorDash driver, a paint foreman, and a small business owner from Henderson. 
Democrats held a press conference at the Culinary Workers Union headquarters ahead of the hearing as counter-programming where union members described the negative impacts of the bill.
Health care advocates noted the legislation will cut Medicaid by nearly $1 trillion over a decade, a move that could place a major burden on Nevada, which relies heavily on the low-income health program. 
Nevada became the first state led by a Republican governor to expand Medicaid in 2012, reducing the uninsured rate from 22% to 8%. 
Stricter Medicaid eligibility requirements under the Republican megabill could cut health coverage for nearly 100,000 Nevadans, according to analysis from Nevada Medicaid. 
Premiums through the Silver State Health Exchange – which covers another 100,000 Nevadans – are likely to increase by roughly 75% next year, Cannizzaro said, leading to more uninsured individuals and increased costs for state and local health systems.
Stricter eligibility requirements under the Supplemental Nutrition Program under the megabill will cost Nevada $20 million per year, while denying thousands of people access to food assistance, she added.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/field-hearing-8-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 08:56:55.938548

Buildup of dead vegetation in Evens Creek, a wetland area bordered by homes, has created a wildfire hazard the Reno Fire Department hopes to mitigate by introducing 250 goats that will eat away dry brush for the next 45 days.
“They’re working all day long,” said Reno Fire Chief Dave Cochran.
The move comes as wildfire season approaches its peak this month. Wildfire season in Nevada typically lasts from late summer to early fall, but in recent years the season has lengthened due to climate change.
Last year, nearly 860 wildfires burned about 104,000 acres of land across Nevada, according to the Nevada Division of Forestry. 
In northwest Reno, where thousands of houses have been built in the urban wildland interface, the impact of the fires can be especially devastating. 
Northern Nevada experienced one of the most economically destructive wildfires in recent memory last year. About 20 miles south of Reno, the wind-driven Davis Fire rapidly burned through nearly 6,000 acres of land. The fire drove the evacuation of about 20,000 people and ultimately destroyed two commercial buildings and 14 homes.
With less precipitation than normal across much of Northern Nevada this spring, a prolonged heat wave, and fields of flammable grasses, the region is at greater risk of widespread wildfires this year.
“We are seeing a very high threat of wildfire, and it’s increasing every day that goes by,” Cochran said.
The goats, from High Desert Graziers in nearby Smith Valley, are bred to consume a wide variety of non-native grasses and weeds that fuel wildfires including bitterbrush, manzanita, and cheatgrass.
Those non-native grasses and weeds typically die off in the summer, unlike native species, creating dangerous fuel for wildfire. 
It’s the fourth time the city has used goats for fire mitigation. Like other years, the goats will be corralled to specific areas by a temporary solar-powered electric fence, and under the watch of guard dogs.
Cochran said the dogs are also there to protect the goats from being eaten by animal predators, or stolen by humans.
“People love goats, so that’s a concern as well,” he said. 
The goat grazing operation will cost the city about $67,500. It’s funded in part by state legislation passed in 2022 that allocates funding to the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources for wildfire prevention, restoration, and long-term planning.
“Targeted grazing is an environmentally friendly and sustainable option for managing noxious weeds and flammable vegetation,” said Reno City Ward 2 Councilmember Naomi Duerr. “We’re proud to continue this creative approach.”
Wildfire managers say it takes a suite of approaches to prevent wildfires, including manual brush clearing, herbicides, and prescribed burns.
Goats have proven to be a cost-effective way to clear dry vegetation in difficult to reach terrain like steep bluffs and cliffs near homes. 
“It’s low tech, and it’s very cost-effective. They target exactly what we need,” Cochran said.
Studies looking at whether goats’ grazing can reduce the severity or impact of wildfires are scarce, but some research does suggest targeted grazing significantly reduces the grasses and weeds they goats were introduced to control. 
In Arizona, some scientists have observed that land cleared of excess vegetation by goats acts as fire breaks and can stop wildfires in their tracks.
Anecdotally, Cochran said goats have had positive, long-lasting effects on previous areas they grazed.
“Goats are a great tool to do that. They work from dawn till dusk. They actually eat non-native and invasive species of plants. They just take it down to the dirt,” Cochran said.
Despite the positive impact of goats, Cochran emphasized the need for federal action when it comes to wildfire response and mitigation. 
Ongoing cuts, funding freezes and hiring pauses brought on by President Donald Trump’s executive orders shrinking the federal workforce have weakened the nation’s already strained firefighting force by hitting support staff who play crucial roles in preventing and battling wildfires.
The Trump administration stated the U.S. Forest Service has reached 99% of its firefighting hiring goals, but documents obtained by ProPublica show a high vacancy rate, as well as internal concern among top officials responsible for wildfire response.
“There’s no department in the country that can handle these giant fires by themselves. You need local resources, state resources, but you also need a lot of federal resources, and if they’re not funded, that puts a dent in our ability to respond to these fires. We are keeping an eye on that. We’re very concerned,” Cochran said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/20250724_163319929_iOS-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-28 08:56:55.938548

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.

The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
In Utah, the data shows ICE has made 1,579 arrests since Trump took office in January, compared to 493 arrests under Biden. Of this year’s arrests, 57% of immigrants who were detained carried violent convictions, while the percentage under Biden was 70%.
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.












The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling.


– Oregon Republican state Rep. Cyrus Javadi




Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.
If Trump wants more deportations, he’ll need to target the construction industry

Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.
More cities, counties join immigrant sanctuary lawsuit seeking to block Trump funding cuts

Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

SELMA — Mason’s grandfather had recently taught him the family recipe for fried green tomatoes. And Mason wanted to show his classmates in the Better Basics program at Brantley Elementary School how to make them, using green tomatoes in the class’ garden.
“They did the batter, cut the tomatoes. We have safety kids’ knives, potato peelers, and they cut their tomatoes,” their teacher, Towanda Friday, said. “Mason showed them how to season it, and they season it all up. And so they watched us cook the tomatoes for them.”
Friday teaches fifth grade at Brantley Elementary in the Dallas County School system, and the Better Basics program in the summer. It was a grant program through a Birmingham organization that serves central Alabama to “advance children’s literacy” and also incorporates music.

Mason’s plans aligned with Friday’s, who along with reading and math teaches her students how to take care of a garden. She said in a recent school visit that they had tomatoes, squash, sunflowers, watermelon and red peppers. She teaches them how to make everyday lunches, and to stay away from the microwave.

“They’re not only going to do cooking and the garden. They’re bringing in instruments to play in a band,” she said. “They’re trying to help build Brantley up.”
Friday teaches in a system that is in the early stages of supervision by the state. Alabama State Superintendent Eric Mackey intervened in the system in March, his third intervention, saying that the system did not follow proper procurement processes in dealing with more than $12.1 million in federal funds. 
Alice Jackson, the system’s director of federal programs, said intervention is helping on the financial side. Part of why the system had so many federal dollars left, she said, was due to not having a streamlined system to process those funds.
“I’m very optimistic that with the transition of Mr. Sampson and the company of Dr. Boyd, that we’ll be able to get the system where it needs to be in a timely manner,” Jackson said of the system’s former superintendent, Anthony Sampson, and the state official in charge of the intervention, Daniel Boyd.

Why the state stepped in

Mackey intervened in Dallas County because of financial and board governance concerns, according to the show cause letter sent to the local board on Feb. 21. 
“This behavior erodes public trust in individual members and the Board as a whole. It also suggests that the Board is dysfunctional and ineffective in properly stewarding the funds awarded to the system for its students,” Mackey wrote in the letter. “Consequently, losing faith in the Board’s ability to govern could lead to a decline in engagement and support, making it more difficult for the DCSS to receive additional federal monies in the future.”
Mackey said in a June interview that the Dallas intervention is different from the Sumter County and Bessemer City interventions.

“It was not necessarily that the board couldn’t get together and get it done, but they just didn’t have it,” he said. “They literally don’t have the money and don’t have the capacity to handle the situation that was before them.”
One reason for that is a shrinking population base. Dallas County’s population shrunk 12% between 2010 and 2020. Public school enrollment has fallen even faster: Dallas County Schools had just over 3,300 students in the 2014-15 school year; it fell to 2,262 in the 2023-24 school year, a 32% decrease. Boyd said that the population decline is directly related to the intervention and the school closures.
“Our schools are a microcosm of the greater community,” Boyd said. “As our greater community gets smaller, the population of schools will decline.”
The district is already being reshaped by intervention. In an effort to get one month’s worth of expenses in reserve, two of the district’s 11 schools will close. Boyd, the state-appointed chief administrative officer for the Dallas and Bessemer interventions, said the system had 20% of a month’s expenses in reserve. He said in a phone interview Tuesday that a month’s expenses for the system is about $2.8 million.
“I feel that perhaps in 18 months or so, we’ll have that state minimum of one month reserve, maybe even before 18 months, which will be huge,” Boyd said. “It’s been years since the district had this one month reserve.”
The Dallas County Board of Education unanimously approved the closures of J.E. Terry Elementary School in Plantersville and Bruce K. Craig Elementary School in Selma on June 4. Like the district, Both schools had seen enrollment fall. J.E. Terry, which had 123 students in the 2014-15 school year, had 81 in the 2023-24 school year, according to the Alabama State Board of Education. Bruce K. Craig, which had 218 students enrolled in 2014-15, had 148 in 2023-24.
Boyd said the teachers at those schools were offered positions at other schools in the district and the students will consolidate to Valley Grande Elementary School, in Valley Grande. Both closed schools are about 12.5 miles from Valley Grande, in opposite directions.

“We don’t feel that it will make a lengthy trip for the students. Our transportation supervisor and transportation staff are working closely together to make sure that we’ve streamlined the routes as much as possible,” he said. 
Boyd did not rule out the possibility of further closures, but said he feels confident the two closures will help get the system’s finances back in line.
“Even though you have a plan in place, it’s not until school starts and you see how the routes run that you’re able to make additional modifications to improve efficiency,” Boyd said.

Academics

Academic achievement was not a reason for the state’s intervention, and former Dallas County Superintendent Anthony Sampson took pride in the kids’ achievements.
“I’m really proud that kids know where they stand academically on their own, not based on what somebody else is saying,” he said on June 30, his last day as superintendent. . 
 Sampson, who had served as superintendent since 2022, chose not to renew his contract in November so he could be closer to his family in Baldwin County.
“The last 100 days have been very busy, very fulfilling, and it just never ends. There’s always highs and there’s always lows,” Sampson said. 
Former DCS Superintendent Hattie Shelton has stepped in as an interim superintendent while Boyd searches for a permanent superintendent. She said in a phone interview Thursday that she will support the students and teachers to her best ability.
“I’m probably going to be praying very hard for things to turn around for us and turn around quickly,” Shelton said.

‘A lot of motivation’

  Brantley Elementary Principal Adrienne Lee speaks with students during a visit by Dallas County Superintendent Anthony Sampson on June 30, 2025,(Andi Rice for Alabama Reflector)
Brantley Elementary Principal Adrienne Lee values transparency in academics, and making the usually stressful tests fun for her students.
“We do a lot of motivation here. We’re very unorthodox,” Lee said. “We’re doing a lot of music, we’re doing a lot of activities to push and motivate you.”
The school got a 56 on the 2022-2023 state report card, a result that surprised Lee. She started posting graphs depicting the school’s performance on recent state tests on Brantley Elementary’s colorful hallways.
“Instead of us taking that 56 and saying that’s who we are, we said, ‘That’s exactly who we started from,’” she said. “And we started to build ourselves.”
The school’s score increased to a 67 for the 2023-2024 report card.
“That motivation does a lot, and we motivate our kids a lot,” she said. “We’re playing music, we’re getting in the hallway, we’re dancing.”
Although recent test score data is not available at the school and district level, the fifth and sixth graders in Friday’s class knew how they did on the state test. Of the six students in her class on June 30, the average proficiency score was 2.6 out of 4 for math and 2.8 out of 4 for English Language Arts. Students are scored from level one to level four, where levels three and four are considered proficient. Statewide, 68% of fifth graders are proficient in ELA, and 40% of fifth graders are proficient in math.
“When I tell you they go hard, they work really hard, and they listen to everything that I taught them or told them to do. They implemented it no matter what, no matter how much homework I give them to do, they actually did it,” Friday said. “I’m really proud of them, because they put their best forward at all times.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ALR_Selma_063025-20-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-07-28 08:56:55.938548

(Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)More than 63 million Americans are caregivers for a family member with complex medical needs, a 20 million increase over the past decade, according to a new report.
But state policies, workplaces and the American health system haven’t kept up with this surge in family caregiving responsibilities, said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, a physician and the CEO of the AARP, which released the report with the National Alliance for Caregiving, a nonprofit policy and research organization.
“Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences, draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing,” Minter-Jordan told reporters on a call this week.
One of the biggest reasons for the surge in family caregivers is that Americans are living longer, yet they’re not necessarily healthier. There’s a 12-year gap between the average number of years that Americans live and the number of years they’re healthy.
The caregiving role typically involves helping a family member with daily tasks like bathing, dressing and eating. But more than half of caregivers also perform more complex medical tasks, such as managing catheters or administering injections, the report found.
A growing number of caregivers are so-called “sandwich caregivers” — parents caring for their children as well as for an adult family member, such as an aging parent. About 17 million people are sandwich caregivers, compared with 11 million a decade ago. And most caregivers are also working a job.
And while the bulk of caregiving still falls on women, 40% of American caregivers are men.
Some states have heeded the growing calls for action.
Earlier this year, Maine lawmakers created a state program to provide respite care, which includes services such as adult day care that give family caregivers a temporary break.
Also this year, Tennessee extended its pilot program that provides respite care for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, and also passed a bipartisan bill that directs the state Medicaid program to develop guidelines to allow family caregivers to be paid for their work.
Last year, Nebraska passed a tax credit for family caregivers; Oklahoma passed a similar law the year before. And while the United States is one of few countries that doesn’t mandate paid family leave at the federal level, 13 states and the District of Columbia have established their own paid family leave rules.
Meanwhile, the historic cuts to Medicaid enacted as part of the GOP’s Big, Beautiful Bill Act will shift health costs to states, leaving experts worried that family caregivers could lose Medicaid-funded services they rely on.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2154932283.jpg,,,2025-07-28 08:56:55.938548

(Andi Rice for Alabama Reflector)Our governor likes to say Alabama is “open for business.” Our leaders insist we are the most “pro-business” state in the nation.
This is, of course, situational. Private solar panel companies are effectively shut out of Alabama, thanks to a rooftop solar tax supported by Alabama Power and maintained by the Public Service Commission.
And the love of free markets and enterprise doesn’t extend to workers who take the initiative and try to get the best deal for their labor. That’s when celebrations of entrepreneurship turn into demands for obedience. (Nothing seems to enrage an Alabama politician more than the thought of an employee talking back.)

We also see this conditional support for business when we talk about the state’s workforce participation rate. Our leaders say they want to address it. But only up to a certain point.
Alabama has long struggled to get everyone who can work to do so. In June, about 58% of those who could work or look for a job in Alabama were in the workforce, compared with 62.5% of the country as a whole.
This lag goes back to 1976, if not earlier. Lack of access to affordable child care burdens workers. So do gaps in education and training. Transportation is another obstacle. The absence of mass transit in many parts of the state means those who can’t afford automobiles are stuck.
It’s a particular problem in rural areas, in part due to infrastructure challenges. In the most recent list of county workforce participation rates, only one of Alabama’s major urban areas (Mobile) fell below the state average.
But another significant factor is the aging of rural Alabama. The state as a whole is slightly older (median age 39.6 years) than the nation (39.2 years). But in Perry County, where the workforce participation rate was 35.4% in May, the median age is 42.5 years. In Tallapoosa County, where less than 49% of the population is in the workforce, it’s 45.4 years.
Getting younger people in the state will help boost workforce participation rates. And there’s a pretty obvious way to do that.
Immigration.
Among Hispanic Alabamians, one-third of whom were born outside the country, the median age is 24. Among Black Alabamians, with an immigrant population of 1.2%, the median age is 35. Among white Alabamians, of whom 1% are foreign-born, it’s almost 43. (The median age among the smaller Asian communities in the state is 37; over two-thirds of people in those groups were born outside the country.)
This doesn’t mean immigration on its own will solve our labor issues. Alabama will not attract the jobs that would bring people into struggling areas if infrastructure problems persist.
But bringing immigrants here would help. Not only are their participation rates higher than the country’s as a whole, the groups with the largest percentage of immigrants are having more children, who will eventually enter the workforce.
And yet, we are not doing that. We are persecuting the foreign-born.
It’s not enough that Gov. Kay Ivey can cut ads shamelessly mocking Hispanic immigrants. Now we have law enforcement agencies, apparently with no serious crimes to address, signing up to harass people for the high crime of not being a native-born Alabamian.
According to al.com, authorities arrested nearly 2,000 immigrants in the state through the end of June, more than had been arrested through all of 2024.
This is called a crackdown on people with criminal records. That’s facetious. In most of these cases, “criminal record” does not mean murder, assault or robbery. Just 3% of ICE arrests in Alabama involve violent criminals. it means being in the country without authorization, even if you’ve abided by every other law and paid taxes.
These are not people causing chaos. They are men and women seeking opportunities and trapped in a system that makes it very difficult to come to the United States legally.
One would hope the horrific treatment of people detained under this regime would cause some reflection. Our leaders, though, have no problem with terrorizing and traumatizing people they dislike, particularly women and transgender youth seeking health care.
So let’s go back to business. Every state official from Ivey on down claims to want to improve the workforce participation rate. Immigration would be a useful way to do that.
But instead, we have a state government all but cheering attacks on immigrants and discouraging them from coming here.
It’s hateful and wasteful and destructive. We once again look like the unquestioning toadies of whatever conservative figure holds the throne at the moment. And we give young people, whatever their national origin, even more reason to leave our state.
Which only adds to our workforce participation problems. But that doesn’t matter to our state leaders. The only “pro-business” attitude they have is ensuring workers obey their employers. And they’ll happily terrorize large swathes of our population to do so.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ALR_022225_Selects-40-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-07-28 08:56:55.938548

Katie Britt of Alabama is asking the White House to speed up the release of appropriated funds for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a major source of funding for the University of Alabama Birmingham (UAB).
In a July 24 letter to Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, Britt and 13 of her Senate Republican colleagues asked the administration to fully implement the Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, which was signed into law by President Donald Trump earlier this year and allocates funding for NIH initiatives at the previous year’s funding level.
“Senator Britt has been a strong advocate for ensuring the NIH remains the gold-standard of research and innovation across the nation and the world. She has continued to express the need for taxpayer dollars to be spent efficiently, judiciously, and accountably, which includes funding life-saving, groundbreaking research at high-achieving institutions like those in Alabama,” Grace Evans, communications director for Britt’s office, said in an email Friday.

Senators raised concerns in the letter about the slow pace of NIH funding disbursement for fiscal year 2025, which ends on September 30. The letter said withholding or delaying these funds could undermine critical research; risk jobs supported by scientific research and delay Americans’ access to life-saving treatments.
“Suspension of these appropriated funds — whether formally withheld or functionally delayed – could threaten Americans’ ability to access better treatments and limit our nation’s leadership in biomedical science,” the letter stated.
Alabama received $380 million in NIH funding in fiscal year 2024, with 88% of those funds, or $334.4 million, allocated to UAB. As of July 21, Alabama has received $190.9 million in NIH grants during fiscal year 2025, with approximately $166 million allocated to UAB, which is about the same share as the previous fiscal year.
UAB relies significantly on federal funding. According to a 2023 press release, UAB was in the top 1% of all NIH-funded institutions, including private, public and international organizations, with $413.7 million out of $774.5 million in research grants coming from NIH.
Hannah Echols, a spokesperson for UAB, said in a statement Friday that UAB appreciated Britt’s “continued efforts to support critical NIH funding that improves and saves lives.”
“We continue to monitor, assess and address the developments regarding recent federal activity. Our government affairs professionals are actively engaged on the matter,” Echols said.
In a Senate Appropriations Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee hearing in June with NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya, Britt discussed her personal legislative priorities aimed at addressing the nation’s high maternal mortality rates, particularly in states like Alabama, which faces significant challenges with maternal care deserts, pointing to legislation she sponsored to providing funding a NIH initiative to research causes of maternal mortality.
“When you look at rural areas in Alabama, we have one third of our state’s 67 counties are actually maternal care deserts, meaning they don’t have access to birthing facilities or maternal care providers. It’s 2025. These numbers should be moving in the opposite direction,” Britt said in her line of questioning.
In a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing in April, she introduced Dr. Barry Sleckman, director of UAB’s O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center to the committee, where she asked Sleckman to describe the Cancer Center’s work and how it’s “investing in that will ultimately change lives in the future.”
Britt also asked Sleckman to tell the committee “why federal funding is unique in cancer prevention research.”
“Federal funding is unique in cancer prevention research, in part, because there are not a lot of other revenue streams for cancer prevention. This is not really a high priority, for example, for industry and pharma, and so federal funding, to understand how to develop cancer prevention approaches, is critical,” Sleckman said in the April hearing.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC00579-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 08:56:55.938548

Where they’re located and why they’re unsafe,Andrew Brown,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/28/ct-lead-service-lines-what-to-know/,"There could be as many as 8,000 lead service lines connecting CT homes to the large water mains that run under the streets. What to know.","Lead plumbing was banned in the United States in 1986, but new data assembled by Connecticut’s water utilities show there may still be thousands of lead pipes carrying water into homes, apartments and some schools.
The Connecticut Mirror obtained hundreds of reports from the state Department of Public Health that show there could be as many as 8,000 lead service lines connecting people’s homes to the large water mains that run under the streets.
The state’s community water systems, which supply more than three-quarters of the state’s population with drinking water, began sending out notices late last year warning homeowners and renters that their service line could contain the toxic metal.
Every public water system across the country is now required to identify and replace all of the remaining lead service lines within the next 10 years. In the meantime, however, many utility customers are questioning how to protect themselves and their families from potential lead exposure. 
Here’s what you need to know.
What is a lead service line and what’s the concern? 
Service lines are the pipes that connect buildings to the larger water mains that run below many sidewalks and roads in Connecticut. Those lines can be made of all types of material, including plastic, copper, galvanized steel and lead. 
Between the late 1800s and the 1930s, it was not uncommon for homebuilders and water utilities to use lead to make those plumbing connections. And in many parts of the country, lead was considered a viable option until the federal ban in 1986. 
The issue with lead plumbing is that the metal can leach into the water that is running through the pipes. And that is a problem because no level of lead in the human body is considered safe. 
In adults, elevated levels of lead can affect kidney function and can contribute to cardiovascular problems, and in children it can cause developmental delays, learning difficulties and behavioral problems. 
How many lead service lines remain in Connecticut and where are they located? 
According to the data compiled by Connecticut’s community water systems, there could be nearly 8,000 lead service lines still in the ground — though that number is likely to change as officials continue to inspect homes and dig up old water lines.
Those lead lines are not distributed equally throughout the state, however. Some utilities are finding very little lead in their systems, while others are predicting that hundreds or thousands of homes, apartments and other buildings could be affected. 
The initial data provided to the Connecticut Department of Public Health shows that places like Bridgeport, Waterbury, Willimantic, New London, Middletown and Greenwich contain significant numbers of lead service lines. Some utilities, however, are just beginning to assess how many lead lines might remain in their systems. 
The number of lead service lines in a water system is largely dependent on what years the public water system was built and what materials the utilities used over their history to make service connections. 
How do I know if I have a lead service line?
Many utilities have created maps that allow water customers to search their address to learn whether they have a lead service line or not. Aquarion Water, Connecticut Water Company and many of the state’s larger municipal water systems, have links to those maps online. 
CT Mirror created a search tool for the 60 largest water systems in the state.

The new federal regulations required utilities to send out notices to customers if they suspected that the service line contained lead or if they were unsure what material the service line is made of.
Some utilities are also soliciting help from their customers in identifying lead service lines. Many utility companies have asked customers to take photos of their water lines where they enter the basement or crawl space.
And they’ve provided step by step guides, like this one, for how to investigate what material was used for their service line.
Why are officials investigating these lines now and what are they going to do about them?
While lead plumbing was banned in the mid 1980s, the push to remove older lead service lines did not gain traction until after the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, in 2014.
That crisis was created when officials in Flint changed the source of the city’s drinking water, and it resulted in service lines and other plumbing leaching significant amounts of lead into people’s tap water.
To try to prevent similar public health emergencies, federal officials adopted new federal regulations last year requiring every utility serving more than 25 people to identify how many lead lines they have and to replace all of those lines in the next 10 years.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates there could be between 6 million to 10 million still in use throughout the United States. 
Replacing all of those service lines is likely to be an expensive and time-consuming process. In the meantime, most utilities will continue to treat their water with corrosion inhibitors — compounds that help prevent plumbing from leaching large amounts of lead into people’s tap water.
What precautions can I take if my home has a lead service line? 
The Connecticut Department of Public Health and many of the state’s water utilities are advising customers with suspected or confirmed lead service lines to take several precautionary steps to limit their potential exposure.

If this week’s funding drives offer any insight, that answer is a resounding yes.
WABE, Atlanta’s local NPR affiliate, raised half a million dollars in its first week of fundraising since Congress voted to claw back $1.1 billion in federal funding that had already been approved for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, according to president and CEO Jennifer Dorian. 

 



How to support Georgia’s public media organizations

GPB: Visit gpb.org/federal-funding
 




The CPB provides federal funds to organizations like National Public Radio, the Public Broadcasting Service, and local public media stations across the country. During the most recent fiscal year, Georgia received nearly $6.6 million in CPB grants. That money went to five different stations across the state: WABE, Georgia Public Broadcasting, WCLK, WJSP and WUGA.
The bill, which in addition to slashing public media funding also eliminates $8 billion in foreign aid, cleared the House last Friday by a 216-213 margin. All nine Republican members of the Georgia delegation voted in favor of the bill, and the state’s five Democratic House members voted against it. Georgia’s two senators, both Democrats, also voted against the legislation, which passed in a 51-48 vote in the Senate. President Donald Trump signed the bill into law Thursday.
But critics have warned about the devastating impact the funding cuts could have on rural Americans, particularly those who live in news deserts. Holes in local broadcast coverage could also become more glaring during severe weather events such as hurricanes, when prolonged power outages could restrict access to other types of news.
“Radio is one of the most effective and affordable means of communication that humans have,” Dorian said. “In a case of an extreme weather event or in any kind of emergency, people are super reliant on radio broadcasting.”
WABE, which serves 258,000 listeners per week, is now expecting a $1.9 million shortfall this year, which constitutes 13% of its budget. 
For GPB, which operates nine public television stations across the state and was slated to receive $4.2 million from CPB this year, federal funding accounts for 10% of their revenue. They also receive funding from Georgia’s state budget, as well as from donors.
“GPB leadership anticipated a rapidly changing federal funding environment and in response, has conducted careful scenario planning in preparation for multiple outcomes,” GPB said in a statement this week. “We are grateful to the Georgia General Assembly for providing level funding for this year and thankful for our many loyal donors across the state and beyond.”
Both outlets have launched emergency fundraising drives in response to the new law, hoping that Georgia residents will be able to help make up the remainder of the funds. GPB has not publicly disclosed how much their fundraising drive has raised.
Though the money raised by WABE is not yet enough to fill the organization’s $1.9 million funding gap, Dorian said it’s a strong start. 
“We still have a ways to go, as you can imagine, and we are counting on everyone in Atlanta to chip in, whether it’s a small amount or a large amount,” Dorian said. 
But amid all the chaos, she has found an unlikely silver lining.
“This is not going to be a public-private partnership anymore,” she said. “This is now going to be 100% community funded, which also makes us a 100% independent newsroom.”

(Photo courtesy U.S. Department of Energy.)Last week’s energy auction by multistate power grid operator PJM will cause most Marylanders’ monthly electric bills to go up $2 to $5 next summer — but that’s on top of other costs, for transmission, fuel and more, that one advocate calls “death by a thousand cuts.”
It’s also the latest evidence, say ratepayer advocates and policymakers, that policies of PJM, the grid operator in a 13-state region that includes Maryland, are out of whack.
The latest of the “thousand cuts” is mostly the result of energy-guzzling data centers, David Lapp, the Maryland People’s Counsel, who is charged with representing state ratepayers. Predictions for their proliferation are largely behind inflated projections of energy demand in PJM states, pushing demand past supply in the auction process, sending the price skyward.
And ultimately, consumers pay the price.
“It’s fundamentally unfair,” Lapp said. “Why should residential customers be responsible for costs being driven by some of the biggest and wealthiest corporations in the world?”
At the same time, consumer advocates say PJM policies have restricted supply, with a backlogged queue for energy projects, many of them renewable energy proposals.
“Until there’s actual queue reform, there’s not going to be real relief,” said Emily Scarr, a senior adviser for Maryland PIRG, or Public Interest Research Group.
All eyes were on this year’s auction because last year’s was a blockbuster: The clearing price jumped 800% compared to the 2023 auction, setting a record for the most expensive such auction in PJM history.
This year’s auction surpassed that record, but it was offset by policies that consumer advocates — and some governors — pushed PJM to adopt.
Energy bills likely to tick up again in 2026 after electricity auction clears at maximum price

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) was behind a new cap on the auction’s clearing price. The auction hit the cap, saving consumers about $2.9 billion in total costs on their bills. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) supported Shapiro’s appeal.
As various parts of energy bills increase, grid decision-makers don’t seem to be asking a key question, says Laurel Peltier, a low-income ratepayer advocate for the AARP: “Can people afford this?”
During a news conference Tuesday, Stu Bresler, a PJM executive vice president of market services and strategy, said that auction costs are a “small part of retail bills, and it also varies” how auction costs translate into rate changes for consumers.
But Peltier said that ignores key context.
“That’s like being in a bakery, and you know that the flour got more expensive, the butter got more expensive, the labor got more expensive, and you’re the egg maker, and your eggs are 800% more, and you’re like, ‘It’s OK. It’s just a little part,’” Peltier said.
When it comes to bill increases from the capacity auction, BGE customers are the exception. The segment of their bills tied to the auction will actually go down an estimated $3.36 per month, according to Office of People’s Counsel calculations.
But that’s really only because their rates soared so high after last year’s capacity auction at PJM.
PJM forced a Baltimore-area coal-fired plant, Brandon Shores, and oil-burning plant, H.A. Wagner, to keep running beyond their announced closure dates. But PJM’s rules kept that power out of the 2024 auction, suppressing expected supply at a time of surging demand.
This time, after urging from Lapp’s office and others, the rules were changed so that power from the two older plants was counted. And BGE customers will actually receive a credit for any revenue that the plants’ owner, Talen Energy, receives from the auction, Lapp said, lowering their bills, contrary to initial predictions from PJM.
But their monthly electric bills will still be up $16 from two auctions ago.
Changes inside PJM?
In a July 16 letter to PJM, a bipartisan group of nine governors in PJM’s 13-state territory — including Moore and Shapiro — said the moment presents an opportunity for change.
With the “abrupt termination of two long-standing members of the Board of Managers and the imminent departure of the CEO,” their replacements must “understand the concerns of ratepayers facing rising costs,” and create “a more collaborative and more effective ethos” at PJM, the governors wrote.










It’s fundamentally unfair. Why should residential customers be responsible for costs being driven by some of the biggest and wealthiest corporations in the world?


– David Lapp, Maryland Office of People's Counsel


“In the past, other regions looked to join PJM due to its many strengths; today, across the region, discussions of leaving PJM are becoming increasingly common,” read their letter.
In a July 18 response, PJM Board of Managers Chairman David Mills pushed back.
“Our operators are keeping the lights on through some of the most challenging circumstances that any grid operator, anywhere, has faced in its history,” he wrote. “We also continue the necessary function of operating regional markets as well as planning for a grid that is seeing an explosion of demand growth at the same time that state and federal policies have pushed a meaningful amount of generation capacity into retirement.”
He listed a number of changes PJM has made to its auction “to address concerns raised by our states,” including the “temporary” cap.
In a statement announcing the auction results Tuesday, PJM wrote that it “continues to focus on enhancing its process for connecting new generation resources onto the system, which includes clearing all the projects in its transition queue over the next 18 months, opening its new cycle process in spring 2026, and leveraging artificial intelligence through our partnership with Google to reduce processing time.”
Regime change may help, but some advocates warn that more transformative change may be necessary to lower prices. That includes changing how the organization is governed, Lapp said.
“We and the 13 other state consumer advocate offices in PJM — we get one vote. There are transmission-owning utilities that have more votes than us together,” Lapp said. “It’s the transmission owners that wield the most influence at PJM.”
Those same companies generally lose out when more power generation comes online, Scarr said.

“The legacy power plants lose out when that happens — but they’re the ones managing the ship,” Scarr said.
In a statement Thursday, Moore spokesman Carter Elliott IV wrote that Moore is “demanding reform and a meaningful voice for states in PJM governance, which is why a bipartisan group of governors’ staff met with PJM members” on Wednesday, including Moore’s staff.
A spokesman for PJM pointed to a fact sheet describing the grid operator’s governance structure, which highlights that PJM’s 10-member Board of Managers must not be financially tied to any PJM member. But on the member’s committee, which includes about 1,000 members, votes are divided between five industry sectors. State consumer advocates are the other voting members.
Data center debacle
When she hears ominous predictions for data center demand on the PJM grid, Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D-Montgomery) is skeptical.
The massive computing facilities have a sprawling footprint in Northern Virginia that has quickly inflated power demand in that region. But it remains an open question how widespread they will become, she said.
“You have the data centers that are sort of playing the field. There’s a real question right now about: Are we overcounting data center load? If the same data center is checking out five different locations, how are we sure?” said Charkoudian, who closely studies energy issues and is frequently behind energy legislation in the General Assembly.
It’s part of the reason she was dismayed to see Moore veto two bills that would have studied energy issues, citing their cost. One bill created a Strategic Energy Planning Office in Maryland, focused on predicting future energy issues without relying on PJM and utility companies; the second studied data centers specifically.
“Right now we’re continually caught flat-footed,” said Charkoudian, who added that she supports veto overrides for those bills.
Lapp said he also worries that data center projections are overblown because technology could be advancing to increase power efficiency at the facilities, which are full of computer servers that require immense amounts of energy to run and to keep from overheating.
That’s a major reason why data centers themselves should be footing the bill for their own power demand, and the upgrades to the power system they may require, Lapp said.
“If the data centers aren’t responsible for paying for all the costs that they are driving, they have much less incentive to find more computer chips, to operate more efficiently, to reduce their own costs,” he said.
It’s PJM’s job to change the paradigm, wherein ratepayers pay for enhancing the electric system, he said.
“It’s an unprecedented period of time in the industry, when you have city-sized demand being built up in just a few years,” Lapp said. “You can’t treat that the same as load growth gradually occurring over time.”

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)By Matt Dragon
While a lot of the focus has been on the chaos in Washington, DC over the tax bill that would represent the largest transfer of wealth to the ultra-wealthy in our history, New Jersey’s legislators and Gov. Phil Murphy are responsible for an equally unjust budget, written largely out of the public eye.
It’s easy to see why so many voters sit out elections, or say they don’t see the difference in their lives regardless of election outcome, when we see parallel stories playing out in Democratic-controlled New Jersey and in Republican-controlled D.C. The budget process in Trenton has long been criticized as “three white dudes in a room,” which needs to be addressed head-on. But it also doesn’t seem to yield very good results, with rushed votes right before the deadline, and multiple recent instances of “clean-up bills” needed to fix up mistakes no one had a chance to notice before the fast-tracked passage to meet the deadline.
In the few days before the vote, as the actual shape of the state’s new budget became apparent, there were several red flags. The affordable housing trust fund is being raided to plug holes elsewhere in the budget, continuing a long line of one-off budget “fixes” at the expense of much-needed programs. What could have been a moment of real celebration with the passage of a mansion tax to create a more equitable tax system has instead been undermined, potentially leaving affordable housing in New Jersey worse off than it started.
It’s not just the public that’s kept in the dark. Even Attorney General Matt Platkin, with whom I have my own disagreements, was shocked to find out that $45 million from the state’s share of the national opioid settlement was being diverted to four major hospital chains in the state. One of those hospital chains, RWJBarnabas Health, will receive $15 million, which definitely has nothing to do with the fact that longtime Murphy chief of staff, limited-time-only U.S. senator from New Jersey George Helmy fell into a high paying role at the health care giant when he departed the Murphy administration in 2023. A very Jersey career arc, but this simply isn’t how functional governments govern.
Unfortunately, New Jersey’s new budget and its process, cloaked in secrecy, intentionally devoid of meaningful public input, and inarguably rushed, is nothing new, nor limited to budget bills. In 2020, a bill to allow Horizon to convert to a for-profit entity was introduced in the last few days of the lame duck session before the end-of-year Legislative holiday. Horizon is the largest health insurer in New Jersey and the health insurance provider for the State Health Benefits Plan offered to state employees (also an option for municipal and county workforces). That bill was moved through committee with amendments that the public had never seen — and let’s be honest, the legislators probably never read them either.
Surprising no one, after the restructuring was approved, Horizon jacked up state plan premiums more than 20%, despite its new, “more competitive” for-profit form. In the three years after the misguided bill was rushed through the Legislature without transparency, Horizon paid out $35 million in bonuses, with just under $13 million going to the new CEO.
Flash forward to this year, and the governor and legislators have a plan to take $100 million from public employees. We could cover 10% of the $100 million in desired savings just from one Horizon executive’s bonus. Are our teachers, firefighters, and snow-plow operators getting bonuses like that?
To add insult to injury, the Horizon board has been a rotating clown car of former state legislators, which seems to have done nothing to protect the state’s or their former constituents’ interests.
The system is clearly broken, but the challenge is getting those who broke it — and benefit from its brokenness — to fix it. While voters are effectively locked out of the process, every state Assembly member and senator has the power to force change. It’s not about party, it’s about whether you were elected to represent — or to rule over.
So our legislators need to learn:

If you’re representing us, you can’t vote bills out of committee that we’ve never seen.
If you’re representing our best interests, you can’t vote bills out of committee that exist only as a few bullets on a napkin.
If you’re representing the people, you actually have to engage with and listen to those people, and you have to do that before you decide how to vote.

They need to slow things down and:

Hold actual public hearings, where you don’t give priority to retired lawmakers, and instead prioritize testimony from the actual public, not professional lobbyists.
Make those public hearings accessible, as most people can’t drive to Trenton and spend six hours sitting around waiting to testify during working hours.
Refuse to vote on things that weren’t on public committee agendas for at least a week before the hearing.
Refuse to vote on amendments that haven’t been released publicly for at least 72 hours.
Work with the legislative and technology offices to ensure that full bill text and amendment text are actually public on the New Jersey Legislature site before bills come before committees. 

Your chamber leaders will hate you, your committee chairs will despise you, but voters will support you. You have to reestablish trust, or election turnouts will continue to dwindle and more and more residents will, rightfully, feel like they’re on the outside, and that you’re not interested in representing them. Your chamber and committee leadership are not your bosses; your constituents are.

There has never been a case where restricting speech on a political matter to such a degree has gone well. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Habib Meiloud: Do not support bill H.310.","This commentary is by Habib Meiloud of central Vermont.


I recently learned about bill H.310 and find it troubling on multiple levels. Mainly, it’s a seemingly purposeful attempt to conflate anti-Zionism and critique of the State of Israel with antisemitism. 
Not only is this comparison false, but it is also extremely concerning when considered in the context of education. 
To be clear, I fully support mandating that the Holocaust be taught in every single Vermont school. I take issue with the attempt to infringe on students’ rights to critique a state. 
There is no other country in the world where the critique of its policies is so easily twisted into hate speech against its people. 
If I critique the state of Ethiopia for its slaughter of the Tigray people, am I considered to be racist? Of course not — because there is a difference between critiquing those in power and discrimination against people. 
Every Vermont student should be able to discuss openly their thoughts and opinions on Israel or any other country. Stifling warranted conversation is not the solution to the rise in antisemitism that we have seen. The way we fight that antisemitism and all hate is by education and discussion. 
There has never been a case where restricting speech on a political matter to such a degree has gone well. 
I recognize, however, that a discussion without a solid educational foundation can easily become hateful. So I would hope that supporters of this bill would also support having students have a full education of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and not starting on Oct. 7, 2023, but rather in 1917, the year of the Balfour Declaration. That way, students can understand the nuances of the conversation. 
However, H.310 does not accomplish that goal. All it does is start to set up Vermont’s students to become complacent in the face of national acts, out of fear of retribution. 
Is this the lesson we want to signal to our kids? Can that adversity only be solved by forceful legislation? If that is not what you want, then do not support H.310.

As anti-immigration rhetoric surges across Europe and the United States, it is vital that we look beyond the fearmongering and analyse what is really going on. While human mobility is often presented as a burden, the truth is quite the opposite. It is an essential driver of economic growth, demographic resilience and cultural cohesion.
Ignoring this fact is not just a miscalculation – it flies in the face of both empirical evidence and the democratic principles that modern societies claim to defend.
Migration is also not a 21st century anomaly. From the Mediterranean diasporas of antiquity to the mass migrations of the 20th century, human history has been defined by movement. City-states, colonial empires and modern nation-states have been built – and rebuilt – through the movement of people, languages, knowledge and goods. Presenting human mobility as a threat ignores this historical pattern, and tries to turn the exception – isolation – into the rule.
Any political discourse that presents migrants as intruders, rather than as potential citizens or economic agents, is a dangerous distortion, not only in moral but also in strategic terms.
 Migration drives economies

In 2016, an analysis by the McKinsey Global Institute drew some compelling conclusions. While migrants accounted for only 3.3% of the global population in 2015, they generated 9.4% of global GDP that year – about $6.7 trillion. In the United States alone, their contribution amounted to about $2 trillion.
More recent studies confirm this. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated in 2024 that net migration flows to the eurozone between 2020 and 2023 – including millions of Ukrainian refugees – may raise the region’s potential GDP by an additional 0.5% by 2030. This is not a marginal amount, as it represents roughly half of all expected potential growth. Without migration, Europe’s economic horizon would be considerably more limited.
 Workers, innovation, growth

In the US, more than 31 million immigrants were part of the labour market in 2023 – 19% of the total, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Their participation rate (meaning the percentage of the working-age population that is active in the labour market) was 67%, compared to 62% of native-born workers. This difference signals a disproportionate contribution to tax revenue, domestic consumption and economic dynamism in general.

  Labour force participation rate in the US: immigrants have been more active participants in the labour market than their native-born counterparts for nearly two decades. (Council on Foreign Relations)
Statistics also show that immigrants do not compete on a level playing field: they tend to work in physically demanding jobs, or in those that are not covered by locals. This reinforces the idea that they complement, rather than substitute, native-born workers. This role becomes even more significant in contexts of full employment or population ageing.

 Migration and innovation

Migration brings not only workers, but also new ideas. According to the World Economic Forum, immigrants to the US are 80% more likely to start new businesses than native-born people, and more than 40% of Fortune 500 companies were founded by migrants or their descendants.
This pattern is repeated in academia and technology: a significant proportion of patents filed in the United States have at least one foreign inventor. The country’s leading universities also depend on international students to sustain their science, technology, engineering and mathematics programmes. In other words, closing borders means closing the door to innovation.
In the European Union, their impact is no less significant. According to the 2024 IMF report, between 2019 and 2023, two thirds of new jobs were filled by non-EU migrants. These statistics refute the idea that migrants “steal jobs”. On the contrary, they fill structural vacancies that neither automation nor the internal market has been able to fill.
Moreover, the OECD warned in 2025 that if more women, older people and immigrants are not brought into the labour market, GDP per capita growth in member countries could fall from 1% per year (2000-2020) to a meagre 0.6% by 2060. Conversely, a more inclusive migration policy could add at least 0.1 percentage point to annual growth.
 Sending money home

The 2024 World Migration Report confirmed that global remittances – immigrants sending money to family members in their country of origin – reached $831 billion in 2022, a growth of more than 650% from 2000.
This far exceeds official development assistance and even, in many cases, foreign direct investment. However, they perform a similar function – remittances are mainly invested in health, education and housing.
They are, in effect, a global redistribution of wealth that does not pass through any multilateral system. For the people who receive them, their impact is stabilising, and profoundly humane.
 Looking forwards

This is not just a question of economics. When political and social rhetoric starts to exclude those perceived as outsiders, it undermines their capacity to adapt and change. Ignoring the evidence comes at a great cost, which can be summarised in three areas:

Economic losses: reduced immigration means giving up a structural source of growth, innovation and fiscal sustainability.
Social instability: anti-immigration discourse feeds the stigmas that fracture coexistence and weaken social cohesion.
Geopolitical weakness: less immigration means losing influence in a world increasingly defined by intense competition for talent and human capital.

The good news is that there are tried and tested solutions. From streamlining professional accreditation processes to regional migration coordination systems, there are already tools available to governments. The challenge is a political and, above all, narrative one. Public opinion – which is shaped by political rhetoric – needs to recognise and embrace the value of human mobility as part of our contemporary social contract.
As the World Economic Forum rightly points out, migration is not a problem to be solved, but a strategic asset to be managed intelligently and humanely. To underestimate it is to undermine the foundations of global development in the 21st century.

(Getty Images)The last Indiana biennial budget faced significant challenges, which seem certain to worsen. Still, it is not short-term fluctuations that challenge us, but rather the long-term changes to how we spend our state tax dollars. 
The economic forecast for 2025-6 turned sour because of the emerging trade war. That cut $2 billion from the state budget forecast over the next two fiscal years, and was followed by further belt-tightening steps in preparation for what is almost certain to be more bad economic news through 2026-7.
Hoosier lawmakers are obligated to balance our budget, and keep roughly $2.4 billion, a bit more than 5% of a biennium budget in reserve. That’s a healthy, but not excessive reserve. We saw nearly a 5% decline in Indiana’s gross domestic product in 2008, which combined with what is charitably described as a stochastic federal budgeting approach should worry state lawmakers.  
There are always issues to complain about in a state budget, but the bigger focus of interest should be on long-term budgeting issues. The question should be how much are we taxing and spending, and where are we allocating those dollars.  
Analysis: Latest Indiana budget drops spending 7% — with cuts ‘telling’

This is not as easy as it seems. The state government took over the last 15% of school operational funding in 2010, so comparisons in earlier years require some adjustment. At the same time, our local spending as a share of GDP and local government employment are both below where they sat two decades ago. 
Recent local tax cuts, primarily to businesses, are likely to push local spending back to 1990s levels by 2026. I note this, because lower local spending places more pressure on state services.  
State spending as a share of GDP dropped from 10.9% in 2004 to 9.6% in 2024, despite the 2010 takeover of school operational funding. But, the year-to-year variation has been significant. In 2014, the state spent only 8.3% of GDP, and in 2022-3 spent 10.7% of GDP.  
It is fair to say that without dipping into the reserves, state spending in the 2026-7 budget as a share of our economy is likely to be among the lowest of the past two decades. But the far bigger issue is how we are spending those dollars. 
The state budget fits nicely into some big categories – K-12 and higher education, food assistance, Medicaid, corrections, transportation and housing. The ‘other’ spending categories of environmental, economic development and a slew of miscellaneous funds has been fairly stable, with one exception – a rapid burst in economic development spending, primarily on the LEAP district.










if we spent the same share of GDP on education today as we did in 2010, K-12 and higher education institutions in the state would receive $3.2 billion more each year in spending.


I think it is helpful to place the ‘people focused’ budget items into two broad categories – those that help prevent poverty, and those that mitigate the effects of poverty. Transportation is best left by itself in this analysis. 
As of last year, Indiana spending on all transportation items – road maintenance and capital investment, along with safety and bridges was 0.31% of our GDP. That is well below the 21st century average of 0.50% of GDP, and near inflation adjusted lows.  
Even with the changes in gasoline taxes, our highway and road spending are deeply stressed. That is why the governor is pushing for more local spending via a wheel tax while also pursuing tolls on federal highways. He is right to pursue both of these.  
Helping Hoosiers
The bigger changes we’ve seen come in the allocation of funding between state government activities that help ensure prosperity, and those that treat poverty. 
The two big “pro-prosperity” programs at the state level are quite obviously, education. The programs that treat poverty are food assistance, Medicaid, corrections and housing.  
Our spending on pursuing prosperity is lower than in 2010, by every relevant measure. In 2010, we spent 2.77% of our GDP on education, today that figure is 2.16%. The biggest cuts have been in higher education, but in K-12 we are spending $100 less per student each year today than in 2010. Furthermore, if we spent the same share of GDP on education today as we did in 2010, K-12 and higher education institutions in the state would receive $3.2 billion more each year in spending.  
As a side note, all my data are in inflation adjusted dollars – the approach used by anyone who is honestly comparing spending across time. 
On programs that attempt to remediate the effects of poverty, our spending has grown substantially. Altogether, the share of our state’s economy we spend on these four big programs has risen by 0.34%.  This extra spending since 2010 translates into an additional $1.8 billion spent each year to mitigate poverty.   
The sole culprit here is Medicaid. In 2010 we spent 0.57% of our GDP on Medicaid. That rose to 1.12% in 2023-24.  
Today, Indiana has worse educational outcomes, and higher poverty spending than we did in 2010.  The challenge of the next decade is to reverse these trends.  That just won’t happen without more fiscal capacity aimed at education.

Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, D-Skamania County, who is bracing for a pitched fight to keep her seat representing southwest Washington, raised $904,000 in the most recent reporting period. 
Meanwhile, Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Sunnyside, arguably the state’s most at-risk Republican House member, is stockpiling cash ahead of another tussle with MAGA Republican Jerrod Sessler in central Washington.
Here is a round-up of money raised by Washington’s incumbent House members and opponents between April 1 and June 30 as reported to the Federal Election Commission. 
Washington’s battleground district
Gluesenkamp Perez was first elected in 2022, capturing the 3rd Congressional District seat that Republicans had held for a dozen years. She spent nearly $12 million to win reelection in 2024.
It is not going to be easier in 2026. The National Republican Congressional Committee is already criticizing her with a drumbeat of press releases and ads, as at least two recognized Republicans have looked at entering the race. 
Two people have stepped up to challenge her – Republican Antony Barran and Democrat Brent William Hennrich. Barran raised $9,300 and Hennrich brought in  $7,400, according to their campaign disclosures.
With her haul of a little over $900,000, Gluesenkamp Perez had $1.1 million on hand June 30, according to her FEC filings.
Tim Gowen, campaign manager for Gluesenkamp Perez, said in an email last week the congresswoman “is ready to put her record of fighting our fentanyl crisis and leveling the playing field for everyday people up against anyone.”
A third round
In November, Newhouse secured a sixth term representing the 4th District by defeating Jerrod Sessler, a candidate backed by Donald Trump.
Newhouse has been scorned by MAGA Republicans since he voted to impeach Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. But the congressman has defended his seat twice since that vote.
He raised $261,000 this last cycle and, after expenses, had $339,000 on hand.
Sessler, who also ran in 2022, is the lone challenger so far for 2026. The Prosser resident raised nearly $60,000 in the quarter and close to $184,000 for the election cycle. However, he’s spent most of it and had a little under $8,300 on hand June 30.
In a statement, Sessler expressed confidence, saying, “I’ve got President Trump’s support and all those who want to see Washington state return to sanity.”
A campaign spokesman for Newhouse said the congressman is delivering “positive results” and that if Sessler runs again, “the result won’t be any different than the last two times.”
Packed House
Rep. Adam Smith, who is getting challenged from the political left and right in the 9th District, collected $226,000 and had $659,000 banked at the close of the filing period.
Kshama Sawant, the socialist who served a decade on the Seattle City Council, may be his best-known opponent. Sawant formally kicked off her campaign in early June and raised $87,000 by the end of the month.
Melissa Chaudhry, a Democrat who lost to Smith in November, looks to be running again. She reported $107,000 in her campaign account, nearly all of it carried over from her 2024 campaign. 
Republicans Mark Greene, who ran unsuccessfully last year, and Janis Clark filed campaign committee paperwork this month. 
A rematch?
Republican Rep. Michael Baumgartner received 60.6% of the vote when he beat Democrat Carmela Conroy in November in the 5th District. The two Spokane residents could duel again next year.
The first-term congressman got $228,000 in contributions and ended with $435,000 on June 30, based on federal reports. Conroy had a little more than $73,000 on hand after a quarter in which she raised $68,000.
Ann Marie Danimus, a Spokane Democrat who ran in 2024, looks to be eyeing another bid for the seat as well as she registered her campaign committee in mid-June. 
The rest of the pack
Six Democratic House members, most without announced opponents, boosted their totals.
Rep. Suzan DelBene of Medina raised $581,000 and had $1.2 million on hand as she eyes another term in the 1st Congressional District. She also chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, making her a point person in the party’s effort to recapture the House majority in next year’s midterms.
Rep. Rick Larsen of Everett, who first won his 2nd Congressional District in 2000, brought in $331,000 and ended with nearly $415,000 in his campaign account.
Rep. Emily Randall of Bremerton, in her first term serving the 6th Congressional District, collected $203,000 and closed with $128,000 banked as she eyes a reelection run.
In the 7th District, Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Seattle hauled in an impressive $609,000 and, after expenses, finished this cycle with $2.2 million on hand. The former chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus has been an unyielding opposition voice to the Trump administration.
In the neighboring 8th District, Rep. Kim Schrier of Sammamish reported nearly $466,000 raised and $2.5 million in her coffers. Earlier this month, Republican Bob Hagglund of Granite Falls filed as a candidate with the Federal Election Commission. Hagglund ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in 2024.
Rep. Marilyn Strickland of Tacoma, looking to retain her seat in the 10th District, reported $295,000 in contributions and had banked $685,000 through June 30. No opponents had signed up a campaign committee as of Friday.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/money-rake-1024x680.jpeg,,,2025-07-28 07:57:23.627213

(Courtesy of Cooperative Energy Futures)More than 180 local households will see significantly lower energy bills after the solar array atop Abbott Northwestern Hospital’s new parking ramp powers up later this year. 
Abbot Northwestern — Twin Cities’ largest private hospital — will enjoy similar savings while hosting Minneapolis nonprofit Cooperative Energy Futures’ newest community solar garden for at least the next 25 years. 
It’s CEF’s second ramp-top solar garden — after the 3,760-panel installation at Ramp A in downtown Minneapolis — and one of its largest yet. Community solar garden subscribers typically save 20% to 30% on their monthly electricity bills, CEF says. Fifty-five percent of subscribers in the Abbott Northwestern garden qualify as low- or moderate-income. Canopy-style arrays like this one provide shade for people and cars in summer and reduce snow removal crews’ workloads come winter.
Perks like these helped CEF find long-term hosts for and draw nearly 1,000 subscribers to its 10 existing community solar gardens, a mix of rooftop and canopy arrays in the Twin Cities and ground-mounted installations farther out. CEF plans to energize at least three more gardens this year and has five projects in earlier stages of development, according to its 2025 annual report.
The future of projects like these are in doubt since the election of President Donald Trump, which has ushered in a federal government bent on making it harder for Americans to access affordable, non-polluting electricity.
Trump signed a partisan budget law on July 4 that sunsets federal solar tax credits years ahead of schedule while boosting already-generous fossil fuel subsidies, sending solar developers scrambling to grandfather as many projects as possible under the current rules. Days later, Trump made good on an apparent side deal with congressional conservatives and ordered the U.S. Treasury Department to take a hard line on those rules, possibly by increasing the amount of early investment projects need before they can qualify. Developers expect final guidance sometime next month, soon after Trump’s latest tariffs take effect (or not).
“Our lawyers are really trying to define our deadlines and we’re going to push as much as we can before we have to reorient,” CEF’s Dan Grantier told The Reformer at the Abbot Northwestern ribbon-cutting event.

The Abbot Northwestern project illustrates the potential for creative uses of a solar garden in an urban environment. Hospital owner Allina Health approached CEF in 2019 as part of a campaign to endear its Midtown Minneapolis neighbors to the new parking ramp it needed for a major campus expansion, Allina Vice President of Facilities Tony LaCroix-Dalluhn recently told The Reformer. 
“A parking structure is not exactly a welcome addition to the neighborhood, so we came up with a community solar garden to make it more appealing,” along with less conspicuous nods to sustainability, like a “maxed out” 200-stall bike parking area with showers and a pollinator garden along the Midtown Greenway, LaCroix-Dalluhn said. 
“There’s not much benefit for us, but it’s great for the community,” he said.
Minnesota helped kickstart the American community solar movement thanks in large part to legislation championed by the late State Rep. Melissa Hortman and the doggedness of homegrown developers like CEF, which began weatherizing older Minneapolis homes in the late aughts.  With more installed community solar capacity than all but three other states — more than 900 times the maximum output of the Abbott Northwestern system — Minnesota continues to punch well above its weight. 
Despite Trump’s war on decarbonization, states and municipalities that care about climate change and energy access will continue to support solar development. Minnesota needs to add a lot more solar panels — as well as wind turbines and other carbon-free sources and batteries to provide grid stability — to meet its mandate for 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040, giving developers like CEF and dozens of smaller rooftop solar installation businesses clarity on long-term demand. House Democrats gave the industry another boost in the June special legislative session when they killed a budget provision that would have ended Minnesota’s community solar program in three years. 
And despite tightening municipal budgets, some Minnesota cities offer generous incentives for residential and commercial solar projects. Businesses qualify for up to $50,000 and residential buyers’ groups up to $175,000 from the Minneapolis Green Cost Share program, for example.
“If you’re looking to build a parking ramp in Minneapolis, we want to talk to you,” Grantier said.
Even without federal subsidies, solar and backup batteries increasingly make financial sense for utility customers, said Michael Allen, cofounder and CEO of All Energy Solar. 
But the slow, cumbersome process of getting new systems approved and connected to the grid — typically a 40-to-60-day wait for Xcel Energy customers “if everything goes smoothly,” he said — scares some prospects off and raises costs for the rest. Larger arrays can take many months or years to get utility approval, though Grantier said urban neighborhoods like Midtown tend to have more slack in the grid.
“Where legislators and regulators can really make a difference is by holding (utilities’) feet to the fire and taking a stand to improve things for Minnesotans,” Allen said.
Otherwise, he warned, more utility customers may take matters into their own hands and look for ways to reduce their reliance on the grid.
 “The more we fight each other, the greater the desire there is to do something different,” he said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/solar-garden-2-1024x578.jpg,,,2025-07-28 07:57:23.627213

Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.



The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.


The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling.


– Oregon Republican state Rep. Cyrus Javadi


Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.

Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.

Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

And Indiana’s state police agency has no plans to seek such U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement duties for its officers, despite a directive from Gov. Mike Braun promoting participation.
Nearly 1,400 people in Indiana have been subject to ICE administrative arrest since Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, as of June 26. That’s almost an 80% increase over the same period last year, according to ICE records obtained by the Deportation Data Project and published July 15.

About a quarter of those apprehended in June had no criminal convictions or charges, prompting Braun to remark, “If that data is correct, I’d say that should raise eyebrows. Because I’ve been clearly on record: the worst, first. And there are many of them out there.”
The tally comes as the Hoosier State is tapped to bulk up the nation’s deportation infrastructure.
Amid a capacity crisis in federal immigration facilities, Camp Atterbury will be used to hold immigrant detainees. The federally owned military installation is licensed to and operated by the Indiana National Guard.
Meanwhile, the crusade has revealed cracks among Trump’s Hoosier backers and forced immigrant advocates to adjust.
Enforcement-boosting agreements idle
More than 866 state and local law enforcement agencies have entered formal partnerships with ICE to help identify and remove people in the U.S. illegally, particularly those with criminal histories — but only four are Indiana agencies.
The program, authorized in Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, lets ICE delegate certain immigration enforcement powers to state or local officers. There are three active program models: jail enforcement, task force and warrant service officer.
Although available since 1996, the first memorandum of agreement wasn’t signed until 2002, according to a 2021 Congressional Research Service report. The total increased to 72 in 2011, declined to 35 by the end of former President Barack Obama’s administration, and shot back up to 150 in late 2020, near the end of Trump’s first term in office.
As of Friday, ICE’s records of 287(g) participants listed four Hoosier law enforcement agencies.
All signed up this year, after Braun issued an executive order in January directing Hoosier law enforcement agencies to “fully cooperate with ICE, and, to the maximum extent permitted, enter into (287(g)) agreements.”


They include sheriff’s offices in Hamilton, Jasper and Noble counties, as well as the town of Greens Fork’s police department.
But officers nominated by at least two of them haven’t yet been activated.
The Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office turned in a jail enforcement agreement dated Feb. 24. ICE signed it March 3.
Under that model, select officers would be able to serve and execute administrative arrest warrants for immigration violations; interrogate and process suspected arrestees; serve warrants of removal; prepare charging documents; transport arrestees to ICE-approved detention facilities; issue immigration detainer requests and more.
But before officers are conferred those powers, they must complete delegation of immigration authority training and score at least 70% on related exams. 
Five members were identified for training, which has been scheduled, Hamilton County Sgt. Bryan Melton said Thursday; they’re “waiting to attend.” ICE has also granted access to its systems and software.
“We have a good working relationship with ICE,” Melton added. His office has held 74 people for transfer to ICE custody so far this year, after holding just 77 across the entirety of 2024.
ICE signed the Jasper County Sheriff’s Office’s warrant service officer deal on March 17.
“To date, that training has not yet occurred,” Chief Deputy Jason Wallace said Wednesday. “As such, we currently have zero deputies/jail officers participating in the program, and it is my understanding that we are not considered active participants until the required training is completed.”
“I am unsure why the training has not yet taken place,” he added. “All necessary paperwork was submitted; however, we have not received any follow-up or communication from ICE regarding next steps.”
His agency has recorded 14 transfers to ICE custody so far this year.
The Noble County Sheriff’s Office and Greens Fork Police Department didn’t return requests for comment on their participation in the 287(g) program. They have memorandums of agreement effective March 25 and April 10, respectively.
ICE also maintains a log of pending partnerships. As of Friday, it listed no Hoosier agencies.
The Indiana State Police indicated that it won’t be among those seeking ICE powers.
“ISP has no plan to enter into a 287(g) agreement of its own,” Capt. Ron Galaviz said.
He directed the Capital Chronicle to Braun’s order, adding, “The Indiana State Police works very closely with all its law enforcement partners at the local, county, state, and federal levels.”
Conservative dissent
As the Trump administration pushes for a daily arrest quota of 3,000, splinters have emerged among the president’s supporters.
“I have people they call me. They’re like, ‘I’m not sure if my crew is going to show up for work Monday morning, because if there’s a raid, or something like that, right?” U.S. Rep. Marlin Stutzman of Indiana said last week, the Wall Street Journal reported.

“If you try to deport all of them, you’re gonna crash the economy,” Stutzman, a rancher, continued. He represents the Third District in northeast Indiana.
The House Freedom Caucus member later wrote on X that he’d “never support giving someone who crossed our border illegally citizenship, amnesty, or the right to vote.” Then, he quoted Trump: “If a farmer is willing to vouch for these people, in some way, we’re going to have to say that’s going to be good.”
Stutzman’s office didn’t return interview requests. But his remarks — and cosponsorship of a bipartisan immigration reform bill — prompted hundreds of critiques from conservative commenters and others.
Micah Clark, the executive director of the American Family Association’s Indiana chapter, called on Stutzman to “remove his name” from the bill while the “national security risks, criminals, traffickers, and other problems facing us from 4 years of an open border are addressed first.”
“This congressional majority should govern with the mandate voters gave them on this issue and set aside what some special interests seem to want — cheap labor,” Clark wrote in a Wednesday newsletter.
When asked about any impacts of the deportation push on Indiana Farm Bureau members, National Affairs Director Brantley Seifers emphasized the value of a temporary agricultural worker visa program, particularly to specialty crop growers.
“The workers our members employ via the H-2A program are essential to that goal, and INFB will continue to advocate against the overregulation that continues to burden farmers who participate in the program,” he continued.
The Indiana Farm Bureau “ha(s)n’t heard of any of our members being impacted by raids, but that’s not to say it hasn’t happened,” spokeswoman Heidi Gant added.
The Indiana Chamber of Commerce declined to provide an interview or comment.
State-level officials have largely applauded stepped-up immigration enforcement.
“For too long, Hoosier communities have borne the burden of open-border policies, facing increased crime, human trafficking, and strain on our schools, hospitals, and other taxpayer-funded resources,” Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita said in a statement last week. “Using Camp Atterbury to securely detain illegal aliens pending immigration proceedings or deportation sends a clear message: Indiana will not tolerate lawlessness.”
Rokita said his office “stands ready” to back up federal efforts.
Advocates mobilize
The Indiana Latino Democratic Caucus began as a way to encourage political participation but has pivoted to “coordinat(ing) a statewide response to the emergency needs of the Latinos,” according to organization President Karla Lopez-Owens.
“Everybody feels it: this is different,” she said. “It’s unforgiving. It’s cruel.”
The group published a bilingual “Find an ICE detainee” guide, she said, and in the weeks since, they’ve been printed out and distributed to churches, coffee shops and other community spaces.

Lopez-Owens is also a cofounder of the Indiana Undocumented Youth Alliance, which recently launched a rapid response team. About 250-300 volunteers have been trained on best practices when encountering or spotting ICE officers, she said.
The alliance also plans to publish a list of reputable immigration attorneys to combat scams. And it maintains a legal defense fund, which Lopez-Owens dubbed a “very small lifeline.”
“The need far exceeds what’s available, and it wasn’t like this before,” she said. “… It’s not even about preparation, because we’re way past that point. It’s about mitigation and supporting the needs on a day-by-day basis.”
The alliance isn’t the only group struggling to meet need.

They also placed a question on the 2026 ballot rolling back abortion rights that voters enshrined in the state constitution in November. 
It’s not the first time the GOP-dominated legislature overturned voter-approved laws in recent years. But this time, the backlash could have long-lasting consequences.  
In the short term, proponents of the paid sick leave law are eyeing a new initiative petition to reinstate the benefit in the state constitution, while abortion-rights supporters expect to raise millions to fend off a new ban. 
But another coalition hopes to go even further. 
Respect Missouri Voters, a bipartisan constellation of organizations, this month submitted 38 versions of a new initiative petition seeking to undermine the legislature’s ability to overturn voter-approved measures. 
Most would require 80% of the legislature to agree before a law or constitutional amendment enacted by initiative petition could be revised or repealed. They also would prohibit the legislature from making the initiative and referendum process more difficult. 
The group’s PAC reported $200,000 cash on hand on July 1, with another $170,000 in large donations since then. That includes $10,000 from former Republican U.S. Sen. John Danforth. 
“This is our one shot,” said Benjamin Singer, CEO of one of the coalition’s members, Show Me Integrity. “If we don’t act now, they’ll succeed in silencing us forever.”
Missouri Gov. Kehoe signs bill repealing paid sick leave 

Republicans have taken notice, with some pondering a preemptive strike to change the initiative petition process before any campaign gets off the ground. But others worry it may already be too late and wonder if the GOP overplayed its hand with its recent moves.
“The legislature doesn’t really seem to understand, they’ve kicked the hornet’s nest,” said James Harris, a veteran Republican consultant in Missouri. “We may be about to cross the rubicon… where the legislature loses a lot of its power.”
The showdown is decades in the making. 
After Missourians approved a constitutional amendment to limit taxes in the 1980s, the Democratic-led legislature tried to make changes to the initiative petition process that were criticized at the time by GOP Gov. John Ashcroft as an attempt to silence voters. He ultimately vetoed the bill. 
In 1999, Missouri voters rejected a ballot measure that would have allowed concealed carry of firearms. Despite the defeat, the legislature revisited the issue after Republicans took the majority and ultimately passed a concealed carry bill in 2003.
Voters passed a ballot measure in 2010 called the “Puppy Mill Cruelty and Prevention Act” that specified appropriate living conditions for breeding operations with at least 10 female breeding dogs. It also capped the number of animals that a business could use for breeding at 50.
Soon after, lawmakers passed a bill that peeled back key parts of the new law, including the cap on the number of breeding dogs.
The puppy mill vote inspired advocates to forgo changes to state law and instead put their focus on putting policy changes in the state constitution — making it much harder for lawmakers to make changes because it would require another statewide vote. 
In subsequent years, voters approved constitutional amendments legalizing marijuana, expanding Medicaid eligibility,  creating a nonpartisan redistricting plan and repealing a ban on abortion. 
But the GOP supermajority wasn’t ready to quit without a fight. 
Lawmakers refused to fund Medicaid expansion until the Missouri Supreme Court said they had no choice. They pushed through a ballot measure of their own, approved by voters, that repealed the nonpartisan redistricting plan. 
Next year, voters will weigh in on an amendment passed by the legislature putting the state’s abortion ban back in place. The paid sick leave expansion was not a constitutional amendment, allowing lawmakers to repeal it without a new statewide vote. 
“I don’t understand the legislature’s strategy at all,” said Sean Nicholson, a progressive strategist who has worked on numerous initiative petition campaigns in Missouri. “A very pro-Trump electorate spoke very clearly on abortion rights and paid sick leave in November. And now we head into a midterm, and we’ve seen in Missouri and other states that shenanigans from politicians become part of the story. The legislature has given voters plenty of motivation to double down on what they’ve already said.”
Missouri Republicans shut down Senate debate to pass abortion ban, repeal sick leave law

Republicans, who held legislative super majorities as these progressive ballot measures have been approved by voters, have long complained that out-of-state money from anonymous sources have largely fueled these initiative petition campaigns. 
They’ve vowed for years to make it harder to change the constitution through the initiative petition process, but the push always fizzled amidst GOP infighting or other legislative priorities. 
The threat of an initiative petition that would weaken the legislature’s hand in the process has reignited calls for Republicans to take action quickly. The Missouri Freedom Caucus, a group of right-wing legislators who regularly quarrel with GOP leadership, is calling on Gov. Mike Kehoe to convene a special legislative session to change the initiative petition process. 
“Missouri’s Constitution should not be up for sale to the highest left-wing bidder,” the group said in a statement last week. “Without immediate reform, left-wing activists will continue to use this loophole to force their unpopular agenda on Missouri citizens with a mere 51% of the vote.”
Whether Missourians will get another chance to vote on paid sick leave is still up in the air. 
Missouri’s law allowed employees to earn one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked, starting May 1. By the time it’s officially repealed, 17 weeks will have elapsed. That means someone working 40 hours a week could have earned 22 hours of paid sick leave.
If workers don’t use their paid sick leave before Aug. 28, there’s no legal guarantee they can do so afterward.
The sick leave expansion was a “job killer,” said Kara Corches, president and CEO of the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry, adding that “one-size-fits-all mandates threaten growth.”
Richard Von Glahn, policy director of Missouri Jobs with Justice, which advocated for the paid sick leave ballot measure, noted 58% of voters approved the proposal. It was also upheld unanimously by the Missouri Supreme Court. 
“Now workers may again face the reality of having no paid sick time to take care of their families without losing out on a check,” Von Glahn said shortly after the governor signed the paid sick leave repeal earlier this month. “This move by the Missouri legislature sets a dangerous precedent for democratic processes in our state.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-618211822-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 07:57:23.627213

But there’s a catch,Feleecia Guillen,,,,,https://missouriindependent.com/2025/07/28/more-americans-can-get-compensated-for-nuclear-poisoning-but-theres-a-catch/,"This July marked 80 years since the U.S. government detonated the first atomic bomb in the desert of southern New Mexico, marking the start of the nuclear age — and an ongoing nightmare for the people who call the area home. That test, known as Trinity, blanketed rural communities in radioactive fallout. No one was […]","A sign warns of radioactive material at the West Lake Landfill. Thousands of tons of nuclear waste from the Manhattan Project were dumped there in the 1970s (Theo Welling/Riverfront Times).This July marked 80 years since the U.S. government detonated the first atomic bomb in the desert of southern New Mexico, marking the start of the nuclear age — and an ongoing nightmare for the people who call the area home.
That test, known as Trinity, blanketed rural communities in radioactive fallout. No one was warned. No one was evacuated. Families drank radioactive rainwater, breathed in ash, and were left to carry the burden in silence.
Now, for the first time in history, those communities will finally be acknowledged.
Earlier versions of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), originally passed in 1990, offered compensation to “downwinders” impacted by nuclear testing in Nevada and to others who’d worked as uranium miners before 1971. But New Mexicans and other long suffering communities were left out.
But now that law, which expired last year, has been renewed and expanded to include New Mexico’s Trinity downwinders, post-1971 uranium mine workers, and other affected communities in Missouri, Tennessee, Alaska, Kentucky, and beyond.
But this long-overdue justice comes with a gut punch: the RECA expansion is buried inside Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” the GOP budget that slashes Medicaid, SNAP, and rural health care — lifelines for the very people this bill claims to protect — to finance tax cuts for the wealthy.
This is not justice.
I come from generations of Nuevomexicanos who’ve lived and worked on these lands for decades. Both of my grandparents have battled cancer. And while we may never get a clear answer, we can’t help but wonder if it was because of exposure to the radioactive legacy that’s haunted New Mexico for generations.
These aren’t isolated stories. They’re echoed across our pueblos, acequias, and towns. From the Navajo Nation, where uranium miners were sent underground without protection, to the 1979 Church Rock disaster — the worst nuclear spill in U.S. history — our communities have borne the brunt of nuclear colonialism while being erased from the story.
When RECA was passed in 1990, it excluded us. Even as cancers and birth defects multiplied, even as we buried our elders and our children, we were told our suffering didn’t count. When the program expired in 2024, it slammed the door shut on new claims.
Now, with a revival of RECA on the table, it’s a historic moment. But the same bill that expands RECA also threatens to strip millions of people of their basic health care.
I crunched the numbers in a new fact sheet for the Institute for Policy Studies.
In the 16 RECA-eligible states alone, I found that this bill will rip health insurance away from over 3.9 million people — including 103,719 in New Mexico, the very state whose residents were sacrificed to build the U.S. nuclear empire.
The total figure includes over 1.4 million people losing Medicaid coverage and another 2.5 million losing Affordable Care Act coverage. On top of that, a total of 240 rural hospitals in these states are considered at risk of closing.
These are not just numbers — they are lives. Aging uranium miners. Downwinders living in remote, medically underserved areas. Elders in rural towns who have no alternative when their hospital closes.
This bill gives with one hand and takes away with the other. That’s not justice — it’s policy murder.
I welcome the long-overdue recognition of downwinders from New Mexico and other impacted communities in RECA. But what does that mean if those same people are losing access to health care? Many rely on Medicaid and rural hospitals. If those lifelines vanish, how will they get diagnosed, let alone treated?
Even this “win” is short-lived: RECA would only be extended until the end of 2028, far too little time to reach, enroll, and support impacted communities.
Justice must come with real care. We shouldn’t have to trade one harm for another. We deserve compensation without compromise. RECA should be expanded for longer — without compromising Medicaid or rural health care.
We demand justice without sacrifice.

Shelia Stubbs for her efforts calling attention to the violence Black women and girls face. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)For the third session in a row, State Rep. Shelia Stubbs (D-Madison) is calling on Wisconsin lawmakers to create a task force to examine the violence African American women and girls face and develop policy solutions to prevent others from going missing and being murdered.
The bill would establish a 17-member task force to produce a report on the issue. Members would include two Senators, two Assembly representatives and other stakeholders, along with law enforcement representatives and representatives from advocacy or legal organizations, including those that focus on Black women and girls. 
“This is my third time to try and get a critical piece of legislation passed into law,” Stubbs said at a press conference Friday. 
Stubbs, inspired by a similar task force in Minnesota and one focused on Indigenous women in Wisconsin, first introduced the proposal during the 2021-2023 legislative session, but it failed to gain traction. The second iteration of the bill, during the 2023-25 session, passed the Assembly but stalled in the Senate as former Sen. Duey Stroebel initially refused to allow the bill to move forward. It eventually received a public hearing and was approved by a committee but never advanced to a vote on the Senate floor. 
“Can anyone tell me why this critical legislation could not get scheduled? Can you tell these families why their loved one was not important enough to at least get a hearing?” Stubbs asked at the press conference. “It is not fair to these victims and their families that they have to continue to wait for this Legislature to do something.” 
Stubbs said Wisconsin has the “worst disparity in the nation” when it comes to Black women and girls being killed. A 2022 investigation by the Guardian found five Black women and girls were killed each day in the U.S. in 2020. Wisconsin was the worst in the country, with the rate doubling that year. 
Coauthors on the new bill include Rep. Pat Snyder (R-Weston), Sen. Jesse James (R-Thorp) and LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee). 
“I’m demanding that we get an answer,” Stubbs said. “I am demanding that we get justice. How many more victims do we need in this state before we do something?”
Stubbs was joined at the press conference by Sheena Scarborough, mother of 19-year-old Sade Robinson, who was murdered last year.
“The things that we have gone through as a family,” Scarborough said. “They stand behind me knowing exactly what it’s like being a victim of a severe traumatic crime in the worst possible way… We are still dealing with ongoing trauma daily.” 
A jury found Maxwell Anderson guilty last month of murdering and dismembering Robinson, who had gone on a first date with him in 2024. Anderson’s sentencing is this week. 
Scarborough said there wasn’t enough support as she dealt with law enforcement and navigated the criminal justice system for the first time following her daughter’s murder. The lack of support  pushed her to start the Sade’s Voice Foundation, she said. The nonprofit was formed to advocate and provide  support for the families of missing Black women and girls.
“There weren’t many other supports through this time…. It doesn’t matter if you are Republican or Democrat. These are our babies. This was my daughter. She was a granddaughter. She was a sister. She had her whole life ahead of her,” Scarborough said. “The task force is definitely needed.”
The task force would examine several related issues. They include systemic causes of the violence Black women and girls experience, the appropriate methods for tracking and collecting data on violence against Black women and girls, government practices including policing related to investigating and prosecuting crimes against Black women and girls, measures that could reduce violence against them and ways to support victims and their families.
The final report, which would be due by 2027, would need to recommend policies and practices that would be effective in reducing gender violence and increasing the safety of Black women and girls and help victims and communities to heal from violence.
Angela Arrington, the social action coordinator for Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., said that  the task force could help address the persistent violence that Black women and girls face. 
“They are more likely to experience homicide, sexual assault and other forms of violence than their white counterparts, and these cases often go unsolved or receive less attention,” Arrington said. “The epidemic of violence is a complex issue with deep-rooted historical and systemic causes requiring comprehensive and coordinated action to address.” 
Attorney General Josh Kaul said lawmakers are needed to establish a task force and that a state investment must be included.
Kaul and Gov. Tony Evers included creating a task force in their budget proposals, but the Republican-led Joint Finance Committee did not include it in the final proposal. 
“People are ready to step up,” Kaul said. “The problem now is not whether there is interest among folks in collaborating and working to identify solutions. What we need is legislative will. We need the legislators and the Senate and the Assembly to pass legislation that will help ensure we have this task force… It’s clear that there is a need not just for action, but for there to be an investment so that we can seriously consider these issues.” 
He alluded to the new budget approved earlier this month that was celebrated as a bipartisan compromise by legislative leaders and Gov. Tony Evers.
“The Legislature was so close to passing legislation that would help us move forward on this issue, but we’ve seen there’s an opportunity for some compromise in this legislative session,” Kaul said. 
The bill includes one position supported with state funding of $80,200 in 2025-26 and $99,500 in 2026-27. 
Kaul said the additional Department of Justice employee would be essential to coordinate the work of the task force, including gathering data that may be needed. 
A similar task force focused on Indigenous women and girls was formed in 2020 by Kaul after legislation failed. Kaul started that task force without state funding by using federal funding from the Violence Against Women Act. He said at the press conference that the agency doesn’t have funding  for a similar pathway for the proposed new task force. 
The 2023 version of the bill did not include funding when it passed the Assembly. 
“This is a really significant issue that takes the investment of time and resources, and I don’t want to see a group come together without having the resources they need to be successful,” Kaul told reporters. “I want to see this done properly and right and that’s what this bill would do.”

(Photo via U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.



The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.










The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling.


– Oregon Republican state Rep. Cyrus Javadi


Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.
Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.
Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)August could be interesting if Montanans concerned about the course of our federal government will reach out soon to our four-member congressional delegation.
The Senate and the House calendars call for them to be in recess between Aug. 4 and Sept. 1 – adequate time for at least one or two town hall meetings. Each member of our delegation – Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy and Reps. Troy Downing and Ryan Zinke – has a section of their official websites for scheduling requests. And each has local offices around the state one can visit or call for information. 
Good places to start. 
With House Speaker Mike Johnson shutting down that chamber a week early, we might expect Downing and Zinke to have even more time back home. 
But there are obstacles. Congressmen are under orders from Republican leadership not to hold in-person town hall meetings with their constituents. Our team has been avoiding them like the plague.
Call-in imitations of town hall meetings are now the standard where questions are screened and controlled in advance with no opportunity for follow-up. But not that they are plentiful. Downing, for example, has been able to spare three entire hours since taking his seat in January to speak at his constituents en masse.
Daines and Sheehy boast they are proud to meet with constituents one-on-one — thousands of them, they say. But how do ordinary Montanans figure out how to meet up with them? A chance encounter at a fund-raiser? 
All four of them are frequent guests of Fox television talk-show hosts, especially Laura Ingraham and Larry Kudlow on Fox Business. We might ask, what do those people have that the people who put our quartet into office don’t have? 
There is much to discuss, beyond question. 
I can understand the fear apparently being felt by the delegation, even by the three men who are so proud of their warrior status as SEALS and in combat search-and-rescue, and the fourth member who honed his skills with 28 years of private-sector business experience. 
But guys – give us a chance, would you? 
No member of our delegation provides their schedules publicly. Montana congressmen used to, you know, both Republicans and Democrats. Restricting schedule information began when Greg Gianforte and Daines sequentially held the single House seat, according to a long-time state political observer.
It is reasonable that during the recess each member will want to spend private family time, and have some commitments and fund-raisers already scheduled – the latter particularly for Daines and Downing who have started their 2026 reelection campaigns.
However, it is also reasonable to assume each one would have time available to accept an invitation to speak with a citizen group, even perhaps outside of their own perceived comfort zone. 
If our congressmen deem their constituents as deserving of interacting directly with them, it is important we commit ourselves to respectful and orderly events.
For the sake of our collective civic health in Montana, we cannot go on with the intolerable situation of our congressional representatives stiff-arming our requests to meet face-to-face with them. Somebody must blink – if our four representatives will not change their practices, then it is up to we citizens to make the effort to try to forge a better way forward for all of us.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/trump-sheehy-31-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 06:56:52.622386

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Liz Brown has been called a lot of things. But liberal is a new one.
“I would say that might not be the name anyone that’s ever known me would pick for me. You could say outspoken, maybe loud occasionally … very passionate and strong about what I believe is right. But no, I don’t think I’ve ever been accused of being a liberal. That’s a stretch,” she told the Indiana Capital Chronicle.
Texts accusing “Liberal Liz” Brown of betraying her conservative values on the Second Amendment and transgender issues have been flying in northeast Indiana— funded by a dark-money “social welfare” nonprofit that no one knows about or isn’t willing to divulge.

Brown — a staunch pro-lifer — has been a fixture in the Senate Republican caucus since 2014. But now high-profile GOP Hoosiers like U.S. Sen. Jim Banks and Attorney General Todd Rokita have put her in the crosshairs for 2026.
And they appear to have found their man — former Allen County councilman and current Northwest Allen County Schools board member Darren Vogt, according to several Allen County sources.
Brown has known Vogt for more than 20 years. She defeated him in the 2014 primary for her current seat. Since then, he has supported Brown — hosting a fundraiser, endorsing her in a congressional run and even inviting her to his son’s wedding.
“It’s rather sudden,” she said.
Brown hasn’t had a primary since her 2014 run.
Vogt declined to talk to the Indiana Capital Chronicle, saying only “I’m strongly considering and will be making an announcement soon.”
Immigration
The focus started when Rokita called out Brown for not hearing a stringent immigration bill during the legislative session. As the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, she has the power to choose which bills get heard. Ultimately, the legislation died.
On June 3, Rokita posted on X that Brown ignored “repeated warnings that sheriffs needed stronger statutory direction on their obligations to detain illegal aliens. She refused to hear (House Bill) 1531 and deprived her colleagues of the chance to do their jobs and vote on common sense immigration legislation.”
Brown, who is also an attorney, ultimately filed a disciplinary action against Rokita.
Banks – who Brown challenged for his old congressional seat in 2016 — replied, “Liz should be primaried.”

Brown told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that law enforcement came to her with concerns on that bill, which would have required them to honor immigration detainer requests. Detainers are not backed by a judicial finding like a warrant.
She supported a separate immigration bill that did become law.
Brown said the Rokita immigration bill had a lot of problems that weren’t fixable.
“I think what people need to understand is some of these issues are federal issues, and I would turn to anyone who is representing us at the federal level to say, ‘hey, why haven’t you fixed this problem?’
“I think it’s fair for local sheriffs and local law enforcement to say, ‘We will be happy to assist you,’ which they’ve been doing 100%, and I fully support, but you need to make sure the procedures are being followed so we know how we can back you up.”
Some think Vogt has a good chance at winning, despite the support she will likely have from the Senate Majority Campaign Committee and their coffers.
Brandon Seifert — a Huntertown councilman — said Brown has been around “Indianapolis liberals” for too long.
He noted she is still extremely conservative on the issue of life and abortion.
“But the other core conservative issues … she’s just lost her way. She has completely lost her way.”
He recently shared several text ads on his Facebook page questioning the immigration decision as well as two previous votes by Brown in recent years. They are paid for by Hoosier Leadership for America — a nonprofit that was established in 2024.
The group has a Huntertown P.O. Box. The incorporator is a man out of Virginia that the ICC could not locate.
Seifert said he is not behind the group and doesn’t know who is. But he said their points are valid.
He is disappointed that Brown is no longer the attack dog of the Republican Party that she used to be. He has supported her in the past and she is his senator.
“It’s gonna be a heck of a race. I’ve given my support to Darren 100% and am fully behind him, because we need a change, and he’s the one to be that change.”
Other issues
One of the ads takes Brown to task for her role in hearing a constitutional carry bill in 2021. She declined to give the legislation a hearing and instead the Senate removed permit fees.

Brown also voted against a bill to ban transgender Hoosiers from high school sports in 2022. She did support a college ban this year.
Browns’s conservative credentials have dipped recently, according to two GOP rankings.
The Conservative Political Action Conference issues annual rankings of lawmakers. In 2019, Brown’s score was 85% and has since dropped to 61% in 2023.
GOP-aligned Americans for Prosperity also issues scorecards. Her ranking in 2022 was 100 and dropped to 86 and 78 in the next two years.
Donors behind the Hoosier Leadership for America nonprofit are shielded under law — but if it were organized as a political action committee, they would be public.
The Internal Revenue Service says on its site that “The promotion of social welfare does not include direct or indirect participation or intervention in political campaigns on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office. However, a section 501(c)(4) social welfare organization may engage in some political activities, so long as that is not its primary activity.”
But Marjorie Hershey, professor emeritus of political science at Indiana University, said there is no enforcement against these dark money groups. That means they can hide donor identities who might want to avoid the scrutiny of supporting a candidate or issue.
And she noted the U.S. Supreme Court has erred on the side of free speech, likening spending on campaigns as speech.
“All of this has been just a steady weakening of the original purpose of this stuff,” she said. “Because, you know, as they say, money will find a way.”
As for Brown, she is ready for a fight.
“I’m committed to running again. I have been a strong advocate for northeast Indiana and the conservative values of our district up here,” she said.

This story was originally reported by Barbara Rodriguez of The 19th.  Meet Barbara and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
A growing number of Americans — more than 63 million, or nearly 1 in 4 — have served as a family caregiver for a loved one in the past year. The figure is a jump of 20 million Americans compared to a decade ago, according to findings released Thursday by AARP and the National Alliance for Caregiving (NAC).
The surge is due to a confluence of factors, including Americans living longer but in some instances, in poorer health. That is requiring more people to engage in the work of family caregiving. There is also a growing recognition of who is a family caregiver — or a person providing care to an adult or child with a complex medical condition or disability, often without pay.
The report finds that these caregivers are managing financial risks, their own poor health and isolation. As in a previous iteration of the survey, roughly 60 percent of family caregivers are women. Women, LGBTQ+ caregivers, and those who felt they had no choice in becoming caregivers are significantly more likely to report feeling alone.
“We need systems that see caregivers, value them and support them — because they are not just helping families, they are holding up our entire health care system,” said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, CEO of AARP. “This impacts all of us because most of us will be a caregiver or need one at some point in our lives. And too often, people don’t realize that they are a caregiver until they’re already overwhelmed and unsupported.”
Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences because of their growing responsibilities. They’re draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing. One in 5 report that their own health is fair or poor.
The “Caregiving in the U.S. 2025” report, which surveyed nearly 7,000 caregivers nationwide, also finds nearly 1 in 3 family caregivers are part of the “sandwich generation” of caregivers who raise children while simultaneously caring for adults in their lives.
“This dual responsibility is a recipe for burnout and requires solutions that recognize caregiving happens across the lifespan,” said Jason Resendez, CEO of NAC. “It’s time to recognize and value this continuum of care that we all experience and benefit from, and the responsibilities themselves are becoming more complex and more intensive.”
During a media call Thursday, AARP and NAC shared the story of Alma Valencia, a woman from Pasadena, California, who has cared for her mother for the past 10 years. Valencia’s mother has dementia. Valencia said she eventually left her career to become her mother’s full-time caregiver. That meant losing a stable salary and benefits, and isolation.
“Like so many others, I didn’t plan for this,” she said. “I stepped into the role because someone I love needed me.”
The report shows 65 percent of family caregivers now help with at least one activity of daily living, including intimate tasks like bathing, dressing and feeding. Over half say they’re performing complex medical and nursing tasks that once primarily took place in clinics and hospitals, including administering injections and managing medical equipment. But only 11 percent of family caregivers say they’ve received training for basic caregiving tasks — and just 22 percent get any training for complex medical and nursing tasks.
Both AARP and the National Alliance for Caregiving are calling for federal policies that include national paid family and medical leave, a federal tax credit to bring relief to out-of-pocket costs and greater access to respite care, training and support services, as well as stronger workplace protections that recognize caregiving responsibilities.
These organizations have been advocating for these policies in joint reports for years, but now they come amid a changing federal landscape. President Donald Trump this month signed a tax and budget law that is estimated to cut federal Medicaid spending by more than $900 billion over 10 years. Nearly eight million family caregivers rely on Medicaid for their own health care coverage, according to Resendez.
Resendez said advocates are seeing progress at the state level, with several establishing paid family leave policies or advancing caregiver tax credits and long-term care insurance programs.
“This is an issue that continues to build strength and visibility, and this report helps to put numbers behind the urgency for that continuing, and for translating that into solid action,” he said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/long-term-care-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 06:56:52.622386

(File photo courtesy of Tracy Brooks/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)As Idaho changes to a totally new method for counting wolves, officials with the Idaho Department of Fish and Game have increased the state’s 2023 wolf population estimate they reported publicly last year.
Officials increased the 2023 wolf population estimate by 85 wolves, an increase of about 7%, state officials confirmed.
The change comes as Idaho is seeking to reduce the number of wolves in the state and as some outside researchers have stressed the importance of an accurate wolf count.
During the July 2024 Idaho Fish and Game Commission meeting, state officials estimated Idaho’s 2023 wolf population at 1,150 wolves as of Aug. 1.
Ghost wolves: As Idaho aims to reduce its wolf population, advocates worry counts aren’t accurate

But during an interview Wednesday at the Idaho Department of Fish and Game’s Boise headquarters, Wildlife Bureau Chief Shane Roberts and Wildlife Research Manager Matt Mumma told the Idaho Capital Sun officials are no longer using the 1,150 estimate.
Instead, they have increased the Aug. 1, 2023 wolf population estimate to 1,235 wolves.
The change was made after Idaho Department of Fish and Game officials added four additional measurements to the new method the state uses to estimate the wolf population, Roberts and Mumma said. 
“The new estimates are better and more accurate than the other ones, which were likely slightly off,” Mumma said Thursday. 
“Through simulation, we determined that the addition of these metrics improved the accuracy of the model,” Mumma added.
Jeff Abrams, a wildlife program associate for the Idaho Conservation League, said the state should be as precise and transparent as possible in its wolf estimates and use conservative figures for the number of nonbreeding wolves and the amount of lone wolves used in statistical models.
“Generally, we believe they should be more conservative – based on research previously cited in (the department’s) own wolf management plan,” Abrams said. “We believe folks should take a closer look at fundamental assumptions the agency is feeding into their new model.”

Roberts said the state’s new model for estimating wolves uses a wide range of options and does not rely on static assumptions. 
Even with the revision, Mumma said the state’s numbers are still well within a 95% credible interval and Roberts said the larger overall population trends reported since 2019 have not changed. 
“The overall trend since 2019 is down, but in the last three years of estimates, it’s fairly stable,” Roberts said.
Idaho Department of Fish and Game officials provided the revised 2023 wolf population estimate after the Idaho Capital Sun requested follow up information about changes to the new wolf population estimation method on July 18.
Officials estimate the wolf population in Idaho because wolves are too elusive and Idaho is too rugged and remote for the state officials to physically count every wolf.
Overall, the state says the wolf population is on a downward trend from 2019-2020, when more than 1,600 wolves were estimated. Last year, Idaho’s wolf population decreased by almost 100 wolves from 2023 to 2024, state officials said earlier this month. 
 Idaho officials also recently changed date they report the wolf population estimates

The change in metrics is part of a much larger overhaul of how Idaho counts its wolf population. From 2019 to 2023, the state used trail cameras to estimate Idaho’s wolf population. 
Then in July 2024, Roberts announced the state switched to a new method that uses age and genetic data taken from a tooth from every dead wolf checked by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game each year. State officials call the new method the ABC method, short for Approximate Bayesian Computation. 
After switching from trail cams to age and genetic data from teeth, the state also switched when it reported Idaho’s wolf population estimates. 

For years, Idaho reported its wolf population as of Aug. 1.
But last week when Idaho Department of Fish and Game officials presented the 2024 wolf population estimate, they switched the reporting date to May, the Sun previously reported. 
The change makes a difference because of wolf population dynamics. The new May numbers are likely to show higher wolf populations than the previous August estimates. 
For example, the state’s ABC method estimated the 2024 wolf population higher in May, at 1,235, but lower in August, when it was projected to be 1,140, according to data provided by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game.
The new May estimate sets the state’s wolf official population estimate at its highest point in the year, right after when the new pups are born in the spring. Throughout the rest of the year, the wolf population declines as wolves are killed by hunters and die of natural causes until the population reaches a low point in the spring just before new pups are born. That means a population estimate tied to May — when the state’s new wolf population data is reported — would always be expected to be higher than a population estimate tied to August, which was when the state’s previous estimate was based on.
Roberts said he understands moving the date from August to May may cause some confusion, but he said state officials moved the date to May because they believe the new ABC method is most accurate right after pups are born because one of the factors the ABC model estimates is new litters. 
On the other hand, Roberts said the state believed the old Aug. 1 date was the most accurate date to use for trail cams because state officials actually deployed the cameras during the months of July and August. 
Moving forward, Idaho Department of Fish and Game officials submitted their new ABC method for consideration for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Roberts told the Sun Idaho that the Idaho Department of Fish and Game plans to consistently use the May numbers going forward.
 Idaho seeks to reduce the wolf state’s wolf population

These changes to how Idaho counts its wolves are happening as Idaho is in the middle of a six-year plan to reduce the state’s wolf population by more than 60%. The 2023-2028 Idaho Gray Wolf Management Plan calls for reducing Idaho’s wolf population down to an average of about 500 wolves, with a low of about 350 wolves, driven largely by human hunting of wolves.

Some outside researchers have questioned the state’s previous trail cam wolf population methods and told the Idaho Capital Sun the accuracy of Idaho’s wolf population is extremely important as Idaho reduces its wolf population. 
Abrams, a wildlife program associate with Idaho Conservation League, said Thursday he supports the Idaho Department of Fish and Game, which is commonly referred to as IDFG, switching away from trail cameras and trying to improve the way the state estimates wolf populations.
Idaho Department of Fish and Game estimates Idaho’s wolf population decreased to 1,235

“It’s helpful that IDFG wants to improve the way they estimate wolf abundance,” Abrams said. “This is something (the Idaho Conservation League) and many others have encouraged the agency to do in the past. Idahoans want wolves to be managed responsibly and not have populations jeopardized. It benefits everyone to have accurate estimates of how many wolves we have. It’s important that the public has trust in this process.”
Abrams said he is happy the state is submitting its new ABC method to a peer-reviewed journal. But Abrams said the state should be as precise and transparent as it can be in how it estimates the wolf population. 
“However, we do still have some questions on basic assumptions used in the new model about pack size,” Abrams said. 
Abrams also called for the Idaho Department of FIsh and Game to resume publishing wolf reports every year that include detailed data about wolf population characteristics, harvest and hunting data, livestock depredation and more. Abrams said he hasn’t seen the state release a detailed annual wolf report of this kind since the 2016 Idaho Wolf Management Report.
“The department could make another improvement by getting back to publishing an annual wolf report, so the public understands how close IDFG may be getting toward their management target,” Abrams said. “They haven’t done this in almost 10 years.”
Abrams said he is concerned about how close the state could be getting each year to its wolf population management goal and he wonders what the mid-winter population low-points are for wolves. Abrams said the new May population estimate the state releases doesn’t provide that information to the public because the May estimate reports Idaho’s wolf population at its highest point each year, right after pups are born in the spring. 
“The (Idaho Fish and Game) Commission itself also said just last year, the agency needs to be careful about overshooting their management goal,” Abrams said. 
Roberts said the reason the Idaho Department of Fish and Game switched to the new ABC method is because they want to be as accurate as possible and realized the old trail cam method would be less accurate as the number of wolves decreased.
“Part of the reason, as we mentioned in last year’s presentation, that we switched methods to the ABC is because our own research suggested that the camera method was going to become less reliable as we were able to get fewer pictures of wolves,” Roberts said. “So that was a big impetus for the switch.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)Ryan Walters and his merry band of administrative leaders should not be operating the State Department of Education like their own private fiefdom, oblivious to the laws that govern public access.
Yet our state superintendent and those leaders he’s entrusted to serve us appear to be happily doing just that in denying access to one of the most basic records that’s long been released through our state’s Open Records Act — resignation letters.
And Attorney General Gentner Drummond’s office, which is supposed to help enforce open records laws, has strangely — and inexplicably — been sitting on the sidelines like a stupified observer as this continues to play out.
Walters has seen a number of senior employees exit stage left for greener pastures. He also leads an agency whose administrators have proven that they’re not the strongest champions of laws that govern public access. After all, they lost a lawsuit that accused agency leaders of violating First Amendment rights related to public meeting access and face another that contends the Education Department is not complying with the Open Records Act.
The latest dustup involves a request Oklahoma Voice filed earlier this year seeking access to all employee resignation letters submitted since Jan. 1. The agency issued a blanket denial, citing a provision of law that it claims bars the release to protect employee privacy and one that allows public bodies to keep documents private if they pertain to an internal personnel investigation.
As far as we can tell, there’s no indication that any of these employees are subject to any investigation, and for any state agency to inaccurately cite a provision of law inferring such would be reckless and potentially damaging to someone’s reputation. One would also hope that there weren’t personnel investigations into multiple high-level employees because that would indicate Walters’ is making really bad hires.
Normally resignation letters are as dry as parched earth, and pretty much every other state agency I can think of typically releases them without issue. Even the State Department of Education used to do so without batting an eye. 
I’ve never seen a blanket denial like this.
That’s why it’s so odd that the Department of Education has chosen this hill to die on, and that Drummond’s office, which lawmakers have empowered to help the public fight for open records access, has sat idly by, seemingly wringing its hands.
A recently leaked scathing resignation letter may shine some light on why the Education Department is so reluctant to release them. 
The Education Department’s former chief compliance officer wrote in her resignation letter that the agency has “fundamental operational issues” and “senior leadership attitudes” that will need to be addressed in order to “achieve the outcomes that Oklahoma students deserve.”
She also leveled accusations of “manipulation of school accreditation and deleting employee review processes,” but did not include specifics.
In short, the letter portrays a very unflattering portrait of the inner workings of an agency that receives over $3.8 billion in annual state appropriations and raises questions about its operational integrity. 
That’s something the public deserves to know. And it’s why the access to resignation letters should be an undisputed right.
Our state is one that believes — or at least used to — that “people are vested with the inherent right to know and be fully informed about their government.” And that access to government records helps Oklahomans “efficiently and intelligently exercise their inherent political power.”
That’s straight from the state’s Open Records Act. It’s also why Oklahoma agencies have done the right thing and provided resignation letters without argument, particularly for high-ranking officials.
It boggles the mind that the Attorney General’s Office, which is supposed to have a public records ombudsman to fight for public access, has refused to intervene in this issue and insist upon their release. It’s even stranger because last year, Drummond took a swipe at Walters following what he called an “alarming number of complaints” of his agency’s poor compliance with the state’s records act and sent a sign he wasn’t going to stand for it.
But ahead of the publication of our story highlighting our records battle, the Attorney General’s Office and its “public access counselor” refused to comment or address our complaint because of a pending lawsuit involving a single resignation letter. 
I could see not releasing a single letter that’s subject to litigation, but to allow an agency to issue a blanket denial to withhold all undisputed ones is nuts. There seems to be no reason Drummond couldn’t have advocated to release the rest.
Unless, that is, his office wants to keep our government shrouded in secrecy or he doesn’t believe the public should view resignation letters written by public employees.
The fight over resignation letters at the state Department of Education proves why lawmakers need to further strengthen public access laws, not water them down. If there’s any lingering doubt that these are public, maybe they need to spell it out. 
This also highlights how critical strong advocacy from the Attorney General’s Office is in this realm.
Because it’s never a good idea to give a government bureaucrat absolute power to determine if the public is entitled to records. In the wrong hands that power can lead to unintended consequences, making government less accountable and accessible to the very people it is supposed to serve.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.
The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.
Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.
Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.
Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

A draft bill that would make an exception to Wyoming's nuclear waste ban is intended to accommodate a California firm's plans to ""mass-produce"" microreactors near Casper.
The post Wyoming lawmakers consider nuclear waste storage as tensions rise over microreactor plant proposal appeared first on WyoFile .","Lawmakers will consider draft legislation this week that would allow manufacturers of “advanced nuclear reactors” to store high-level radioactive waste at their Wyoming facilities. It would be the second exception to a decades-long ban on nuclear fuel waste storage in Wyoming — removing a barrier to what nuclear energy proponents here say could become a lucrative new manufacturing and power production sector that also reinvigorates the state’s uranium mining industry. 
The measure faces significant public opposition, however, particularly in Natrona County, where Radiant Industries proposes to build a nuclear microreactor manufacturing plant on the outskirts of Bar Nunn. The company notes the location is “actually over a mile away from any home,” and meets the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s distance requirements. Many residents object to Radiant’s plan to house spent nuclear fuel waste on site — a location they say is too close to homes, schools and businesses.
“Bar Nunn does not want nuclear waste,” Midwest Republican Rep. Bill Allemand told a crowd of about 200 on Thursday evening in Bar Nunn, citing his own polling of constituents in House District 58. “We want manufacturing. We would love for Radiant to come here and manufacture and put the waste somewhere else.”
Such declarations earned raucous cheers and applause, lending credibility to Allemand’s claims that about 70% of respondents are against storing the waste.

Allemand organized the town hall, he said, because he believes state and local officials — along with Radiant — are rushing too quickly to change Wyoming law to accommodate the company’s plans. Bar Nunn residents, along with all Wyoming residents, deserve a longer conversation and an opportunity to learn about a complex and high-stakes industry before they can decide if it’s a good fit. How to impose limitations such as siting and whether to allow the industry’s radioactive waste warrant further examination, he said.
Both Allemand and Glenrock Republican Rep. Kevin Campbell urged the crowd to attend and speak up at the Joint Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee’s hearing on Wednesday in Casper, when the panel will consider the “Advanced nuclear reactor manufacturers-fuel storage” draft bill.
Neither Allemand nor Campbell serves on the Minerals Committee.
A similar piece of legislation, Senate File 186, “​​Advanced nuclear reactor manufacturers-fuel storage,” was defeated during this year’s legislative session.
But not everyone in Bar Nunn has made up their minds about Radiant and its plans for the community. A smattering of attendees at Thursday’s event raised their hands in support of the project. Bar Nunn Mayor Peter Boyer, urged to the lectern by Allemand, gave a solemn and terse response to an apparent rumor in the community that his tentative support of the project is because he’s been bribed by Radiant.

“I’ve never taken money,” Boyer said. “I wouldn’t ever take money. I didn’t go to Iraq, serve my country for eight years, bleed, watch my friends die so I can be accused of bribery. That’s bullshit. And I’m pissed, and I’m tired of this. Everybody has been at everyone else’s throat, and that is unacceptable.”
Bar Nunn town council member Dan Sabrosky posted a comment on a Facebook post about Thursday’s event: 
“People were mad [including those] I spoke with that left early,” Sabrosky wrote. “They are tired of controlled Townhalls and being fed false information to try [to] scare them. People are educating themselves about this industry and realizing that reality tells them it’s the safest energy industry in the Country.”
Radiant and Wyoming’s nuclear waste ban
Bar Nunn, like most Natrona County communities, is well acquainted with industrial, manufacturing and tech companies. But nuclear energy is new to the entire state, where a ban on storing spent nuclear fuel has been in place for decades — despite repeated efforts to open Wyoming to commercial storage of the industry’s radioactive waste. 
Without a permanent repository in the U.S. — or an apparent path to one — critics of waste storage have long argued that if Wyoming were to allow “temporary” storage, the state would likely become a de facto permanent repository.

But lawmakers managed to carve out an exception in 2022: “Temporary” storage is allowed, but only if the radioactive waste is associated with a nuclear power plant operating in the state. Wyoming still won’t accept even a pound of the estimated 86,000 metric tons that reside at dozens of nuclear power plants across the country.
The 2022 exemption, enshrined in House Bill 131, “Nuclear power generation and storage-amendments,” was made to accommodate TerraPower’s Natrium nuclear plant being built near Kemmerer. 
Similarly, the “Advanced nuclear reactor manufacturers-fuel storage” draft bill on the Minerals Committee’s schedule for Wednesday appears to have been drafted to accommodate another company’s ambitions.
California-based Radiant Industries, launched in 2019, proposes to build a microreactor manufacturing plant just outside Bar Nunn’s border. The town of 3,000 residents is located just a few miles north of Casper, home to 59,000. Radiant plans to build a 100-plus-acre campus where it will “mass produce” and fuel 1-megawatt Kaleidos microreactors, which are “designed for deployment anywhere it’s needed without the need to refuel for years,” according to the company.
Although Radiant may sell the microreactor units, it also plans to lease them, according to the company. When the units need refueling, the mobile reactors will be shipped back to Radiant’s Wyoming facility — from all over the world — and the spent fuel will be stored at the Bar Nunn campus, where it will remain until there’s a permanent federal repository to send it.
“Our microreactors will come back to our factory to have the spent fuel — which is about the volume of two Walmart gas grill propane tanks — removed and temporarily stored on site in dry casks until they can be shipped to a national repository as soon as it’s been selected,” Radiant Vice President of Communications and Marketing Ray Wert told WyoFile via email. “We’re very hopeful that the [Trump] administration will be standing up a national repository site shortly.”

Radiant also needs Wyoming lawmakers to make another exception to the state’s waste storage ban for its business plan to work here. The draft bill up for consideration this week would add “advanced nuclear reactor manufacturers” to the state’s short list of exceptions.
But critics say that’s no small departure from the 2022 exemption to the waste storage ban. 
Under the proposed legislation, Wyoming would accept radioactive fuel waste for the benefit of Radiant’s customers from across the nation and the world, giving the state’s residents an unequal portion of the burdens and risks that come with the industry, Rep. Campbell told WyoFile.
“If we do this with Radiant, we set a precedent to store nuclear waste from anywhere on the globe,” Campbell said, adding that several other companies have floated proposals to manufacture microreactors in the state.

The piecemeal additions of exceptions serve the end-goal for many longtime proponents of nuclear energy projects in the state, Campbell said: Namely, to open Wyoming’s doors for commercial nuclear waste facilities. House Bill 16, “Used nuclear fuel storage-amendments,” a measure to do just that, was also considered and defeated in this year’s legislative session.
“The next step is to go right back to where we were at with House Bill 16: ‘Oh, why don’t we just become the nuclear repository?'” Campbell said.
It doesn’t make sense, Campbell added, to change state laws for Radiant when the company hasn’t even submitted an application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the project. Radiant plans to file an application as soon as “we’ve finalized our location,” the company told WyoFile.
Political divides emerge
Wyoming’s congressional delegation, along with Gov. Mark Gordon and top energy officials in the state, staunchly support welcoming nuclear energy endeavors to the state while chastising an inept federal bureaucracy for not building a permanent, national repository for spent nuclear fuel waste.
But political lines are being drawn on the waste issue. 
The Wyoming Freedom Caucus posted a statement on its Facebook page on Thursday declaring the group’s opposition to nuclear waste storage: “Wyoming must continue to be a leader in proven energy production, not settle as a dumping ground for nuclear waste from other states. California billionaires insist on saddling our landscapes with their windmills, their solar panels, and now their radioactive casks.”
The group’s statement also criticizes efforts to secure a $25 million grant from the Wyoming Business Council to support the buildout of water, sewer and other infrastructure to help support Radiant’s manufacturing campus, calling it a subsidy.
“Fantastical promises of huge revenues to the State, overt gaslighting, and outright lies aren’t what we use to craft policy,” the group stated.
Meantime, Natrona County resident and Natrona County School Board Trustee Kyla Alvey has launched a change.org petition to “Support Radiant and bring new energy jobs to Natrona County.”The Joint Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee will meet Tuesday and Wednesday at the Thyra Thomson State Office Building in Casper. It is scheduled to discuss the “Advanced nuclear reactor manufacturers-fuel storage” draft bill on Wednesday morning. The meeting will also be live streamed.

Ramaco Resources’ Brook Mine could become the second rare earth extraction operation in the U.S., but the minerals face an uncertain domestic market under President Trump.
The post Republican excitement for Wyoming rare earth mining contradicts the party’s disdain for renewables appeared first on WyoFile .","This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News (hyperlink to the original story), a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.
At the foot of Wyoming’s Bighorn Mountains sits a mine potentially full of minerals crucial for renewable energy, yet capable of drawing praise from some of the United States’ most ardent supporters of fossil fuels. 
On July 11, the U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, the former CEO of a hydraulic fracturing company, joined former West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin and Wyoming’s congressional delegation and governor, Mark Gordon, at the ribbon cutting ceremony for Ramaco Resources’ Brook Mine, which could one day become just the second source of rare earth minerals in the U.S. 
But the minerals, including but not limited to scandium, gallium, germanium, praseodymium, neodymium, terbium and dysprosium, are locked up in coal, according to Ramaco — and it is that coal that has driven Republican enthusiasm for the mine. 
Rare earth minerals are critical components in a long list of technologies, including solar cells, wind turbine rotors, batteries, magnets, missiles, motors, semiconductors and smartphones. A vast majority of the world’s known critical mineral deposits lie in Asia, particularly in China.
But as Ramaco looks to bring the Brook Mine online in 2027 — July’s ribbon cutting marked the opening of a pilot plant — some wonder what kind of domestic market it will find after President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans gutted federal incentives to boost the development and manufacturing of renewable energy technologies earlier this month. 
“I would argue that a large portion of the projected need [for rare earth minerals] is in clean energy,” said Steve Feldgus, former principal deputy assistant secretary for land and minerals management at the Department of the Interior. 
Despite his disdain for renewable energy, Trump has been eager to mine more rare earth minerals, signing an executive order in March expediting the permitting process for mines to extract the elements.  
Ramaco intends to sell some of the coal present in the mine, a costly form of energy and a major contributor to the climate crisis, but it should amount to less than 1% of all the coal exported from Wyoming, Jeremy Sussman, Ramaco’s chief financial officer, said in an email.
That small portion of coal didn’t stop Wright from touting the mineral as the mine’s major achievement. In a video posted on X, formerly Twitter, the secretary of energy said, “You’re going to see a lot more of big, beautiful, clean coal!” and noted that he was celebrating not only the opening of a mine for rare earth minerals, but also the first coal mine to open in Wyoming in 50 years.
Ramaco has analyzed one-third of the mineral deposit, according to a July letter to shareholders signed by CEO Randall Atkins, and Ramaco’s pilot project will test processing techniques for rare earths.
Broadly, “there is a rare earth element resource [in coal],” said Lauren Birgenheier, a professor of geology and geophysics at the University of Utah. In the Brook Mine’s case, “how excellent it is is still probably to be determined, but it appears excellent enough for them to feel like they can move forward.”

With only a third of the mine mapped and rare earth prices subject to change — Ramaco’s price estimate for scandium, a crucial component of fuels cells used in hydrogen-powered machines, was over 200% higher than the U.S. Geological Survey’s estimate of $1.2 million per metric ton — Feldgus said it was too soon to say for sure what the mine’s future holds.
“It’s still going to be a little bit longer before they can say that ‘this is actually what we’re going to mine,’” he said.
Sussman said Ramaco’s estimates were for 2028 and accounted for attempts from China “to manipulate pricing” by keeping rare earth values low, thereby “disincentivizing western projects.” He said he expects the market to improve as the U.S. tries to source rare earth minerals domestically, and pointed to a recent Department of Defense contract for neodymium at $110,000 per ton — twice the mineral’s typical spot price, according to Sussman — as evidence that the market for western critical minerals was improving.
Despite its support for policies that depress U.S. renewable energy markets, Wyoming’s congressional delegation, made up entirely of Republicans, lauded the effort to extract rare earth minerals in statements released after Ramaco’s groundbreaking ceremony.
Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso said the mine will “support American industries, and strengthen our supply chains.” Cynthia Lummis, the state’s other senator, added that the mine “will produce resources needed to achieve energy independence and grow our economy.”
But where the domestic demand for those minerals will come from is uncertain, as many of the industries they would supply face questionable near-term futures in the U.S. after Trump signed legislation earlier this month gutting many incentives for renewable energy technologies.
“The excitement over rare earths is sort of at odds with the destruction of demand for clean energy,” Feldgus said. “The magnets that a lot of these minerals go into, I mean, those are critically important for electric motors, for turbines, for anything that is built off the clean energy economy.”
The policy whiplash in the U.S. has left Sussman unfazed. “Our rare earth elements and critical minerals are vital to national defense,” he said. And those same technologies Feldgus outlined “are still projected to grow at a meaningful pace,” he said. “In fact, the [U.S. Department of Energy] projects wind capacity in the U.S. to grow from 113 [gigawatts] in 2020 to 404 [gigawatts] in [2050].”

Columnist Kerry Drake loved the thrill of taking rodeo photos in the arena. Now he writes that he’s too afraid of the traffic to even visit the park. 
The post Surviving, and occasionally thriving, during Cheyenne Frontier Days appeared first on WyoFile .","The latest edition of Cheyenne Frontier Days has been put to bed. Hundreds of volunteers who ran the “Daddy of ‘em All” can rest, retailers can count their profits, and fans — at least the ones who didn’t join the carnival or become rodeo circuit roadies — have gone home.

Opinion

And residents like me can rejoice at surviving 10 days of madness. We feel safe on the streets again, no longer dodging drivers who are even worse than we are. We can make trips to grocery stores and downtown without making battle plans.
I wasn’t always this jaded. As a photojournalist for the then-Wyoming State Tribune in the 1970s, I fully embraced my job covering Frontier Days, from pancake breakfasts and parades to afternoon rodeos and evening concerts.
I’d usually join local and traveling journalists at a bar to discuss the day’s events because, of course, we thought we knew everything. As I count down my most memorable good, bad and embarrassing moments, let’s start with one that could still get me pummeled by country music fans.
10 — The Hitching Post was our favorite place, because it had a good live house band. The only downside for my ears was a cowboy who invariably came on stage to sing the last couple of songs. That was my time to leave, because this guy was always off-key.
I am chagrined to confess it was future country superstar Chris LeDoux, a legendary rodeo competitor from Kaycee. Years later, I interviewed him and learned that he was also an amazing Western sculptor and probably the nicest man on the planet.
9 — Another faux pas, this time at the rodeo. Reporters watched for contestants leaving the arena, stopping them before they disappeared under the stands to shed their equipment.
A woman who was the Denver correspondent for the New York Times kept beating me to interviews. I’d stand around patiently to ask questions about their techniques, background, motivation, etc., while my new competitor always asked the same thing: “What’s the name of that horse (or bull) you rode?”
I couldn’t reconcile how someone writing for the nation’s most prestigious paper could ask such a lame question. The reporter was Molly Ivins, who became one of the premier political columnists and hellraisers in America. See a trend here?


8 — I’m glad Molly wasn’t around when the Frontier Days public relations committee convinced the livestock committee to name some of the bulls after local journalists. I was in the arena waiting to take a photo of my namesake busting out of the gate when I heard the confused announcer say, “Here’s so-and-so, today’s leader, riding Kerry Drake. [Long pause] Now why on Earth would someone name a bull Kerry Drake?”
Why indeed? A genuine WTF moment for everyone in the stands, the cowboy and the bull.
7 — This isn’t a “moment,” but a fashion statement. The newspaper’s mandatory dress code was a sport coat and tie, but the rodeo required us to wear a cowboy hat, long-sleeve Western shirt and cowboy boots, no exceptions. Why, Frontier Days could lose its authentic image if someone snapped a photo of us covering the event wearing a sensible T-shirt to avoid heat stroke!
But I really didn’t mind. Losing the tie was a big plus, because I still hate wearing one. And I learned that my Dad was right, a good pair of cowboy boots are indeed the most comfortable footwear ever. I just wish they gave us a clothing allowance, because even in the 1970s, all that Western garb was expensive.
6 — In high school, most of my friends were listening to Led Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix, but I wore out my copy of “Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison” — again, Dad’s influence. So when the “Man in Black” held a press conference, I jumped at the assignment. While l should have been more professional, I followed him to the elevator, shook his hand and thanked him for all his music. I’d do it again.
5 — Speaking of music, I saw almost every major country star of the era because they loved playing Frontier Days. As long as we sat in a booth on the catwalk, people with media credentials could watch for free. I saw classic concerts by Cash, Merle Haggard, Charlie Daniels, Charley Pride, Dolly Parton, Waylon Jennings, Jerry Jeff Walker and Buck Owens. 
But hands down, the most unforgettable performance was by Kenny Rogers in 1978. Not my favorite singer, but it was during a deluge and he stood on stage wearing a soaked yellow slicker, playing his full show under the worst conditions I’ve ever seen.
4 — Reporters are often bumped up the editorial ladder, so eventually most of my Frontier Days writing landed on the opinion page, where I took up the cause of finally appointing women to chair the rodeo’s volunteer committees. It was one of the rare occasions when Cynthia Lummis — then-state legislator, now-U.S. senator — and I were fighting for the same thing.
Every year, we saw it rejected by men who hated the idea. But Lummis was rodeo royalty as a former Miss Frontier Days, and she eventually won them over.
But the guys who ran the show treated me as a traitor to my gender who ruined their world. Still, that was nothing compared to my decision to let PETA and other animal rights activists air their views about rodeo’s alleged cruelty to livestock. Burning me at the stake would not be enough punishment for that sin.
3 — Those guys could have exacted their revenge by tossing me in the legendary Zipper carnival ride. Despite fears of permanent damage, I willingly bought tickets when my future wife wanted to go for a few spins nearly 40 years ago. I’ve had a pain in my neck ever since, though she reminds me I’ve been a pain to her for just as long.
2 — Perseverance can pay off handsomely, as my friend Pete Laybourn proved when, after many years, he won the wild horse riding contest. It’s a fan favorite, and I’ll never forget the smile on his face when he claimed his prize.
1 — My chart-topper was the opposite of Laybourn’s experience. I loved taking photos in the arena because you can’t beat the action. But after a record rain drenched the rodeo grounds overnight, it was a sea of mud. I didn’t want to ruin my boots, so my father loaned me a pair of hip waders.
That worked fine until I drifted way too far from the fence and got literally stuck in the arena’s mud during the bareback event, making me an easy target for a stray horse. When I picked myself off the ground, I held my mostly dry, intact camera high in the air.
I didn’t expect cheers or gasps that I survived, but I also didn’t anticipate waves of laughter from thousands of spectators that kept growing louder as I trudged off, every inch covered in mud. Even my “friends” let me know it was the funniest thing they’d ever seen. It would have gone viral but YouTube hadn’t been invented. 
I’m sure I will get over the humiliation someday. Ask me in a couple of decades.

Even as natural disasters and trade wars have caused row crop prices to decline, record high beef prices, growing poultry production and hundreds millions of dollars in federal disaster payments have bolstered the sector.
Some farmers have reported that federal payments have been slower and lower than needed as they continue to feel the impacts of bad weather in 2023 and 2024 exacerbated by low prices, high costs and trade wars. In Mississippi, row crops, which include soy beans, cotton and corn, have been among the hardest hit.
“This is one of the worst years for row crops,” said Dr. Joshua Maples, an agricultural economist at Mississippi State University. 
Row crops, especially soybeans, are an important part of Mississippi’s economy with soybean production valued at over $1 billion. Farmers are still recovering from the effects of past severe weather conditions and the outlook for 2025 is not promising with higher than normal rainfall that may result in a lower crop yield.
The prices of row crops have declined since 2022 leading to smaller profits for farmers who are struggling to break even with high production costs. As a result of 2018 tariffs, China, the biggest importer of soybeans in the world, shifted to buying more from South America, a loss that the U.S. industry has not recovered from.
The bright spots in the agriculture industry have been the livestock and poultry industries. Poultry, the largest agriculture sector in Mississippi, grew by 10% according to data from the Mississippi State University Extension largely due to strong production.
But livestock saw the most growth, with a 14% increase.
“Livestock is the shining star of Mississippi,” said Mike McCormick, a cattle farmer and president of the Mississippi Farm Bureau Federation. Beef prices have soared due to historically low numbers of cattle in the United States. As of January 1, 2025, there were 86.7 million head of cattle in the United States, the fewest since 1951. 
While cattle farmers are currently seeing higher returns, they struggled for years with drought and weak profit margins leading to smaller herds. Farmers are trying to grow their herds but the process will likely take a few years, so beef prices will likely continue to be high.
In 2024, the state’s agricultural nominal GDP remained relatively unchanged with a decrease of 0.4% while the overall state GDP grew by 4.2%.

Agriculture GDP makes up around 2% of the state GDP. At the end of June, data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed that in the first quarter of 2025, Mississippi’s economy grew 0.7%.  The agriculture sector was the largest contributor to growth of any industry at 0.83%. This was the third straight quarter that agriculture had the largest GDP growth rate in the state.
But agriculture GDP growth in the first quarter of this year was largely due to $120 million in direct payments from the federal government to Mississippi farmers.
“It’s not reflective of the reality farmers are facing right now,” said Andy Gipson, Mississippi’s agricultural commissioner on a recent episode of Mississippi Today’s podcast The Other Side, of what would appear on paper to be robust growth in farming output.
These payments are part of the American Relief Act that was passed in December 2024 that set aside more than $30 billion in direct payments to farmers to help with losses from economic changes and natural disasters. The money is being paid out through multiple programs, including the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, or ECAP, and the Supplemental Disaster Relief Program, or SDRP. The commodity program helps farmers impacted by increased production costs and falling crop prices while the disaster program helps those affected by severe weather in 2023 and 2024.
 “The $120 million is about 3.5% of the total GDP the state gained from ‘Agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting’ in 2024,” said Dr. Sondra Collins a Senior Economist at the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning. She expects to see the impact of these programs on GDP throughout the year as applications continue to be submitted and money is paid out. 
McCormick’s family has been farming in Mississippi since the 1820s and says this is one of the most challenging periods for farmers since the farm crisis of the 1980s. 
“Farming has always been a risky business,” said McCormick.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/06213500/IMG_0328.jpg,,,2025-07-28 06:56:52.622386

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Every Nebraska worker was set to have paid sick leave starting this fall, because voters approved it through a citizen-led initiative.
That change was part of a wave of ballot measures Nebraska voters embraced in recent years, including the legalization of medical marijuana that left lawmakers and a newly created commission to craft the framework of how the new medicine would be regulated. 
Voters also approved increasing the minimum wage and tied future annual pay bumps to inflation. And they rejected state funding to help pay some of the costs of students attending private K-12 schools.
But the officially nonpartisan, GOP-led Nebraska Legislature this session, often with gubernatorial support and the support of at least one Democrat, poked and prodded for changes that would have weakened or reversed those ballot measures. 
Some lawmakers argued that they wanted to make those measures more “workable.” Others sought to reimplement the school voucher law voters rejected.
Different groups of lawmakers resisted each time, often filibustering or arguing against the changes. Many accused the legislative majorities of going against the “will of the people.” 
  A new GOP supermajority 

Nebraska was one of several Republican-led legislatures nationally that sought to restrict or, in Missouri’s case, reverse ballot measures voters approved this year.
Majorities in Lincoln did so after having built a 33-member supermajority. With the new supermajority, conservatives could modify, weaken or repeal citizen initiatives without crossing the political aisle — if Republicans stayed in lockstep.
 Nebraska’s GOP lawmakers and Democratic State Sen. Jane Raybold of Lincoln did so on paid sick leave, weakening the voter-approved law’s blanket requirements for sick leave and adding new restrictions. 
Now employers will no longer be required to offer paid sick leave to young teens, ages 14 and 15, or to temporary workers, seasonal agricultural workers and workers at the state’s smallest businesses, those with 10 or fewer employees.
The larger majority also made the filibuster, a tactic long used in the Unicameral to stall or kill legislation that lacks consensus, less effective. 
Some lawmakers, often Democrats, lamented that the statehouse had become less pragmatic, while Republicans blamed them for using the once-rare stall tactic too often to resist a different will of the voters, conservative lawmaking majorities the people elected. 
Some Democrats said they were left little choice but to stall, as Republicans more frequently stuck together to pass their most controversial priorities.
On medical cannabis, lawmakers refused to establish a clearer framework of how the new laws should be implemented. 
The majority tried to slow down voter-approved minimum wage increases but failed after one lawmaker missed the final round vote. That proposal is already set to be reconsidered next year. Supporters of the slowdown had argued businesses needed more predictable increases. 
Throughout the session, worker advocates and union leaders spoke out against the proposed changes to citizen-led initiatives.

“I don’t understand how democratically elected senators can so easily go against these democratically supported initiatives,” said Sam Washburn, a student activist, in March.
One state senator, speaking privately, said during a last-ditch effort to slow the minimum wage increase that the statehouse is “not a serious place,” and that lawmakers are “not serious people.” 
As the Legislature pushes back against voter-approved laws, lawmakers are also asking voters to consider letting them run for a third term in 2026 via a constitutional amendment. 
Now, after the dust settles, both state parties will try to pick up seats by turning to the same voters. Republicans will try to gain more seats and strengthen their majority to the point that a handful of conservative holdouts would hold less sway. Democrats are trying to end the super majority and restore the filibuster’s strength. 
 The Never-Ending Culture War 

The Nebraska Unicameral, while it isn’t as loud or larger-than-life as some statehouses, also had its culture war spats this spring — from talk of stopping the “elitist” class from promoting lab-grown meat and other foods they call unnatural to restricting what high school and college sports team transgender students can join. 
The Legislature passed legislation that would require public school districts to adopt a policy so parents can see what materials are in school libraries, as book bans passed by school boards and states have drastically increased in recent years.
Nebraska also joined 26 states in having a law that restricts which sports teams transgender students can join. Transgenders people’s participation in sports has become a wedge issue in recent years. ​​Fewer than 10 transgender students have filed to participate in middle school and high school sports in the state over the past decade, according to the Nebraska School Activities Association.
State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area continued proposing bills that affect transgender Nebraskans. In 2023, her bill passed restricting gender care for some minors. That year, her bill and legislative resistance to it sidetracked the session, as State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha filibustered nearly every bill.
ACLU Nebraska Executive Director Mindy Rush Chipman said in a statement, “The constant targeting of LGBTQ+ Nebraskans must stop.”
Kauth, who had to limit her latest bill to high school and college sports to pass it this year, has said she would reintroduce a proposal to set similar sex-based legal restrictions on school bathrooms and locker rooms during next year’s legislative session. 
“The work is not done,” Kauth said. “We’re going to continue.”

 The governor’s future 
Gov. Jim Pillen claimed victory for the bill’s passage. He had identified Kauth’s sports restrictions bill as one of his priorities for the 2025 session. 
Pillen, who announced his 2026 bid for reelection as the session wound down, achieved most of his legislative priorities, including a law against foreign agents, age verification for future social media accounts, the ban on lab-grown meat and a merger of the state’s agencies in charge of overseeing water quality and quantity.
But Pillen fell short a second straight year at convincing some Republican holdouts to support a proposal to alter how the state awards Electoral College votes for president to a winner-take-all system, which every state but Maine and Nebraska use. 
President Donald Trump and campaign surrogates had expressed support for the change during his 2024 campaign, which some pundits thought might come down to the results in Nebraska’s Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District. In the end, former Vice President Kamala Harris won the “blue dot” in the Omaha area but lost Nebraska as a whole to Trump.
While the debate made national headlines, political observers had known the GOP holdouts for months. The bill’s sponsor, State Sen. Loren Lippincott of Central City, knew he was short votes. The governor still pressured lawmakers to debate the change.
The reason: Pillen might need Trump’s backing in 2026, as the Republican governor could face a GOP primary challenger with ties to Trump world. At worst, his team hopes to keep Trump from endorsing an opponent. It would like to earn the president’s backing.

Pillen might face questions about budget troubles slowing his momentum on his top priority, securing lasting property tax relief. 
A handful of Republicans joined most Democrats to oppose Pillen-favored changes to the property tax code, including broadening the sales tax base to cover more of the costs of funding public education that is currently covered by local property taxpayers. Three times now, enough senators have balked at Pillen’s push to tax more goods and services to pay for property tax relief.
He also could face scrutiny for mishandling line-item vetoes to the state’s two-year budget.
“What happened with the delivery of the vetoes is not a problem with the budget,” said State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Appropriations Committee.”
Clements said the budget was put together well, but that a majority of lawmakers would have supported all of Pillen’s intended line-item vetoes. Some Democrats disagreed with that assessment.
 A nation that needs help
Some state lawmakers, following the lead of cohorts in other states, tried and fell short at infusing more religion into public schools, testing the legal limits of the separation of church and state.
One proposal would have required displaying the Ten Commandments in every Nebraska elementary school classroom and in every middle or high school building. Another would have allowed school districts to employ unlicensed religious chaplains to counsel students. 
Neither made it out of committee. 
The lawmakers behind the bills say they aim to restore morality and character among Nebraska students, saying that they believe the nation needs help.
One of the four proposals, Legislative Bill 550, would have let K-12 students be excused during the school day for off-site religious instruction and coursework. That proposal was included in a broader education package that sidetracked the Education Committee for a month. 
LB 550 was married to a proposal that would have given Nebraska teachers more paid time off around significant life events. It fell to a filibuster on the floor after lawmakers from both sides of the aisle expressed concerns about the logistical challenges of letting students leave.

Some who backed the deal have said that parents can already sign out their kids for any reason and that they do not see it as a state endorsement of religion. Critics argued it could open the door to more controversial educational religious bills, including vouchers for private K-12 education and display of the Ten Commandments.
“I think in any normal course of a session, a bill like LB 550 would be seen as a radical piece of legislation,” said State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha during the floor debate. 
A “historically conservative” budget 
Beyond the culture war battles, Lawmakers balanced the budget mostly by using the state’s “rainy day” cash reserve fund and a series of cash transfers and spending cuts to fill budget holes, a budget Pillen touted as “historically conservative.” 
“I believe we are setting the Cornhusker State up for success,” Pillen said. 
Some Democratic lawmakers compared the budget to “The Emperor’s New Clothes,” a fairy tale where the ruler is naked but his subjects pretend he has extravagant clothing. They questioned the math behind it. 
Pillen, should he win reeelection, would face future budgets based on the limitations of the current one — less revenue than anticipated and increased spending over time — a budget already back in the red, facing a deficit of $95 million due to lower tax revenues. 
A vocal, ever-changing group in the Legislature’s minority spent much of the session filibustering. They lost most fights but scored a few wins.
State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln expressed pride that they had blocked the proposal that would have slowed the state’s voter-approved minimum wage increases, for now. 
“I’m glad that we were at least able to fight for everyday working Nebraskan,” Dungan said.

Wes Moore and Westernport Mayor Judy Hamilton speak to reporters Sunday after a 90-minute meeting to discuss the recent FEMA denail of an request for areas hit by devastating floods in May. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)A decision to deny federal emergency aid to areas of Western Maryland hit hard by flooding in May is being called petty, partisan and punishing by Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D).
State, federal and local officials met for 90 minutes inside a Westernport restaurant Sunday to discuss last week’s denial by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the next steps they can take.
And while there is bipartisan agreement that the denial is a “gut punch” to the area, ant that there must be an appeal, there is disagreement on the motivations behind the decision.
Sen. Mike McKay (R-Western Maryland) said that while the reason for the rejection is not yet clear, he does not believe it was political. But Gov. Wes Moore blamed the denial squarely on President Donald Trump (R).
“His decision was a political decision,” Moore told reporters gathered under an awning next to the Port West restaurant Sunday. “There’s no other justification that could make where West Virginia had around the same amount of damage that was done” and had its application approved, while Maryland was rejected.
The comments to reporters are some of the strongest yet made by Moore as he continues to decry a denial of federal aid by the Trump administration.
Moore, McKay, Rep. April McClain Delaney (D-6th) and Westernport Mayor Judy Hamilton met at Port West Restaurant, which was hit hard by flooding that overwhelmed the town’s Main Street area in May. But on Sunday, it was reopepned and doing brisk business.
“Port West and the Subway are staples here,” McKay said, standing outside as a thunderstorm passed through.
Lawmakers call denial of disaster assistance for Western Maryland floods a ‘gut punch’

McKay said the two restaurants were beneficiaries of both a shovel brigade organized by area residents and local government aid that quickly provided some funding that allowed both to jumpstart their own recoveries.
The town and parts of Allegany and Garrett counties were inundated by storms in May. Westernport, which sits near the Potomac and George’s Creek, was among the flood damaged towns.
George’s Creek surged to more than 12 feet above major flood stage. Wills Creek in Cumberland rose 8 feet. The Potomac River also flooded. Areas of both counties were evacuated. Midland, Lonaconing, and Westernport were among the hardest-hit areas.
Moore declared a state of emergency in the area. In addition to providing some state aid, an application for federal recovery funds was also submitted.
Official damage estimates in that request approached $90 million, including damage to the George’s Creek Railroad and to exposed water and gas lines. Many of those damages were offset by insurance claims and further reduced through a “joint assessment” process in which FEMA agrees with some claims but denies others, until the damage estimate was reduced to $15.8 million.
In a letter sent to state and local officials last week, FEMA denied that funding even as it approved $11.7 million in aid for two West Virginia counties hit by a different storm in June.
Hamilton said the area is still struggling to recover. Half a mile away, Ross Street is still closed after part of the road was damaged by the flooding.
“That road alone leads down into town,” Hamilton said. “We have approximately 10 first responders from the fire department, EMS, that live on that hill. By that road not being open, it’s going to delay response. They’re going to have to go a little further out and down … that is going to be a major problem.”
The town of about 2,000 people has a $2 million budget. Damage to the municipality — excluding private property — is currently estimated at $10 million, including the loss of four city vehicles, Hamilton said.
“We lost a lot — the town itself — all of our equipment, our trucks … we lost four vehicles,” she said. “We were able to recently, through insurance money, to replace only three.”
The town has been renting additional equipment “because we don’t have the money to purchase that as well. So financially, it is affecting the town as well as all the citizens.”
With months left in the summer, Hamilton said she is already concerned about residents in the area come winter.

“Families here lost their furnaces. They have no money to replace those. So, we have families that will be cold this winter or will result to other means to heat their homes, which is a concern for the fire department as well,” Hamilton said.
“I’ve been a 25-year member with the fire department and usually homes that don’t have the capability of heating, they switch to kerosene, they switch to electric heaters, and it’s very scary for us to know that that’s probably what a lot of those families are going to do,” she said.
Hamilton said a lack of federal aid will hamstring recovery efforts.
“Honestly, I think we’re going to have to let the road set closed as it is right now,” she said of Ross Street. “You know, we’re only able to do what we can do.”
“There is money that the state has given us that right now we’re using for hot water tanks, looking to provide furnaces, those types of things for our residents,” she said. “People have to come first. The road is secondary to our residents.”
Still, Moore, Delaney and McKay said they hold out hope of reconsideration.
Moore said the state is appealing even though the denial letter offers little insight as to the reasons the state request was rejected. And while McKay and some others said they hoped the federal agency would elaborate on the reason for the denial, Moore was more cynical.
“I’ve stopped trying to do the mental gymnastics of trying to understand how this administration is making its decisions, or what to expect when it comes to partnership with them,” Moore told reporters. “What I do know is the decision that they made, it is petty, it is partisan, and it is punishing and is deeply unfair to the people of Allegany and Garrett County.”
McClain Delaney and McKay both said they have asked for meetings with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
“It’s important that they are forced to justify why … they rejected it so abruptly, because it does seem that any Democratic member who’s asked for help hasn’t received it,” McLain Delaney said.
“I believe that no matter what, your ZIP code doesn’t matter. You know, people over politics, so it’s horrific,” she said. “But the one thing I keep reiterating is this is the best of what recovery looks like — it’s when state, federal and local come together. They pool their resources, and they figure out ways to leverage them to, you know, lift up in the best and most economical way.”

McClain vowed to press the administration for funding.
“We’ll embarrass them,” she said.
When asked if she thought the Trump administration is susceptible to those tactics, McClain Delaney said that “if there is enough publicity and enough of an outcry, it does look embarrassing for them because it looks like they’re penalizing people.”
McKay said he still is not attributing the decision to politics and to punishing an area that voted for Trump even as the state overall did not in 2024.
“I tend to believe that it is not political,” McKay said. “I tend to believe, just from the simple fact … that I don’t believe that FEMA, those who are at FEMA, at that level, are playing politics with applications.”
McKay said he hoped state leaders could push for a reconsideration on the merits of the case.
“I believe that we have shown the metrics that we meet everything,” McKay said. “There is an appeal process. I disagree about trying to embarrass anybody. My grandma said you could always catch a whole lot more flies with honey than a baseball bat.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9586-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-28 06:56:52.622386

Using conventional methods to measure the magnitude of small earthquakes in Yellowstone, however,[...]","This is the Kaleidoscope Geyser in the Lower Geyser Basin. George D. Marler and Donald E. White wrote in their 1975 journal paper that “In 1963, about 18 m northwest of Kaleidoscope Geyser, a violent eruption that may have been a single event scattered scores of blocks of sinter about a newly created crater about 3 m in diameter” but suggested that the event was either directly or indirectly related to the Hebgen Lake earthquake. (Photo by George Marler/ Yellowstone National Park in 1965)Although they mostly go unnoticed by humans, small earthquakes occur much more frequently than large earthquakes, and knowing more about these tiny seismic events can help us better understand the earthquake hazard and geological processes occurring in a region. Using conventional methods to measure the magnitude of small earthquakes in Yellowstone, however, can be challenging. But perhaps artificial intelligence (AI) approaches offer a solution. After all, AI is already helping to refine earthquake location procedures in Yellowstone.
Earthquake magnitudes are calculated from the energy released by the earthquake as recorded by a seismometer. In Yellowstone, the University of Utah Seismograph Stations (UUSS) operates a network of seismometers to monitor earthquakes in the area. Generally, magnitude measurements for a single earthquake are made at several stations in the network independently, and the estimates are then averaged into the final magnitude that is reported. Accurately computing magnitude values for small earthquakes becomes challenging when 1) there are not enough measurements, or 2) earthquakes are happening close together. This is a particular problem during swarms of small earthquakes because the signals from individual seismic events can overlap. Usually, this can be fixed by a seismic analyst after they locate the earthquake, but not always! About 2% of the earthquakes in the UUSS catalog do not have a magnitude computed, likely because of a combination of these issues, so the value is reported as -9.99. To solve this problem, let’s reach into our AI toolkit!
  Example of a Yellowstone seismic waveform recorded at station YMC (at Maple Creek in the northeast part of Yellowstone National Park) with earthquakes for which a magnitude could not be determined. The magnitude was therefore set at -9.99 in the University of Utah Seismograph Stations catalog. The gold area highlights one event, but there are several others close by. The entire window is ~1 minute long. The close occurrence of several earthquakes in such a short time window and their small magnitude values make it a challenge to calculate an earthquake magnitude for any of these events.
Most people are likely familiar with complicated “deep learning” models, like ChatGPT, that accept and output complex data like long text sequences and images. The deep learning models we use in processing small earthquakes are similar, and they take ground motion data from seismometers as the input. Deep learning models like these are a type of machine learning, which describes algorithms that learn patterns in a dataset to estimate values of interest for new data. The models learn the patterns during a training phase, in which the model is provided with examples — sort of like a test with an answer key. After training, the model can accept inputs it has never seen before and estimate the output, given what it learned from the training data.
There is also a somewhat simpler, though still powerful, type of machine learning that relies on human-defined features that describe the data instead of the more complicated, raw data to make predictions. In a recent study, UUSS scientists used this method to train models to calculate earthquake magnitudes based on short windows of data, so it won’t generally be a problem if earthquakes are close together.
In the new approach, the UUSS scientists trained one machine learning model for each station in the Yellowstone region using data from the UUSS earthquake catalog. Each model uses features describing the earthquake signal — such as the amplitude — and the location of the earthquake to estimate a magnitude value. The new method makes better use of the available data by accounting for multiple types of seismic waves, and the method also can take advantage of data from more seismic stations because of the rigorous training step. The net result is that there are up to 4 times as many measurements available to calculate a magnitude. Like in the conventional approach, these measurements are combined to determine a final magnitude.
  A map of the stations operating in the Yellowstone region between 2012 and 2024 shown as triangles with fill and edge colors indicating whether they are used to calculate magnitudes using traditional approaches, artificial intelligence methods, or both. Many more stations can be used with the AI magnitude method, allowing for more small-magnitude values to be computed. The black dots show the locations of the earthquakes cataloged by the University of Utah Seismograph Stations that were used to train the AI models.
The new method will ultimately complement, and not replace, the traditional approach for magnitude calculations. This is because traditional methods work very well most of the time (except for these small, nearby events), and because the machine learning approach does have its limitations, mostly because the models are only going to work well for earthquakes that are similar to the training dataset. So, for example, a model may fail to estimate the magnitude of an earthquake occurring near Hebgen Lake if it saw very few training examples from that area. Similarly, if most training examples were greater than M0.5, the model may perform poorly when applied to earthquakes with a magnitude less than 0.5. Combining predictions from multiple station models can help us to remove and identify poor magnitude estimates, but it can be challenging to know when the models are uncertain. In the future, UUSS scientists plan to expand the approach to not only provide a magnitude, but also an assessment of the confidence in that magnitude.
These machine learning methods are at the current cutting edge of seismology, and Yellowstone provides the perfect location to train and test the new approaches!

(Getty Image)A group of Tennessee electricity providers is taking early steps toward turning part of the West Tennessee Megasite into a power plant designed to generate extra power when demand peaks.
The cooperative has its eye on about 100 acres located near a new substation the Tennessee Valley Authority built to help power the megasite and its tenants, including Ford’s massive BlueOval City electric vehicle and battery manufacturing campus.
The group wants to resurrect the Tennessee Power Distribution Company, a nonprofit, tax-exempt electricity generation and transmission “co-op of co-ops” created in 1999 in case local electricity distribution became an open market. 
The power industry didn’t experience such a transition, so co-ops are considering other uses for the company, according to Mike Knotts, CEO of the Tennessee Electric Cooperative Association, a group of 23 nonprofit electric co-ops that serve more than 2.5 million Tennesseans. The co-ops purchase their energy from TVA and distribute it locally to customers, accounting for about 25% of the federally-owned public utility’s annual revenue, Knotts said.
“This started back at Christmas Eve of 2022 when we experienced a first for our area — which was rolling blackouts — where there was simply not enough capacity to produce energy in the TVA service territory,” said Knotts, who also serves as Tennessee Power Distribution Company president. “So we as local utilities were called upon to, in rolling increments … turn your power off.”
Affordable, reliable and sustainable: report compares utility performance

Winter Storm Elliott plunged much of Tennessee into single-digit temperatures that year, and mechanical failure combined with historically high electricity demand resulted in the rolling blackouts. The utility made multiple changes to its emergency communications procedures and fortified its facilities to try to withstand frigid conditions the following year.
Knotts told members of the West Tennessee Megasite Authority on Wednesday that the group sought to ensure this would never happen again and landed on the idea of building a “peaking facility” themselves.
Such facilities are intended to operate only when electric consumption needs reach extreme highs, running about 10-20% of the year, Knotts said. The site would generate power using simple cycle combustion turbines powered by natural gas. These turbines do not generate steam and as a result have little discharge water.
The Tennessee Power Distribution Company would then sell that power to TVA to be distributed where it’s needed. 
The long process ahead
The Tennessee Electric Cooperative Association, with TVA’s cooperation, completed a site selection study to determine how and where the cooperative could “build assets to produce energy that could complement what TVA does and not disturb the contractual relationship between our cooperatives and TVA,” Knotts said.
The study focused on the Megasite property adjacent to the TVA substation — it’s close to transmission infrastructure, the interstate and a natural gas pipeline installed to serve BlueOval City.
Knotts said the group has had “fruitful” conversations with state officials, and it’s time to move on to more formal arrangements. The cooperative is negotiating with TVA, he said, and will soon start the roughly two-year process of applying to connect to the power transmission grid. 
Ultimately, Knotts said the project would need a binding letter of intent and then a long-term lease agreement for the land from the Megasite Authority. The project also would need the blessing of the State Building Commission and must clear a federal interconnection study.
Several Megasite Authority board members posed questions about the proposed facility’s impact, including potential nitrous oxide emissions. Knotts said the facility would require an air quality permit from the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation. 
The Megasite Authority board did not take formal action on the issue Wednesday, but each member of the board expressed interest in learning more about the proposal at a September meeting.
Knotts said while he does not speak for TVA, the utility has “stated publicly that it has a deficit for capacity,” in addition to a debt cap set by federal law limiting how many new generation projects TVA can take on.
“Plants like this are going to be built, so our members decided, jointly, we would rather do this, given our service mission, given we are nonprofit entities … than outsource it to a for-profit company,” he said.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Workers’ rights and the state budget were among the top themes of Nebraska’s 2025 legislative session as lawmakers tried to balance new voter-approved laws with legislative power, all while dealing with a major budget deficit.
State lawmakers had telegraphed their intent to adjust what Nebraskans passed in recent years, including votes to increase the minimum wage (passed by about 59% of voters in 2022) and mandate paid sick leave for all workers (passed by about 75% of voters in 2024).
The labor laws came into focus in the first contested vote of the 2025 session in January, the choice for chair of the Business and Labor Committee.

Both candidates for the post — Omaha State Sens. Kathleen Kauth and John Cavanaugh, a Republican and Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, neither of whom had yet served on the committee — hinted that the laws from Nebraska’s “second house” might need adjustments.
“We need to make sure that we honor the intent of those [voter-initiated] bills and get through the process successfully,” Kauth said Jan. 8. She would be elected committee chair 31-18.
Cavanaugh described the need for possible “technical updates and implementation” to some of the ballot-passed laws while stating the Business and Labor Committee should “be respectful of the will of the voters but also make sure that we are taking into consideration those very real concerns.”
The labor proposals worked their way through Kauth’s committee, and the fights spilled over like proxy wars into other labor measures and the budget.
If 2023 focused on health care and 2024 focused on education and taxes, in that year’s regular and special sessions, 2025 focused on the budget and labor, often a direct response to the “will of the voters” from recent elections.
‘Will of the voters’
The phrases “will of the voters” or “will of the people” were repeated throughout the session and became rallying cries for opponents of the labor bills. One example was the morning of March 26 when the phrases were said 44 times by 14 different senators during three hours of debate on proposed changes to paid sick leave, legislative transcripts show.
The proposed tweaks were panned as partisan and nearly divided the 49-member Legislature along ideological lines. One Democratic exception, State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, a grocery store executive, joined 32 of 33 Republicans on the labor-related, voter-passed laws.

The result left 33 votes, which is the minimum threshold to overcome a filibuster but also change voter-approved laws as required under the Nebraska Constitution. However, the minimum wage proposal led by Raybould stalled procedurally but will likely return in 2026 and pass if all supporters hold.
Supporters defended the efforts to water down paid sick leave protections and slow minimum wage increases as necessary for businesses, citing fiscal and cost restraints.
“I don’t think we’re undoing the will of the people as much as we are contemplating what the financial impact may be,” State Sen. Tony Sorrentino of the Elkhorn area said in late March.
But opponents regularly questioned the message to “working families” and made the fight personal, especially for Raybould and other business owners.
“We can see by opening the door to undermining the will of the people under the auspices of so-called ‘technical corrections,’ it has opened a Pandora’s box to completely defy the will of the people,” State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln said the same day Sorrentino spoke.
‘Nebraska: We do not like competition’
Two other labor fights moved more quickly, including a pair from freshman State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse, and led to the gnashing of senators’ teeth early in the session.

Hallstrom’s first bill classified rideshare drivers for Uber, Lyft and Door Dash as independent contractors, locking workers out from some employee-based protections for discussing organizing into unions (Legislative Bill 229), while the other increased the legal threshold to sue companies after cybersecurity breaches, protecting businesses from lawsuits unless they showed “willful, wanton or gross negligence” in securing data (LB 241).
The fights repeatedly drove a wedge between some progressives in the legislative minority and Raybould, who also joined 32 Republicans on the rideshare and cybersecurity bills over filibusters.
Conrad and State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha, both progressives, viewed the Hallstrom bills as part of an emerging theme of being hostile to labor as the pushes to change voter-led laws waited in the wings.

McKinney on March 4, during debate on a smaller fight over liquor licenses designed to help in-state distillers, said the state was reaching a new slogan: “Nebraska: We do not like competition.”
“It’s either competition or helping out corporations,” McKinney said at the time.
State Sen. Dan Quick of Grand Island, one of two Democratic lawmakers representing Trump-won districts, led the distillery measure that Raybould opposed to the point of seeking an attorney general’s opinion. She argued Quick’s proposal would have given “preferential treatment” to in-state operators and could entangle other liquor laws and lead to lawsuits. The bill passed 33-13.
Conrad on Feb. 4 called out “palpable disdain both for the voters of Nebraska and for working families,” and on March 6 she said “anti-worker legislation” was moving “at record pace.”
Legislature’s referendum power
Hallstrom, a former longtime lobbyist who had worked around the statehouse since 1981 when he graduated from the University of Nebraska College of Law, defended his legislation as helping protect “flexible work” for rideshare drivers. He said it would help working families. He said his other bill limiting lawsuits after data breaches would cut back on “speculative risks” that he argued could strain judicial resources or cost businesses.

Hallstrom said he doesn’t buy into the criticisms of him and others that they had advanced “anti-worker legislation” or pushed back on voters. 
Instead, Hallstrom and Raybould repeatedly pointed to the Nebraska Constitution, as amended by the voters in 2004, that gives the Legislature the ability to amend voter-approved laws with at least 33 votes. Voters set the 33-vote threshold that year, moving it up from a simple majority.
“Not only have the people spoken with regard to the specific statutory initiatives regarding minimum wage and paid sick leave, but they’ve spoken just as loudly to the authority of the Legislature to make revisions where deemed appropriate and necessary,” Hallstrom told the Examiner.
Finding a ‘balanced approach’
Raybould was among those who repeatedly said senators in the majority were standing up for a “balanced approach” to “good policy,” which she and others argued would better help keep Nebraskans safe, healthy and employed with benefits and competitive wages.
  State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln. Jan. 9, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska News Service)
Her minimum wage proposal sought to slow the annual rate at which the state’s minimum wage increases beginning in 2027, rather than increasing it based on inflation as voters mandated. Raybould’s measure would also carve out teen workers, aged 14 or 15, for a “youth minimum wage.”
“You have to always balance it out to make sure that we maintain the economic vitality and vibrancy and economic growth in our state without falling off and creating a cycle of cost increases that are so much harder for Nebraska families to be able to afford,” Raybould said in April.
Raybould took barbs from colleagues she usually agrees with, including Conrad. In March, Conrad urged her “friends on the left,” primarily Raybould, to renege from what she called an “ongoing assault on working families and workers’ rights” that were “undermining your values.”
“You claim to support civil rights. You claim to support human rights,” Conrad said. “Yet, without economic justice, Nebraskans have no opportunity to be empowered to exercise those.”
Raybould has decided to not seek reelection in 2026. She said her decision was not related to the “rather brutal” 2025 session or her minimum wage bill.
‘Making it so that it will work’
The paid sick leave law voters passed required sick leave to be paid to all employees beginning Oct. 1. But before the law takes effect, legislative changes led to passage by freshman State Sen. Paul Strommen of Sidney this spring will leave out teens aged 14 or 15, agricultural workers, independent contractors and businesses of 10 or fewer workers from the new requirement.
  State Sen. Paul Strommen of Sidney meets with his staff on the floor of the Nebraska Legislature. March 26, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
The back-and-forth was similar to that of minimum wage but featured a seemingly brief compromise in Strommen’s proposal that would have allowed more employees to be entitled to paid sick leave, including requiring it of businesses with 6-10 employees and for 14 or 15 year olds who are parents.
Strommen had said his measure recognized the “will of the voters, while also avoiding a few serious detriments to small businesses and workers and the Nebraska economy.”
But at the urging of State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte, lawmakers reconsidered the “compromise.” It returned to the new Strommen requirements.
The majority yanked the “compromise” partly because the floor fight over the bill continued even after the changes had been adopted.
“We’re not taking away what the voters said they wanted. We’re making modifications to it,” Jacobson said in May. “We’re making it so that it will work for small businesses and for employers.”

The “compromise” would have also reinstated the voter-approved right for employees to sue to enforce the law, rather than solely relying on the Nebraska Department of Labor. Some lawmakers hope to revive that provision in 2026.
Employers can still choose to offer paid sick leave to any employee before the law takes effect Oct. 1, and employers can pay any employee above the state minimum wage, for that matter.
The way the public can petition the state government could also change as Strommen introduced an interim study to examine Nebraska’s ballot measure process, including possible statutory or constitutional tweaks.
Medical cannabis
The labor fights also played at least a small role in the defeat of efforts to tweak medical cannabis laws to legalize and regulate the drug, which voters approved in November. 
But unlike the paid sick leave and minimum wage proposals, longtime advocates for medical cannabis, including those who led the 2024 campaign, had supported and asked for the legislative changes.
Cavanaugh was among those helping negotiate a path forward for the bill while Kauth worked with the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office on a hemp-related ban that some worried could ensnare the new legal framework for medical cannabis.

Some conservatives, including State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman, described the lawmakers’ efforts on medical cannabis as “political theater,” saying the proposal was meant to get around lawsuits, which have so far failed.
Storer and State Sen. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County were among senators blasting progressives for embracing changes to the voter-approved medical cannabis legislation yet deriding conservatives for pursuing changes to the voter-approved laws on paid sick leave and minimum wage.
“This bill’s unnecessary, inappropriate, undermines the will of the people and implements recreational marijuana,” Andersen said at the time.

Progressives, including State Sen. John Fredrickson of Omaha, who similarly opposed the minimum wage and paid sick leave legislative bills, contended that cannabis would not “leap off the shelves” and corrupt Nebraska youths, as some opponents had suggested. 
He said senators, sometimes, needed to go outside and “touch some grass and just think about what the world is like outside of this room.”
“Let’s not get too concerned about ‘fighting against the will of the people,’” Fredrickson continued. “Let’s help shape it. Let’s help put in the right guardrails in place, and let’s help build a system that we can be proud of and puts our patients first.”
Ongoing budget balancing
Minimum wage, paid sick leave and medical cannabis could all return in 2026, as could major adjustments to Nebraska’s 2025-27 budget.
Lawmakers began the 2025 session trying to juggle a $432 million projected hole but needed to cover even more after an economic forecast in April estimated fewer state receipts for the next two years.
  State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood. Jan. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Lawmakers juggled roughly $850 million in changes, such as creating new revenue streams, cutting state spending, scrounging for loose dollars in state cash funds and dipping into the state’s “rainy day” fund. In the end, they finished the session with $4.15 million to spare.
“It seemed like an insurmountable mountain to climb, but we did it, and we also did not cut essential services,” State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, Appropriations Committee chair, said after the budget passed in May.
Still, the budget fight isn’t over. Just last week, revised fiscal estimates, including receipts coming $86 million short in May and June, returned the two-year state budget to a nearly $100 million deficit that will need fixing.
Speaker John Arch of La Vista identified the state budget as the top issue of 2025 before the session began, and he has said it again will be top of mind in 2026.
Arch had told his colleagues to prepare for and be mindful if there is an economic shift before 2026, notably in state receipts or via the federal government. 
Those urgings came before the latest state projections and before Congress passed President Donald Trump’s “one big beautiful bill” that could cut Nebraska’s share of Medicaid dollars and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits.
  State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha. Jan. 23, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Gov. Jim Pillen, who, along with all of Nebraska’s congressional delegation, supported the federal bill, has said the state is “prepared” if federal funding stalls or slows, which he called “our job.” But he has taken a different approach than recent GOP governors in trying to draw down “more than our fair share” of federal dollars.
Also likely to be considered as part of the 2026 budget debate will be Pillen’s attempted line-item vetoes from the end of the 2025 session, the official copies of which were delivered to the wrong office in May, which lawmakers said made the attempted vetoes null and void. 
Next year will also feature a new Pillen goal to state agencies under his control: Cut 10% from the just-approved $5.5 billion annual spending.
State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha had compared the budget state lawmakers approved in 2025 to the fairy tale “The Emperor’s New Clothes,” where the ruler is naked but his subjects pretend he has extravagant clothing. She said the budget, which she opposed, was “based on a number of sleight of hands.”
“It is not actually balanced,” DeBoer said in May. “We’re just making it look like it’s balanced.”



Oher 2025 items of note
Among other major legislation in 2025:

Property taxes — For the third time in a row, lawmakers rejected attempts to shift some of the burden from local property taxes onto currently sales tax-exempt goods and services. The governor has acknowledged that the failure to pass more property tax relief in 2025 could lead to increased property tax bills as lawmakers hope to address the perennial issue in 2026. In the meantime, a new School Financing Review Commission will meet and soon begin suggesting long-term solutions.
Social media and cellphones — Lawmakers approved age verification for all social media sites, beginning July 1, 2026; implemented new social media design features meant to protect children and required school districts to adopt policies with the goal of banning most student cellphone use on school grounds. The creation of child sexual abuse material using artificial intelligence will also soon be prohibited in the state.
Juvenile justice — A broad “public safety” package included a bill from State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, at the request of Gov. Jim Pillen, to allow the detention of younger juveniles, as young as 11, down from 13. All temporary and alternative placement options must be exhausted before a child aged 11 or 12 can be detained.
Legislative oversight — A new legislative division and committee was created in a multiyear standoff with the executive branch over legislative oversight of child welfare and corrections.
School retirement — Questions over whether the state should continue contributing to public employees’ retirement funds when obligations are fully funded came to a head with the Governor’s Office fighting with the Nebraska State Education Association and a flareup among Lincoln lawmakers. In the end, school employees received a benefit if obligations are nearly or fully funded, leading to more take-home pay in the upcoming year and a smaller cost for the state.
A new state department — Beginning July 1, the Nebraska Department of Water, Energy and Environment was established from the merger of the former Nebraska Department of Natural Resources and the former Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy.

But now that President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending law bars students from borrowing more than $50,000 annually in unsubsidized federal loans for medical school, Bonner is worried her dream of becoming a doctor is financially out of reach.
“I get told, ‘Well, we really need you. We have a physician shortage, and you’ve done all this work leading up to this point,’ and that’s true as well, and it’s not that I want to quit,” Bonner said in a recent interview. “But there are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can’t take out the full cost of living through loans.”
The tax and spending law includes provisions that significantly alter the student loan process for higher education. The law halts current student loan repayment plans for loans that are granted on or after July 1, 2026. On that date, the law also terminates Grad PLUS loans, which have helped people pay for their higher education degrees and total cost of attendance. Current borrowers will be grandfathered in.
The federal law gives current borrowers enrolled in loan repayment plans for students based on income — such as those plans known as SAVE or IBR — until July 1, 2028, to switch to a new plan. Interest collection will resume Aug. 1 for students enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE plan.
At the same time, medical or law school students hoping to get unsubsidized federal loans — in which the borrower is responsible for paying the interest at all times rather than the government — will only be able to borrow $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in areas such as history or philosophy have a $100,000 lifetime cap.

The average yearly cost of medical school for the 2024-25 academic year ranged from around $42,000 to $72,000, depending on whether the school was private or public and whether the student was a resident or nonresident, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Some congressional Republicans say that students need to be working harder to pay for higher education, like medical school, on their own. Others say the caps put the onus back on colleges and universities to rein in the rising cost of tuition. But critics of this legislation say the loan caps are only going to harm students, especially from lower-income backgrounds, and will exacerbate physician shortages.
In recent years states have tried to ease physician shortages by implementing various policy solutions. Since 2023, at least nine states have made it easier for doctors trained in other countries to get medical licenses. States have also participated in interstate licensing compacts, allowing nurses and physician assistants to travel across state lines to work, so long as they are licensed in one state within the compact.
For student loan relief, more than 20 states have enacted legislation to address student loan forgiveness, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a group that tracks states policies. Georgia passed a measure that will expand a cancelable loan program for physicians working in rural and underserved areas. Idaho also created the Rural Nursing Loan Repayment Program, offering nurses $25,000 in forgivable loans after three years of service in a rural area.

McKenzie Richards, a health care policy fellow at the conservative think tank Cicero Institute who has been studying the pace of physician shortages, told Stateline that the national physician shortage could potentially exceed 100,000 by 2034. At the end of 2024 that projected number was closer to 64,000 physicians.
Richards said states will be looking toward more policy solutions should the student loan changes exacerbate physician shortages.
“We know what’s going to be happening coming down the line in just five years, so I think policies that states can adopt to get out of this are really important to be looking at now,” she said.
“The hope is that by capping [federal loans], it will encourage schools to lower tuition prices,” Richards added. “Then maybe they need to be admitting more students, which would have a great downstream effect for getting more doctors through.”
Other students will be in the same boat, said Lesley Turner, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Chicago and an economist.
“This is going to hit some students worse than others,” Turner told Stateline. “Those [students] in more expensive programs tend to borrow more, and so for those students they will need to return to private student loans or other ways of financing their graduate education.”
Many students were already questioning their capacity to go to medical school before the student loan caps, said Shannon Jimenez, dean of the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine.
“I expect that this bill, this cap, is going to push people out of primary care and into specialties to help pay off those higher interest rate loans,” Jimenez told Stateline. She added that caps will likely deter students from lower socioeconomic statuses from going into primary care — important in places like Arkansas, where she says there is a “maldistribution of physicians.”
“Many schools like us try to attract those students, because they’re more likely to go into primary care and serve in underserved areas. So it’s going to tie our hands in a lot of ways.”

Large states and more rural states will feel the gaps more deeply, said Richards, of the Cicero Institute. Louisiana, for example, is projected to be short almost 5,000 doctors from a variety of specialties by 2030, including close to 400 primary care doctors. Already more than a third of Louisiana physicians are close to retirement age — similar to the situation in neighboring Arkansas.
As for whether schools will just be able to lower tuition, Jimenez said, “it makes no sense.”
“We still function in a somewhat market-driven economy and have to compete with other schools around us, so our cost is based mostly on what we have to pay our faculty, and that’s not going to go down,” she said. The annual cost of attendance at her school is between $80,000 and $85,000.
Bonner, the EMT, holds a political communications degree from Regent University and now is studying biomedical sciences at Old Dominion University. She already has $20,000 in loans, she said, and for the rest of college tuition, she has paid out of pocket. Since she’s supporting herself, she hasn’t been able to save much.
She’d planned to take the medical school entrance exam next spring, but now worries about how she’d pay for living expenses while attending. “Medical school scheduling doesn’t allow for working, so you have to take out loans for living expenses,” she said.
“A lot of people, I feel, would be panicked if you had worked for eight to 10 years of your life and found out that all the systems that you were banking on in a really academically challenging space are disappearing,” Bonner said.
“I don’t see a path forward for certain, but I’m fighting to make one.”

After months of  uncertainty and scrambling, we’re now told the funds are coming — but too late to avoid the  chaos caused by the delay. 
Most administrators I’ve spoken with in North Dakota were prepared to make things work  without these funds if they believed their students would still benefit. That’s the “we’ll make it  work” attitude that defines rural communities. However, with property tax caps imposed by state  law, declining enrollment, and the constant uncertainty surrounding federal funding, these same  administrators are bracing for a tough spring in 2026. The challenge is not just funding; it’s how  we attract and retain teachers in these conditions. 
US Education Department to unfreeze contested K-12 funds

Rural schools, students, and communities have always shown remarkable resilience in the face of  adversity. But this federal funding freeze and subsequent late reinstatement doesn’t just impact  the budgets — it undermines the stability that families in rural areas rely on. Schools in North  Dakota have been left trying to piece together plans without knowing if they would have the  funding to pay for essential services. Educators have had to delay hiring, adjust programs, and  scale back on services they knew were crucial for their students’ success. As Kirsten Baesler  notified us Friday at 10:56 p.m., these funds are now back in the mix, but how many late-night announcements do we need before we realize the impact of this uncertainty on our rural communities? 
Rural schools don’t run on “maybe.” We plan carefully and rely on these federal funds to provide  essential services, from migrant education to after-school programs. But when we’re told to wait,  then suddenly rush to use funds months late, it only makes the work harder and more uncertain. We need stability. It’s time for the federal government to recognize that rural schools can’t  function on last-minute decisions and delayed promises. Our kids deserve better than this.",https://northdakotamonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-115093584-scaled-1-1024x680.jpeg,,,2025-07-28 06:56:52.622386

We have a physician shortage, and you’ve done all this work leading up to this point,’ and that’s true as well, and it’s not that I want to quit,” Bonner said in a recent interview. “But there are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can’t take out the full cost of living through loans.”
The tax and spending law includes provisions that significantly alter the student loan process for higher education. The law halts current student loan repayment plans for loans that are granted on or after July 1, 2026. On that date, the law also terminates Grad PLUS loans, which have helped people pay for their higher education degrees and total cost of attendance. Current borrowers will be grandfathered in.
The federal law gives current borrowers enrolled in loan repayment plans for students based on income — such as those plans known as SAVE or IBR — until July 1, 2028, to switch to a new plan. Interest collection will resume Aug. 1 for students enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE plan.
At the same time, medical or law school students hoping to get unsubsidized federal loans — in which the borrower is responsible for paying the interest at all times rather than the government — will only be able to borrow $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in areas such as history or philosophy have a $100,000 lifetime cap.










There are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can't take out the full cost of living through loans.


– Michaela Bonner, aspiring medical student


The average yearly cost of medical school for the 2024-25 academic year ranged from around $42,000 to $72,000, depending on whether the school was private or public and whether the student was a resident or nonresident, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Some congressional Republicans say that students need to be working harder to pay for higher education, like medical school, on their own. Others say the caps put the onus back on colleges and universities to rein in the rising cost of tuition. But critics of this legislation say the loan caps are only going to harm students, especially from lower-income backgrounds, and will exacerbate physician shortages.
In recent years states have tried to ease physician shortages by implementing various policy solutions. Since 2023, at least nine states have made it easier for doctors trained in other countries to get medical licenses. States have also participated in interstate licensing compacts, allowing nurses and physician assistants to travel across state lines to work, so long as they are licensed in one state within the compact.
For student loan relief, more than 20 states have enacted legislation to address student loan forgiveness, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a group that tracks states policies. Georgia passed a measure that will expand a cancelable loan program for physicians working in rural and underserved areas. Idaho also created the Rural Nursing Loan Repayment Program, offering nurses $25,000 in forgivable loans after three years of service in a rural area.

McKenzie Richards, a health care policy fellow at the conservative think tank Cicero Institute who has been studying the pace of physician shortages, told Stateline that the national physician shortage could potentially exceed 100,000 by 2034. At the end of 2024 that projected number was closer to 64,000 physicians.
Richards said states will be looking toward more policy solutions should the student loan changes exacerbate physician shortages.
“We know what’s going to be happening coming down the line in just five years, so I think policies that states can adopt to get out of this are really important to be looking at now,” she said.
“The hope is that by capping [federal loans], it will encourage schools to lower tuition prices,” Richards added. “Then maybe they need to be admitting more students, which would have a great downstream effect for getting more doctors through.”
Other students will be in the same boat, said Lesley Turner, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Chicago and an economist.
“This is going to hit some students worse than others,” Turner told Stateline. “Those [students] in more expensive programs tend to borrow more, and so for those students they will need to return to private student loans or other ways of financing their graduate education.”
Many students were already questioning their capacity to go to medical school before the student loan caps, said Shannon Jimenez, dean of the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine.
“I expect that this bill, this cap, is going to push people out of primary care and into specialties to help pay off those higher interest rate loans,” Jimenez told Stateline. She added that caps will likely deter students from lower socioeconomic statuses from going into primary care — important in places like Arkansas, where she says there is a “maldistribution of physicians.”
“Many schools like us try to attract those students, because they’re more likely to go into primary care and serve in underserved areas. So it’s going to tie our hands in a lot of ways.”

Large states and more rural states will feel the gaps more deeply, said Richards, of the Cicero Institute. Louisiana, for example, is projected to be short almost 5,000 doctors from a variety of specialties by 2030, including close to 400 primary care doctors. Already more than a third of Louisiana physicians are close to retirement age — similar to the situation in neighboring Arkansas.
As for whether schools will just be able to lower tuition, Jimenez said, “it makes no sense.”
“We still function in a somewhat market-driven economy and have to compete with other schools around us, so our cost is based mostly on what we have to pay our faculty, and that’s not going to go down,” she said. The annual cost of attendance at her school is between $80,000 and $85,000.
Bonner, the EMT, holds a political communications degree from Regent University and now is studying biomedical sciences at Old Dominion University. She already has $20,000 in loans, she said, and for the rest of college tuition, she has paid out of pocket. Since she’s supporting herself, she hasn’t been able to save much.
She’d planned to take the medical school entrance exam next spring, but now worries about how she’d pay for living expenses while attending. “Medical school scheduling doesn’t allow for working, so you have to take out loans for living expenses,” she said.
“A lot of people, I feel, would be panicked if you had worked for eight to 10 years of your life and found out that all the systems that you were banking on in a really academically challenging space are disappearing,” Bonner said.
“I don’t see a path forward for certain, but I’m fighting to make one.”

Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.
 
The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.










The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling.


– Oregon Republican state Rep. Cyrus Javadi


Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.
U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans misrepresented family’s immigration history

Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.
Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A coalition of media groups, including the Tennessee Lookout, is challenging a new state law making it a crime to come within 25 feet of a law enforcement officer after being told to stay back.  
Tennessee’s so-called “buffer” law lays out scenarios in which reporters or others approaching police may be arrested and charged with a misdemeanor.
They include situations in which an officer is conducting a traffic stop, working the scene of an alleged crime or handling “an ongoing and immediate threat to public safety.” The law does not require an intent by journalists to disrupt police activity and gives officers discretion to decide when to order reporters and photographers to stay away. 
Bill expanding Tennessee law enforcement powers during protests draws pushback

The law has “grave implications” for the ability of journalists and news organizations to exercise their First Amendment rights, the lawsuit said. 
“The Act authorizes law enforcement officers to bar journalists (and the public) from reporting — for any reason and no reason — on a wide range of events of public interest, including a parade, a rally, and arrest or an accident scene,” the complaint said. 
“The Act applies with equal force to a reporter gathering the news in a park, standing on a sidewalk or lawfully present in other spaces open to the public,” it said. 
The lawsuit is seeking a judgment that the law violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments and an injunction blocking the law, which took effect July 1, from being enforced against the media organizations filing suit.
In addition to the Lookout, the Nashville Banner, Gannett, Scripps Media and TEGNA are plaintiffs in the suit, represented by Paul McAdoo and Grayson Clary of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. The organization has successfully obtained preliminary injuctions against similar laws in Louisiana and Indiana.

Wisconsin Books to Prisoners and the Wisconsin Department of Corrections plan a second test of having books sent to incarcerated people. (Photo courtesy of Wisconsin Department of Corrections)  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The nonprofit Wisconsin Books to Prisoners told the Wisconsin Examiner that another pilot project involving the nonprofit and the Wisconsin Department of Corrections will take place in the next three to four weeks. 
The collaborations between the nonprofit and the department might lead to the books project being permitted to send used books to people incarcerated in prisons across the state. 
The department said last year that it could no longer accept used books from anyone, including the nonprofit. The DOC cited concerns about drug smuggling and alleged that some book shipments tested positive for drugs. This led to scrutiny of the department’s rationale for the used book ban. 
“We have hundreds of requests for books that haven’t been fulfilled since the only-new-books policy was established,” Camy Matthay of Wisconsin Books to Prisoners said over email. 
In an August 2024 email to the books project, a DOC official said the concern was not with the nonprofit but with people who would impersonate it. 
In late June, the books project organizers said they were able to send used and new books to Oakhill Correctional Institution in a pilot program. The books were added to the library collection, making them available for checkout by those who requested them. 
DOC communications director Beth Hardtke said the pilot program was designed to allow the DOC to test and refine its screening process for donated reading materials to ensure safety. 
Hardtke said that between 2019 and 2023, 20 incarcerated people died of drug overdoses in DOC facilities, while none have died of drug overdoses in 2024 or so far in 2025. She also cited a study about harmful effects that can occur when incarcerated people are exposed to drug-soaked paper strips. 
“The goal is to eventually allow WBTP to send reading materials to individuals at any DOC facility — safely,” Hardtke said in late June. 
Hardtke said at the time that starting July 1, WBTP would be able to send requested materials directly to individuals at Oakhill instead of the library.
Instead, the DOC has asked for a second pilot, Matthay said. For that, the books project will send books to a library at a second prison. Matthay said this pilot will take place in the next three to four weeks. 
“Should our books pass inspection without issues at prison number two, WBTP hopes to return to fulfilling our mission, i.e., sending books directly to prisoners who request books from us,” Matthay said. 
She said the group is not likely to return to sending books to prisoners directly before September. 
Matthay said that per the DOC’s request, the group will no longer fulfill requests for specific titles. Instead, prisoners are asked to request books by subject matter or genre. 
She said the group provides tracking numbers that will validate the source of the books, and that the nonprofit will also include embossed receipts. 
According to Wisconsin Books to Prisoners, in August 2024, the group asked the DOC if the organization could resolve the concerns about impersonation by providing a postal service tracking number for every package of books it ships. 
Hardtke said the department recognizes the importance of education and books as part of rehabilitation and maintains libraries at all institutions, offers books on electronic tablets and has educational partnerships with the University of Wisconsin System and the state’s technical colleges. 
Critics have raised questions about the quality of the selection on the tablets and whether the quality of the libraries varies by institution. 
Matthay said that when boxes of books have been returned to the nonprofit over the years, the cause was confusion in the mailrooms. 
In late June, the nonprofit said that many of the packages of new books sent to prisoners had been returned to the group. Sending new books to prisoners is not banned by the DOC. 
“We think this problem will resolve itself,” Matthay said, as the DOC establishes better lines of communication between the agency’s headquarters and the institutions that take in the books. 
“The DOC understands that this will improve security for WBTP as well as the DOC,” Matthay said. She added that “it is also understood that when these pilots are completed and if we get a greenlight, that the new policy — whatever that may be — needs to be clearly communicated to all employees (and prisoners too) to avoid confusion.”

Vibrant Health Products selected Rossville — a town of about 1,200 residents near the southwest border of Fayette and Shelby counties in West Tennessee — as its U.S. manufacturing location. 
The company will move into Rossville’s former Kellogg Company’s Eggo plant. Kellogg closed the plant in 2024, laying off 142 workers.
“This is a transformative moment for Rossville and our surrounding communities,” Fayette County Mayor Rhea “Skip” Taylor and Rossville Mayor Judy Watters said in a joint statement. “The acquisition of our former Kellogg facility by Vibrant Health Partners breathes new life into a vital part of our local economy while creating hundreds of quality jobs for our residents.”
The mayors also said the project “underscores the resilience and potential of our community.”
The company received incentives from the state, but the details of the deal are not immediately clear.
Vibrant Health Products will begin with bread production at the new site with plans to expand to other baked goods. 
The brand produces a variety of health-focused baked goods, including organic, gluten-free, grain-free, non-GMO, plant-based, paleo and keto options. Its main operations are located in Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada.
“Our new bakery in Tennessee will help us increase production so we can welcome new customers and sustain strategic relationships, explore new possibilities for innovation, broaden our business in new product categories, create stable jobs on both sides of the border and pursue every opportunity to share our healthier products with the world,” Vibrant Health Products President and co-founder Stan Smith said in a Friday news release.

Rep. Nathan Toman, R-Mandan, who will chair the effort, said his goal for the task force is to work with state agencies to ensure they are running effectively. 
“We’re trying to view it as a partnership saying, ‘We want to help you guys succeed and we want the employees to succeed,’” Toman said. 
The first meeting will include presentations from the departments of Health and Human Services, Information Technology and Commerce. Joe Morrissette, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said those agencies, along with higher education and K-12 education, have some of the largest budgets.
“If the end result is going to be an impact on the overall state budget, you’ve got to look at those big areas,” Morrissette said.

North Dakota’s task force will not have Elon Musk’s chainsaw, with DOGE seeking out savings without the approval of Congress. The state version will submit a report before the 2027 legislative session that details possible cost savings, plus recommended legislation.
Toman also said the executive branch members of the task force may be able to take action to adjust some programs, if those changes are allowed under state law without needing additional legislation.
Lawmakers earlier this year approved a state budget of $20.3 billion for 2025-27, including federal and other funds. Toman said he believes the task force could find more than $1 billion in cost savings, though he said a more realistic goal would be saving hundreds of millions.
Toman said examples of efficiencies could include reducing funding allocated to programs, cutting staffing levels, reevaluating state partnerships with vendors and streamlining processes.
He added the task force will be looking at federal funding cuts to the state and their effects on state programs and agencies.
State Auditor Josh Gallion, one of the members, said he hopes the task force reduces redundancies and improves outcomes.
“But I also think we have to have a goal of reducing overall spending,” Gallion said. “Our state budget, the growth that we’ve had over the last decade is just not sustainable.”

Morrissette, also a member of the task force, said finding government program efficiency does not always mean finding things to cut.
“I hope the committee has an open mind when we look at things because there could be some opportunities where in order to do something better and be more effective, it may cost more resources,” he said. 
For example, he said his office recently hired a leasing agent for government facilities to take the leasing burden off of state agencies. The office also added a state construction supervisor so all state construction projects are handled under one roof, making it more efficient.
“I think long-term, we’ll save millions over time by having better negotiation on leases and better negotiation on construction managing fees,” Morrissette said.
Jonathan Casper, a former Fargo-area state senator and business owner, is the only person on the task force not currently serving in state government. He said he doesn’t expect the state task force will find misuses of programs and funds, but it can still look for efficiencies in government.
“North Dakota is constitutionally required to balance its budget. The federal government doesn’t,” Casper said. “Until such time as the federal government does, I think having something like DOGE on the federal level is different than on the state level.”
House Bill 1442, which created the task force, calls for the group to meet at least once every three months and operate until July 31, 2031.

Rep. Nathan Toman, R-Mandan, chair
Sen. Chuck Walen, R-New Town, vice chair
Rep. Glenn Bosch, R-Bismarck

It also touched on where he stands on issues such as immigration, Medicaid expansion, “school choice,” and his affinity for President Donald Trump.","Thomas Duff has used his wealth from a tire empire he and his brother created to become a political power broker and sought-after philanthropist. 
Duff, of Hattiesburg, has been involved in state politics, but only peripherally or behind the scenes. Now, the tire baron is considering a political run of his own. His entrance into the 2027 Republican primary for governor could reshape a field of candidates likely to include several statewide officials. 
Duff served an eight-year stint on the state Institutions of Higher Learning Board, first appointed by former Gov. Phil Bryant. He has been a major contributor to many Republican campaigns in Mississippi, and earlier this year formed and funded a political action committee to help elect Republicans to city and legislative offices. He and his brother are major supporters of higher education and have donated millions to Mississippi universities.
As he mulls a run for governor, the billionaire businessman sat for a wide-ranging interview with Mississippi Today.
The conversation spanned his business philosophy, support for tariffs, concerns about Mississippi’s “brain drain,” and his investments in the state’s higher education system. It also touched on where he stands on issues such as immigration, Medicaid expansion, “school choice,” and his affinity for President Donald Trump.
The interview was conducted June 17 and has been edited for clarity and length.
Mississippi Today: Tell me about the moment when you knew that what you were building would grow far bigger than the family business your father had left you. When did you have a sense of the scale at which you were really working with? 
Thomas Duff: That’s a good question. Nobody’s ever asked me that before. When I got into our business, we were in very bad financial shape. Southern Tire Mart was a little company with about seven employees, losing money every month. My father was an attorney in Columbia. He loved business, but he was not active, he just liked to own them. I was finishing up a master’s degree in business, which I did not finish. So I was going to law school at Ole Miss and decided that I liked business much more than practicing law. So I said, ‘Can I stay on and just try to run this company?’ Because I grew up in high school working on tires, changing tires, retreading tires, being very involved in it. My dad said yes. And so I started, and that’s where we began. 
After I got involved in it and liked it, and frankly, started having some success in it, I would say, within about five to eight years after we began, I realized that this thing had potential. It’s really not a job, it’s an opportunity. And truthfully, I’ve never worked a day of my life because I’ve enjoyed being in business that much. 
Our business started with Southern Tire Mart. That has enabled us to be in other businesses and given opportunities. KLLM was a customer of Southern Tire Mart for many, many years, and it had undergone several ownership changes. It had gone public, it had gone back private. So we realized there were opportunities, and hopefully that it would be a profitable opportunity. And so we purchased other businesses that way, and that’s how we grew.
MT: Your core businesses require an integrated transportation ecosystem. Supply chain issues have now taken on a growing salience in our politics. Tell me about the evolution of supply chain issues, and your observations of debates surrounding onshoring versus offshoring that have come closer to the center of the political conversation. What has that been like to watch from your perspective?
Duff: We are uniquely affected by the supply situation. Also by the products that come from Asia and China, in particular. United States truck tire manufacturing only supplies about 70% of our needs in this country. So 30% have to come from outside the United States. So how do you deal with that? Where do you buy? What do you buy? Is it the right thing for customers to buy? 
It’s given us insights into how these foreign companies operate, and frankly, it’s not pleasing, because you see how so many of them have taken advantage of American laxity. Just being, frankly, lax in the way we operate in our supply management, it’s something that needs to be tightened up. We need more domestic manufacturing. There is the demand. There’s just not the manufacturing capacity. So our goal has been to try to increase that.

MT: With tariffs and trade policy being such a central element of political debate right now, what is your view on the trade-offs between free trade, getting products to market and protecting local industries? 
Duff: I think that’s a concern for a lot of people in Mississippi. I think we have watched American manufacturing be a serious problem for the last 25 years — it’s dissipated. We don’t have the trades and the things that we need. We are too dependent. 
But outside of supply chains, and we need to work on that, I have watched tariffs in the last few months be a good thing that’s happening. We approve of what President Trump is trying to do, because this mess existed long before he got here. He’s trying to correct it, and if we can correct it, which we will, it’ll take some short-term concerns, short-term hardships, but it’s going to be a long-term gain for our country. And I say that to you as a person who will probably pay more in tariffs, right? It will hit us hard. But is it going to be corrected? Yes, it will be. So, you know, we got into this mess over 20 or 30 years, it’s gonna take a little while to come out of it.
MT: What is your perspective then on short-term economic cost, let’s say, versus a longer-term structural fix in the economy. Mississippi is one of the poorest states in the country. How should people in a state like this who are working class perceive these sorts of trade-offs?
Duff: Obviously, it is a concern. The question is how much of a concern should it be to the average Mississippian? Again, this is a short-term situation. It will have great long-term benefits. And I think what President Trump is trying to do is appropriate, and it will be successful in the end. 
For example, when we had a 20% tariff here, the first time with President Trump’s presidency, our car prices went up three or four percent, what we found out was, in China, they’re more interested in employment and keeping those plants going than they are in profitability because they’re Chinese-owned anyway. It’s not like a normal company like I have that tries to show a profit. In China they’re trying to show employment. So when people talk about these tariffs and what they mean in pricing, we have no evidence that it’s going up that much. What we’re seeing is many manufacturers saying we’re reducing the amount of the increase and trying to work with the American consumer, that’s particularly true for the folks in Mississippi.
MT: You’ve said that retaining employees and attracting quality employees is a priority for you in business. As far as the labor market is concerned, how should Mississippians be thinking about immigration policy? How does reducing immigration impact the economy here in Mississippi?
Duff: You know, we value every person. Each is important for what they do and in their employment throughout our businesses, and frankly, throughout this state. Getting rid of people that have convictions, have problems that come from other countries, that should be one of the highest priorities of stopping the illegal immigration at the southern border. That is is very important, because we need that stability in our employment. 
We are doing well in finding qualified people to work, and I think that’s one of the reasons that we see a lower labor participation rate in our state, you’ve got to offer people good jobs. But you know what? You’ve got to do more than that. You’ve got to have appropriate child care. You’ve got to have good medical. You’ve got to have the things that attract people to say, ‘Hey, I desire to work.’ 
We need more Mississippians at work and we need to be more attractive in what we offer people. That’s very important, and that’s one of the greatest responsibilities that my brother and I have. Do we offer those types of opportunities? Employment wise, social wise. I mean, having proper nursery care, having proper health care is just as important as your wage in today’s world. 
MT: Sure. And to that end, let’s talk about the social safety net. Of course, private employers play an important role in providing access to health care, but there is a segment of Mississippians that may need to rely on the public benefits. Do you think Mississippi should expand Medicaid? 
Duff: You know, I think there are so many rules about Medicaid expansion, it’s hard to always say I’m in favor of it or not in favor of it. Do people need better medical care in the state of Mississippi? Yes, sir. Do more people need to be included in that? Yes, the health of our state is so important. So we have got to offer those things through businesses, through state assistance that helps all Mississippians have better health care. That’s got to be one of the top responsibilities that we all have. How it’s done in today’s changing political environment? I don’t know what to say, but I do know that it’s got to be of the highest importance, and we need to take care of all Mississippians.
MT: So what you’re saying is you’re neither wedded to expansion nor entirely against it? Are you saying you’re open to all options? 
Duff: I want to know the facts and the facts that are best for the people in Mississippi, and those facts have changed with a new president. So it’s hard to really say until we understand the changing political environment.  
MT: I want to ask you about your conception of “welfare” as well. It’s been a politically charged term for a long time, people have different ideas about what programs should be considered welfare. How do you think about welfare and how it relates to the safety net here?
Duff: Well, we need a safety net that’s appropriate and takes care of needs, especially for people who have those needs. We also need a system where people participate, where they’re paid adequately, where they can take care of their families and take care of themselves. 
So my definition of those things would be, if you can work, you need to work. And it’s not just working, it’s working at a higher level. Some people have jobs that they could easily go to someone else, and they could do higher-level jobs. Can you have a better education? Can you have workforce training? How can you maximize your potential in your job?
MT: You mentioned education and training. You and your brother have invested about $50 million in Mississippi universities. So higher education has been a focus of yours, and the issue of “brain drain” has been one of your central concerns. How would you propose that either yourself or others fix this brain drain issue in Mississippi?
Duff: The first thing we’ve got to do, and it’s not a simple answer, we need to have K-12 education that is excellent. And by having excellent education, you prepare people either for vocational jobs or for going into a four-year college route. But you’ve got to have the basics done. 
We have made rapid progress in that. The Mississippi Miracle is real, and we see that. But the real question is, as everybody else is getting better, can we keep our foot on the accelerator and continue to expand K-12? Now we go to vocational, which is so important. We were talking in a meeting this morning about the vocational needs and of some of our businesses, it’ll amaze you what we pay vocational employees, and I’m glad to see they do really well. They have great incomes, a good living. And I like seeing those things. And then we decide to go with the four-year college route, or however many years you decide to go to college, it is important that they receive a good education.

Education, I can tell you, having served eight years in the Institutions of Higher Learning, Mississippi provides a great education for the money spent, an excellent education. Now, the problem we have in our state is the fact that within three years, half of our college graduates are living somewhere else. That’s our problem. So we have got to start a development in our state of economic activity, and it’s going to come. 
Everybody thinks that we need to grow by hitting home runs and going and finding an Amazon or someone like that to come in. The best way to grow our economy is to take the small businesses and get to know them. There’s no one cookie cutter way for a person to go from seven employees to nine, right? I remember when I had seven employees. I’ve got 15,000 now. So you have to learn to adapt and grow. And if you grow your small businesses, you grow your communities. And if you grow your communities, you grow this state.
And you know, as someone who is one of those employers, we hire 50 college graduates a year in our training programs, in our companies, and it’s a great program. These people get great job opportunities, and frankly, our retention rate is excellent. But you know, it worries me when I have my meetings with these new folks and ask, “Where do you want to live? Why do you want to live there?” And the bulk of these students are from Mississippi colleges, and they say, I want to go to Nashville, Atlanta, Phoenix. I want to live somewhere else. And I’ve never had anybody come in and say, “I want to go live in Greenwood” or “I want to live somewhere around here.” And that concerns me, because we’re letting that problem happen. These are our best and brightest students, and we’re letting them go somewhere else. 
Shame on us for not having those opportunities. That’s what we’ve got to do to grow this state. Population wise, economic wise, social wise, when you have a state that’s prospering economically, you solve a lot of problems.
MT: Before we move on from K-12, do you think that taxpayer dollars should follow students to private schools? Do you think that undermines public education?
Duff: You know, the success of a community is its public school system and its school system, yet every parent deserves the opportunity to make sure their child has the best education that they can get. So is there a place for school choice? Yes, again, the definition of what school choice is goes from left to right, but the overriding consideration needs to be, every parent needs to have a very good hand in their child’s education. And whatever that means, we need to do. So we’re not scared of competing and having great schools, we want them. How does that need to be? I think that’s up to the community and the parent.
MT: Moving on to the Institutions of Higher Learning and politics. I know that most of the work of the IHL just relates to the functionality of the university system. But I want to ask you about your observations of higher education while serving in that capacity, because there’s no denying that college campuses have become a battleground for the culture wars in this state and in the country more broadly. Do you think the state government should play a more active role intervening and regulating the activity of campus life?
Duff: Mississippi pays a good part of the education of college graduates. They should have a say in it, but their say needs to be, how can this student receive the most comprehensive education? 
There’s certainly definitions between liberals and conservatives, what’s important, what’s not important. Some of that’s just part of growing up and learning how to operate. Overall, I would say that our schools present a wonderfully conservative balance of what to do. Two things that I think needs to be done is as I have watched students come in. 
When taxpayer dollars at four year colleges are having to be spent for math and reading and things like that to bring them up to a college level before they even start, that’s an indictment of our K-12 education, and we’ve got to do better in that. 
I (also) think it’s important that we learn more of our civic responsibilities. I don’t think that’s taught as much anymore. What it means to be an American, a Mississippian. What does it mean to be a future member of society, a citizen? The importance of voting. Those type of things need to be added into college curriculums. Learning our constitution, that type of stuff that makes you more well rounded and makes you a better student and adult.
MT: Is there a political thinker that informs your worldview? If you think to yourself, “Where should I come down on a certain issue?” Are there certain leaders or thinkers that you look to for guidance or knowledge?
Duff: I’m a voracious reader. I’m also an avid watcher of newscasts. I like to see all points of view. I’ve always believed if you only had one point of view, that makes you fairly narrow minded. So all points of view are important and you can learn from all of those things, even when you don’t agree. I go into many meetings with our folks and say this is a point of view that’s expressed. It might not be mine, but let’s debate it. Let’s take it apart. Let’s see what’s good about it, what’s bad about it, and we learn from that. So that’s what college is about.
MT: If I could just push you on that a little bit. I appreciate that you consider and take in all points of view. But you do have politics yourself, and you have created a political action committee with a priority to elect conservative candidates. So within the realm of conservatism, I suppose, what sort of conservative are you? Do you identify with a particular political figure? What to you makes a quality conservative leader that you would want to support?

Duff: I am a conservative. I believe that less government is better. I believe that each of us should have the ability to raise our families, to live our lives and to accomplish what our God given abilities are. So I am very conservative. I’m not trying to raise taxes. I’m not trying to have these social things that jump out there. I think that goes with being in families and being an individual.
The political leader that has affected us, certainly in the last 10 years, would be Donald Trump. He has revolutionized not only the Republican Party, but also the way that people view government, whether you like him or disagree with him, and I happen to like him. I think that what he’s doing in his administration is exactly what he said he would do. And I think 75 million people said ‘I like what he says he’s gonna do. I’m gonna vote for him.’ And he’s following through on that example. So he could probably be the one, if you were to ask me, that would have an influence. But his influence comes from vision and leadership. It’s not always his views, just the fact that he says, ‘I feel it should be this way, and I’m going to offer leadership through myself and the folks that I work with, and hopefully there’s buy in from the people that see it.’ 
MT: Yeah, and just jumping off that, I do want to ask directly about the PAC and the purpose behind it. What do you hope to achieve by potentially ushering in a new cohort of leaders in Mississippi?
Duff: That’s what it’s really for, to have conservative minded people take on these responsibilities because they’re very important economically in their communities and statewide. 
Are they the type leaders that will be exemplary moving forward? 
Mississippi has come so far. Our governor has done a great job, but it’s important for the future that we don’t take the foot off the gas pedal, that we move forward. And it will be different than it is today. The growth of things like AI, the growth of the political challenges that we have, you’ve got to have a person who is a leader, who can have a vision for being able to continue moving forward.
MT: Will you run for governor in 2027?
Duff: I love this state. This state has been good to me. I love being a part of this state. If I can assist and help in the leadership of moving forward in this state, I want to be a part of it. But as far as saying I have to have this as a stepping stone or something else, I don’t need that. 
If I can be of service, and enough people believe in that, then perhaps we can all together move Mississippi forward. So that’s where I stand now. This election is 29 months out. 
MT: I want to close by asking you what Mississippians might not know about you that you want them to know as you go and meet more of them and consider this run for governor? 
Duff: I think what I would want Mississippians to know is I’m just like them. I started out in menial labor, growing up in high school, throughout college, basically put myself through college, got involved in a business. I still work 50 to 60 hours every week. I love my family. I’m very devoted to them and involved with them. But we work, my brother and I work hard. We try to be fair and honorable with every person we deal with.
And you can take principles of business and apply it to certain aspects of government. I think that’s where it comes to vision and it comes to leadership. Those are the most important things that I think our state needs, where everybody is working together for a common goal. I don’t expect people to agree with everything I say, but I would hope that people would say ‘he cares, and I hope that’ll be a difference.’",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/24175319/Thomas-Duff-1-1.jpg,,,2025-07-28 06:56:52.622386

Today, thanks to the hard work of the Ways and Means Republicans, we will make those tax cuts permanent and prevent an end of the year tax hike.” — Rep. Carol Miller, R-W.Va.
Miller apparently believes that the government should run deficits that our children will pay off. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the big, beautiful bill (or more accurately the budget buster bill) — even after accounting for the Medicaid and Affordable Care Act cuts in the bill which will leave countless West Virginia residents without insurance — will still increase budget deficits by $3.4 trillion over the next decade.
I am a proven fiscal conservative who wants a balanced federal budget. Otherwise, we are leaving our children and grandchildren a tremendous crisis which will blow up in their lifetimes, ruining the U.S. economy.
Yes, the national debt is out of control due to both parties. However, only one party currently controls the presidency and Congress — the GOP. Therefore, this column will look at their past spending and recently approved spending bill. Childishly saying, “but look at what the Democrats have done in the past” is unhelpful in analyzing the impact of Trump’s recently passed budget buster bill, which takes Trump’s 2017 temporary tax cuts and makes them permanent. The BBB also cuts Medicaid/ACA, contrary to Trump’s promises.
Trump is a known quantity; he had a first term. One of his 2016 priorities was to push through a package of historic tax cuts, which he did in 2017. In an interview back then with Sean Hannity, he declared that his tax cuts would stimulate the economy, contrary to what the Congressional Budget Office calculated when it estimated almost a $2 trillion increase in debt over a decade.
Trump stated that — due to increased growth — his 2017 cuts would lower, rather than raise, our national debt. So did his Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who said “at 3% economic growth this tax plan will not only pay for itself but in fact create additional revenue for the government.” The first Trump tax cut did exactly the opposite of what Trump and Mnuchin predicted. Here are the facts.
In 2016, the last year of Barack Obama’s presidency, our annual deficit was an unacceptable $585 billion. However, despite Trump’s promises to the contrary, it grew every year in large part due to his tax cuts. In 2019, prior to COVID-19, it was up to nearly $1 trillion. By 2020, it was over $3 trillion annually. These are the same tax cuts that Trump pushed to make permanent in his recently passed budget buster bill.
Here is who benefits from those tax cuts this year: 

The wealthiest 1% of households will get tax cuts averaging in excess of $60,000
For more normal working-class Americans (i.e. households in the bottom 60%), their tax cut will be less than $500

In 2017, as in 2025, Trump strong-armed Congress into supporting him, against their better judgment. For example, here is what Trump and the Senate’s GOP leader misleadingly stated at the time —

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell — “We are totally confident this is a revenue-neutral bill and probably a revenue producer.” 
President Trump —  “We have $21 trillion in debt. When this [tax cut] really kicks in we’ll start paying off that debt like water.”  

The GOP’s BBB increases budget deficits by $3.4 trillion, on top of an already outrageous national debt. The GOP is saddling West Virginia’s children with excessive debt and hypocritically covering it up. Remember this fact when you vote in 2026 and 2028.

(Photo from the CDC)After the U.S. Supreme Court ruled through its shadow docket earlier this month that President Donald Trump could move forward with plans to fire tens of thousands of federal workers, U.S. government employees across Pennsylvania braced themselves.
Philip Glover, the national vice president of the district of the American Federation of Government Employees that covers Pennsylvania and Delaware, says thousands of employees have likely been laid off around the country since the ruling, though exact numbers haven’t been shared with unions yet.
But for employees at the Pittsburgh-area campus for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), a division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the ruling only added to a sense of uncertainty that workers say has become a constant of employment under the Trump administration. 
“It’s been the entire range of human emotion,” Suzanne Alison, a steward at the local chapter of the American Federation of Government Employees and a NIOSH employee, told the Capital-Star after the ruling. “I haven’t talked to a single person who feels like their job is safe.” 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
While the Supreme Court ruling allowed the Trump administration to move forward with thousands of previously stalled layoffs, the U.S. Health and Human Services Department (HSS) is tied up in a separate lawsuit moving through a federal District Court in Rhode Island.
Filed by Democratic attorneys general in 19 states and Washington, D.C., the suit argues that layoffs at key divisions of the Health Department, including NIOSH, are being conducted illegally. The judge in that case, Melissa DuBose, has ordered that, for now, the department has to keep those workers until the case moves forward.
The state of Pennsylvania is not part of the lawsuit.
The NIOSH facilities in Allegheny County house two key teams, whose impacts are felt across the country. There’s the coal mine safety division, which houses researchers and scientists studying how to prevent fatalities and injuries in coal mines. And there’s the National Personal Protective Technology Lab, which certifies the nation’s respirators, from the N95 masks that became ubiquitous during the COVID-19 pandemic to specialized devices used by firefighters and Marines.
Federal officials call miners’ health a ‘priority,’ but are cutting a Pa. team studying mine safety

Employees on both teams, with more than 160 federal workers between them, now feel stuck in a holding pattern.
“It feels a lot more precarious.”
For Pennsylvania-based NIOSH employees, nothing has been normal since the beginning of the Trump administration’s efforts to slash the federal workforce. There were the layoffs of probationary employees (workers who have been with the agencies less than one or two years), buyouts and offers of early retirement, and the reduction in force notices, which alerted employees across both divisions that many jobs would be terminated this summer.
A series of lawsuits held up various parts of the downsizing efforts. And federal lawmakers from both parties raised alarms about the impacts of cuts to divisions ensuring the safety of miners.
At a hearing on Capitol Hill in May, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. assured lawmakers that “work on mine safety will continue.” Yet employees of the Pittsburgh mine safety team largely remain on administrative leave, and notices that their jobs will be terminated July 2 remain in effect, though layoffs have been held up by lawsuits. Until the Rhode Island judge rules or HHS reverses course, no one can be laid off.
There were other decisions that impacted their ability to work too. The department, for instance, instituted a communications freeze and a block on work-related travel earlier this year, and credit cards were frozen that were typically used to purchase necessary research materials.
With so many people remaining on administrative leave, many affected mine safety workers are coming into work on a voluntary basis. Brendan Demich, chief steward of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) local chapter that represents the Pittsburgh-area NIOSH employees, and an employee of the coal mine safety division, says morale has dropped.
“It’s really hard to do anything,” he said. “It feels a lot more precarious right now.”
Federal cuts threaten to close Pennsylvania lab that certifies N95s and other respirators in June

Still, some are continuing their work.
Demich’s own team, which is working on a virtual reality training program for mine safety teams, has cut its ambitions and is winding down their work. Now, they’re getting what they can to industry partners in the hopes it can still prove useful.
“These are all people who have been laid off, told they can take administrative leave—basically a paid vacation—and there are still people going into work, essentially voluntarily,” he said.
Employees at the National Personal Protective Technology Lab have had a slightly different experience. In April, many were preparing for their lab — the only one in the country certifying respirators for NIOSH — for permanent closure. Yet, following a May ruling on a class action lawsuit in West Virginia, they learned that the decision to shutter the division had been reversed.
But even those workers have not been able to feel a sense of security. That same month their layoffs were reversed, HHS released a proposed budget for 2026 which listed their division among those having their funding cut.
The coal mine safety team employees, who are still subject to layoffs pending a court ruling, found the opposite. The broader mine safety division would remain funded under the proposed 2026 budget
Job cuts reversed at Pittsburgh lab that certifies nation’s respirators

Employees in both NIOSH divisions in Pittsburgh, as well as their union representatives, say they’ve sought clarification from leaders at the U.S. Health and Human Service Department, NIOSH, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). But they’ve been met with silence.
Spokespeople for HHS and the CDC did not respond to questions from the Pennsylvania Capital-Star seeking clarity.
“We haven’t had anything communicated to us through official channels,” said Demich. “Our division leader is communicative with what they know, but there’s a breakdown of communication from the higher levels of HHS. Our division leaders are finding things out about the same time our front line employees are.”
Democratic congressmen from Pennsylvania have also weighed in, with all seven in the 17-member House delegation signing onto a letter last month asking the agency to reverse its decision to lay off people in the mine safety division.
In recent weeks, lawyers for Health and Human Services moved to have the case blocking layoffs across NIOSH dismissed, arguing the U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing the Trump administration to fire thousands of federal workers applied to them as well. The judge shot down the argument.

HHS lawyers also argued earlier this month that layoffs should be allowed in states like Pennsylvania that are not a party to the lawsuit. They argue the current court-ordered pause is too broad following another recent Supreme Court ruling effectively ended nationwide injunctions.

(Getty Images)A group of lawyers who defend people facing capital punishment has asked the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to take extraordinary action to restrict a prosecutor’s use of the death penalty.
Washington County District Attorney Jason Walsh filed notices of his intent to pursue sentences of death in 11 out of 18 homicide cases his office has prosecuted since he took office in 2021, according to a petition the Atlantic Center for Capital Representation filed this week.
Listen to Peter and Emily’s audio recap: 

https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/27eppkWASCOweb.mp3
 
The filing alleges that in two pending cases, Walsh is pursuing the death penalty without evidence to support it. And it outlines a pattern in which Walsh’s office has allegedly held other defendants for trial for capital murder without establishing the basic facts required to support their charges.
Earlier this month, a Washington County judge dismissed criminal homicide and other charges against a Donora woman who was held for nearly four years while Walsh pursued the death penalty against her. In dismissing the charges, the judge stated the prosecutor’s theory was “based wholly on speculation.”
The Atlantic Center made the request on behalf of two clients, Jordan Clarke and Joshua George, who are charged separately in the deaths of their infant children. It alleges Walsh is seeking the death penalty against them despite scant evidence that the deaths were intentional or especially cruel, heinous or depraved warranting the ultimate punishment.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Walsh, who became district attorney after his predecessor’s death and was elected as a Republican in 2023, called the Atlantic Center’s filing a “liberal smear campaign” by an anti-death penalty group. 
“I pursue the death penalty consistently in cases where the death penalty fits,” Walsh told the Capital-Star. “The petition is false, misleading and untrue.”
Marc Bookman, executive director of the Philadelphia-based center, said prosecutors are entrusted with the discretion to seek the death penalty, but must provide evidence to establish certain elements of the crime before doing so. Bookman said Walsh is abusing that discretion. 
“We’re not offended by him because he’s tough on crime,” Bookman said. “I have a problem because he doesn’t appear to know the law and he’s seeking the death penalty viciously when it doesn’t apply.”
Under Pennsylvania law, the death penalty may be applied only when the killing at issue was intentional and there is at least one aggravating factor, Jules Epstein, a professor at Temple University Beasley School of Law, said.
Aggravating factors can include when the victim is a police officer or other first responder, murder for hire, torture, killing in the commission of another felony and more than a dozen other circumstances. 
Epstein, who has reviewed hearing transcripts, said the cases are indicative of problems in Washington County’s criminal justice system that extend beyond the district attorney’s office. He noted that magisterial district judges, who conduct preliminary hearings, have a responsibility to determine whether prosecutors have enough evidence to support the charges. 
To support a first-degree murder charge required for the death penalty, prosecutors are required to show evidence that the defendants’ had a criminal intent before the killing, such as an action or statement beforehand. 
Without such evidence, “The only proof is that it’s a tragic accident,” Epstein said. “And that district judge should say, ‘The proper charge here is third-degree murder.’”
In the cases at issue in the petition, that didn’t happen.
“Why a prosecutor, in a case that is so clear, would seek the death penalty when the law says you can’t do it … is a problem,” he said. “And if it happens more than once, … as someone who’s been involved in capital case work a long time, that’s a system breakdown.”
The petition asks the Supreme Court to employ its “King’s Bench power” to intervene in the cases and prevent Walsh from pursuing the death penalty. It also asks the court to establish supervision over the Washington County District Attorney’s Office by a special master and prohibit it from pursuing the death penalty without approval from an out-of-county judge.
It also asks the court to order the office to consult with the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office before seeking the death penalty and to appoint a judge from another county to review every death penalty case charged since 2021. 
In the case of Clarke, the petition alleges, Walsh filed homicide charges and notice of aggravating factors to pursue the death penalty before the manner of his two-month-old son’s death had been determined. It also claims Walsh attempted to improperly influence the death investigation.
Prosecutors allege Clarke killed Sawyer by shaking him in their McMurray home. Clarke, who lives with mobility issues as a result of a car crash when he was a child, told detectives he had tripped over a plastic bag and fell on his son. Clark’s grandfather and aunt were in the house at the time of the incident and called 911, the petition says.
Sawyer was taken to Children’s Hospital in Pittsburgh, where he ultimately died on May 24, 2022. The Allegheny County medical examiner determined the cause of death to be bleeding on the brain and the manner of death was undetermined. Walsh, however, obtained a court order from Judge John DiSalle directing that an autopsy be performed by a Washington County coroner’s office pathologist, despite the child’s death in Allegheny County.
The Washington County Coroner’s Office determined the cause of death was blunt-force trauma to the head and torso due to “shaken baby syndrome/abusive trauma” and declared the death a homicide. Although Allegheny County issued a death certificate, Coroner Timothy Warco filed a second certificate listing the death as a homicide, which the state Department of Health rejected.
Clarke was held on criminal homicide and related charges after a preliminary hearing where Warco testified that the results of Sawyer’s autopsy were still pending. A physician testified the injuries were consistent with shaken baby syndrome, despite not having reviewed medical records prior to the child’s fatal injury, the petition says.
The Atlantic Center alleges the testimony was insufficient to establish that Clarke intended to kill his son. It also argues that the aggravating factors, including torture, are also not supported by the evidence. 
George also faces the death penalty for the death of his son Oliver, who died after becoming ill in December 2021. Prosecutors allege George killed Oliver by shaking him and causing head trauma.
Oliver did not show indications of illness or injury until several hours after George had left him and his two other children at their grandmother’s house. The petition alleges that the district attorney’s office withheld the testimony of the pathologist who conducted Oliver’s autopsy and ultimately testified that the child would have shown signs of trauma immediately after suffering the injury.
Although the petition requests that the district attorney’s office be barred from pursuing the death penalty in the case of the Atlantic Center’s two clients, it also details the cases of three others who were held in jail for years awaiting capital murder trials.
According to the petition, Walsh’s office sought the death penalty for Jah Zhanee Inifi Sutton in connection to the murder of a man at a Donora convenience store. 
Prosecutors alleged that Sidney McLean and Devell Christian shot and killed the man in February 2021. Based on the discovery of Sutton’s DNA on a bullet casing at the scene of the killing and her alleged relationship with McClean, the district attorney’s office charged Sutton with conspiracy to commit homicide and possession of an instrument of crime.

At a preliminary hearing, a state police trooper testified Sutton was not at the scene of the killing and that it was likely her DNA on the casing. Pressed by Walsh, who asked if it was possible Sutton was waiting in a car outside during the shooting, the trooper testified “anything’s possible.” 
Sutton was held on the charges and Walsh filed a notice that he would seek the death penalty. When Sutton’s attorney notified Walsh that none of her charges qualified for a death sentence, Walsh simply added criminal homicide to her charges.
Nearly four years after her arrest, Judge Traci L. McDonald dismissed the charges after finding the trooper’s speculation about Sutton’s whereabouts during the killing was insufficient to sustain first-degree murder charges, particularly when the death penalty was on the table.
“Four long and fearful years after the Commonwealth improperly (and absurdly) sought the death penalty based on virtually no evidence, the Washington County courts finally held the Commonwealth to its burden. This was cold comfort for Ms. Sutton,” the Atlantic Center’s petition says.
The filing also outlines the cases of James Riley May IV and Shannon McKnight, who faced capital punishment for the drug-induced death of their three-month-old daughter. The couple called 911 after finding the baby unresponsive and an investigation found she died from ingesting fentanyl.
In a preliminary hearing, Walsh presented testimony that there was drug paraphernalia scattered in the bedroom where the couple slept with their children. According to the petition, their one-year-old son was also found to have indications of cocaine in his system.
“There was no testimony establishing any particular actions that either defendant had taken, how the baby had been exposed to the fentanyl, or any fact that would show that either of them had the intent to kill,” the filing says.
After 2½ years under the threat of the death sentence, May and McKnight each pleaded guilty to drug delivery resulting in death.
“If DA Walsh is allowed to continue abusing his discretion in seeking death sentences, other defendants facing capital trials in Washington County will give up their right to trial to avoid an illegal threat of death,” the petition argues. 
Walsh said the age of the victims in the challenged cases alone constitute an aggravating factor that supports the death penalty and their injuries leave little doubt about intent.
“When babies have fractured skulls and are beaten to death, that’s intentional,” he said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/gavel-bang-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-07-28 05:56:12.160985

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)The American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island says the state’s Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) gave inadequate notice to nearly 30,000 Rhode Island motorists who received late renewal forms for vehicle registrations set to expire in July.
Vehicle registrations that were originally scheduled to go out June 11 were all sent by July 14 after “a failed computer file transfer” halted their mailing by about a month, said DMV spokesperson Paul Grimaldi.
As a result of the delay, 29,145 affected vehicle owners now have through Aug. 31 to renew their registration — which can be done online.
The delay was announced via a news release on July 11 and is featured at the top of the DMV’s website.
“We appreciate our customers’ patience and understanding as we worked quickly to resolve this issue,” DMV Administrator Walter “Bud” Craddock said in the July 11 statement.
In a July 17 letter to Craddock, ACLU of Rhode Island Executive Director Steven Brown commended the DMV for the extension but said he believed most of the affected drivers were likely unaware of their forms getting sent out late.
“Absent receipt of a timely notice sent out by the vendor, they may not realize that their registration is expiring, much less that this extension has been granted,” Brown wrote. “The same lack of knowledge may hold true for police departments across the state.”







Drivers caught operating with an expired registration face an $85 fine. Registrations that have been suspended because of lapsed insurance or expired inspection can be reinstated for a fee of $253.50, Grimaldi said.







Brown asked what steps the DMV took to ensure police don’t pull over drivers next month still awaiting their updated tags.
In his response Wednesday, Craddock wrote that a notice was sent to the Rhode Island Police Chiefs Association and that Rhode Island State Police were tasked with posting it on the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System.
“While this is considered ample time for individuals to renew their registrations, the decision was made to extend the renewal period in case some were out of state for summer vacation,” Craddock wrote.
Sidney Wordell, executive director for the Rhode Island Police Chiefs Association, confirmed via text message that notices were received and distributed to all municipal police departments. Rhode Island State Police Lt. Col. Robert Creamer also confirmed that agency posted the required notice to the national system.

Weisman/Rhode Island Current)Anyone who has tried to buy or rent a home lately in Rhode Island has seen firsthand the impacts of the state’s housing shortage, including bidding wars to access homeownership or significant yearly rent increases for tenants. The median sales price of a single-family home in Rhode Island rose to $520,000 as of June, 2025, according to the Rhode Island Association of Realtors, and rental costs in the Providence metro area climbed at one of the fastest rates in the nation, reflected in a median asking rent of $2,145.
A root problem is that Rhode Island is building fewer homes per capita than any other state in the nation. We need 24,000 homes just to meet today’s needs. With an average household size of 2.4, and a lower median household income than our neighboring states, new housing production must include smaller and more affordable options. 
A recent Stateline story in Rhode Island Current detailed the impacts of the lack of homes for sale that are affordable options for teachers, highlighting that the housing crisis does not discriminate. Workers across all sectors and all educational backgrounds are impacted. The lack of homes in Rhode Island prevents teachers, child care workers, and retail workers from living in the communities they serve. 
There is a profound irony in the fact that even builders of homes are priced out. Consider that someone earning the average income of a skilled trades worker with four-plus years of experience — $68,717 — is unable to afford most homes on the market in Rhode Island. A family of four now needs an annual income of $151,067 to purchase a home. This is dispiriting news for our state’s hardworking residents trying to secure a future for themselves and their families.  










With an average household size of 2.4, and a lower median household income than our neighboring states, new housing production must include smaller and more affordable options. 


The status quo has consequences; it pushes young people out of the communities they grew up in, as they move away in search of more affordable housing options. The lack of home choices stops older adults from downsizing into a more accessible home, putting them in a situation of maintaining a home that is too large, too expensive, or too difficult to move around in. 
Allowing more types of homes can help address this shortage. That’s why we are thankful to the Rhode Island General Assembly for passing 10 housing-related bills. Neighbors Welcome! Rhode Island championed five in particular that will allow more homes — and more naturally affordable home types, such as townhomes or apartments in mixed use areas — to be built.
Among them is a new law that removes obstacles for townhomes and another law that allows smaller residences to be developed above retail spaces. 
Townhomes are a great option for a first-time home buyer, or an older adult seeking to downsize. Slightly smaller, with less yard to take care of, these attached homes are often less expensive due to their smaller size and the sharing of land costs across multiple households. Legalizing townhomes in communities across Rhode Island will put more homeownership opportunities within reach of teachers, young adults just starting their families, and older neighbors who are looking to downsize. 
State lawmakers also passed legislation to make it easier to build what are now called mixed-use developments to replace empty office buildings or aging strip malls with the kind of homes on walkable main streets so many people want to live in, with spaces for living and spaces for commerce together in one area. 
These policies are popular with voters. Neighbors Welcome! Rhode Island recently conducted polling showing 88% public support for the state to do more to expand housing choices. We found that 70% of voters support allowing townhomes to be built anywhere other homes are built, and 87% support allowing homes to be built near jobs, shopping centers, in aging strip malls, or near transit. 
These are policies and strategies we can use to build more home types so that every Rhode Islander has a choice about where they live, and what type of home they live in that isn’t solely dictated by cost. But they’re not the only ways we can give more choices to Rhode Islanders looking to find the homes they need here in the Ocean State. We made progress this legislative session, but there is much more to do. We look forward to more collaboration with the General Assembly next year.
 



5 legislative wins for new housing production in Rhode Island
The Rhode Island General Assembly passed these bills championed by Neighbors Welcome! Rhode Island in the 2025 session. Gov. Dan McKee signed them into law in late June and early July.
Mixed-Use Zones: H5800 | S1090A
Underused commercial land served by public infrastructure, aging strip malls and vacant commercial lots are an opportunity to build new homes and mixed-use neighborhoods while preserving the state’s farmlands and forests. This law allows cities and towns to apply mixed-use overlays in commercial zones where appropriate, ensuring new homes are not built near heavy industry or other environmental nuisances.
Electronic Permitting: H5803Aaa | S1087
Rhode Island has made significant progress in reducing delays by creating a new online permitting system, but many state and local permits remain to be added to the platform. This law empowers the Department of Business Regulation to continue expanding e-permitting, speeding up new home construction and creating cost-savings that can be passed on to residents.
Oversized Lot Splits: H5794B | S1086Aaa
This law allows double lots to be subdivided for new homes as long as the newly created lots resemble nearby parcels, maintaining neighborhood character. For example, a 10,000-square foot lot surrounded by 5,000-square foot lots could be divided in two.
Townhomes: H5798Aaa/S1083A
Townhomes offer a path to homeownership at a more affordable price point and are significantly easier for builders to finance compared to condominiums. This law allows for townhomes in residential zoning districts at reasonable levels of density, depending on the type of community, while allowing cities and towns to retain control over key design characteristics.
Building Code Changes: H5804A | S1089Aaa
New triple-deckers or other small multifamily buildings in Rhode Island have had to meet the same commercial building code requirements as high rises, shopping malls, and hospitals. That’s cost-prohibitive. So this law reclassifies three- and four-family homes as residential, making these homes more cost- effective to build while maintaining the high safety standards of modern construction.

The North Dakota Department of Agriculture last week announced the award of a $300,000 grant for drone scouting in the 2025 and 2026 growing seasons. The project aims to help weed control officials respond to new infestations quickly.
Grand Farm, a research organization with a campus near Casselton, is taking the lead on the project.
Grand Farm celebrates first building to foster ag innovation

Nathan Marcotte, senior program manager of technology and innovation at Grand Farm, said the state grant helps continue a first phase of the project that involves teaching an artificial intelligence system what a weed looks like by feeding it hundreds of photos of the plants at different growth stages and other variables, such as different times of the day. 
Marcotte said researchers will be working with farmers and weed officers in five southeastern counties — Barnes, Cass, Richland, Steele and Traill. The project will focus on soybean and sugar beet fields.
Marcotte said an initial phase of the project targeted Palmer amaranth, an herbicide-resistant weed with a limited presence in North Dakota but with the ability to spread quickly. The next phase will build on that work, he said. 
“The focus is, within those five counties, to build up a weed image library and model so it can detect more than just Palmer amaranth,” Marcotte said. 
Fields found to have weeds will remain confidential and identified at the county level only, the Ag Department said. 
The funding for this program was approved during the 2025 North Dakota legislative session. 
Grand Farm is leading the research project partners including Thales, an aerospace company, iSight Drone Services that provides the drones, and North Dakota State University. 
Marcotte said landowners will be advised of any drone flyovers before they take place. Farmers and property owners interested in participating in the project can email info@grandfarm.com.

While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.


The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.










The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling.


– Oregon Republican state Rep. Cyrus Javadi


Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.
Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.
Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

Haaland, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna and a former U.S. congresswoman, served as Interior Secretary during the Biden Administration.She will be presented with the award during a ceremony Oct. 13 — Indigenous Peoples’ Day — at the Lied Center for Performing Arts in Lincoln.
The award is given annually by the Chief Standing Bear Project, a nonprofit group founded in 2022 to recognize those who embody the spirit of Ponca Chief Standing Bear. It was Standing Bear’s legal fight with the U.S. government that led to the recognition of Native Americans as “persons” under the law.
A Project official said that Haaland, a 35th generation New Mexican, is being recognized for overcoming financial hardship as a single mother to earn a law degree and become the first Native American woman to lead a state political party, one of the first Native American women elected to Congress and becoming the first Cabinet Secretary,
“Former Secretary Haaland’s life and leadership reflect the many forms that courage can take — quiet resilience, determination in the face of hardship and the willingness to lead, even when the path is uncertain,” said Katie Brossy, board president of the Chief Standing Bear Project.
As Interior Secretary, Haaland addressed the epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous people and helped the nation confront the painful legacy of federal boarding schools.

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)Woonsocket City Councilor James Cournoyer wasn’t shocked to see Fitch Ratings pull its credit ratings for the city on July 14 for failing to turn in a fiscal 2023 audit, among other financial statements. 
“The only surprise was that it took them as long as it did,” said Cournoyer.
Moody’s Ratings yanked its bond ratings in October for the same reason; S&P Global Ratings lowered its rating of city water bonds the next month. 
Without bond ratings, the northern Rhode Island city with the sixth largest population in the state can’t borrow any money to pay for future capital projects like schools or infrastructure upgrades — not an immediate concern for Cournoyer since the city isn’t planning to issue bonds. Much more distressing is the disarray of city finances, including the still-incomplete fiscal 2023 audit, now more than 18 months overdue.
A newly hired city finance director and promise of near completion on the overdue report offer a glimmer of hope. Not that the problem ends there.
“We’re digging ourselves out of a hole, a deep hole,” said Cournoyer, who works as a finance director for Textron, Inc. “We’re grappling with 10 years of a Lisa Baldelli-Hunt regime. She basically destroyed the financial organization in the city of Woonsocket. Now, we’re left to clean up.”

Baldelli-Hunt, Woonsocket’s former mayor, resigned on Nov. 9, 2023 in the wake of a land purchase that violated the city charter’s rules around notice to the council, and appeared to be a sweetheart deal with her former boss. The deal was uncovered and reported by WPRI-TV 12 in October 2023. No criminal charges have resulted. But her specter continues to haunt city hall, as city officials grapple with the fallout from her decade of leadership. 
Baldelli-Hunt’s resignation came less than two months before the Dec. 31, 2023 deadline by which all cities and towns across Rhode Island are required under state law to turn in an audited financial report to the Rhode Island Office of the Auditor General. 
Punctuality is not a new problem, nor one isolated to Woonsocket, as municipalities nationwide struggle to turn in financial reports amid staff vacancies and the rapid decline of accounting firms able and willing to perform local government audits, said David Bergantino, the state auditor general.
A year ago, in July 2024, two other municipalities, East Providence and Coventry, had also failed to submit their fiscal 2023 audited statements to the auditor general, according to the office’s compliance report. Both have since turned in the reports, Bergantino confirmed Thursday. Woonsocket, on the other hand, has not.
The price of paperwork problems 
Its lack of timely financial reporting doesn’t just risk bond ratings. It also compromises the city’s ability to form an accurate spending plan for the current fiscal year — risking major deficits if it underestimates expenses or overshoots revenue, Bergantino said.
“At this point, we’re in fiscal 2026,” Bergantino noted. “When you don’t have the prior fiscal year done, or the last two, it impacts current operations.”
Not to mention the separate but also overdue audited statements to the federal government on how the city spent federal pandemic aid and routine grant funding. Baldelli-Hunt’s land deal relied on $1.1 million in federal funding to buy a five-acre plot of vacant land for use as affordable housing.
 The city has since reversed the deal and commissioned a $15,000 investigation — later forwarded to law enforcement — that detailed her negotiations with her former boss, who owned the land, on the purchase price, as well as her concerted efforts to keep the transaction secret from staff and the city council — violating the city’s charter, according to news reports. But the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development grant funds Baldelli-Hunt tried to use to buy the land could leave the city vulnerable to federal repercussions for misusing its money, said John Ward, former city council president who unsuccessfully ran for mayor in 2024.










We’re grappling with 10 years of a Lisa Baldelli-Hunt regime. She basically destroyed the financial organization in the city of Woonsocket. Now, we’re left to clean up.


– Woonsocket City Councilor James Cournoyer


Ward, who retired after 17 years as finance director for the town of Lincoln in 2023, made the city’s financial state a key part of his campaign. He lost the November 2024 nonpartisan mayoral race by 3 percentage points to Mayor Christopher Beauchamp, who took over the mayoral post after Baldelli-Hunt resigned in 2023.
Leading into the election, Woonsocket’s paperwork problem took a turn for the worse after the accounting firm hired to audit its financial statements abruptly quit, also first reported by WPRI. 
In a May 28, 2024 letter to the council, Mary Sahady, principal for Hague, Sahady & Co., listed five reasons for the decision, including continued rescheduling of meetings, missing reports and untimely and incomplete responses to the firm’s requests for information. Sahady also referenced an accusation made by some council members at a May 22 meeting that Baldelli-Hunt swayed the firm’s prior audit reports.
Ward and Cournoyer blamed the firm’s resignation squarely on Baldelli-Hunt, even though she had left city hall six months before.
“The issues surrounding their resignation all related to the games and misinformation and delays occurring under the Baldelli-Hunt administration, without question,” Cournoyer said. “I don’t care who the next mayor was, they would be in the same position after inheriting the mess they got from her.”
Beauchamp declined to answer any questions for this story.

The blame game
Baldelli-Hunt pointed the finger back at the city leaders still in office.
“How many years do I need to be gone before they start to realize I am not the problem?” she said in an interview Thursday. 
Baldelli-Hunt touted the city’s financial accomplishments under her tenure as mayor, from the brink of receivership when she started in 2013 to a balanced budget, less debt and strong ratings from the major credit ratings agencies. 
“I turned the city of Woonsocket around,” she said. “I took the bond rating from junk to stable and positive. I did a hell of a job in this city and I am proud of it.”
She continued, “Maybe, potentially, they’re just ill-equipped to handle things.”
Sahady’s letter reinforces Baldelli-Hunt’s final point, noting that insufficient city financial staff has led to inadequate tracking of its money. When Beauchamp became mayor in November 2023, he immediately fired the city’s finance director. The city has since struggled to hold on to a permanent replacement, relying on a longtime finance department employee Christine Chamberland to serve as interim finance director for a majority of the next 20 months.










How many years do I need to be gone before they start to realize I am not the problem?


– Former Woonsocket Mayor Lisa Baldelli-Hunt


Meanwhile, Sahady’s surprise resignation sent the city scrambling to find a new accounting firm to audit its financial statements. Sahady had already completed more than 80 hours of fieldwork and meetings on the fiscal 2023 audit — with a $8,554 cost, according to the bill included with the resignation letter.
The subsequent contract with CBIZ forced the city to start the process over with the new, more expensive firm. Cournoyer estimates the city has spent more than $300,000 for CBIZ to audit its fiscal 2023 statements based on the agreed-upon hourly rate.
In May 2025, CBIZ submitted a draft audit report to the City Council for review, with the caveat that the report remains unfinished, awaiting major updates including lengthy and detailed financial disclosures from the lawsuits filed against the city, which continue to multiply. The cases are mostly unrelated to the land deal, spanning disputes over allegedly inaccurate property tax assessments, the environmental and health effects of improperly treated sewage flowing into the Blackstone River, and the wrongful arrest of an unhoused person. The fired former finance director, Cindy Johnston, has also sued the city, alleging her termination violates anti-discrimination laws related to her disability, The Valley Breeze reported. 
“As every day goes by, any new lawsuit or new activity also has to be disclosed,” Cournoyer said.
The draft audit has not been made public, but a copy was obtained by Rhode Island Current. The 200-page report shows the city ended fiscal year 2023 $165.5 million in the red, due to $248.1 million overspent through its general, government spending account, partially offset by revenue gains in its separate funds for water and wastewater treatment services. 
CBIZ does not include any commentary on the city’s fiscal 2023 financial performance, which saw a $5.6 million decline in its net position compared with the prior year.
But Cournoyer fears that even after the audited report is finally finished, and resubmitted to Fitch and Moody’s, the city’s new credit rating will not be as strong because of its deficit.
Fitch rated Woonsocket’s bonds at an A+ in July 2024, while Moody’s upgraded its assessment of the city’s bonds to “Baa2” in October 2023. Both are considered investment-worthy grades, though not the strongest possible ratings.
Calling in financial cavalry 
One spot of rare good news is the city’s newly hired finance director, James Lathrop, who started on July 21. Some might not view the $145,000-a-year job of putting the city’s broken financials back together as worth the headache. Lathrop was unfazed.
“This is no more difficult than anything I’ve done in Chester and Lansdale,” Lathrop said of his most recent two jobs resuscitating a pair of Pennsylvania municipalities from receivership and multimillion-dollar bank statement discrepancies, respectively. 
A former 2022 Republican state general treasurer candidate and Bryant University graduate, Lathrop has made a career of helping cities and towns escape difficult financial situations, including others in Rhode Island. He expects Woonsocket’s fiscal 2023 audit to be finished and ready to submit in the next two weeks, with plans to immediately begin the also overdue fiscal 2024 audit. 
Ward still has his doubts.
“This is not just about being a good bookkeeper,” he said of sorting through the tranche of mismatched and missing reports spanning three or more years. “This is about, can you play chess?

(Shannon Heckt/ Virginia Mercury)Amazon Web Services pulled an application for a 7.2 million square foot data center in Louisa County last week, after a surge of resident opposition. Concerns remain, however, over the impact of the county’s three other data centers that are in different stages of development, none of which were required to go through the conditional use permitting process that allows for more community input.
Virginia doesn’t have statewide data center regulations. Localities are making their own rules.

“We have heard the community and appreciate the desire for more robust input in any future projects that may be brought forward in the county, and we are confident that this is a goal that can be accomplished.” said Charles W. Payne, Jr., an attorney representing AWS.
Residents gathered Thursday night in the community center of a Baptist church in the rural town of Mineral. Many said they felt lighter knowing one project is, at least for now, off the table. Some people passed out stickers that read “Don’t Loudoun my Louisa” — a reference to the proliferation of data centers in Northern Virginia — and yard signs urging the board of supervisors to say “no” to more data centers..

“We’re letting or even entertaining the idea of a billion dollar corporation coming around and messing with our drinking water. I think it’s pretty humiliating,” Louisa resident Brittany Carroll said.
Loudoun County has one of the highest concentrations of data centers in the state. Conversely, winding roads cut through pockets of forest and farmland that stretch far and wide in Louisa. Some Louisa residents fear Loudoun’s level of development would destroy the rural nature of their community.
The county has been open to the digital industry since 2018 when the Technology Overlay District was developed, Lousia County Supervisor Duane Adams said.
A few dozen community members attended the informal meeting about the data centers already in the works, one of multiple held since the third AWS application was announced. The crowd audibly grumbled during discussion of the AWS campuses already approved with by-right permits.
AWS proposed the third data center to be one of the largest in the area by far. The 1370-acre plot near the Northeast Creek Reservoir prompted concerns about construction near schools in the area and how much water would be needed to cool the systems inside the building. The land is currently zoned for agricultural use and is used for timber production, adding to concerns of losing the rural land.

After the latest application was filed, community members took to social media and local meetings to share worries and debate over possible sound pollution, loss of agricultural land, and the rapid rate of development. Some people went so far as to say they felt betrayed by the board of supervisors for agreeing to the initial two AWS sites. Adams sees the tension as an opportunity for community collaboration.
“We threw the nets out, we went fishing and we landed two big fish. So we accomplished our goal. [We shrank] the technology overlay district,” Adams said. “Then let’s be very deliberate as we move forward with this, and that’s when we added the CUP process, which is why you see the engagement with the community. I think that’s really positive.”
AWS already has two data centers in the works in the county’s Technological Overlay District (TOD) that allowed the facilities to be permitted by-right, meaning the public had less of a say in the project. In 2024, the county Board of Supervisors revised the TOD to be smaller and to add the conditional use permit for future projects to allow the public to be part of the process.
Amazon has invested $35 billion into the commonwealth, with $11 billion of that being in Louisa county for the two AWS data centers. 
Adams has been very supportive of the two data centers in the county. A third proposal is being considered as EdgeCore recently purchased 697 acres in the Shannon Hill business park to build a 3.9 million square foot facility. However, that proposal includes a closed loop cooling system and does not have as heavy of impacts on community water sources. Some at the public meeting felt the project was far enough away from residences that light and sound would not be a major concern.
“We’re going to see one of the data centers on the existing campuses come online (by the end of the year). So we’re going to see some of the things that we’ve talked about in the abstract actually become hard base facts, and that’s water usage, employment opportunities, tax revenue …I’m taking a long view of this. I don’t think there’s a rush,” Adams said.
The town Council of Mineral, which lies to the east of the TOD,  published an opposition to the new proposed AWS project in June over concerns of traffic from construction, noise pollution, water use, and other concerns brought to their attention by residents.
The Piedmont Environmental Council, who presented facts about data centers at the meeting, acknowledged the draw of building data centers is the tax revenue for the county through personal property tax and real estate taxes. But the computers inside of data centers rapidly depreciate, decreasing that revenue for the county.
“More folks need to be concerned about putting all their eggs in the data center revenue basket because it can be a really risky move. Loudoun County at the height of the pandemic had a $60 million budget shortfall because two of their data centers were not able to refresh their computing equipment as scheduled due to supply chain issues,” said Sarah Parmelee, land use field representative with the Piedmont Environmental Council.
Parmelee went on to say while data centers are essential for internet use, the demand has exploded due to the growth in AI technology. There are now questions about how long that demand will last and if all the proposed data centers will come to fruition. Microsoft recently canceled two gigawatts worth of data center leases across the U.S. and Europe, claiming their existing data centers have them on track to meet the current demand. It leaves Parmelee and other Virginians with more questions.
“We need to slow down, we need to start really looking at these things and asking how many of them do we actually need?  How many of them can we actually support without throwing away everything that makes Virginia an awesome place to live, work and play?” Parmelee said.
Louisa resident Savannah Walker works in the data center industry with nearly 20 years of experience. She said the third AWS site was too large of a facility without the proper infrastructure in the county in place to support it. She had taken charge in the community effort to get educated on the project and speak out about concerns.
“We have to have them. It is what it is. It’s today’s world. However, there’s a time and a place for them,” Walker said.
Some residents floated the idea of putting a moratorium on data centers in Louisa County. 
Adams said with the revisions to the TOD that now required a conditional use permit and heavy public involvement, it will already be more of a challenge for future proposals to get through. He said it is a positive thing to see the public involved in the process and that residents get to have more of a say in what is allowed to be built.
The letter from the attorney representing AWS didn’t specify if the company would ever come back with a future application in the county. Some residents are gearing up for another round.
“They’re going to be back; we have to control how it happens,” Walker said.

Virginia consumers probably noticed it for the first time when they saw pop-up notices while they were shopping online. 
Senate Bill 754, the Virginia Consumer Protection Act, put protections in state law from having an individual’s health information sold or shared with third parties without that person’s consent. That was particularly welcome for women in an age when draconian assaults on reproductive rights in some states includes vacuuming up the most private of data, from menstrual cycles to birth control preferences.
The legislation passed by a 21-17 Senate vote on Jan. 24. One Republican joined 20 Democrats voting for the bill; all 17 nay votes were Republican. One Democrat and one Republican did not vote.
New Va. law protecting reproductive health data prompts Walmart’s online data collection pop-ups

Three weeks later, it cleared the House on a 52-43 vote. Two Republicans broke ranks and joined 50 Democrats in support. Four of the five delegates who did not vote were Republicans.
On this one, Gov. Glenn Youngkin differed from most in his party and, in March, chose the greater good, signing the bill patroned by Senate Democrats Barbara Favola of Arlington and Scott Surovell of Fairfax. It took effect on July 1, the start of Virginia’s new fiscal year.
O happy day!
Alas, Virginia, no good deed goes unpunished.
On the bill’s effective date earlier this month, customers shopping their favorite online retailers started seeing notices pop up on their computer monitors. They vary, but in essence they inform consumers that they must consent to have their online data harvested if they wish to continue shopping.
Some were quite up-front about it, such as the one initially posted by Walmart. The world’s largest retailer was remarkably straightforward in describing limitations that Virginia’s brand-new VCPA applies to consumer data about sexual and reproductive health merchandise. It explained that by clicking the “Continue shopping” button and proceeding to browse the site, users consent to Walmart using their data to complete the purchase, provide the requested feature and for general analytics, operations and fraud prevention.
Janet Peyton, a McGuireWoods attorney* who advises clients on data privacy issues, noted that Walmart’s advisory isn’t proposing to provide the data to third parties, only for its own internal use. Virginians have more robust data privacy protections under a slightly older state law, she said, and nothing in Walmart’s disclaimer waives those.

“It doesn’t say anything about your other privacy rights under the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act and, in fact, there are lots of other (rights),” she said. The Walmart pop-up, she said, constitutes “a very limited consent specific to this health information that they’re gathering.”
Walmart has significantly pared down its pop-up since early July, dropping the references to the family-planning and intimate products.  
Other big chains that offer those products are far less conspicuous in letting Virginians know about the newer privacy law.
The CVS drugstore chain, for example, has a small, obscure disclaimer at the bottom of its landing page under the curious heading “Improving your site experience.” It says in miniscule type that by continuing to shop on the site, you give the pharmacy giant the right to share your data with “trusted third parties, including our marketing, analytics and research partners.”
Its rival apothecary chain, Walgreens, similarly requires users to do a lengthy scroll downward to find its privacy link nestled in the sub-basement of its webpage. There, one finds a “Your Privacy Choices” link that jumps to a consumer rights box outlining non-specific rights afforded customers in Virginia and 15 other states. In that box, there are links to pages that allow consumers to access, correct and delete their data, and to opt out of the sale, sharing or use of their data for targeted advertising, rights Virginians have had since the VCDPA took effect Jan. 1, 2023.

Those pages ask users to jump through multiple hoops just to verify their identity and, after that’s done, opt out of sharing, selling or bartering your data.
I undertook the exercise on several big chain retailers’ websites, including the aforementioned. I had to confirm unsettlingly specific personal information, including an approximate range for my mortgage payments, which of several random home addresses was once mine, banks where I held accounts decades ago, names of relatives and more. It’s precisely the sort of info you don’t want out there. With that completed, I was informed that I would be updated on the progress of the request or, in one case, get an email I could use to complete the process within a couple of weeks. I’m not holding my breath.
Creepy? Sure felt that way.
Confusing? Yes, on any number of levels, not the least of which is a state-to-state patchwork of statutes that even legal professionals find challenging because there’s no nationwide data privacy law.
Burdensome? Sure.
“It can be done. It is a little bit cumbersome — not particularly consumer friendly — but it’s not saying anything here about waiving your right to make a data access request or opt out of those other things,” Peyton said, referencing the Walmart disclaimer.
Data in large-scale retailing is money. Huge money. Ask Jeff Bezos, the founder of the all-online Amazon, the planet’s second-largest retailer after Walmart.
E-commerce retail sales ballooned from $5.6 billion in the first quarter of 2000 to $300.2 billion in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
Data are essential to that. As Charlotte Rene Woods explained in her reporting on July 8, pop-ups informing users about “cookies,” or other data that websites collect and store aren’t uncommon in online transactions. Some are necessary to complete them.
That’s been true for more than 30 years, back in the phone-modem days when many folks of a certain age got their first excursions into cyberspace via America Online with its cheery “You’ve got mail!” log-in greeting. The age of Amazon, Google and Meta is built on data.
It’s no mystery, then, that there’s no incentive other than the law’s baseline requirements for retailers to make it as easy as allowing consumers to click one icon to keep their private data private.
On the other hand, some of them have made relinquishing at least a slice of your privacy exactly that easy.

(Courtesy of Natalie Emmerson)In January 2024, Bowdoin freshman Natalie Emmerson collected signatures for U.S. Sen. Angus King’s re-election campaign. Frequently, she was asked by voters, “isn’t he already on the ballot?” 
That’s when she realized that by working on the campaign she was learning information about how elections and democracy work that most people didn’t know.
That lesson prompted Emmerson and classmate Larsen Van Horn one year later to create a podcast called “Pine State Politics: In Session,” where they learn and educate listeners about basic civic processes, like how a bill becomes a law, the difference between state and federal government, the role of lobbyists and much more from some of the biggest names in Maine politics: former Congressman and U.S. Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen, current Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, and King himself.
“A lot of young people want to get involved, but don’t know how,” Emmerson said of the political process. “That’s exactly what the point of the podcast is. We’re digging into the mechanics of how everything works.”
Van Horn, who is from out of state, said the podcast is a way for her to learn more about how Maine’s government and elections work, for instance, concepts like ranked-choice voting and clean elections funding. He said this is especially important because, like other college students, he is able to vote in Maine elections. 
Next year, the podcast could be played in high school classrooms across Maine as part of a newly offered curriculum that Emmerson and Van Horn are partnering with the Maine Department of Education to develop. 
For example, in the first episode, the hosts asked Bellows and Washington, D.C. lobbyist and University of Maine adjunct professor Peter Madigan which issues are handled locally and which are federal: Who do you call about a road that needs paving? Which office handles disability payments?
That segment will help prompt classroom discussion questions, Emmerson said, such as “What issues can your congressperson help you with? What is a district office and what do the people who work there do?”

“Some of these questions will require the student to look some information up for a complete answer,” she added. “The conversation in the snippet will help point them in the right direction. That way students stay engaged and are required to ask questions and think critically about the systems they’re learning about “
The department hopes the collaboration will make the democratic process more accessible and engaging for young people, particularly because it’s a resource developed by other young people. 
“They’re a great example of youth voice in civic education, which is something we want to be promoting because … there is very low youth engagement nationwide in civic life,” said Beth Lambert, chief teaching and learning officer at the Maine Department of Education.
The podcast breaks down complex government processes in a non-partisan, approachable manner, Lambert said, which was another reason the partnership appealed to the department.
“They’re not diving into polarizing policy debates in these podcasts,” she said. “It really emphasizes how democracy works and encourages understanding across the political divides, which is key in our classrooms.”
The lesson plans, which will be available this fall, will allow high school teachers to use specific segments in civics, U.S. history, and current events classes. Since Maine allows local districts to control curriculum, teachers in each district will be able to decide whether to use the lesson plans. 
But the initiative reflects the department’s broader commitment to promoting youth-driven learning experiences that encourage students to understand and actively participate in democratic processes. 
Next year, the department will be rolling out another learning opportunity for elementary students — interactive town halls. These day-long events, developed in partnership with the Secretary of State and local municipalities, will immerse young students in democratic processes such as town council meetings. Students will participate in various roles, such as reporters, candidates, and voters, learning about local government, the role of the media and policy through hands-on activities. 
These new initiatives are part of “broader efforts to support interdisciplinary, inclusive and relevant learning experiences,” Lambert said, which are a department priority.

Kelly Ayotte this month, allows K-12 schools to hire faculty from New Hampshire’s colleges and universities to teach up to 20 hours a week of classes. (Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin) For 26 years, the Community College System of New Hampshire has offered a proposal to public high school students: Take a college-level course taught by a faculty member, earn college credit, and use that credit to save time and money in college.
That program, originally known as Running Start, has ballooned in popularity. What started with 25 participating high schools has grown to more than 100, serving around 11,000 students, according to Chuck Lloyd, the vice chancellor of the community college system. Each year, more schools are seeing examples of that interest: high school seniors graduating with full associate’s degrees. 
Now, a new state law could help expand that system. House Bill 90, signed by Gov. Kelly Ayotte this month, allows K-12 schools to hire faculty from New Hampshire’s colleges and universities to teach up to 20 hours a week of classes. 
To Lloyd, the bill will empower community colleges to expand their high school dual enrollment partnerships. It allows the school district to pay the community college faculty member directly, and for the faculty member to better divide their time. 
“We loved our partners so much, we wanted to make it work, but it really wasn’t scalable,” he said in an interview. “We couldn’t take our automotive instructor and do it for three or four different high schools, because they wouldn’t have the bandwidth to come teach our college students.” 
But the bill applies to all courses — not just dual enrollment courses for college credit — meaning it also allows a school to hire the faculty members for standard math or English classes. Democrats, public school advocates, and teachers have heavily criticized that piece, arguing it will allow schools to cut corners to save money and potentially lower pay to teachers, and that it could degrade the quality of instruction. 
Republicans say the bill is a simple change that provides schools a tool to help with persistent staffing shortages.
“The way I see it is, if there is an open space and there’s a teacher who has passed a background check, they have experience teaching at a college, and they’re more than willing to teach at the high school, I would much rather that teacher be in the classroom than nobody at all, and the class doesn’t get offered, and the students can’t learn that subject,” she said. 
HB 90 allows any full-time or contracted faculty member of the University System of New Hampshire or Community College System of New Hampshire to work part time in a public school without obtaining a credential. To do so, they must have “expertise or significant professional experience” to teach in the schools, and pass a criminal background check from the Department of Education. 
The law requires the faculty members to abide by the state’s code of conduct that applies to K-12 teachers, even though they have no credentials that could potentially be revoked. And it excludes former K-12 teachers whose licenses have been revoked. 
Rep. Rick Ladd, a Haverhill Republican and the bill’s prime sponsor, said the bill is meant to help schools, not take away teachers’ jobs.
“This bill is attempting to aid schools that do not have the staff in place or are encountering scheduling difficulties to ensure all students have an equal opportunity to receive a dual and concurrent education,” Ladd, who is chairman of the House Education Funding Committee, said in testimony to senators earlier this year.
Rep. Valerie McDonnell, a Salem Republican and co-sponsor of the bill, said the law’s main aim is to build partnerships for career and technical education. Salem has a CTE center, where high school students can go for classes to prepare them for professions or trades that are not always taught in high school, and the new law could help more high schools in her area contribute to that program, she said.
“It’s specialties, maybe automotive or cosmetology,” McDonnell said in an interview. “So having a CTE center, Salem has found that (the new law) would be helpful.”
But McDonnell also noted the law could be used to help high school administrators fill spots when hiring teaching help is difficult.
“The way I see it is, if there is an open space and there’s a teacher who has passed a background check, they have experience teaching at a college, and they’re more than willing to teach at the high school, I would much rather that teacher be in the classroom than nobody at all, and the class doesn’t get offered, and the students can’t learn that subject,” she said.
But teachers have protested.
“I am insulted that this would even be considered for the education of our college (bound) students,” wrote Jamie Bolduc, a teacher of 24 years from Fremont, in written testimony to the House. “Our certifications show that we have demonstrated the skills required to educate others; it would be like going to have surgery with someone who has never been to medical school”
Kate Griffin, of Hooksett, agreed, arguing in her own testimony that the law would “dumb down” teaching. “Education is a multifaceted and complex job,” she said. “We need certified professionals who are up to the task, not those who do not also understand the complexities of child development and how children learn.”
The National Education Association of New Hampshire, the state’s largest teacher’s union, has also opposed the bill. 
“While New Hampshire’s inadequate and inequitable school funding system has exacerbated teacher shortages in property poor and lower-income communities, lowering  the standards for who can teach is an inappropriate response,” said NEA-NH President Megan Tuttle in a statement earlier this month. “For school districts with fewer resources, this law could incentivize administrators to hire uncertified and untrained temporary fill-in educators rather than licensed teachers who are invested in the school community and their students.”
For now, it’s not clear whether public schools are interested in hiring part-time teachers from colleges. 
Mark MacLean, the executive director of the New Hampshire School Administrators Association, said in an email he has not heard anything this summer from his member school districts. And a spokeswoman for the University System of New Hampshire said the university was unaware of any public school that has reached out to faculty seeking to hire.
Any moves by schools to hire faculty as part-time teachers would most likely occur on an individual, case-by-case basis, and might not be known to college administrators, Lloyd said.
Lloyd said he is unsure how much interest there is among community college faculty to teach standard classes in K-12 schools. 
And he stressed that the community college system does not take any stance on whether its members teach non-college courses; the organization is only seeking to promote the law’s role toward dual curriculum courses. 
But when it comes to those courses, Lloyd is hopeful the partnerships will continue to increase.
He pointed to one area in which HB 90 could help community college faculty members: working hours. Under the current system, faculty are paid by their community college for the work they do with high schools, and any hours they work at the K-12 school are subtracted from the hours they can spend teaching their courses to college students. Under the new law, if hired by a school district, a faculty member can move forward with two separate contracts and two separate hourly limits, Lloyd said. 
“It really makes it cleaner,” he said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nhti-1024x670.jpg,,,2025-07-28 05:56:12.160985

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)School districts in Ohio and across the country will now be receiving billions of dollars that were being withheld by the Trump administration, funds local public education workers and supporters said are critically needed as the new school year approaches.
The Trump administration halted distribution of $6.8 billion in funds allocated by Congress in March, though $1.4 billion was unfrozen for one of the U.S. Department of Education’s grant programs earlier this month. On Friday afternoon, the White House reportedly announced it will release the rest of the funds due to schools.
The news comes after Ohio school districts, pro-public education organizations and hundreds of individuals signed on to a letter on July 21 urging state and congressional leaders to help release federal funds.
Led by the coalition Honesty for Ohio Education, the letter was directed at Attorney General Dave Yost, the U.S. Department of Education and Ohio’s congressional delegation, expressing “deep concern” over the freezing of federal funding for the state’s public schools.
The funds for Ohio amount to about $185 million for the 2024 fiscal year, according to Honesty for Ohio Education, the absence of which the group said has been “causing widespread disruption and panic to district planning and school operations.”
“This funding is not hypothetical – they are federal dollars already allocated by Congress,” said Dr. Christina Collins, executive director of Honesty for Ohio Education, in a statement. “The withholding of these necessary funds harms children, educators and school communities every day it is delayed, undermining educational progress.”
The federal monies can be used for school districts with low-income families, after-school programs and other educational services, to provide students with “significant opportunity to receive a fair, equitable and high-quality education, and to close educational achievement gaps,” according to the Ohio Department of Education & Workforce website.
“Ohio schools rely on these federal Title funds to support critical services and programs for students,” the letter from the public school supporters stated. “The continued delay in releasing these funds has created uncertainty, disrupted district planning and jeopardized the academic and social supports that many of our students depend on.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe money is allocated based on “accountability systems to identify and support schools with academically struggling students” and the funds must be used “to improve student outcomes, including academic achievement,” according to the state education department.
The groups wrote in their letter that the funds “are essential to ensuring equitable access to education for all students, especially those with the greatest need.”
Cleveland Heights-University Heights and Shaker Heights school districts both signed on to the letter, along with the Shaker Heights Teachers Association, retired members of the Ohio Education Association and the Ashland County Community Academy.
Organizations such as the Boys & Girls Clubs of Northeast Ohio, the Lake County NAACP and the Ohio Council of Churches also joined in on the letter.
The districts, groups and individuals asked for specific things of each entity to whom they sent the letter. They called on Yost to “take all legal and administrative steps necessary to secure the immediate release of these funds,” and asked Ohio’s members of Congress to “publicly and forcefully advocate for the prompt distribution of these federal dollars to our school districts.”
Of the U.S. Department of Education, the letter asked for a partnership with state and federal officials “to ensure these funds are delivered swiftly and equitably, as intended by law.”
“Ohio’s children cannot afford to be caught in political or bureaucratic limbo,” the letter read. “The state must act now to honor its obligations and ensure that every child has the resources they need to learn, grow and thrive.”
Yost’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the letter.

The Mississippi State Department of Health, like other state health departments, is concerned about the potential loss of federal funding. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Between 2016 and 2022, as congenital syphilis cases rose nationally and especially in the South, Mississippi saw a one thousand percent increase — from 10 to 110 — in the number of newborn babies who were hospitalized after contracting the disease, known to cause developmental issues, intellectual disabilities, and even death.
So in 2023, the state Department of Health mandated that all medical practitioners screen for the disease in pregnant mothers, and it has been running advertisements to spread awareness.
Annual congenital syphilis cases in Mississippi rose from 62 in 2021 to 132 in 2023, according to state data. The number fell to 114 last year. There have been 33 cases so far this year.
That work won’t stop despite potential budget cuts, Dr. Daniel Edney, Mississippi’s state health officer, said in an interview. “We’re going to keep doing what we have to do, you know, to keep it under control.”
State by state, public health departments take a similar approach: They monitor, treat and try to stem preventable diseases, alongside their host of other duties. But in the coming year, health department officials — with their agencies already strapped for cash — fear they’ll find it much more difficult to do their jobs.
President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 would cut the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by more than half, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion. The proposal serves as a wish list from the administration, a blueprint for the Republican-controlled Congress as it works through upcoming spending legislation.
If lawmakers hew to Trump’s vision, then state and county public health departments would be hit hard. States contribute to their own health departments, but a lot of them rely heavily on federal funding.
And around half of local public health department funding comes from federal sources, primarily the CDC, as noted in a 2022 report from the National Association of County & City Health Officials.
Medicaid cuts are likely to worsen mental health care in rural America

“The federal government provides a lot of funding, but the actual implementation of public health programs happens at the state and local level,” said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF, a health policy research group. “Each state has its own approach, in many ways, to how public health programs are overseen, how they’re funded, how they are implemented.”
In announcing his department’s share of the proposed budget, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Trump’s goals align with “new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic.”
But many local health leaders point to the longtime mission of state public health departments in preventing the spread of disease.
“Local public health is on the front lines preventing communicable disease, operating programs to prevent chronic disease, ensuring our septic and well water systems are safe,” said Dr. Kelly Kimple, acting director of North Carolina’s Division of Public Health within the Department of Health and Human Services.
“I’m very concerned,” Kimple said, “especially given the magnitude of funding that we’re talking about, as we can’t keep doing more with less.”
Clawing back COVID-era grants
Other federal budget cuts also have states worried.
Many state public health departments grew alarmed when the Trump administration announced in March that it would be clawing back $11.4 billion in COVID-era funding for grants that were slated to extend into 2026.
Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia sued. A federal district court in Rhode Island temporarily blocked the cuts, and the case remains tied up in court.
The court’s preliminary injunction may not protect temporary staff or contractors, though. Public health departments have been laying off staff, cutting lab capacity and reducing immunization clinics, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
No one knows whether Trump’s $50B for rural health will be enough

Historically, public health departments receive funding in “boom and bust” cycles, meaning they tend to get more federal support during emergencies, said Michaud, of KFF. But “since the Great Recession of 2008, there was a general decline in public health support funding until the COVID pandemic.”
For example, KHN and The Associated Press reported that between 2010 and 2019, spending on state public health departments declined by 16% per capita and spending for local health departments fell by 18%.
Nationally, syphilis cases reached historic lows in the 2000s, thanks to robust prevention efforts and education from public health officials. By 2022, however, cases reached their highest numbers nationally since the 1950s.
“In the wake of the COVID emergency, you’ve seen a sort of backlash to what people had been calling the overreach of public health and imposing vaccination requirements and lockdowns and other public health measures,” Michaud told Stateline.
Smallpox, cholera and typhoid
Public health departments and officials go back to the 19th century, when there was a greater emphasis on sanitation efforts to prevent spread of diseases such as smallpox, cholera and typhoid, which were rampant at the time.
By the end of the century, 40 states had established health departments, which to this day are responsible for water sanitation, tracking the spread of disease, administering vaccinations, furnishing health education, providing screenings for infants and some prenatal care for moms at local clinics, offering family planning services, and tracking and treating sexually transmitted infections, among other things.











What we're seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.


– Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF



Kimple pointed to measles as a current example of a disease that’s spreading fast. When North Carolina’s health department detected a case in the state, she said, the department “identified and contacted everyone who might have been exposed, helped people get tested, worked with doctors to make sure they knew how to respond.”
That’s the legacy of local public health, Michaud said.
“The federal government cannot decide, ‘This public health program will happen in this state, but not that state,’ that kind of thing. And cannot declare a national lockdown. The COVID pandemic tested a lot of those boundaries. It really is a state and local responsibility to protect public health. And that’s always been the case, since the beginning of our country,” Michaud said.
“And what we’re seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.”
A major cut in services
Kimple said she’s seen recent progress in her state in the support for funding public health.
“North Carolinians viewed our work as highly important to improving health and well-being in the state, and appreciated the local presence, the reliable information, the role in prevention and efforts to protect, in particular, vulnerable communities,” she said.
Similarly, Edney said that Mississippi state lawmakers were showing more support, despite some setbacks in 2016 and 2017. New federal cuts could throw a wrench in the health department’s economic plans and its ability to reach small communities.
“Now the federal rug is being pulled out from under us,” he said.
Edney said he expects the federal share of his department’s public health funding to fall from its current 65% to around 50%.
Edney said he’s been trying to strengthen Mississippi health department’s longevity by diversifying its revenue streams by, for example, accepting private donations.
The state will not stop doing its “core” work, he said, regardless of federal funding.
“We’re not going to cut back on services at the county health department, because what we do now is all mission critical,” Edney said.

Almost half of the 63 million Americans who care for a family member say they struggle financially to do so. (Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)More than 63 million Americans are caregivers for a family member with complex medical needs, a 20 million increase over the past decade, according to a new report.
But state policies, workplaces and the American health system haven’t kept up with this surge in family caregiving responsibilities, said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, a physician and the CEO of the AARP, which released the report with the National Alliance for Caregiving, a nonprofit policy and research organization.
“Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences, draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing,” Minter-Jordan told reporters on a call this week.
One of the biggest reasons for the surge in family caregivers is that Americans are living longer, yet they’re not necessarily healthier. There’s a 12-year gap between the average number of years that Americans live and the number of years they’re healthy.
‘A purpose in this world’: Older adults fear elimination of program that helps them find work

The caregiving role typically involves helping a family member with daily tasks like bathing, dressing and eating. But more than half of caregivers also perform more complex medical tasks, such as managing catheters or administering injections, the report found.
A growing number of caregivers are so-called “sandwich caregivers” — parents caring for their children as well as for an adult family member, such as an aging parent. About 17 million people are sandwich caregivers, compared with 11 million a decade ago. And most caregivers are also working a job.
And while the bulk of caregiving still falls on women, 40% of American caregivers are men.
Some states have heeded the growing calls for action.
Earlier this year, Maine lawmakers created a state program to provide respite care, which includes services such as adult day care that give family caregivers a temporary break.
Also this year, Tennessee extended its pilot program that provides respite care for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, and also passed a bipartisan bill that directs the state Medicaid program to develop guidelines to allow family caregivers to be paid for their work.
Last year, Nebraska passed a tax credit for family caregivers; Oklahoma passed a similar law the year before. And while the United States is one of few countries that doesn’t mandate paid family leave at the federal level, 13 states and the District of Columbia have established their own paid family leave rules.
Meanwhile, the historic cuts to Medicaid enacted as part of the GOP’s Big, Beautiful Bill Act will shift health costs to states, leaving experts worried that family caregivers could lose Medicaid-funded services they rely on.

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Ann Cornwell has been the soundtrack of the Arkansas Senate for decades.
Standing behind a lectern in the well, Cornwell has read thousands of bills, resolutions and governor’s letters and recited senators’ names as they cast their votes.
The first and only woman to be Secretary of the Senate and its director, colleagues describe Cornwell as a committed public servant who’s led with grace and a commitment to excellence while directing staff and legislators through the intricacies of creating state law.
After 45 years in the Senate, Cornwell plans to retire in December.
During the waning days of her final legislative session in April, a staged argument erupted between two senators. The distraction allowed staff to slip into Cornwell’s hands a resolution honoring her years of service. 
Cornwell began to read the text aloud but paused when she saw her name. Lawmakers laughed and applauded, while family and friends hiding in side rooms spilled onto the Senate floor. 
The surprise was a welcome one, perhaps the first for a woman who’s had her hand in the meticulous details of running the Senate for years. 
“I was totally shocked, especially with the kids coming in from out of state. It was a big surprise, it really was,” she said. 
Overcome, Cornwell handed the resolution to a colleague to read. 
“For forty-five (45) years, Ann Cornwell has been the heart and soul of the Senate because of her dedication to the institution and its processes, loyalty to the first branch of government, unmatched work ethic, affection for each senator, and support of Senate and legislative staff,” the resolution read, in part. 
While Cornwell feels fortunate to have a job she absolutely loves, she’s looking forward to spending her retirement visiting family, traveling with legislative colleagues from around the country who’ve become close friends and learning to play Mahjong. 
“I love the Senate, I always have. I still love it and I know I’m going to miss it, but it’s time,” she said. “I’m ready, and I think the Senate’s in a good place right now for me to leave.”
Origin story
Sabrina Lewellen said she has one of the world’s best jobs as deputy director and assistant secretary to a “superhero.”
Having worked alongside Cornwell for two decades, Lewellen said she’s blessed to have learned from a “fearless, dedicated public servant” who’s committed to the details. 
“Her grace, her unmatched dedication to all things Senate…I have had the honor to be in the presence of true greatness, and I am going to miss her.”

Though she’s now synonymous with the Senate, politics was not Cornwell’s obvious destiny. Growing up in Russellville, she was an athletic child who loved swimming and diving. She also studied physical education at Arkansas Tech University where her dad coached.
“I dropped out of that when they plopped a rat in front of me I had to dissect and I said, ‘I’m out of here.’ So I changed to business,’” Cornwell recalled with a laugh. 
While in college, Cornwell married her husband and gave birth to their son. She had twin girls two years later, and the young family moved to Tennessee and Texas before ultimately settling in North Little Rock. 
Cornwell cared for her children, played tennis and bridge, and was active in Junior League. One day friends suggested Cornwell join them at the Capitol for session work because “it’s fun,” and she did. 
She began her career in the Senate in 1981 as a journal clerk. Cornwell became assistant Secretary of the Senate in 1991 and the full-time Secretary and fiscal officer in 1995. She’s served in her current role since 2009. 
When she started four decades ago, did Cornwell think she’d still be here? “Absolutely not,” she said with a hearty laugh. 
Cornwell, who loves being in session and busy, has seen lots of change during her time in the upper chamber. Women are now elected to Senate seats instead of serving temporarily after their husband’s death. Technology has evolved. Many things are now digital, but the process remains the same so staff can still run a session if the computers go down, Cornwell said. 
Institutional legislative staff are the “indispensable facilitators of democracy,” according to Lewellen, who said she’s grateful for Cornwell’s  “legacy leadership.” 
“It’s quite a machine and it doesn’t happen by accident, and the Anns of the world who help construct it, it’s just true brilliance,”  Lewellen said.

During Lewellen’s first day in the Senate in 2003, Cornwell taught her some important lessons. One is “this is a very big deal and never treat it less than that,” Lewellen said. 
Another, Cornwell said, is “there’s no job that you’re too good for,” including taking out the trash.
“Everybody works together and helps each other, and that’s what you’ve got to understand: is that if something needs done, you’ll help somebody, you’ll do it,” Cornwell said. “I don’t expect anyone to do something that I would not do, and I’ve done everything.”
Lewellen remains in awe of her hero, who’s “touched hundreds of thousands of pages of history.” 
“There is some real strength and intelligence and integrity and intentionality, commitment and sacrifice that goes on behind the scenes, and she is one of those warriors whose strength has just been unmatched,” Lewellen said. 
Like family
In 2010, Missy Thomas Irvin, a newly-elected Mountain View Republican, was lost in the Senate chamber the first time she met Cornwell.
“She just immediately embraced me with a hug and just said, ‘Welcome to the Senate,’ and then directed me to the office I needed to go to…I’d still never forget her demeanor of…you are now in the Senate and you’re a part of the Senate family,” Irvin said. 
The following summer, Fayetteville Democrat Greg Leding, a new House representative, was wandering around San Antonio alone during a legislative conference. Cornwell spotted him and insisted he join her and other legislators on a riverboat tour. 
“I just always remember that because I was still very much a new member of the House, I wasn’t even in her chamber, but still made me feel incredibly welcome,” Leding said.

Cornwell is a warm and pleasant person who loves to socialize, according to Leding, who grew to know her better after joining the Senate in 2018. 
“Even if you’ve never met her, she can make you feel like you’ve been friends for years within minutes of meeting her,” he said. 
Lt. Gov. Leslie Rutledge said working with Cornwell provided “a great deal of relief” when she began presiding over the Senate in 2023. 
“She is a selfless leader, she enjoys life, she has an incredible, witty personality, hardworking, someone you want to be around,” Rutledge said. 
Irvin said she also appreciated Cornwell treating all lawmakers equally. 
“What you do for one senator, you do for the next one…doesn’t matter if it’s the number one in seniority or if it’s the 35th in seniority, you treat them all the same. It’s totally nonpartisan,” Cornwell said. 
The Senate stalwart’s mark on the body is “indelible and it’ll never be the same,” Leding said. 
Never one to sit idle, Cornwell said she’s exploring volunteer opportunities during her retirement, and can provide assistance behind the scenes at the Capitol if she’s needed. 
As she prepares for this next chapter, Cornwell hopes she’s remembered as someone who worked hard and always tried to do her best.
“And that I was fair. That I’ve always been fair and tried to uphold the institution…45 years is a long time to be up here…it’s been a good ride,” she said.

(Getty Images)More than 63 million Americans are caregivers for a family member with complex medical needs, a 20 million increase over the past decade, according to a new report.
But state policies, workplaces, and the American health system haven’t kept up with this surge in family caregiving responsibilities, said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, a physician and the CEO of the AARP, which released the report with the National Alliance for Caregiving, a nonprofit policy and research organization.
“Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences, draining savings, falling into debt, or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing,” Minter-Jordan told reporters on a call this week.
One of the biggest reasons for the surge in family caregivers is that Americans are living longer, yet they’re not necessarily healthier. There’s a 12-year gap between the average number of years that Americans live and the number of years they’re healthy.
The caregiving role typically involves helping a family member with daily tasks like bathing, dressing, and eating. But more than half of caregivers also perform more complex medical tasks, such as managing catheters or administering injections, the report found.
A growing number of caregivers are so-called “sandwich caregivers” — parents caring for their children as well as for an adult family member, such as an aging parent. About 17 million people are sandwich caregivers, compared with 11 million a decade ago. And most caregivers are also working a job.
And while the bulk of caregiving still falls on women, 40% of American caregivers are men.
Some states have heeded the growing calls for action.
Earlier this year, Maine lawmakers created a state program to provide respite care, which includes services such as adult day care that give family caregivers a temporary break.
Also this year, Tennessee extended its pilot program that provides respite care for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, and also passed a bipartisan bill that directs the state Medicaid program to develop guidelines to allow family caregivers to be paid for their work.
Last year, Nebraska passed a tax credit for family caregivers; Oklahoma passed a similar law the year before. And while the United States is one of few countries that doesn’t mandate paid family leave at the federal level, 13 states and the District of Columbia have established their own paid family leave rules.
Meanwhile, the historic cuts to Medicaid enacted as part of the GOP’s Big, Beautiful Bill Act will shift health costs to states, leaving experts worried that family caregivers could lose Medicaid-funded services they rely on.

Ohio Reps. Sean Brennan, D-Parma, and D.J. Swearingen, R-Huron, once again introduced a bipartisan bill that would make the  walleye Ohio’s official state fish. 
“I’m optimistic that we’re going to be able to reel this one in and finally make the walleye our state fish,” Brennan said. “We are the walleye capital of the world, and Ohio is open for anglers from all over the place to come here and experience what Ohio is all about.”

The lawmakers introduced House Bill 312 at the end of May and it had sponsor testimony last month in the House Arts, Athletics and Tourism Committee. Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa are the only states without a designated state fish. The walleye is the state fish in Minnesota, South Dakota, and Vermont. 
“By having an official state fish, it allows the state of Ohio to market that to folks in other states,” Brennan said. “I’ve talked to environmentalists who said that having a state fish can help them on their grant applications with different levels of government and with other nonprofits that make donations.”  
There are 72.1 million walleye in Lake Erie at least two years or older, meaning they are ready to be caught and kept, Brennan said in his testimony. For comparison, there are about 600,000 white-tailed deer in Ohio, he said. 
The Walleye are the nickname of Toledo’s professional minor league hockey team and Port Clinton celebrates the annual Walleye Festival as well as the Walleye Drop on New Year’s Eve.
Brennan — who grew up fishing on Catawba Island — and Swearingen introduced the same bill during the previous General Assembly and it easily passed the House with only four dissenting votes, but it ran out of time in the Senate and died. 
“It’s not really controversial,” Brennan said. “I mean, we passed almost unanimously last year.” 
Having the walleye become the official state fish would help show off Lake Erie, Swearingen said. 
“There’s a lot of people that come into the district just to fish for that fish on Lake Erie,” he said. “The economic impact is pretty large.”
Jason Fischer runs three competitive walleye tournament series in Ohio — the Lake Erie Walleye Trail, the Walleye Fall Brawl, and the Ohio Walleye Federation. 
“Ohio is the walleye capital of the world,” he said. “No questions asked, it is just astronomical.” 
People from more than 20 states and Canada come annually to compete in the Walleye Fall Brawl. 
“You come to Ohio to fish for walleye because it’s the best place in the world to do it,” Fischer said. 
Ohio fishing has an economic impact of $5.5 billion per year, according to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. 
“Just because somebody comes here to fish doesn’t mean that the restaurants don’t benefit, the fuel stations don’t benefit, the hotels don’t benefit,” Fischer said. 
For Ohio Marine Trades Association President Michelle Burke, naming the walleye the official state fish is no brainer. 
“This shouldn’t even have to be brought up again,” she said. “It should just be a full vote. We love eating perch. Perch tastes great, but I think what the walleye does for Ohio far exceeds any other fish.”

Mike DeWine’s new property tax reform working group met on Thursday to discuss relieving the burden homeowners are facing. The group has not been well received by some Republican lawmakers, who are not obligated to act upon the group’s suggestions.
The working group has 60 days to attempt to solve what business leader Pat Tiberi and former state Rep. Bill Seitz say is the most challenging issue in Ohio: property tax relief and reform.
“Our objective is to provide as much meaningful property tax relief as we can, particularly to those who need it most, and do it in a way that does not break the bank of the state of Ohio,” Seitz said during the meeting.
DeWine assigned the pair to co-chair the new group, which is made up of local officials and school superintendents. The group has a report deadline of September 30, when the state budget bill goes into effect.
The governor created this group as a way to discourage overrides to his vetoes.
House Speaker Matt Huffman (R-Lima) and the GOP have passed one override.
In the two-year state operating budget, DeWine vetoed restrictions on the ability to put emergency levies on the ballot or request an increase to a current levy. That provision eliminated levy replacements on property taxes for all political subdivisions. For schools, it would have prohibited them from imposing a fixed-sum emergency levy, a substitute emergency levy and a combined school district income tax and fixed-sum property tax levy. But the House narrowly passed an override on the provision, 61-28, just clearing the threshold of 60 votes.
The speaker also wants to override two other vetoes. However, he was unable to get the votes to override them.
DeWine removed a provision that would have allowed county budget commissions to unilaterally take money away from passed school levies if they find it “reasonably necessary.”
He also vetoed another that would have required that emergency and substitute tax levies, incremental growth levies, conversion levies, and the property tax portion of combined income tax and property tax levies be included in the 20-mill floor calculation for school funding purposes.
“Transparency, clarity — gives the opportunity for voters to know what they’re voting on, for locals to control taxes,” Huffman said.
The governor’s working group isn’t necessary, he said.
“The legislature has studied and acted … I’m not interested in participating in that,” Huffman said.
Neither is state Rep. David Thomas, who has been leading the override charge. He sighed when I brought it up to him.
“I don’t know exactly what else could be put out there that’s not already been said,” Thomas said.
Republicans have said that local governments should be responsible for providing property tax relief since appraisals have skyrocketed over the past few years.
Educators like John Patterson say that Ohio should bear the cost.
“The state has not done its best for local governments and for the school districts,” Patterson said.
Schools and municipalities have been underfunded while the wealthy have received tax cuts, Patterson said.
“I’m asking for a balance between property tax, sales tax, and obviously, income tax, for all taxing entities across the state of Ohio,” he said.
Veto overrides could lead to massive cuts, he said, to school programs and staffing.
Local law enforcement and firefighters could also face challenges due to levy restrictions.
“The FOP is very concerned about potential reductions in funding for law enforcement across Ohio and are looking forward to seeing the results of Governor DeWine’s task force,” said Jay McDonald, President of the FOP of Ohio. “Many jurisdictions across Ohio are barely able to provide basic services now, and we are interested in hearing any ideas on how those services will be sustained with a reduction in revenue.”
Tiberi said he knows that policy will need to have a balance, and every idea is on the table when coming up with relief.
“We have to figure this out because it’s important to our citizens, it’s important to our seniors, it’s important to our kids who we want to stay here, live here, buy a house here and create a business here,” Tiberi said.

(Getty Images)For the past two weeks now, I’ve gone to the movies.
That’s probably the first time in a half decade or so that I’ve actually chosen to buy tickets, make the drive out to the Lawrence multiplex, and watch two films on two successive Sundays. The first was the latest incarnation of Superman, the second a new take on the Fantastic Four.
I’m not actually the world’s biggest superhero movie fan. I enjoy them well enough, but I’ve sat out most recent entries. Too much spandex, too many capes, not enough human connection — except the punching and kicking kind. Yet the Fantastic Four and Superman both interested me enough to take the plunge. My husband, at one time a devoted comics reader, made the decision easier. We can always find something to talk about afterward, even if the movies are bad.
Yet neither movie was bad. And both had a lot to say about the world right now.
Sunday columnist Max McCoy covered Superman for the Reflector a couple of weeks ago, noting recent controversy about the hero’s immigration status. (He’s from the planet Krypton, after all, although raised right here in Kansas.) The Fantastic Four film reboots the first superhero team created for Marvel Comics, setting up a confrontation with cosmic baddie Galactus in alternate-history 1960s New York. Picture analogue robots, flying cars and sleek spaceships. It depicts a world in which nations eagerly work together to combat a common threat.
Wouldn’t it be nice to live in such a world? Wouldn’t it be nice to have that world inhabited by super-beings who work for the betterment of everyone?
Each film adopts a pointedly optimistic, earnest tone. My husband noted that either one would have been unthinkable 10 or 20 years ago, when irony was the coin of the realm.
These days, we want sincerity. Even in our escapist weekend entertainment, we want to believe that we can work together with our fellow human beings. We want to believe that folks among us can be, well, super. If you want wisecracks and sarcasm, you can pull up whatever social media platform you choose.
The films put me in mind of another Kansas Reflector columnist, Mark McCormick. Last week, he argued that attacks on the U.S. Department of Education undermine the common good.
“Increasing waves of politicians exalt qualities that should disqualify them as public officials: a mistrust of government, demonizing opponents, and supporting private schools with public money,” Mark wrote. “These qualities should stand as barriers to candidacy, not bona fides.“
Both the Fantastic Four and Superman devote themselves to the common good.
That’s why they’re superheroes — not because of their powers, but because of their morals. They serve humanity. They serve their country. They serve one another. The Fantastic Four literally contains a family: Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic) and Sue Storm (the Invisible Woman) are a married couple, while Johnny Storm (the Human Torch) is Sue’s brother and Ben Grimm (the Thing) is a close friend. During the film, Reed and Sue welcome their son, Franklin, into the world.
“They are parents first,” director Matt Shakman told Variety. “They are scientists and explorers second. And they’re superheroes only when they have to be. I come at this as a dad and as a husband. That’s what makes it so special to me.”
Every summer brings superhero films. Almost every superhero film brings battles between good and evil. Yet these films, and this summer, suggest to me that both filmmakers and audiences yearn for more than thrills. They want clarity. They want warm, nurturing, uncomplicated goodness.
Unfortunately, that’s not the world right now.
We live in a state and nation riven by partisan divides. Figuring out the right course in a shattered political landscape can flummox the most informed among us. Rather than the bright clarity of the movies, alternate realities where we know good from bad and right from wrong, where villains helpfully sneer and snarl at heroes, we have to make the best-informed decisions we can. We make decisions without knowing the outcome, only hoping for the best.
Superheroes appear in comic books on and screen. Those of us navigating troubled times have to find that heroism, moral clarity and dedication to others within ourselves.
We may not fly. But we can soar.

(Photo by Jnaiah Price)Twenty-eight-year-old Michaela Bonner has been working 12-hour shifts as an emergency medical technician in Norfolk, Virginia, for the past four years, while attending and paying for college to finish her prerequisites for medical school.
But now that President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending law bars students from borrowing more than $50,000 annually in unsubsidized federal loans for medical school, Bonner is worried her dream of becoming a doctor is financially out of reach.
“I get told, ‘Well, we really need you. We have a physician shortage, and you’ve done all this work leading up to this point,’ and that’s true as well, and it’s not that I want to quit,” Bonner said in a recent interview. “But there are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can’t take out the full cost of living through loans.”
The tax and spending law includes provisions that significantly alter the student loan process for higher education. The law halts current student loan repayment plans for loans that are granted on or after July 1, 2026. On that date, the law also terminates Grad PLUS loans, which have helped people pay for their higher education degrees and total cost of attendance. Current borrowers will be grandfathered in.
The federal law gives current borrowers enrolled in loan repayment plans for students based on income — such as those plans known as SAVE or IBR — until July 1, 2028, to switch to a new plan. Interest collection will resume Aug. 1 for students enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE plan.
At the same time, medical or law school students hoping to get unsubsidized federal loans — in which the borrower is responsible for paying the interest at all times rather than the government — will only be able to borrow $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in areas such as history or philosophy have a $100,000 lifetime cap.
The average yearly cost of medical school for the 2024-25 academic year ranged from around $42,000 to $72,000, depending on whether the school was private or public and whether the student was a resident or nonresident, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Some congressional Republicans say that students need to be working harder to pay for higher education, like medical school, on their own. Others say the caps put the onus back on colleges and universities to rein in the rising cost of tuition. But critics of this legislation say the loan caps are only going to harm students, especially from lower-income backgrounds, and will exacerbate physician shortages.
In recent years states have tried to ease physician shortages by implementing various policy solutions. Since 2023, at least nine states have made it easier for doctors trained in other countries to get medical licenses. States have also participated in interstate licensing compacts, allowing nurses and physician assistants to travel across state lines to work, so long as they are licensed in one state within the compact.
For student loan relief, more than 20 states have enacted legislation to address student loan forgiveness, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a group that tracks states policies. Georgia passed a measure that will expand a cancelable loan program for physicians working in rural and underserved areas. Idaho also created the Rural Nursing Loan Repayment Program, offering nurses $25,000 in forgivable loans after three years of service in a rural area.
States are making it easier for physician assistants to work across state lines

McKenzie Richards, a health care policy fellow at the conservative think tank Cicero Institute who has been studying the pace of physician shortages, told Stateline that the national physician shortage could potentially exceed 100,000 by 2034. At the end of 2024 that projected number was closer to 64,000 physicians.
Richards said states will be looking toward more policy solutions should the student loan changes exacerbate physician shortages.
“We know what’s going to be happening coming down the line in just five years, so I think policies that states can adopt to get out of this are really important to be looking at now,” she said.
“The hope is that by capping [federal loans], it will encourage schools to lower tuition prices,” Richards added. “Then maybe they need to be admitting more students, which would have a great downstream effect for getting more doctors through.”
Other students will be in the same boat, said Lesley Turner, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Chicago and an economist.
“This is going to hit some students worse than others,” Turner told Stateline. “Those [students] in more expensive programs tend to borrow more, and so for those students they will need to return to private student loans or other ways of financing their graduate education.”
Many students were already questioning their capacity to go to medical school before the student loan caps, said Shannon Jimenez, dean of the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine.
“I expect that this bill, this cap, is going to push people out of primary care and into specialties to help pay off those higher interest rate loans,” Jimenez told Stateline. She added that caps will likely deter students from lower socioeconomic statuses from going into primary care — important in places like Arkansas, where she says there is a “maldistribution of physicians.”
“Many schools like us try to attract those students, because they’re more likely to go into primary care and serve in underserved areas. So it’s going to tie our hands in a lot of ways.”
Amid mental health crisis, new compact allows social workers to practice across state lines

Large states and more rural states will feel the gaps more deeply, said Richards, of the Cicero Institute. Louisiana, for example, is projected to be short almost 5,000 doctors from a variety of specialties by 2030, including close to 400 primary care doctors. Already more than a third of Louisiana physicians are close to retirement age — similar to the situation in neighboring Arkansas.
As for whether schools will just be able to lower tuition, Jimenez said, “it makes no sense.”
“We still function in a somewhat market-driven economy and have to compete with other schools around us, so our cost is based mostly on what we have to pay our faculty, and that’s not going to go down,” she said. The annual cost of attendance at her school is between $80,000 and $85,000.
Bonner, the EMT, holds a political communications degree from Regent University and now is studying biomedical sciences at Old Dominion University. She already has $20,000 in loans, she said, and for the rest of college tuition, she has paid out of pocket. Since she’s supporting herself, she hasn’t been able to save much.
She’d planned to take the medical school entrance exam next spring, but now worries about how she’d pay for living expenses while attending. “Medical school scheduling doesn’t allow for working, so you have to take out loans for living expenses,” she said.
“A lot of people, I feel, would be panicked if you had worked for eight to 10 years of your life and found out that all the systems that you were banking on in a really academically challenging space are disappearing,” Bonner said.
“I don’t see a path forward for certain, but I’m fighting to make one.”

Twenty-eight-year-old Michaela Bonner has been working 12-hour shifts as an emergency medical technician in Norfolk, Virginia, for the past four years, while attending and paying for college to finish her prerequisites for medical school.
But now that President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending law bars students from borrowing more than $50,000 annually in unsubsidized federal loans for medical school, Bonner is worried her dream of becoming a doctor is financially out of reach.
“I get told, ‘Well, we really need you. We have a physician shortage, and you’ve done all this work leading up to this point,’ and that’s true as well, and it’s not that I want to quit,” Bonner said in a recent interview. “But there are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can’t take out the full cost of living through loans.”
The tax and spending law includes provisions that significantly alter the student loan process for higher education. The law halts current student loan repayment plans for loans that are granted on or after July 1, 2026. On that date, the law also terminates Grad PLUS loans, which have helped people pay for their higher education degrees and total cost of attendance. Current borrowers will be grandfathered in.
The federal law gives current borrowers enrolled in loan repayment plans for students based on income — such as those plans known as SAVE or IBR — until July 1, 2028, to switch to a new plan. Interest collection will resume Aug. 1 for students enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE plan.
At the same time, medical or law school students hoping to get unsubsidized federal loans — in which the borrower is responsible for paying the interest at all times rather than the government — will only be able to borrow $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in areas such as history or philosophy have a $100,000 lifetime cap.










There are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can't take out the full cost of living through loans.


– Michaela Bonner, aspiring medical student


The average yearly cost of medical school for the 2024-25 academic year ranged from around $42,000 to $72,000, depending on whether the school was private or public and whether the student was a resident or nonresident, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Some congressional Republicans say that students need to be working harder to pay for higher education, like medical school, on their own. Others say the caps put the onus back on colleges and universities to rein in the rising cost of tuition. But critics of this legislation say the loan caps are only going to harm students, especially from lower-income backgrounds, and will exacerbate physician shortages.
In recent years states have tried to ease physician shortages by implementing various policy solutions. Since 2023, at least nine states have made it easier for doctors trained in other countries to get medical licenses. States have also participated in interstate licensing compacts, allowing nurses and physician assistants to travel across state lines to work, so long as they are licensed in one state within the compact.
For student loan relief, more than 20 states have enacted legislation to address student loan forgiveness, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a group that tracks states policies. Georgia passed a measure that will expand a cancelable loan program for physicians working in rural and underserved areas. Idaho also created the Rural Nursing Loan Repayment Program, offering nurses $25,000 in forgivable loans after three years of service in a rural area.

More than 63 million Americans are caregivers for a family member with complex medical needs, a 20 million increase over the past decade, according to a new report.
But state policies, workplaces and the American health system haven’t kept up with this surge in family caregiving responsibilities, said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, a physician and the CEO of the AARP, which released the report with the National Alliance for Caregiving, a nonprofit policy and research organization.
“Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences, draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing,” Minter-Jordan told reporters on a call this week.
One of the biggest reasons for the surge in family caregivers is that Americans are living longer, yet they’re not necessarily healthier. There’s a 12-year gap between the average number of years that Americans live and the number of years they’re healthy.
The caregiving role typically involves helping a family member with daily tasks like bathing, dressing and eating. But more than half of caregivers also perform more complex medical tasks, such as managing catheters or administering injections, the report found.
A growing number of caregivers are so-called “sandwich caregivers” — parents caring for their children as well as for an adult family member, such as an aging parent. About 17 million people are sandwich caregivers, compared with 11 million a decade ago. And most caregivers are also working a job.
And while the bulk of caregiving still falls on women, 40% of American caregivers are men.
Some states have heeded the growing calls for action.
Earlier this year, Maine lawmakers created a state program to provide respite care, which includes services such as adult day care that give family caregivers a temporary break.
Also this year, Tennessee extended its pilot program that provides respite care for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, and also passed a bipartisan bill that directs the state Medicaid program to develop guidelines to allow family caregivers to be paid for their work.
Last year, Nebraska passed a tax credit for family caregivers; Oklahoma passed a similar law the year before. And while the United States is one of few countries that doesn’t mandate paid family leave at the federal level, 13 states and the District of Columbia have established their own paid family leave rules.
Meanwhile, the historic cuts to Medicaid enacted as part of the GOP’s Big, Beautiful Bill Act will shift health costs to states, leaving experts worried that family caregivers could lose Medicaid-funded services they rely on.

Like the rest of the nation, North Carolina faces some enormous policy challenges these days. Thanks to sustained disinvestments in an array of core public services, our state is fast becoming coarser, less healthy and more divided.
Unfortunately, Republican legislative leaders seem unconcerned. Rather than working with Governor Josh Stein to tackle our numerous outsized problems, they spent the recent legislative session advancing divisive culture war bills and failing even to pass a new state budget for the fiscal year that began July 1.
And now, rather than honestly owning up to and addressing their shortcomings, they’re returning to Raleigh this week to double down on them with a plan to override Stein’s vetoes of several destructive and hyper-partisan bills. And the overdue budget? It’s nowhere in sight.
The bottom line: Caring and thinking lawmakers of both parties should take a stand against this failed and divisive strategy by sustaining Stein’s vetoes and sending a message to legislative leaders that it’s past time to end the games and work together for the good of all North Carolinians.

(Mario Tama/Getty Images)No reading of tea leaves or consulting the crystals appears necessary to remind us that the 2026 election is in full swing … at mid-year of 2025. Candidates are announcing intentions, editorials are being written, and public polling is afoot, the first of which for me landed in my text messages last week.
With a growing number of Democratic and a pair of Republican hats in the ring, Nebraskans in the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District will have a bountiful slate of hopefuls from which to choose as Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon’s successor. U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., will be challenged by registered nonpartisan Dan Osborn. Gov. Jim Pillen has announced his bid for reelection. Those willing to run in this political universe deserve some respect, too.
Some in the chattering class — this space included — have on occasion referred to these days, weeks and months as “silly season,” a snarky broadside not without basis. For details, check some of the frivolity that has accompanied recent campaigns when we set about practicing the bedrock principle of a democratic republic: representative government. Surely the next political contests will provide an intermittent inanity or perhaps some full-on foolishness. 
But make no mistake. What’s at stake this time is anything but silly.
Serious season
This “season” is as serious as one has been. That’s because the shibboleths are correct: Elections have consequences, and we get the government we choose. Even a cursory reading of the morning headlines or a map of the republic’s current misdirection underscores the point that the nation has arrived at a critical intersection.
Election “issues” include the usual suspects: taxes, inflation, immigration, education, foreign policy and jobs. Those and others such as climate change and international trade need to be parsed, debated and delineated among those vying to represent Nebraskans. 
Given the rocky road on which we find ourselves, however, at this juncture in the nascent campaigns, only two issues have worked their way to the top of my mind. Whether they will get any “play” in the 24/7 phalanx of media that hops aboard these long, expensive journeys to a seat in Congress or the state’s corner office remains to be seen. Pro tip: Don’t hold your breath.
First is perhaps more of a group exercise. I’m wondering who, if any, among candidates — incumbents or hopefuls — share the concern that Congress has ceded its co-equal status as a full and functioning branch of government? Or are they comfortable with governing via executive order? See DOGE’s rampage and ransacking for evidence of such acquiescence.
Numbers look off
The numbers are in, too. According to GovTrack.us, Congress has enacted just 27 pieces of legislation since raising its aggregate right hand in early January. Despite the GOP having a majority in the House and Senate, that’s the fewest number of bills in the first six months since the 103rd Congress in 1993, when Democratic President Bill Clinton also enjoyed a political advantage in both houses. 
Nor does passing the Big Ugly in early July make up for the meandering pace of problem solving. All of which adds to the incredulity of House Speaker Mike Johnson extending the August recess while he appears to need time to mitigate the House’s role in a scandalous tempest starting to howl. Less production apparently equals longer recesses.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Second, and of even more importance for a candidate to consider than undoing Congressional capitulation or unchallenged conformity, is whether he or she, as an elected official, would be willing to stand in the face of complete horse hockey and demand that when we do the people’s business, we do it with the facts, not conspiracy theories, internet rumors or simple, bald-faced lies. 
Case in point: Did any of Nebraska’s quintet of representatives publicly question that the country’s director of national intelligence, at a regularly scheduled press conference in the White House briefing room, accused a former presidential candidate of abusing prescription drugs using information from Russian spies? That was also about the time, contrary to evidence, the president was trying to sell the snake oil that a former president should be indicted for treason.
Nebraska used to enjoy a reputation for producing independent political thinkers, a feather in our caps. As we navigate this election season, I’ll be listening for those kinds of voices as taxes, inflation, immigration, education, foreign policy, jobs and more dominate our electoral discussions.
Given the seriousness of this election, however, I’ll mostly be listening for voices who want to return Congress to its full power and who will speak and respect facts, evidence and the truth.

(Screenshot via Facebook page of HOMES Inc.)The groundbreaking Wednesday for a new neighborhood in the Floyd County seat of Prestonsburg wasn’t just a ceremony for Tom Manning-Beavin. The crews working for his nonprofit had already started digging trenches to pour concrete foundations of future homes. 
“My crew leaders were talking to the city building inspector as we were leaving, coordinating the inspection of those footers,” said Manning-Beavin, president and CEO of Frontier Housing in Morehead. “We’ll pour and just start rocking and rolling.” 
The quick pace Manning-Beavin describes is one that nonprofit housing builders in Eastern Kentucky have tried to keep up in the three years since catastrophic flooding inundated Eastern Kentucky communities in the summer of 2022. The aftermath of that disaster ruined thousands of homes and killed dozens of people, and the region has grappled with more devastating floods since, including in February. 
It also has brought about collaborations between Kentucky state government, nonprofit builders and local officials to develop several “higher ground” communities out of flood plains. 
Newly built homes have been going up, some on former strip mines, and flood survivors are slowly starting to move in. Housing developments are still being planned. In Floyd County, the planned neighborhood called New Hope Estates will have 34 homes funded by federal disaster funds previously allocated. 
Despite builders trying to ramp up construction, the need for housing is both vast and urgent.

Ashley Tackett-Laferty, D-Martin. (Provided via Flickr, Office of Gov. Andy Beshear)
Scott McReynolds, the executive director of the Perry County-based Housing Development Alliance, said his nonprofit has built roughly 400 homes over roughly 30 years. In  past years, the nonprofit would typically consider 20 homes built in a year as a “great year.” 
He now expects to build around 60 this year, with a total reaching up to 140 over two years. 
“We’re producing at a scale that just a few years ago was not conceivable. And so on the one hand, I think this is a great push,” McReynolds said. “On the other hand, I don’t know that it’s sufficient.” 
Fahe, a network of more than 50 nonprofits across Appalachia including the Housing Development Alliance and Frontier Housing, rallied around the slogan “Housing Can’t Wait” in the wake of the 2022 floods to call on the Kentucky legislature to allocate immediate housing funds for the region. It’s evolved in the years since into a call to action to address the broader housing shortage across Appalachia, setting an ambitious goal of building or rehabilitating 60,000 homes through 2030 across the multi-state region that Fahe serves. That would double the pace of housing work that the Fahe network does. 
Reynolds said his nonprofit’s calculations, utilizing census data on housing and income, estimate that about 40% of the tens of thousands people across the primary counties they serve of Breathitt, Leslie, Perry and Knott are “inadequately housed.” He said that can include people experiencing homelessness, people living in substandard housing with structural issues or people paying a disproportionate amount of funding on rent or a mortgage. 
“If that number is even remotely accurate, then we need thousands of affordable units. And even with the flood recovery, we’re building hundreds,” McReynolds said. 
Collaborations building communities
One success story is just outside the Letcher County seat of Whitesburg — eight homes on top of a hillside for flood survivors called Thompson Branch. It’s the second planned “higher ground” community in the region to finish construction, according to the office of Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear. 
Seth Long, executive director of the nonprofit housing builder HOMES Inc., that led the construction of the community, said one of the flood survivors his nonprofit is trying to get into a Thompson Branch home has been living in a 16-foot trailer since the 2022 flood. 
“When I walked him through the house, which is a modest ranch-style house, he was like, “My whole trailer could fit in this one room. He said, ‘You don’t know what it’s like to live three years in a trailer,’” Long said. “He hasn’t been able to move one way or another because there’s nothing that’s available.” 
The homes at Thompson Branch also feature solar panels and an energy efficient design, a part of Home Inc.’s efforts to greatly reduce electricity costs for residents in a region that struggles with some of the state’s highest electricity bills. One of the flood survivors who moved into Thompson Branch, he said, was “tickled to death” to have an electricity bill of only $22.58. 
Another statistic that sticks with Long: More than 500 households in Letcher County have used  federal buyout programs to move out of the flood plain after the 2022 and 2025 floods. Those are hundreds of houses that aren’t being replaced in his community. 
“We’re still yet, three years later, feeling a very sharp impact,” Long said. “That federal investment is now just really practically hitting the ground to where builders are building houses back.”
The work of building homes is just getting underway for Long and other builders. There’s a planned “high-ground” community of 115 homes in Jenkins that’s moving forward. HOMES Inc. is also partnering with the Letcher County government on a few housing projects including turning an old high school building in Fleming-Neon into rental units. They’re also one of several housing nonprofits involved with a higher ground community called Chestnut Ridge in Knott County.

Frontier Housing, the Morehead nonprofit, is also launching a factory in Martin County to build customizable modular homes that it hopes can ramp up the production of housing in multiple Eastern Kentucky communities. 
Building out the infrastructure to serve these homes and securing and developing the land has taken years, nonprofit housing builders told the Lantern. Long said the work of actually building the homes is “just hitting the ground.” 
Builders including Long will still be tapping into the remaining pool of nearly $300 million in federal disaster housing funds allocated after the 2022 floods. But builders believe more investment is needed to keep building on the boom of construction. 
Fahe and other nonprofit housing builders came before the Kentucky legislature last year asking for $200 million to be placed into state housing trust funds to pay for housing construction and rehabilitation. Republican leadership, as they were crafting a two-year state budget, declined to make that investment and questioned the capacity of housing developers to effectively use that money  in a two-year timeframe.
Long said the progress nonprofit housing builders have made in three years shows they do have the capacity to build — if given the resources. 
“One of the things that have limited capacity has been property to build and investment to develop that property. If those things are in place, we can build as many houses that are needed,” Long said. “This kind of momentum, this kind of investment is what moves the needle. It gives impact. It can get attention. It can house people.” 
Floods and funding
Many aspects of future housing work are uncertain, such as how to plan for the next flood or storm. The trauma of going through a major flood can remain with people. 
“It is hard to heal from that,” said Courtney Rhoades, an organizer at the nonprofit legal group Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center in Whitesburg. She mentioned the anxiety of dealing with flash flood warnings earlier this month and hearing the news of destructive flooding in Pike County earlier this year. 
There needs to be more affordable housing, she said, but it needs to be done in a way that includes the input of communities. That includes people with personal connections to their land. 
“I think the ‘higher-ground’ communities is great in the sense of if people want to move,” Rhoades said. “You also need to find solutions for people who don’t want to move away.” 
She believes the construction of the Thompson Branch community incorporated local feedback well, given its close proximity near Whitesburg for people who live and work locally. 
Another question for the future: what will happen under a new administration to federal housing programs that builders rely on.
The Kentucky Housing Corporation, the quasi-governmental agency that allocates federal housing funding, has spoken out against a Trump administration budget proposal that the agency argues could cut federal housing monies, including programs for housing construction, received in Kentucky by 44%. 
“At a minimum, it’s chaotic at the federal level,” said Jim King, the CEO of Fahe. “We don’t know what the commitment of federal resources that have traditionally supported this kind of work will look like.” 
He said Fahe’s nonprofit members are instead leaning into private philanthropy and funding to meet their longer-term housing goals in lieu of uncertain federal and state support. While he considers the Kentucky governor and the Kentucky legislature to be “great partners” when involved, he isn’t going to be limited by their funding choices.

However, these low performances are not anomalies — but the status quo, highlighting the state’s prolonged struggle to reverse its affordability issues.   
In early July, CNBC released its annual “America’s Top States for Business” report in which the Constitution State finished middle-of-the-pack, placing 28th overall. The top five were North Carolina, Texas, Florida, Virginia, and Ohio. 
Despite Connecticut improving its overall ranking by four positions from last year, driven mostly by leaps in subcategories like ‘workforce,’ the state still lags in critical areas such as ‘Economy,’ ‘Cost of Doing Business,’ and ‘Cost of Living.’ (See Table One) 
TABLE ONE: CONNECTICUT’S CNBC RESULTS 
CATEGORY 2025 GRADE 2025 RANK 2024 RANK DIFFERENCE Economy D+ 38 39 +1 Infrastructure C 33 29 +4 Workforce B 8 20 +12 Cost of Doing Business D+ 44 43 -1 Business Friendliness C 35 39 +4 Quality of Life B 5 9 +4 Technology & Innovation C+ 19 25 +6 Education A- 5 4 -1 Access to Capital C+ 16 22 +6 Cost of Living D+ 37 34 -3 
Connecticut’s subcategory scores from CNBC are consistent with other national and local surveys released over the past year, indicating a concerning pattern.
WalletHub ranked Connecticut 49th for starting a business; and the Tax Foundation placed the state 47th for the most burdensome tax climate for the tenth consecutive year. The CT Mirror also recently asserted that while Connecticut boasts high average salaries, its cost of living is among the nation’s highest.  
Meanwhile, earlier this year, Realtor.com listed Connecticut third among the states with the highest median property taxes. As the real estate website noted, “Overall, Connecticut residents faced some of the largest property tax increases in the last decade. …Bridgeport, Stamford, and Norwalk are paying some of the highest.”  
When compared to other New England states, New Hampshire eclipsed the Constitution State with the second highest median property tax. Vermont had the lowest rate in the region ranking 33rd. (See Table TWO) 
TABLE TWO: HIGHEST MEDIAN PROPERTY TAX 
STATE MEDIAN PROPERTY TAX AMOUNT New Jersey $9,413 New Hampshire $7,715 Connecticut $6,944 Washington $6,338 New York $6,096 Texas $5,860 California $5,248 Massachusetts $5,142 Rhode Island $5,111 District of Columbia $5,087 
High electric and gas rates, coupled with Connecticut’s ranking among the worst states to retire, exacerbate its affordability crisis — which may endure without curbing government spending and regulations. 
Yet fiscal restraint appears unlikely. Lawmakers are aiming to loosen the state’s fiscal guardrails — bipartisan reforms passed in 2017 to limit the growth in government spending and stabilize the state’s finances — in a rumored special session this fall. Indeed, lawmakers already broke several of the guardrails this past legislative session, despite the reforms’ effectiveness. Since enacted, they have reversed decades of pension underfunding, improved Connecticut’s creditworthiness, and saved the state more than $170 million annually in reduced pension debt payments.  
And despite declaring to be a “strong believer in the spending cap,” Gov. Ned Lamont and lawmakers exceeded the constitutional limit for the first time in nearly two decades to address anticipated Medicaid shortfalls from the federal government. 
Increased government spending, often funded by higher taxes, undermines economic vitality. Indeed, over the years, Connecticut has lost numerous corporate headquarters fleeing to other states (e.g., General Electric, Aetna, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, even LEGO) mostly driven by cost of business expenses.  
Connecticut’s business community has expressed a lack of overwhelming confidence in the state’s economic outlook. In a 2024 survey conducted by the Connecticut Business & Industry Association (CBIA), 86% of business leaders felt the cost of doing business in Connecticut was increasing; and only 8% believed the business climate was improving, versus 39% who said it was declining.  
Although Connecticut’s GDP grew by 2.6% last year, the state economy is not particularly on sound footing, contracting for the “first time in more than three years in the first quarter of 2025 amid tariff concerns, slower consumer spending, and ongoing volatility in the state’s jobs market,” according to CBIA.  
These circumstances would not be as harsh if Connecticut residents received quality government services in return for higher property taxes, helping fund local government operations and schools — yet this isn’t the case. A March 2025 WalletHub report ranks the Constitution State 37th in the country for taxpayer return on investment.  
In short, residents are paying more for less services.  
Further tax increases to fund programs will likely worsen affordability. Higher taxes raise property costs, exacerbating cost-of-living burdens and driving residents and businesses to more affordable states. This vicious cycle leads to the foreshadowed conclusion: a reduction in the tax base. 
Ultimately, Connecticut’s rankings are unlikely to improve without fiscal discipline. All roads to recovery and affordability stem from government restraint, which had once saved the state from a budgetary crisis. 
Lawmakers must resist short-term spending increases, prioritizing fiscal responsibility to ensure a more prosperous future.

It was a symbolic show of solidarity with the real Gaza Freedom Flotilla boats, which have tried to bring humanitarian relief to the two million Palestinians in Gaza – almost always without success and on one occasion resulting in the killing of 10 crew members by Israel.  
One boat – the Madleen – was boarded by Israel in international waters on June 8. The entire crew was arrested and deported from Israel, and its cargo impounded. It only garnered as much publicity as it did because the climate and human rights activist Greta Thunberg was on board.

Another Flotilla ship, the Handala, was intercepted by Israel July 27 in international waters. Among the humanitarian supplies it was carrying was baby formula for starving babies in Gaza.
Besides raising awareness of the ongoing genocide there, the New Haven Freedom Flotilla was raising money for the World Central Kitchen (WCK). It had been feeding tens of thousands of starving Gazans until it was forced to stop for seven weeks due to Israel’s total blockade from March to May, after unilaterally breaking the second ceasefire since October 7. WCK started up operations in late June, but announced on July 20 that it was shutting down again because they had run out of supplies, since Israel is preventing 3,000 trucks from entering the territory.
Our kayakers paddled just outside the Lighthouse Point swimming area, eight of them each displaying a letter that spelled out FEED GAZA. We landed near the lighthouse where we were greeted by dozens of supporters, singing songs and holding banners that demanded, “Permanent Ceasefire Now,” “U.S.: Stop Arming Israel” and “Stop Starving Gaza – Stop ICE – Free Palestine.”

We shared watermelon and got acquainted, since many of us did not know each other and people had come after learning about the event from various lists and social media.
This was a unique action, and it was a local angle on a horrible international tragedy and crime, funded with our tax dollars. It was, therefore, newsworthy. I sent out the news advisory to the usual suspects, but didn’t get much pick-up. One TV station called to say they were planning to come, unless “breaking news” intervened. Then – guess what?! – “breaking news” intervened.
I guess the fact that Israel’s murderous assault on Gaza had been going on for 644 days at that point made it old news.
The confirmed death toll in Gaza so far is more than 58,000 souls, not counting all those buried in the rubble, with some estimates in the hundreds of thousands. And here’s an almost unbelievable twist. Since the U.S. stopped funding UNRWA – the U.N. agency responsible for meeting the needs of displaced Palestinians since 1947 – and since Israel kicked UNRWA out of Gaza, a new U.S.- and Israel-supported organization, the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), is in charge of feeding the starving populace. 
So far, according to the U.N., at least 875 Gazans have been killed trying to access food, the vast majority at the four sites operated by GHF. (UNRWA ran 400 community-based sites.) According to a report on the Israeli news site Ha’aretz, some Israeli soldiers have revealed that they were ordered to shoot to kill unarmed people who posed no threat. When Hamas and other fighters entered Israel on October 7, they massacred 736 Israeli civilians. So, more Palestinians have been killed trying to get food than Israeli civilians were killed on Oct. 7.
When Israel broke the ceasefire in March, I was filled with anger and despair. I’d been holding signs and banners since mid-October of 2023, but none of my messages seemed adequate to the enormity of Israel’s crimes. It came to me to make a sign that reads, “Palestinians are human.” It’s by far my most popular message. I get dozens of horn honks and thumbs up whenever I hold it at busy intersections. Someone even blew me a kiss.
The American people do not agree with sending billions in military aid to Israel to destroy Gaza. If you agree that two million people – including a million children – do not deserve to starve, you can help by donating to WCK. And if you think the more than $350 million from Connecticut taxpayers currently going to Israel to carry out its atrocities could be put to better use, contact your federal elected officials to demand that they turn off the spigot. And tell them to demand that Israel allow the trucks stuck at the border into Gaza.
Every day the death toll from starvation rises, one more proof of Israel’s genocidal intentions.

This story was updated at 10:38 p.m.
Vermont Green Football Club’s magical season will continue next week in the USL League Two national championship after a 4-2 penalty kick shootout victory over Dothan United Sunday night.
Owen O’Malley netted the Green’s fourth goal in the shootout, punching the club’s ticket to the national championship next Saturday — and sending the sold-out crowd at the University of Vermont’s Virtue Field into a raucous celebration. 
“I do it for the fans, man, you know?” O’Malley said. “I just love these guys so much.”
Goalkeeper Niklas Herceg made two dramatic saves in the shootout to help secure the win.
“The reaction [to me] saving the penalties was incredible. It gives you more energy to maybe save the next one again,” Herceg said.
The Green and Alabama-based Dothan battled through an evenly matched, scoreless 90 minutes in regulation. Vermont Green seemed to have the edge in the two 15-minute extra time halves. But despite a few chances, Vermont couldn’t find the back of the net.
“At the end of the day, we deserved to win,” said Vermont Green FC Head Coach Chris Taylor.
The 2025 season has been the club’s highest-achieving by far, with a 16-match undefeated record, a first-place finish in the northeast division, and an ongoing deep run into the playoffs. In 2024, the Green placed third in its division and won two playoff matches, but were ultimately knocked out by the nationally top-ranked Seacoast United of New Hampshire.
This year, the club will play for the national title — and for the growing fanbase in Vermont.
“These boys, they’re special,” Taylor said. “It’s a humbling experience, I would say, for me to see a community like this support our team.”

(Courtesy photo/Arkansas State Police)Arkansas law enforcement officials are seeking the public’s help in finding a suspect in the killing of a couple in their 40s at Devil’s Den State Park on Saturday.
Clinton David Brink, 43, and Cristen Amanda Brink, 41, of Prairie Grove were hiking with their two daughters when they were attacked, according to an Arkansas State Police press release on Sunday. The girls, ages 7 and 9, were not injured and are safe with family members, the release said. The family had recently moved to Arkansas from another state, state police said.
ASP was notified of a double homicide at the Washington County park about 2:40 p.m. Saturday, and the couple was found dead on a walking rail, the release said.  The agency’s Criminal Investigation Division is investigating the suspected homicide.
Investigators asked that anyone who visited the park Saturday check cellphone photos and video and GoPro camera footage for possible images of the suspect. State police asked, however, that anyone with photos or video not post footage on social media, as this could jeopardize the investigation.
“Anyone with images of the suspect, information about the suspect or his whereabouts should contact ASP Troop L at (479) 751-6663,” the release said.
State police on Sunday described the suspect as a white male of medium build wearing a long-sleeved shirt with the sleeves rolled up dark pants, a dark ballcap and sunglasses. He was carrying a black backpack and wearing fingerless gloves, according to state police’s description.
He was seen driving toward a park exit in a black, four-door sedan, possibly a Mazda with the license plate covered by black tape, the ASP press release said. He may have traveled on Arkansas Highway 170 or 229 near the park, state police said.
The area where the couple was found remains cordoned off and secured by law enforcement, the release said. The park’s website on Sunday said all trails remain closed.
Located in a remote, rural and rugged area with thick vegetation and no cellphone service near West Fork, the park is a popular hiking and mountain biking destination.
Shea Lewis, secretary of the Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage and Tourism, issued a statement saying, “We are deeply saddened by the tragic events that occurred at Devil’s Den State Park. … The safety of our visitors and staff is our highest priority, and we are working closely with Arkansas State Police and various law enforcement officials as the investigation continues.”
Col. Mike Hagar, director of State Police and secretary of Public Safety, said his agency is working with local, state and federal law enforcement to apprehend the suspect.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ASP-patrol-car-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-27 21:56:45.008145

(Photo by Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)Ninety-six percent of all registered voters in Idaho believe that public lands should remain in public hands, according to a new poll paid for by Conservation Voters for Idaho.
The poll was conducted in the aftermath of a federal proposal from U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, to make millions of acres of public land in the U.S., including in Idaho, available to be sold off.
The poll specifically asked Idaho voters questions about Idaho public lands and who they support in Idaho’s 2026 U.S. Senate race.
Alexis Pickering, executive director of Conservation Voters for Idaho, said she has never in her career seen Idahoans from all sides of the political spectrum unite behind a single issue like they have behind public lands this year.
“It really is clear that voters are unified in keeping public lands in public hands,” Pickering said in a phone interview Wednesday.
“It demonstrates that Idaho voters are very cognizant of this fight right now,” Pickering said. “They are very engaged, and they are not going to sit this out.”
More than 60% of the land in Idaho is public land of some form.
Idaho’s registered voters are clear on their support for public access to public lands
The polling firm Change Research conducted the poll among 1,027 registered Idaho voters from July 15-17. The margin of error was 3.2%, according to Change Research.
One poll question asked voters, “Did you support or oppose the amendment to sell off over 3 million acres of public land across 11 Western states, including Idaho?” – with 87% of respondents saying they opposed it.
Battles over public lands loom even after sell-off proposal fails

Another poll question asked voters which statement came closest to their opinion:

Public lands in Idaho, where people enjoy outdoor activities such as fishing, hunting, hiking, camping, and biking, should remain public and be protected so that everyone can keep enjoying them.
Public lands in Idaho, where people enjoy outdoor activities such as fishing, hunting, hiking, camping, and biking, should be made available for purchase and private ownership.

Ninety-six percent of Idaho registered voters said public lands should remain public, including 97% of registered Democrats and 95% of registered Republicans, the poll found.
Lee withdrew his amendment to sell public lands after a public backlash and three of Idaho’s four members of Congress provided public opposition from within the Republican Party to selling public lands.
Even though the public lands amendment was withdrawn, Pickering said the issue isn’t going away. She said Conservation Voters for Idaho plans to highlight public lands as a central issue and continue to hold elected officials accountable for keeping public lands public.
Pickering also said the public is deeply invested in the issue and knows Lee could file another proposal to sell public lands. She compared the proposal to sell public lands to waking a sleeping bear.
“Now that they have woken the bear, it will be really hard to get that bear back in hibernation mode,” Pickering said.
How Idaho’s congressional delegation responded to public lands proposal
Three of Idaho’s four members of Congress, U.S. Sens. Jim Risch and Mike Crapo and U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, all R-Idaho, provided public Republican opposition to the proposal to sell off public lands, the Sun previously reported.
On June 20, Risch and Crapo, both announced they were opposed to the provision in the budget reconciliation process to sell off public lands. Simpson co-sponsored the Public Lands in Public Hands Act.
Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher, R-Idaho, opposed the Public Lands in Public Hands Act, the Utah News Dispatch reported.
In a phone interview with the Idaho Capital Sun earlier this month, Fulcher said, “public land should remain public, but the control, management should be local stakeholders, not the federal government.”
Polling data shows that Risch received a 10% bump in support among all registered voters after they learned Risch provided opposition to the proposal to sell off public lands, up from 41% to 51%. Among registered Republican voters only, Risch’s support increased from 60% to 72% after voters learned Risch provided opposition to the proposal to sell off public lands.
The poll only asked voters about Risch’s upcoming U.S. Senate race, where he faces re-election in 2026. The poll did not ask about Crapo, Simpson or Fulcher, Pickering said.

As the planet gets hotter and its reservoirs shrink and its glaciers melt, people have increasingly drilled into a largely ungoverned, invisible cache of fresh water: the vast, hidden pools found deep underground.
Now, a new study that examines the world’s total supply of fresh water — accounting for its rivers and rain, ice and aquifers together — warns that Earth’s most essential resource is quickly disappearing, signaling what the paper’s authors describe as “a critical, emerging threat to humanity.” The landmasses of the planet are drying. In most places there is less precipitation even as moisture evaporates from the soil faster. More than anything, Earth is being slowly dehydrated by the unmitigated mining of groundwater, which underlies vast proportions of every continent. Nearly 6 billion people, or three quarters of humanity, live in the 101 countries that the study identified as confronting a net decline in water supply — portending enormous challenges for food production and a heightening risk of conflict and instability.

The paper “provides a glimpse of what the future is going to be,” said Hrishikesh Chandanpurkar, an earth systems scientist working with Arizona State University and the lead author of the study. “We are already dipping from a trust fund. We don’t actually know how much the account has.”
The research, published Friday in the journal Science Advances, confirms not just that droughts and precipitation are growing more extreme but reports that drying regions are fast expanding. It also found that while parts of the planet are getting wetter, those areas are shrinking. The study, which excludes the ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland, concludes not only that Earth is suffering a pandemic of “continental drying” in lower latitudes, but that it is the uninhibited pumping of groundwater by farmers, cities and corporations around the world that now accounts for 68% of the total loss of fresh water in those areas, which generally don’t have glaciers.
Groundwater is ubiquitous across the globe, but its quality and depth vary, as does its potential to be replenished by rainfall. Major groundwater basins — the deep and often high-quality aquifers — underlie roughly one-third of the planet, including roughly half of Africa, Europe and South America. But many of those aquifers took millions of years to form and might take thousands of years to refill. Instead, a significant portion of the water taken from underground flows off the land through rivers and on to the oceans.
The researchers were surprised to find that the loss of water on the continents has grown so dramatically that it has become one of the largest causes of global sea level rise. Moisture lost to evaporation and drought, plus runoff from pumped groundwater, now outpaces the melting of glaciers and the ice sheets of either Antarctica or Greenland as the largest contributor of water to the oceans.
The study examines 22 years of observational data from NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, or GRACE, satellites, which measure changes in the mass of the earth and have been applied to estimate its water content. The technique was groundbreaking two decades ago when the study’s co-author, Jay Famiglietti, who was then a professor at the University of California, at Irvine, used it to pinpoint where aquifers were in decline. Since then, he and others have published dozens of papers using GRACE data, but the question has always lingered: What does the groundwater loss mean in the context of all of the water available on the continents? So Famiglietti, now a professor at Arizona State University, set out to inventory all the land-based water contained in glaciers, rivers and aquifers and see what was changing. The answer: everything, and quickly.

Since 2002, the GRACE sensors have detected a rapid shift in water loss patterns around the planet. Around 2014, though, the pace of drying appears to have accelerated, the authors found, and is now growing by an area twice the size of California each year. “It’s like this sort of creeping disaster that has taken over the continents in ways that no one was really anticipating,” Famiglietti said. (Six other researchers also contributed to the study.) The parts of the world drying most acutely are becoming interconnected, forming what the study’s authors describe as “mega” regions spreading across the earth’s mid-latitudes. One of those regions covers almost the whole of Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and parts of Asia.
In the American Southwest and California, groundwater loss is a familiar story, but over the past two decades that hot spot has also spread dramatically. It now extends through Texas and up through the southern High Plains, where the Ogallala aquifer is depended on for agriculture, and it spreads south, stretching throughout Mexico and into Central America. These regions are connected not because they rely on the same water sources — in most cases they don’t — but because their populations will face the same perils of water stress: the most likely, a food crisis that could ultimately displace millions of people.
“This has to serve as a wake-up call,” said Aaron Salzberg, a former fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center and the former director of the Water Institute at the University of North Carolina, who was not involved with the study.

Research has long established that people take more water from underground when climate-driven heat and drought are at their worst. For example, during droughts when California has enforced restrictions on delivery of surface water to its farmers — which the state regulates — the enormous agriculture enterprises that dominate the Central Valley have drilled deeper and pumped harder, depleting the aquifer — which the state regulates less precisely — even more.
For the most part, such withdrawals have remained invisible. Even with the GRACE data, scientists cannot measure the exact levels or know when an aquifer will be exhausted. But there is one foolproof sign that groundwater is disappearing: The earth above it collapses as the ground compresses like a drying sponge. The visible signs of such subsidence around the world appear to match what the GRACE data says. Mexico City is sinking as its groundwater aquifers are drained, as are large parts China, Indonesia, Spain and Iran, to name a few. A recent study by researchers at Virginia Tech in the journal Nature Cities found that 28 cities across the United States are sinking — New York, Houston and Denver, among them — threatening havoc for everything from building safety to transit. In the Central Valley, the ground surface is nearly 30 vertical feet lower than it was in the first part of the 20th century.
When so much water is pumped, it has to drain somewhere. Just like rivers and streams fed by rainfall, much of the used groundwater makes its way into the ocean. The study pinpoints a remarkable shift: Groundwater drilled by people, used for agriculture or urban supplies and then discarded into drainages now contributes more water to the oceans than melting from each of the world’s largest ice caps.
People aren’t just misusing groundwater, they are flooding their own coasts and cities in the process, Famiglietti warns. That means they are also imperiling some of the world’s most important food-producing lowlands in the Nile and Mekong deltas and cities from Shanghai to New York. Once in the oceans, of course, groundwater will never again be suitable for drinking and human use without expensive and energy-sucking treatment or through the natural cycle of evaporating and precipitating as rain. But even then, it may no longer fall where it is needed most. Groundwater “is an intergenerational resource that is being poorly managed, if managed at all,” the study states, “at tremendous and exceptionally undervalued cost to future generations.”
That such rapid and substantial overuse of groundwater is also causing coastal flooding underscores the compounding threat of rising temperatures and aridity. It means that water scarcity and some of the most disruptive effects of climate change are now inextricably intertwined. And here, the study’s authors implore leaders to find a policy solution: Improve water management and reduce groundwater use now, and the world has a tool to slow the rate of sea level rise. Fail to adjust the governance and use of groundwater around the world, and humanity risks surrendering parts of its coastal cities while pouring out finite reserves it will sorely need as the other effects of climate change take hold.

If the drying continues — and the researchers warn that it is now nearly impossible to reverse “on human timescales” — it heralds “potentially staggering” and cascading risks for global order. The majority of the earth’s population lives in the 101 countries that the study identified as losing fresh water, making up not just North America, Europe and North Africa but also much of Asia, the Middle East and South America. This suggests the middle band of Earth is becoming less habitable. It also correlates closely with the places that a separate body of climate research has already identified as a shrinking environmental niche that has suited civilization for the past 6,000 years. Combined, these findings all point to the likelihood of widespread famine, the migration of large numbers of people seeking a more stable environment and the carry-on impact of geopolitical disorder.
Peter Gleick, a climate scientist and a member of the National Academy of Sciences, lauded the new report for confirming trends that were once theoretical. The ramifications, he said, could be profoundly destabilizing. “The massive overpumping of groundwater,” Gleick said, “poses enormous risk to food production.” And food, he pointed out, is the foundation for stability. The water science center he co-founded, the Pacific Institute, has tracked more than 1,900 incidents in which water supplies were either the casualty of, a tool for or the cause of violence. In Syria, beginning in 2011, drought and groundwater depletion drove rural unrest that contributed to the civil war, which displaced millions of people. In Ghana, in 2017, protesters rioted as wells ran dry. And in Ukraine, whose wheat supports much of the world, water infrastructure has been a frequent target of Russian attacks.
“Water is being used as a strategic and political tool,” said Salzberg, who spent nearly two decades analyzing water security issues as the special director for water resources at the State Department. “We should expect to see that more often as the water supply crisis is exacerbated.”
India, for example, recently weaponized water against Pakistan. In April, following terrorist attacks in Kashmir, Prime Minister Narendra Modi suspended his country’s participation in the Indus Waters Treaty, a river-sharing agreement between the two nuclear powers that was negotiated in 1960. The Indus system flows northwest out of Tibet into India, before turning southward into Pakistan. Pakistan has severely depleted its groundwater reserves — the region is facing one of the world’s most urgent water emergencies according to the Science Advances paper. The Indus has only become more essential as a supply of fresh water for its 252 million people. Allowing that water to cross the border would be “prejudicial to India’s interests,” Modi said. In this case, he wasn’t attempting to recoup water supply for his country, Salzberg said, but was leveraging its scarcity to win a strategic advantage over his country’s principal rival.
What’s needed most is governance of water that recognizes it as a crucial resource that determines both sovereignty and progress, Salzberg added. Yet there is no international framework for water management, and only a handful of countries have national water policies of their own.
The United States has taken stabs at regulating its groundwater use, but in some cases those attempts appear to be failing. In 2014, California passed what seemed to many a revolutionary groundwater management act that required communities to assess their total water supply and budget its long-term use. But the act doesn’t take full effect until 2040, which has allowed many groundwater districts to continue to draw heavily from aquifers even as they complete their plans to conserve those resources. Chandanpurkar and Famiglietti’s research underscores the consequences for such a slow approach.
Arizona pioneered groundwater regulations in 1980, creating what it called active management areas where extraction would be limited and surface waters would be used to replenish aquifers. But it only chose to manage the water in metropolitan areas, leaving vast, unregulated swaths of the state where investors, farmers and industry have all pounced on the availability of free water for profit. In recent years, Saudi investors have pumped rural water to grow feed for cattle exported back to the Arabian Peninsula, and hedge funds are competing to pump and sell water to towns near Phoenix. Meanwhile, four out of the original five active management areas are failing to meet the state’s own targets.
“They like to say, ‘Oh, the management’s doing well,’” Famiglietti said, but looking out over the next century, the trends suggest the aquifers will continue to empty out. “No one talks about that. I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say it’s an existential issue for cities like Phoenix.”
Both California and Arizona grow significant portions of America’s fruits and vegetables. Something has to give. “If you want to grow food in a place like California,” Famiglietti asked, “do you just bring in water? If we deplete that groundwater, I don’t think there’s enough water to really replace what we’re doing there.” The United States might not have much choice, he added, but to move California’s agriculture production somewhere far away and retire the land.
Chandanpurkar, Famiglietti and the report’s other authors suggest there are ready solutions to the problems they have identified, because unlike so many aspects of the climate crisis, the human decisions that lead to the overuse of water can be speedily corrected. Agriculture, which uses the vast majority of the world’s fresh water, can deploy well-tested technologies like drip irrigation, as Israel has, that sharply cut use by as much as 50%. When California farms reduced their take of Colorado River water in 2023 and 2024, the water levels in Lake Mead, the nation’s largest reservoir, jumped by 16 vertical feet as some 390 billion gallons were saved by 2025. Individuals can reduce water waste by changing simple routines: shortening showers or removing lawns. And cities can look to recycle more of the water they use, as San Diego has.
A national policy that establishes rules around water practices but also prioritizes the use of water resources for national security and a collective interest could counterbalance the forces of habit and special interests, Salzberg said. Every country needs such a policy, and if the United States were to lead, it might offer an advantage. But “the U.S. doesn’t have a national water strategy,” he said, referring to a disjointed patchwork of state and court oversight. “We don’t even have a national water institution. We haven’t thought as a country about how we would even protect our own water resources for our own national interests, and we’re a mess.”

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)Feeding South Dakota is the first of what could be multiple nonprofits asking the Legislature for help to recover from federal funding cuts.
Executive Director Lori Dykstra requested $3 million in one-time funds at the legislative Appropriations Committee meeting Wednesday in Pierre to offset 1.5 million pounds of food no longer being provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture since March.
Feeding South Dakota partners to provide food to 265 smaller food pantries and food insecurity organizations throughout the state. “If we don’t have food, they don’t have food,” Dykstra said.
The nonprofit’s budget typically runs just over $10 million and is nearly entirely privately funded. The $3 million of state funding would help the organization purchase the lost 1.5 million pounds of food and purchase additional food to meet the expected increased need, Feeding South Dakota Vice President of Marketing Stacey Andernacht told South Dakota Searchlight after the meeting. The cost to purchase that much food fluctuates, rising to $2.7 million as of July 25.
South Dakota’s budget could face a $24.5 million revenue shortfall, legislators learn

Tea Republican Sen. Ernie Otten, who serves as co-chair of the budget committee, warned lawmakers of hard choices to “pick winners and losers” in the next legislative session. The committee learned of an up to $24.5 million shortfall in projected general fund revenue for this fiscal year, and Otten said because of federal cuts affecting state departments and nonprofits, “every agency and group will have their hands out.”
Sen. Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City, questioned ways that Feeding South Dakota could get churches and South Dakotans to contribute more, rather than relying on state or federal funding.
“You are a wonderful organization, but you’re one of hundreds, if not thousands, that want government funds to assist them in doing what they started out doing probably without government funds,” Howard said.
Dykstra told lawmakers the nonprofit “runs very lean” and that 93 cents of every dollar goes toward feeding people. Feeding South Dakota has been operating for 50 years, primarily privately funded, and this is the first time leaders have requested state general funds, Andernacht said.
Lawmakers won’t take up the request until the 2026 legislative session starts in January.
“We felt it was the right time to put in front of the state the dollars that they could partner with us on to help fill that gap,” Andernacht said. “They have plenty of time to consider that, ask questions and get more information from us.”
The cuts came from the rollback of federal aid by the Trump administration, particularly programs begun during the COVID-19 pandemic to help the U.S. Department of Agriculture support food distribution. Feeding South Dakota spoke to the legislative budget committee in May about the cuts.
The nonprofit reduced its programs by up to 35% to address the federal loss, Dykstra told lawmakers. Reduced programs include its mobile pantry, wellness pantry and senior box programs, Dykstra said. Feeding South Dakota partners with the state to deliver U.S. Department of Agriculture food insecurity programs, like the senior box program, in South Dakota. Andernacht said the nonprofit has not reduced food provided in the backpack program for school children. 
The group didn’t fill open positions and made cuts to technology to lessen the blow to food-insecure families.
“We did what we needed to Band-Aid the situation,” Dykstra added.
If the nonprofit doesn’t fill its gap in federal funding, she said, rural communities will be hit hardest, because they don’t have other resources like Sioux Falls and Rapid City do.
Sioux Falls Republican Sen. Larry Zikmund highlighted the amount of volunteerism Feeding South Dakota depends on to operate its programs, in addition to the funding.
“It’s very much needed,” Zikmund said, “and we need to look at seeing what we can do to help support them.”

Experts say Medicaid cuts will exacerbate rural communities’ access to mental health care. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Across the nation, Medicaid is the single largest payer for mental health care, and in rural America, residents disproportionately rely on the public insurance program.
But Medicaid cuts in the massive tax and spending bill signed into law earlier this month will worsen mental health disparities in those communities, experts say, as patients lose coverage and rural health centers are unable to remain open amid a loss of funds.
“The context to begin with is, even with no Medicaid cuts, the access to mental health services in rural communities is spotty at best, just very spotty at best — and in many communities, there’s literally no care,” said Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors.
Cuts over the next 10 years could force low-income rural families to pay for mental health care out of pocket on top of driving farther for care, experts say. Many will simply forgo care for depression, bipolar disorder and other illnesses that need consistent treatment.
No one knows whether Trump’s $50B for rural health will be enough

“Not only do you have very few services available, but you don’t have the resources to pay for the services,” Manderscheid said. “That makes the problem even worse.”
Rural communities are already at higher risk of suicide, with rates almost doubling over the past two decades. Already, rural communities are grappling with a shortage in mental health professionals, making them more vulnerable to losses compared with more urban areas, experts say.
Paul Mackie, assistant director of the Center for Rural Behavioral Health at Minnesota State University, Mankato, studies rural mental health workforce shortages.
“If it [coverage] goes away, what would then be the person’s next option if they already don’t have the resources?” said Mackie, who grew up on a rural Michigan dairy farm. “You can have a rural psychologist or a rural clinical social worker working under a shingle, literally alone.”
Small rural hospitals often provide critical behavioral health care access, he said. One analysis found the cuts next year would leave 380 rural hospitals at risk of shutting down.
States such as Mackie’s Minnesota, which expanded Medicaid eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, would suffer significant slashes in federal matches as a result of President Donald Trump’s signature legislation. The law, which includes tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy, cuts the federal government’s 90% matching rate for enrollees covered under expansion to anywhere from 50% to 74%.
States will have to redetermine eligibility twice a year on millions enrolled under Medicaid expansion. Some Medicaid recipients also will have to prove work history. The new law creates work requirement exceptions for those with severe medical conditions — including mental disorders and substance use — but experts say proving those conditions may be convoluted. The exact qualifications and diagnoses for the exceptions haven’t been spelled out, according to a report by KFF, a health policy research organization.










Not only do you have very few services available, but you don't have the resources to pay for the services. That makes the problem even worse.


– Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors


“You can’t work when your mental illness is not treated,” said Dr. Heidi Alvey, an emergency and critical care medicine physician in Indiana. “It’s so counter to the reality of the situation.”
Alvey worked seven years at Baylor Scott & White Health’s hospital in Temple, Texas. As nearby rural critical access hospitals and other mental health centers shut down, the hospital became the only access point for people hours away, she said.
“People who just had absolutely no access to care were coming hours in to see us,” she said. Many had serious untreated mental health conditions, she said, and had to wait days or weeks in the emergency department until a care facility had an open bed.
She’s concerned that Medicaid cuts will only make those problems worse.
Jamie Freeny, director of the Center for School Behavioral Health at advocacy group Mental Health America of Greater Houston, worries for the rural families her center serves. The organization works with school districts across the state, including those in rural communities. Nearly 40% of the state’s more than 1,200 school districts are classified as rural.
She remembers one child whose family had to drive to another county for behavioral health. The family lost coverage during the Medicaid unwinding, as pandemic provisions for automatic re-reenrollment expired. The child stopped taking mental health medication and ended up dropping out of school.
“The child wasn’t getting the medicine that they needed, because their family couldn’t afford it,” Freeny said. “The catalyst for that was a lack of Medicaid. That’s just one family.
“Now, you’re multiplying that.”
Family medicine physician Dr. Ian Bennett sees Medicaid patients at the Vallejo Family Health Services Center of Solano County in California’s Bay Area. The community health clinic serves patients from across the area’s rural farm communities and combines primary care with mental health care services, Bennett said.
“When our patients lose Medicaid, which we expect that they will, then we’ll have to continue to take them, and that will be quite a strain on the finances of that system,” Bennett said. The center could even close, he said.
“The folks who are having the most difficulty managing their lives — and that’s made worse by having depression or substance use disorder — are going to be the folks most likely to drop off,” said Bennett, a University of Washington mental health services researcher. “The impacts down the road are clearly going to be much worse for society as we have less people able to function.”
The psychiatric care landscape across Michigan’s rural western lower peninsula is already scarce, said Joseph “Chip” Johnston. He’s the executive director of the Centra Wellness Network, a publicly funded community mental health care provider for Manistee and Benzie counties. The network serves Medicaid and uninsured patients from high-poverty communities.
“I used to have psychiatric units close by as an adjunct to my service,” he said. “And they’ve all closed. So, now the closest [psychiatric bed] for a child, for example, is at least two hours away.”
Those facilities are also expensive. A one-night stay in an inpatient psychiatric facility can be anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 a night, he said.

JB Pritzker, at the center of 2028 election speculation, asked North Carolina Democrats whether they were ready to fight back against “MAGA Republicans” on Saturday, July 26. (Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)Illinois Governor JB Pritzker spoke like a presidential candidate in waiting in his keynote address at North Carolina Democrats’ Unity Dinner fundraiser Saturday evening, outlining his vision for a post-Trump America.
“When we emerge from this, and we will emerge from this, our Democratic agenda must be bold and our idea fearless. We will have no time to waste: America needs us” Pritzker said. “We must deliver on an agenda centered on working families who truly make America great.”
In a 25-minute speech, Pritzker issued sharp condemnations of President Donald Trump and his cabinet and outlined his vision for how Democrats can regain voters’ trust on kitchen table issues. He also sketched out an agenda for the next Democratic administration that includes rebuilding social services, bringing down cost of living for working and middle class Americans, and developing a cohesive policy approach to artificial intelligence.
“Our democracy is on the line, and Americans are wondering, who is going to fight for them?” Pritzker asked. “North Carolina Democrats, I have a question for you: Are you ready to fight?”
Pritzker’s remarks followed speeches by former Governor Roy Cooper and state Supreme Court Associate Justice Anita Earls, at the center of the state party’s 2026 election hopes. Democratic Party officials and supporters also heard from North Carolina House Democratic Leader Robert Reives and Senate Democratic Leader Syndey Batch.
‘I’ve been to this movie before’
Pritzker, a Duke University graduate who served as legislative aide to Democratic Senator Terry Sanford, took on a pugilistic demeanor as he skewered Trump and denounced his administration in his remarks.
“It’s wrong to snatch a person off the streets of America and ship them to a foreign gulag with no chance to defend themselves in a court of law,” Pritzker said. “They’re literally arresting U.S. citizens in broad daylight, and then green card holders, people who have never committed any crime in their lives and who dream someday of becoming American citizens — they’re being swept up and deported. So are babies and children and teenagers.”
Launching into an explanation of habeas corpus, the legal right to due process of law for those detained, Pritzker quoted Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, underscoring their commitment to that principle and their abhorrence for tyrants who would violate it.
“Franklin, Jefferson, Hamilton — they were talking about Donald Trump,” Pritzker said. “Standing for the idea that the government doesn’t have the right to kidnap you without due process is arguably the most effective campaign message in history.”
In charting a course for new Democratic leadership, Pritzker evoked his own experience taking over the state former Governor Bruce Rauner, a Republican — an analogy that would seem to pitch Pritzker as the antidote to the Trump era.

“There’s a way out of this mess — I know, because I’ve been to this movie before when I was elected governor in 2018 to replace a very destructive Republican chief executive. He defunded the government, slashed health care for the poor and for people with disabilities, racked up massive deficits, and plunged our state’s finances to worst in the nation,” he said. “Does that sound familiar? That’s what happens when you elected a chief executive who’s hell-bent on shaking things up without any idea how to fix what he’s broken.”
Pritzker, the billionaire scion of the family that owns the Hyatt Hotels Corporation, has served as Illinois governor since 2019. While he announced in June he would seek a third term in 2026, his cross-country speaking engagements have fueled expectations that he will seek the presidency in 2028.
Besides North Carolina, Pritzker headlined a New Hampshire Democratic Party fundraiser in April and gatherings of Wisconsin, Virginia, and Iowa Democrats in 2024. He was also a high-profile surrogate for Vice President Kamala Harris’s 2024 campaign, including appearance in Arizona and Nevada.
He urged Democrats to “say what we mean and mean what we say” in his speech Saturday, while jettisoning “poll-tested language and decades of stale decorum.” At times, his blunt condemnations of Trump and his associates were reminiscent of the president’s own barbs.
“Autistic kids don’t deserve to be stigmatized and targeted by a weird nepo baby who once stashed a dead bear in the back seat of his car,” Pritzker said. “Our great soldiers don’t deserve to be told by a washed-up FOX TV commentator who drank too much and committed sexual assault before being appointed Defense Secretary that they can’t serve this country simply because they’re Black, or gay, or a woman.”
He also took aim at Homeland Security Secretary Kristie Noem, saying she “likes to play dress-up as ICE Barbie,” and Attorney General Pam Bondi “who protects the President from scrutiny about his close friendship with a pedophile,” referencing Jeffrey Epstein.
“No more self-dealing by the President of the United States. No more gifts from foreign nations. No more unvetted Russian assets in key government positions,” Pritzker said. “It’s disgusting and it’s got to change. If it sounds like I’m becoming contemptuous of MAGA Republicans, it’s because I am contemptuous of MAGA Republicans.”
‘You didn’t give up the fight’
While Pritzker’s speech centered heavily on national politics, North Carolina leaders largely focused their remarks on judicial elections, storm recovery, and veto overrides.
Delivering a video address in absentia — away attending the National Governors Association conference in Colorado — Governor Josh Stein praised the state party for its successes in 2024, including in the elections for Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, State Superintendent, and Secretary of State. And he thanked supporters for backing Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs amid an “outrageous Republican attempt to steal her seat.”
He condemned the Trump administration for causing “unprecedented chaos” and “an economic roller coaster” while eroding due process and freedom of speech. And he criticized Republicans in the General Assembly for putting forward bills that “make our state less safe and less strong.” So far, Stein has issued 14 vetoes, none of which have been overridden, though state Republicans aim to do so in the coming week.

Rep. Dante Pittman (D-Wilson), the only House Democrat to vote in favor of a sweeping anti-trans bill the Governor blocked, appeared to signal he would stand with Stein’s veto of it at the dinner. Without Democratic assistance, Republicans cannot override Stein’s veto after losing their supermajority in the lower chamber of the General Assembly in the 2024 election.
“When I was sitting at my chair and I saw our governor come up on the screen, my resolve was hardened,” Pittman said before delivering the Salute to the Flag of North Carolina. “When it comes to the veto overrides, we’ve got your back.”
Cooper, Stein’s predecessor, also condemned Republicans in the state legislature, though most of his speech centered on dysfunction in Washington as he alluded to his upcoming Senate bid. “Here in Raleigh, the Republican legislature has left town,” he said. “No budget, no badly needed funding for healthcare, no teacher pay raise. Just passing bills to increase your electric bill and stoking the culture war fires. It’s not right.”
Reives, the House Democratic Leader who represents Chatham County, urged attendees to accept the nature of a big tent party and tolerate disagreements with one another.
“There are going to be people that you don’t like in this party. There are going to be some people running for office that you’re not that crazy about,” Reives said. “I got a guy running in District 54 in Chatham County, I don’t know if I agree with him all the time. But you know what I do know? I need him so we can get our state back.”
  Associate Justice Anita Earls said she would never forget the attempts to overturn the results of the 2024 Supreme Court race. (Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)
Gearing up for her the Supreme Court race in 2026, Earls said she would never forget that four of her Republican colleagues on the bench ruled in favor of Judge Jefferson Griffin’s effort to throw out overseas and military ballots that did not include voter ID “even though those voters fully complied with the law as it existed at the time they voted.”
“I also will never forget that Justice Riggs and the North Carolina Democratic Party stood up for the voting rights of all North Carolinians when they argued that every vote should count,” Earls said. “We are the party willing to win fair and square. You stood up for our rights. You didn’t give up the fight.”
Batch, the Senate Democratic Leader, called on audience members to continue fighting and organizing and not give up hope. She attacked Republicans for shifting funds from public education to private schools, rolling back reproductive rights, and putting Medicaid expansion at risk while cutting taxes for the wealthiest people in the state.
“There has never been a time in the history of this country that it has been safer and easier to do the right thing,” Batch said. “Nobody’s unleashing fire hoses at voter drives. Nobody’s hanging strange fruit from trees because we marched. The steepest price we’ll pay is sore calves from knocking doors, a raspy voice from speaking the truth, or a bruised ego because someone told you to sit down.”
‘Fired up and ready to go’
After the speeches, Democrats at the dinner said they felt optimistic and invigorated ahead of the next wave of electoral battles in the state.
“They were terrific, I’d like to say fired up and ready to go,” said Brenda Pollard, president of Durham County Democratic Women. “They were right on point, and that’s where we need to be, and we’re going to fight.”
Pollard said she was especially pleased with Cooper’s remark hinting at his upcoming Senate announcement. “He’s still standing, so I mean, that was music to my ears. I’m ready and the Governor will make a wonderful U.S. Senator,” she said.
Pritzker’s remarks also drew praise from those in attendance, including state party leadership. Clayton said she was pleased with “what she saw tonight from every person up on that stage” in terms of a willingness to be direct with voters and those in power. She said she would hope to see those traits in future presidential candidates.
“I’d like to see somebody who’s willing to stand up there and go toe-to-toe with a Republican and not afraid to talk to them exactly how they talk to us right now,” Clayton said. “You’re willing to get down in the nitty-gritty, but you’re also willing to speak truth to power.”
Of his blunt style, Batch said “people are exhausted with appearing that Democrats roll over,” something she’s tried to address in her own interactions with Republicans. “I’m showing up like he does every single day with the fight. I’m not going to start a fight, but I sure as hell won’t walk away from one.”
“I am so forever grateful for the amount of energy that you have all given to us,” Clayton said, closing out the dinner. “And I want to take this energy that you have now and give it back to your neighbors, your friends, your community members. Talk to folks, knock on doors with us, make the calls, tell you story — help us write the next chapter of North Carolina.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7262984-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-27 08:56:22.436813

Almost half of the 63 million Americans who care for a family member say they struggle financially to do so. (Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)More than 63 million Americans are caregivers for a family member with complex medical needs, a 20 million increase over the past decade, according to a new report.
But state policies, workplaces and the American health system haven’t kept up with this surge in family caregiving responsibilities, said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, a physician and the CEO of the AARP, which released the report with the National Alliance for Caregiving, a nonprofit policy and research organization.
“Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences, draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing,” Minter-Jordan told reporters on a call this week.
One of the biggest reasons for the surge in family caregivers is that Americans are living longer, yet they’re not necessarily healthier. There’s a 12-year gap between the average number of years that Americans live and the number of years they’re healthy.
‘A purpose in this world’: Older adults fear elimination of program that helps them find work

The caregiving role typically involves helping a family member with daily tasks like bathing, dressing and eating. But more than half of caregivers also perform more complex medical tasks, such as managing catheters or administering injections, the report found.
A growing number of caregivers are so-called “sandwich caregivers” — parents caring for their children as well as for an adult family member, such as an aging parent. About 17 million people are sandwich caregivers, compared with 11 million a decade ago. And most caregivers are also working a job.
And while the bulk of caregiving still falls on women, 40% of American caregivers are men.
Some states have heeded the growing calls for action.
Earlier this year, Maine lawmakers created a state program to provide respite care, which includes services such as adult day care that give family caregivers a temporary break.
Also this year, Tennessee extended its pilot program that provides respite care for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, and also passed a bipartisan bill that directs the state Medicaid program to develop guidelines to allow family caregivers to be paid for their work.
Last year, Nebraska passed a tax credit for family caregivers; Oklahoma passed a similar law the year before. And while the United States is one of few countries that doesn’t mandate paid family leave at the federal level, 13 states and the District of Columbia have established their own paid family leave rules.
Meanwhile, the historic cuts to Medicaid enacted as part of the GOP’s Big, Beautiful Bill Act will shift health costs to states, leaving experts worried that family caregivers could lose Medicaid-funded services they rely on.

BESSEMER — For Ron Morgan, the signs told the tale. He was among the dozens of residents who spilled into the Birmingham suburb’s city hall chambers who were met by what they viewed as propaganda: Literal signs, the residents felt, that city officials may not have an open mind about voting against a development project facing near universal public opposition.
Flanking the chamber doors and on both sides of the council dais were city-printed posters with bold, all-capital letters at their tops: “LET’S TALK FACTS.”
Lower down on the posters was information residents said they felt was misleading and aimed at swaying public opinion on an issue they’ve studied closely: the impacts of a 4.5 million square foot data center proposed in their largely rural community.

“Focus on Benefits,” one of the posters read, “Not Misinformation.”
At the bottom of the posters, next to an emblem of city hall itself, another all-caps slogan: “POWERED BY KNOWLEDGE, NOT FEAR.”
“They’ve already made their mind up,” Morgan, an Army veteran, said. “No surprise there.”

So far, officials in the city of 25,000 have shown little interest in publicly digging into the details of what could be one of the largest development projects in state history—one that would require the clear-cutting of more than 100 acres of land, threaten endangered species and lead to large increases in water and electricity usage.
Instead, public officials, many bound by non-disclosure agreements with the developer, have relied on the assertions of the company proposing the project—a company that has so far refused to answer media questions about the impact of their plans on the community and the environment.
Not long after the July 15 City Council meeting began, Brad Kaaber, a representative of the developer, Logistic Land Investments LLC, told City Council members that residents’ near-universal opposition wasn’t based on facts.

“You’re going to hear things that simply are not true,” Kaaber told council members. “And I appreciate all the people who took time out of their day to come to a meeting like this, but all I want to do is speak to the facts. You’re going to hear a lot of things that simply are not facts.”
Residents who’d packed into the relatively small council chambers balked, audibly reacting to Kaaber’s comments.
Earlier, when Martin Evans, the developer’s attorney, exceeded the two-minute time limit imposed by the council on comments, several members of the audience shouted in protest. Proponents of the development, they said, should be bound by the same time constraint placed on opponents. Council President Donna Thigpen quickly squelched the residents’ complaints: “If you can’t be quiet, we’ll clear the room,” she said.
As Kaaber continued speaking, JC Matthews, director of economic development for the Birmingham Business Alliance, reacted to the groans of community members.
“Y’all just don’t care about the facts,” he said from the side of the room. Residents seated nearby, dressed in red to show their opposition to the data center’s construction, looked shocked.
“That’s exactly what we’re interested in,” one resident said. “The facts.”
To find “the facts,” Inside Climate News interviewed the developer’s representative, public officials and residents who live near the proposed development site on key topics and claims. Among the findings:
Water usage
Because of the need to cool the computer servers and other electronics in the proposed data center, the facility—consisting of 18 buildings, each the size of a Walmart Supercenter—could consume large amounts of water. The specific amount of water used by a data center campus depends primarily on its size and on its specific method of cooling.
Representatives of the developer behind the Bessemer project have said they’re unsure which method of cooling will ultimately be used by the proposed data center campus because an end user has not yet been secured.
At a June meeting, Kaaber told planning and zoning commissioners that a large tech firm, likely a Fortune 10 company, would eventually sign on as the facility’s primary customer—Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook among the chief possibilities.

Only then, with a final user in place, would there be firm estimates of water usage.
Still, publicly available documents provide an insight into how much water the project could ultimately consume.
Warrior River Water Authority, a local utility, said in a letter obtained by Inside Climate News that the developer requested a supply of 2 million gallons per day, an amount the utility said it would not be able to provide without “significant upgrades” to the water distribution system.
Water usage of 2 million gallons per day would likely place the facility among the largest consumers of water in the region with the exception of power plants, the utility document said, straining its capacity. Residents have said they already consider the water utility unreliable.
Publicly available information suggests that the Warrior River Water Authority’s supply capacity is around 6 million gallons per day. Usage of 2 million gallons per day, then, would amount to a third of the utility’s water supply if capacity is not increased to accommodate the facility.
The 2 million gallons of water a day requested by the developer is equivalent to the typical usage of around 6,700 households, about two-thirds of Bessemer’s population, based on the water utility’s consumption estimates.
Charles Miller, policy director for the Alabama Rivers Alliance, told council members at the July 15 meeting to be wary of the developers’ claims that council members should leave environmental regulation to other entities, like the Alabama Department of Environmental Management or the federal Environmental Protection Agency.
“In Alabama, we have no water quantity laws, so no state body or board will be examining whether the volume of water this project requires is reasonable or will harm neighboring communities,” Miller said.
“Water is a finite resource,” Lauren Adele, a citizen concerned about rising water utility rates, told council members. “What do we do as the residents of Bessemer, Jefferson County, Birmingham, the state of Alabama, when our showers don’t work, when we have no water pressure, when we can’t wash our dishes, when we can’t cook our food? We have no way to generate more water than what God sends us from the sky.”
Public water usage estimates also don’t account for the additional water Alabama Power will need to cool its power plants as they provide megawatts of new power the proposed data center in Bessemer will need to operate.

Power consumption

In addition to significant water usage, the data center in Bessemer will consume an enormous amount of electricity, with servers running around the clock.
A document produced by Evans & Evans, the law firm representing the developer, suggests that at total buildout, the proposed data center campus would consume around 1,200 megawatts of energy. That’s more than 90 times the amount of energy used by all residences in Bessemer and more than 10 times the amount of energy used by all residences in Birmingham annually. An increase of that magnitude would amount to a 10 percent rise in Alabama Power’s total electricity demand statewide.
Increased demand for energy, or at least the potential for it, is already driving Alabama Power’s desire to double down on fossil fuel investments. The company, an effective monopoly, has asked the state’s Public Service Commission to approve its purchase of a gas-powered power plant in recent days, increasing the state’s reliance on fossil fuel energy, which globally accounts for over 75 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.
Many experts also say that increased demand from data centers across the country will drive prices up for everyone, including residential customers. Alabamians already pay some of the highest energy bills in the country, according to various analyses of electricity rates nationwide.
Ron Morgan expressed his concern to council members that the data center’s power usage will be so large that it will have to take electricity from multiple power plants.
“Just because they’re on a transmission line doesn’t mean that Alabama Power can flip a switch and provide an additional 1,200 megawatts of power,” he said.

Cancer risks

The city’s signs at July’s council meeting made specific claims around the risk of cancer caused by data centers.
“MYTH: ‘Data Centers Cause Cancer’ FACT: There is NO scientific proof linking data centers to cancer,” the sign said. “While data centers do use diesel backup generators, these are rarely used and must meet EPA emission standards. Most centers are also moving toward clean energy and battery backups.”
No one involved in the proposed development has suggested that either renewable energy or battery backups will be used at the data center, if built. Instead, Kaaber confirmed at the meeting that diesel generators will be the backup source of energy at the site. Kaaber said that each generator in the “generator yards” would be tested three hours each month.
Estimates based on other hyperscale data centers suggest that the proposed Bessemer data center campus would need between 300 and 500 diesel generators to provide a reliable backup source of electricity for the facility. Amazon representatives in Minnesota, for example, asked regulators to approve the operation of 250 diesel generators to provide back power for a facility around half the size of that proposed in Bessemer. Regulators rejected the plan. Even assuming uninterrupted power supply, the testing of the generators for three hours per day would produce a significant amount of emission, contributing to air pollution.
Exposure to diesel exhaust can lead to “serious health conditions,” according to the EPA. Diesel fumes are “likely to be carcinogenic to humans,” according to the federal agency.
The International Agency for Research on Cancer also labels diesel exhaust as “carcinogenic to humans.”
  Becky Morgan explains her concerns regarding air pollution caused by the data center’s operation. (Lee Hedgepeth/Inside Climate News)
Becky Morgan, who already suffers from breathing issues, told council members about her concerns around air pollution caused by diesel generators. She said the council’s posters claiming data centers don’t cause cancer are inaccurate. She said that even if the facility’s power supply is stable, the particulate matter from testing the generators will travel great distances. EPA regulates such emissions, she said, precisely because they may cause cancer.
“We need to know how many generators are going to be backing up the 1,200 megawatts, because that’s a huge factor,” she said. “Pollution will travel. It’s going to come in our backyards.”

Endangered species

Kaaber, the representative for the developer, has told residents in Bessemer that there will be no notable environmental impact from the proposed data center site.
Multiple experts interviewed by Inside Climate News have said the project will have significant, potentially irreversible impacts, including putting an already imperilled, newly identified species of fish—the Birmingham darter—at risk of extinction.

“This would nuke this creek,” Thomas Near, a Yale biologist, said of the data center project.
Near said that based on what he’s learned, its construction and use would be devastating for the Birmingham darter and for other aquatic wildlife in the area.
These “dramatic” negative impacts, he said, could include increased river temperature for a fish attuned to inhabit cool, spring-fed streams. Significant water runoff and water extraction for cooling purposes would also fundamentally alter the ecosystem. And Near is concerned about how the data center development might affect the delicate limestone substrate habitat unique to the Birmingham darter.
The Center for Biological Diversity, a national environmental nonprofit, has also said they’re considering legal action against the city under the Endangered Species Act related to the project’s potential impacts on the watercress darter, another fish already listed as endangered under federal law.
In his comments on environmental impacts, Kaaber has referenced multiple environmental assessments he said were conducted by the developer but has so far declined a request from Inside Climate News for those assessments. Kaaber would not answer questions about the project following the July meeting.
Zoning changes
In a June zoning and planning commission meeting, representatives of the developer suggested that hyperscale data centers are commonly zoned as “light industrial,” the zoning classification they’ve advocated for in the context of the current proposal.
Under Bessemer’s zoning regulations, light industrial uses include bus terminals, gas stations with garages and large billboards. Expressly forbidden from light industrial classification are facilities “which are especially detrimental to property or to the health and safety beyond the district by reason of the emission of odor, dust, gas, fumes, smoke, noise, vibration or waste material.”
The proposed data center site is currently zoned for agricultural use, but city officials are concurrently considering changing the site’s zoning to light industrial to facilitate the construction of the new development.
“This is not light industrial,” Becky Morgan told zoning commission members. The facility’s high power consumption, security needs and sheer footprint should require its zoning in heavy industrial or another, newly created zoning category, she argued.
An Inside Climate News analysis of zoning ordinances around the country concluded that hyperscale data centers are rarely zoned “light industrial.” Municipalities more commonly create a new zoning category specific to data centers, which have unique power and water usage needs when compared to many other commercial facilities.
Many cities also require the placement of such facilities in areas zoned for heavy industrial use. For example, the only other data center project backed by Logistic Land Investment—a proposed data center in Texas—has been zoned heavy industrial.

Tax implications

Both the residents and the developer have made various claims around the tax implications of the project. Representatives of the developer have suggested that the project will be a financial boon for the city while residents have said they’re skeptical of the claims.
Jimmie Stephens, president of the Jefferson County Commission, told council members at the meeting that they would likely end up abating more tax revenue than they would actually collect.
“This isn’t about the environment,” Stephens said. “This is about the money. This is about the tax revenue that has been laid before the city of Bessemer that you’re depending on, you’re looking forward to but that, in all likelihood, they’re going to ask you to abate.”
Stephens, who is opposed to the project, said that if any abatements go before the Jefferson County Commission, he would vote against them.
He may not have the chance. Alabama law contains explicit tax carve outs for capital projects, including a specific, 30-year tax abatement meant to attract large data centers. If approved by Bessemer officials, a tax abatement under the economic development law could amount to a tax cut of more than $500 million. It’s unlikely such an abatement would even need to go before the county commission.
Rep. Leigh Hulsey, a member of the Alabama House who represents residents in the area, said she’s also skeptical of claims around tax revenues. She said she’s spoken to individuals familiar with a data center project in Huntsville who confirmed that actual tax revenues are not meeting expectations.
“They’re not bringing the revenue that the city thought they would, and that’s the truth,” Hulsey said. “That’s directly from those individuals there in Huntsville. It’s the same thing that Commissioner Stevens was talking about. There are promises. … It’s not going to bring all the money you think it’s going to bring.”
The Bessemer City Council is scheduled to consider approval of zoning changes and the related preliminary development plan on August 5.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Bessmer-meeting-for-July-27-2025-story-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-27 08:56:22.436813

(Photo by Emily Elconin/Getty Images)Amid recent political rhetoric about rising crime and violence in American cities, a new analysis shows that violent crime has continued to decline this year.
Homicides and several other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, dropped during the first half of 2025 across 42 U.S. cities, continuing a downward trend that began in 2022, according to a new crime trends report released Thursday by the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
Homicides fell 17% in the first half of 2025, compared with the same period in 2024, among the 30 cities that reported homicide data, according to the report.
During that same period, five cities saw increases in homicide — ranging from 6% in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to 39% in Little Rock, Arkansas.
While the report’s authors say the continued drop in violent crime — especially homicides — is encouraging, they note that much of the decline stems from a few major cities with historically high rates, such as Baltimore and St. Louis.
More than half of the cities studied have higher homicide rates than before the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, though, the analysis found that there were 14% fewer homicides during the first half of 2025 compared to the same period in 2019.
The authors say more research is needed before crediting any specific policy or practice for the continued drop in violent crime.
The group’s findings come as President Donald Trump continues to amplify concerns about crime, at times citing misleading statistics and narratives.
In a Truth Social post earlier this week, Trump claimed that cashless bail — a practice that allows people charged with a crime to be released pretrial without paying money, unless a judge deems them a threat to public safety — were fueling a national crime surge and endangering law enforcement.
He wrote: “Crime in American Cities started to significantly rise when they went to CASHLESS BAIL. The WORST criminals are flooding our streets and endangering even our great law enforcement officers. It is a complete disaster, and must be ended, IMMEDIATELY!”
Some research suggests that setting money bail isn’t effective in ensuring court appearances or improving public safety. Opponents of ending cash bail often raise concerns that released suspects might commit new, potentially more serious crimes. While that is possible in individual cases, studies show that eliminating cash bail does not lead to a widespread increase in crime.
The Truth Social post also marked a sharp shift from Trump’s remarks during a June roundtable with the Fraternal Order of Police, where he claimed the national murder rate had “plummeted by 28%” since he took office — a figure that overstates the decline and overlooks the fact that murder rates began falling well before he returned to office.
According to data consulting firm AH Datalytics, which manages the Real-Time Crime Index — a free tool that collects crime data from more than 400 law enforcement agencies nationwide — the number of homicides between January and May 2025 was 20.3% lower than the same period in 2024.
Similarly, data released in May by the Major Cities Chiefs Association showed that homicides fell roughly 20% in the first quarter of 2025 compared with the first three months of the prior year. The group’s data is based on a survey of 68 major metropolitan police departments nationwide.
Researchers at the Council on Criminal Justice note in their report that it’s difficult to pinpoint a single reason for the drop in homicides, but they note that fewer people appear to be exposed to high-risk situations, such as robberies.
Most major crimes fell in the first half of 2025 compared with the same period last year, according to the council’s report.
Motor vehicle thefts dropped by 25%, while reported gun assaults fell 21%. Robberies, residential and non-residential burglaries, shoplifting, and aggravated and sexual assaults also saw double-digit declines
Drug offenses held steady, while domestic violence reports rose slightly — by about 3%. Carjackings declined 24% and larcenies were down 5%.
Compared with the first half of 2019, before the pandemic and nationwide reckoning over racial justice and policing, overall homicides are down 14%, robberies by 30%, and sexual assaults by 28%.
Still, more than 60% of the cities in the council’s study sample report homicide rates that remain above 2019 levels.
Motor vehicle theft remains the only crime tracked in the report that is still elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels — up 25% since 2019 — although it has declined sharply since 2023.
The council also released another analysis on the lethality of violent crime, showing that while violent incidents have decreased, the share of violence that ends in death has increased significantly. In 1994, there were 2 homicides per 1,000 assaults and about 16 per 1,000 robberies. By 2020, those figures rose to 7.2 and 55.8, respectively.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)In his first public event after news of his impending Senate campaign broke, former Governor Roy Cooper asked everyone in the audience planning to run for office in 2026 to please stand for a round of applause.
Glancing at his feet with a grin, he quipped, “Hey — I’m not sitting down, am I?”
Previewing his run for Senate in a speech before North Carolina Democratic Party leaders and supporters Saturday night, days ahead of an expected campaign announcement, Cooper was met with a standing ovation and cheers of “Run Roy, run!”
“Look at what’s happening in Washington — they are running up our debt, they are disrespecting our veterans, they’re cutting help for the hungry, and they’re ripping away with health care for millions of people,” Cooper said. “All to give tax breaks to the millionaires and the billionaires, and it’s not right.”
Cooper is expected to declare his candidacy for the Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) next week, a development first reported by Axios on Wednesday. He would be vying to become the state’s first Democratic senator in more than a decade, with the party’s last Senate victory coming in 2008 when President Barack Obama won the state.
Tallying up his resume at the party’s annual Unity Dinner, Cooper expressed pride in passing Medicaid expansion and expanding coverage to more than 675,000 people, raising pay for public school teachers, eliminating billions in medical debt for North Carolinians, and taking a stand against a 12-week abortion ban that Republicans ultimately passed over his veto.
“Right now, we’re living in a time in this country, I think, that is as fragile as I can remember,” Cooper said. But this beautiful experiment we call democracy — it only works when we work for it, which means that everybody needs to stay engaged and find a way to do something. We cannot let our progress slip away.”
The popular two-term governor is expected to compete in the general election against Republican National Committee chair Michael Whatley, who is also anticipated to declare as a candidate in the days to come, as first reported by POLITICO Thursday. This follows Tillis’s announcement that he would not seek reelection after voting against Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” citing cuts to Medicaid.
Cooper is poised to be a formidable candidate for Senate, after departing office at the end of 2024 with broad popularity. A March 6 survey of 662 voters by Public Policy Polling found that 47% of held a favorable view of the former governor, while 42% held an unfavorable view — a net favorability rating 28 points better than that of Tillis, who the poll found Cooper leading in a hypothetical match-up 47% to 43%. Pollsters have yet to publish surveys of a prospective Cooper-Whatley matchup.


On Saturday night, Cooper followed state Supreme Court Justice Anita Earls, also running in 2026, and preceded Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who is widely expected to seek the presidency in 2028. His fellow Democrats ranged from similarly coy about his plans to openly delighted at his imminent entry into the race.
Among the most upfront was Earls, who introduced him as “Governor and we hope soon-to-be Senator Roy Cooper” to rousing cheers.
  Among those praising former Governor Roy Cooper at Saturday’s dinner were state party chair Anderson Clayton and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker. “We can’t wait to support you in the next stage of your career,” said Pritzker. (Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)
“He knows this state and how to get things done in difficult times,” she said. “His passion for the well-being of every North Carolina is evident in all of his accomplishments, most recently persevering in the quest to extend Medicaid, resulting in healthcare coverage now for more than 650,000 additional people.”
“The top of the ticket matters tremendously to my race, and you can tell from the enthusiasm in this room that he is someone that the party across North Carolina would be thrilled to have as our candidate,” Earls told reporters after the speeches.
Pritzker, the keynote speaker, said serving alongside Cooper as a governor during the first Trump administration gave him a “true master class in the humility and integrity that marks the best of public service.”
“Roy, I know I speak for Democratic governors across the country when I say: we can’t wait to support you in the next stage of your career delivering for the people of North Carolina,” Pritzker said, applauding the former governor.
“I’m excited. North Carolina Democrats are ready to put a Democrat in the Senate office next year, making sure that we’re representing everybody in North Carolina,” state party chair Anderson Clayton said after the dinner. “I think tonight, Governor Cooper alluded to the fact that he’s excited to be able to put somebody in that same office and do the same thing.”
The enthusiasm reflects a party that had all but lined up to support Cooper before the candidate even made his plans public. Attorney General Jeff Jackson, who gave remarks in private to a VIP Reception preceding the dinner, made headlines earlier this month when he endorsed Cooper for Senate before the former governor entered the race. Former U.S. Rep. Wiley Nickel, the first Democratic entrant in the Senate race, is expected to drop out and run for Wake County District Attorney with Cooper’s announcement.
In some of his most extensive remarks in his seven months out of office, Cooper returned the praise, singling out Pritzker, Earls, and his successor in office. “I’m sleeping really well at night knowing we have Governor Josh Stein leading the charge for our state,” he said.
“Despite all the turmoil and cruelty — because of people of people like you here tonight, I still believe that our best days are ahead of us,” Cooper said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7262863-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-27 07:56:17.338090

The challenge is great. The solutions are complex. The cost is significant. I do not deny the seriousness of the issues we all face, but we are humans.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Garry Schaedel: Despite all the world’s challenges, we are all human.","This commentary is by Garry Schaedel, of Burlington. Previously, he was the health promotion and disease prevention division director for the Vermont Department of Health. He is now retired from state service.


It was a conversation I have heard many times. Too many unhoused people, too many people suffering from substance use disorder, too many criminals in Burlington — implying no one is doing anything to fix it, and our community is rotting away. 
I get it. The challenge is great. The solutions are complex. The cost is significant. I do not deny the seriousness of the issues we all face.
But we are humans.
A while back, I drove to the downtown City Market in Burlington to shop for groceries. When I arrived, I realized I left my wallet home. Darn it! I also had to pick up a picture I had redone at the LeZot Camera store on Main Street, just a few blocks away. Luckily, I had already paid for it.
I walked down Church Street and took a left onto Main Street, where I picked up my picture. I went down Main Street toward City Market, in the opposite direction that I had walked to LeZot Camera. A few doors down I came upon a young man standing and looking at me as I walked toward him. I was prepared for his ask. I assumed he was unhoused and was looking for money.
As I approached him, I said, “I am sorry, I don’t have any money. I left my wallet at home.” He stared at me as I briefly waited for a response. Then he said, “Will you give me a hug?” He was so sincere, and it was not what I expected. I immediately said yes. 
He was younger and shorter than me. I felt like I was hugging an adult son, if I had one. I hugged him gently, but he pulled us together a bit tighter. It was real. He needed a person to give him a hug. We all have felt this way.
We held each other until he let go of me. Still inches away, we were looking right at each other.  I spontaneously patted his cheek, as I would do with anyone I love. A woman sitting on a step next to us yelled, “Wow, he does not let me pat his cheek!”
We looked at each other for a bit more. I said I was sorry I had nothing else I could offer him. I patted his arm. I said, “Hang in there buddy. I will be thinking of you!” — which I do so often when I am downtown. Before I walked away, he replied, “Thank you.”

Consumers are facing a Sept. 30 deadline to be eligible for tax credits for EVs, followed by a Dec. 31 deadline when credits vanish for rooftop solar, air source heat pumps and certain water heaters.
These are major purchases and customers will likely want to consider multiple options before making a selection, but there isn’t much time for research. To help, I’ve convened some experts to help you make good decisions.
First, how we got here: President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this month, which repealed tax credits that had been created or expanded under the Inflation Reduction Act.
Since the EV credits expire first, we’ll start there. Until Sept. 30, the government has a $7,500 credit for qualifying new EVs and plug-in hybrids, and a $4,000 credit for qualifying used EVs. There is also a $7,500 credit under a different part of the law that applies to leased EVs.
Should you buy immediately? I asked Alex Knizek, associate director of auto test development at the Consumer Reports Auto Test Center.
“If you’ve already done your research and found a safe, reliable EV or [plug-in hybrid] that fits your needs and budget, you should make that purchase sooner rather than later,” he said. “But don’t panic-buy a car in a rush just for the sake of getting the tax credit.”
Knizek said there is a danger that a quick decision will leave you stuck with a vehicle that doesn’t fit your needs. Also, a quick buying process may lead you to get a vehicle that is unreliable and will need expensive repairs.
Especially if you’re a first-time EV buyer, there are some details you need to figure out before you start taking test drives. For example, you should determine your charging setup and get a sense of whether there will be extra costs to upgrade your home’s wiring.
The larger point is that rushed decisions are often bad decisions.
But if you feel ready to buy, there are many resources available to identify which vehicles have the best promotions and the inventory levels in your area. Websites such as KBB.com and Edmunds.com can provide a big-picture view.
The federal government lists which new vehicles and used vehicles qualify for credits when a customer is buying, as opposed to leasing.
For leases, dealers and their financing affiliates can get a $7,500 credit for EVs that they deliver to customers, with few restrictions. But there is no master list for prices and availability. I’ve found that it’s helpful to look online for lists of the best lease deals, and also look for specials on the websites of local dealers.
Prices vary depending on where you are located. For example, Columbus, Ohio, where I live, often doesn’t have some of the best promotions that are available in markets where dealers have a lot more EV inventory.
You have more time to shop and make decisions about the other expiring credits than you do with EVs. Most of the other consumer-facing tax credits expire on Dec. 31, including:

A 30 percent credit for home energy systems that can include rooftop solar, battery energy storage systems and small wind turbines, among others. This credit has no maximum benefit, which allows for a lot of flexibility in deciding the size of the system you want.


 A 30 percent credit for buying a qualifying air source heat pump, which is an electric system that provides home heating and cooling. The maximum benefit is $2,000.


A 30 percent credit for home improvements that help with energy conservation, which can include insulation, windows, doors and electrical panel replacement. The maximum benefit is $1,200, and there are several other limits for certain items, such as a cap of $600 for windows.

The only major consumer-facing credit that will continue beyond the end of the year is an incentive for buying and installing a home charger for an EV, which ends after June 2026. This is a 30 percent credit with a maximum benefit of $1,000. (EnergySage has a good roundup of the credits and expiration dates, which helped me to parse some of these details.)
But knowing which credits are available is just an initial step. The next one is to determine what to do with this information.
At my house, I have found that Electrify Central Ohio is a great resource, and I wrote about it in 2022. It’s a volunteer-run organization in which people share their experiences with buying rooftop solar, EVs and other emissions-cutting technologies. Other cities and regions have their own groups like this and I advise you to join one in your community.
I asked the co-founders, Andy Leber and Madeline Fleisher, whether the rapid expiration of tax credits means I should rush to make purchases.
“We were advising people considering solar to do it this calendar year, but it might already be too late to start getting bids and getting the system installed by Dec. 31,” said Leber, who is an Ohio State University psychology professor by day. “If I were shopping now, I’d try to secure a guarantee that the system would be installed in time and eligible for the credit.”
He is less sure of what to recommend for people who want to buy battery energy storage. He expects that retail prices for batteries will continue to fall to the point that the repeal of the credit won’t be as much of an issue in a year or two as it would be for rooftop solar and other resources.
Fleisher, an attorney who specializes in energy issues, emphasized the urgency of getting rooftop solar before the end of the year because of questions of what the solar industry is going to look like as it tries to adapt to not having the credits.
“I think you’re rolling the dice after the end of this year as to what might happen,” she said. “The business model is built around the tax credit and there’s going to need to be some significant adjustment of that business model before companies can figure out how to make money. It could be rough in the meantime.”
In writing about the rapid expiration of the credits, I’m reminded of how forward-thinking they were. Most of these credits were set to last for a decade before this abrupt reduction in the timetable.
Fleisher noted that the original timetable meant that the credits were going to be around as consumers reached the point in their buying cycle when they needed a new car, heating system or other major purchases.
She suspects that many people will find that their needs didn’t line up precisely enough with the window of when the incentives are available.
“People won’t find out about it until it’s too late,” she said. “People are going to miss the chance.”

Other stories about the energy transition to take note of this week:
PJM Capacity Price Rises Again and Hits Cap as Clean Energy Projects Remain Stalled: Electricity customers are going to see a continuing increase in costs because of results of an auction announced this week in the country’s largest grid region, as my colleague Rambo Talabong reports for ICN. PJM Interconnection—whose territory runs from New Jersey to Illinois—held the auction to set the price that is paid to power plant owners to be available for use by the grid when needed. Growth in electricity demand combined with PJM’s backlog of approvals of grid connections for new energy projects, most of them renewable, are contributing to a scarcity that is driving up prices. The new price, which takes effect next year, is $329.17 per megawatt-day, which hit a price ceiling set by PJM. The upshot is that most customers will see increases in the part of their bills that covers PJM’s services.
Tesla’s Automotive Revenue Falls Again, Even Lower Than Analysts Expected: Tesla had a rough second quarter, reporting on Wednesday that its automotive revenue fell 16 percent compared to a year ago, the second quarter in a row in which sales decreased. This is the second straight quarter of revenue declines as the automaker dealt with challenges tied to the lack of a hot new model and the continuing fallout from CEO Elon Musk’s close association with the Trump administration. The results fell short of analysts’ expectations and added to a string of disappointing news for the company, as Lora Kolodny reports for CNBC.
Trump Has Unleashed a Regulatory Blitz Against Renewables: President Donald Trump has used the powers of his office to try to put up barriers to renewable energy development. A recent example is the requirement disclosed last week that Interior Secretary Doug Burgum or his deputy personally approve renewable energy projects on public lands. Benjamin Storrow reports for E&E News about the administration’s efforts and how they are a significant escalation using the government to slow growth of renewables.
Republican Excitement for Wyoming Rare Earth Mining Contradicts the Party’s Disdain for Renewables: A recent ribbon cutting for Ramaco Resources’ Brook Mine was showcase for Republicans’ dissonance on mining for rare earth minerals, as my colleague Jake Bolster reports for ICN. On one hand, the Trump administration has taken action to encourage U.S. production of rare earth minerals. On the other hand, the administration has been hostile to the products that need these minerals, which can include solar cells and EV batteries.
Can the Rooftop Solar Industry Make Up for Lost Tax Credits by Cutting Costs? One of the big questions as tax credits are about to expire is whether the rooftop solar industry will be able to adjust. Jeff St. John of Canary Media reports on some of the attempts by solar companies to reduce “soft costs” in the process, which includes just about everything other than hard equipment. The industry has long recognized that there is room to cut soft costs, and the companies that survive are likely going to be the ones that figure out how to do it.

Adam Smith, in a congressional hearing, in September 2021 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Rod Lamkey-Pool/Getty Images)U.S. Rep. Adam Smith has been around in Washington state politics a long time. 
A moderate Democrat, he’s been in Congress since 1997, and before that, served in the state Legislature. His 9th Congressional District stretches from parts of Bellevue and south Seattle down to Federal Way and Auburn.
Smith covered many topics in an interview this month with the Standard at a Bellevue Starbucks. 
But as the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, he’s one of his party’s lead thinkers in Congress on national security issues and spoke at length on that topic and overseas conflicts in the Trump era — from his tepid optimism for peace in the Middle East and his one meeting with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.
Looking toward next year’s midterms, Smith faces a challenge from socialist candidate Kshama Sawant, a former Seattle City Council member, who has sharply criticized the congressman’s alignment with U.S. policy supporting Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza.
Reflecting broadly on President Donald Trump’s second term so far, Smith did not have much positive to say. “They are the most insular, the most partisan administration that I’ve ever dealt with,” he said. “It’s not just partisan, it’s authoritarian.”
The following interview was edited for clarity and length.
Let’s start in the Middle East. What do you think we’ll most likely see there in the next couple of years?
The most positive thing that’s happened in the last 20 years is the evolution of Saudi Arabia and the [United Arab Emirates] in terms of dealing with extremism. 
Prior to 9/11, Saudi Arabia was the foremost exporter of radical extremism, and now they are combating it, and the UAE is as well, because their focus is on stability.  
They need stability in the region because people aren’t going to do business if buildings are getting blown up and suicide bombers are showing up all the time. 
With Hezbollah weakened, with [former Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad] gone, there’s the chance that Lebanon and Syria could become stable countries.
They could focus on governing instead of jihad grievances against Israel. But for that to happen, Israel needs to make peace with the Palestinians. So that’s the great unknown. 
What’s Iran going to do? I don’t know, but the region is going to be in a lot better position to unify and put pressure on Iran if we can end the war in Gaza, and if there could be some kind of future for the Palestinian people that involves some element of self-governance.
That’s the real test: Can we get Israel into that type of agreement? That’s what Trump’s trying to do right now. God bless him. I hope he succeeds.
If that goes sideways, then terrorist groups motivated by Israel could become a factor in Syria.  They could have militia groups in Iraq that are aligned with Iran, and then these and others destabilize the government in Iraq. 
So that’s the big challenge, and as far as how that is going to play out, I don’t know, but it’s going to require a considerable amount of diplomatic skill.
You strongly condemned the U.S. strikes in Iran. With a few weeks’ hindsight, has that feeling evolved at all?
No, it was a mistake. I don’t think it was the right policy. I don’t think it was the right approach. 
It seems, for the moment, the risks did not bear out as much as it could have. Sort of like, you drive home drunk and you don’t hit anyone. The lesson from that isn’t that driving home drunk is not a problem.
The bad downside consequences have not yet manifested as greatly as they could have. Iran very easily could have chosen to launch a more aggressive attack. Iran still has the capacity to build nuclear weapons. 
You can make a pretty compelling argument that, after being attacked by Israel and attacked by us, it sort of pushes the scale toward, well, ‘Let’s build a damn thing so we can have an adequate deterrent,’ because the deterrent that Iran thought they had clearly was not sufficient. 
Are you at all optimistic that a diplomatic solution is a possibility in any kind of near future?
It is a possibility. Optimism is fine, but you’ve got to do the work. If the players in the region and if the U.S. choose to play a constructive role, it’s a possibility.
Have you always felt it’s a possibility over the past two years?
Not really. The big changes, and Israel deserves credit for this: Assad’s gone, Hezbollah is weakened and so is Iran. That is a fundamental shift that I will confess I did not see coming. It creates a greater possibility that we’ll get to a more peaceful outcome, but it’s still a region rife with conflict.
Moving to Ukraine. The U.S. paused military shipments. The president didn’t seem to know and didn’t agree. The situation has evolved. What does that tell you?
Have you seen the movie “Die Hard?” 
Yes. 
You know the point in the movie when the guy goes in and tries to cut the deal with the terrorist. “I do billion-dollar deals every day. I can handle this guy. Bunch of Eurotrash.” I think that’s the way Trump felt about Putin. “Come on, I’m Trump, I can cut a deal with this guy.”
I think now Trump’s like, “Oh, f***, maybe not.”
And in this case, Trump’s not going to get shot in the head by Putin, but I think he’s beginning to wake up to the fact that, no, he is not someone who Trump’s magnetic personality is just going to magically melt.
On the Armed Services Committee, we are attempting, and this is a very bipartisan thing — Mike Rogers, who’s the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. He and I are talking and like, “How do we get Trump to make the right call?” A lot of bipartisan support in Congress for this, but it’s just where is the support in the Trump administration? [Vice President] JD Vance is not going to be helpful. [Secretary of State Marco] Rubio could be. [Secretary of Defense Pete] Hegseth, I don’t think he thinks that sophisticatedly. 
So it’s really going to come down to what Trump wants.
He assumed that he could bully Ukraine into cutting a deal, then get a peace agreement that he can take credit for, which showed a fundamental misunderstanding of what was going on.
Russia will take every last inch of Ukraine that they can get away with. The only way to get to peace is to make it clear that they can’t. We actually had some success in that, because the Ukrainians have proved far more tenacious than anyone would have expected, and because the Biden administration put together a 53-nation coalition that helped Ukraine defend itself, that has really driven up the cost substantially for Putin continuing this war. 
Have you had any meetings with Hegseth?
I had one conversation [with Hegseth] when Mike Rogers and I were on the phone with him. We had one meeting with what they like to refer to as the Big Eight senators and House members, where Hegseth was at. Then, of course, I ripped into him the one time he testified before us.  
It’s not just partisan, it’s authoritarian. They don’t want to deal with Congress. In fact, they don’t talk to the Republicans that much.  
Has that been surprising? Were you expecting six months in to be saying it’s more authoritarian than partisan?
It’s not surprising. January 6 happened. It was a failure of imagination, not a failure of will, that stopped [Trump] from overthrowing our Constitution and trying to hold on to the White House.
Trump said what he was going to do. Dictator day one. We should be clear about the fact that Trump is attempting an authoritarian takeover of our government.
Do you feel like you and your colleagues have any power to do anything?
Absolutely. I’m a believer in: “There’s always a way.” 
He has done things that are manifestly unpopular, and the power that we have is to make that argument.
Three-step process. One, go after the authoritarian stuff. 
Two, go after the way his policies are negatively impacting people. 
Third thing is we’ve got to show them an alternative. Democrats got a ton of work to do in that area. 
Sadly, we’re locked in a bit of an ideological struggle. Too many people on the left want to prove that the activist left has never been wrong about anything. And you have too many people in the center who want to prove that centrists have never been wrong about anything, and not enough people are just trying to figure out how we all collectively get better so that we can govern better and win elections. 
We’re still stuck in that past of wanting to make sure everything’s pre-curated, as opposed to being authentic.  
Do you see your own election next year as any sort of microcosm of this debate?
I am downright excited about it because it offers the contrast that I want to offer. 
Do you want to sign up for some utopian revolution to tear down everything in society in the hope that some magical left-wing utopia will emerge from it? Or do you want to get to work in the way that true progressives do?
I think Kshama Sawant is a very smart, articulate person. It will be a fair fight from a pure talent standpoint.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-1235580476-scaled-1-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-07-27 07:56:17.338090
,Mississippi Today,2025-07-27 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Health care in Mississippi could get even worse with new federal law,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/27/health-care-worse-new-federal-law/,"Column: Don’t look now, but thanks to the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill, health care, which by nearly every metric already is bad in Mississippi, is going to get worse.","Don’t look now, but thanks to the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill, health care, which by nearly every metric already is bad in Mississippi, is going to get worse.
While Mississippi annually ranks at or near the bottom for most health care outcomes, in recent years some solace could be taken in the fact that the state’s percentage of people without health insurance had dropped significantly.
That drop can be attributed primarily to the fact that since the COVID-19 pandemic, Mississippians have embraced the Affordable Care Act, better known by many as Obamacare.
The citizens of two solid red or Republican states where the ACA for years was ridiculed embraced Obamacare in breath-taking fashion. Texas, viewed as the North Star by many conservatives, had the largest percentage increase of people enrolling in the ACA’s marketplace or health care exchange to obtain private insurance. Texas’ enrollment increased 255% between 2020 and 2025, followed next by Mississippi with a 242% increase to 338,159 people, according to KFF, a nationwide nonprofit that studies health care policy.
Texas and Mississippi have in common that they have more people eligible to sign up for the marketplace policies because they have not adopted another key ACA component: expanding Medicaid to provide health insurance for primarily the working poor. Texas and Mississippi are among 10 states that have not adopted Medicaid expansion. Nine of those non-Medicaid expansion states, excluding Wisconsin, have among the highest percentage of their populations without health insurance and some of the worst health care outcomes. Even with the strong participation in the ACA marketplace, Texas has the nation’s largest uninsured rate at 18.7%, according to Public Health Watch. Mississippi also is in the bottom 10 at 12.4%.
All that said, the uninsured rate in Mississippi is much better than it was pre-ACA, which was passed in 2010 and fully enacted in 2014.
In the 2024 legislative session, as the Mississippi Legislature finally seriously considered expanding Medicaid with the federal government paying the bulk of the cost to provide health care for primarily the working poor, some leaders said the expansion was not needed because of the ACA marketplace. It was true that the working poor, though not the poorest of the poor, could garner private insurance at little or no cost through the exchanges. It was a powerful argument that prevailed, even though hospital administrators stressed that Medicaid expansion would provide more financial security to their struggling hospitals than would the payments they received through the ACA marketplace’s private insurance.
Still, the ACA marketplace policies did provide coverage, and that coverage was bolstered through legislation passed during the Joe Biden administration that provided enhanced federal subsidies to allow the working poor to obtain the policies at little or no cost.
But those enhanced subsidies were not extended with the One Big Beautiful Bill. Some subsidies will still be available under the new legislation, but on average the payments people will have to pay in Mississippi for the marketplace’s private health insurance policies will increase an estimated $480 per year, according to a 2024 KFF study. Plus, the One Big Beautiful Bill makes it more difficult for people to obtain the policies.
Most public health policy experts and the Congressional Budget Office all agree that the percentage of people without health insurance will dramatically increase thanks to the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill touted by President Donald Trump.
But that news is especially disheartening for many in Mississippi, which has the nation’s highest percentage of unhealthy people.
With fewer people receiving health care coverage through the marketplace and with no Medicaid expansion, those numbers most likely will only get worse in Mississippi.
And the people losing coverage will be those who Republicans in the 2024 session of the Mississippi Legislature claimed they wanted to help: the working poor.
They could still help the working poor by expanding Medicaid in the upcoming 2026 session.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/04190025/3X0A0655-scaled.jpg,,,2025-07-27 07:56:17.338090

Vermont is among 20 states that filed a lawsuit Monday challenging the Trump administration’s decision to restrict the Head Start program based on immigration status, claiming it violates federal law.

For 60 years, all families across the United States, including in Vermont, have had access to Head Start, a federally funded preschool program that has become a national model for positive early learning, health and nutrition outcomes.
On July 10, however, the Trump administration announced the program will require immigration status verification, a new restriction that could affect scores of families enrolled across Vermont. 
“Fundamentally, Head Start programs believe in meeting the needs of all children so they can thrive in adulthood. Head Start programs strive to make every child feel welcome, safe, and supported, and reject the characterization of any child as ‘illegal,’” Christy Swenson, director of Head Start in Vermont, wrote in an email.
The mandate follows a number of hurdles for the program. The Trump administration has threatened its federal funding, a computer glitch led to the temporary suspension of some programs and its staff have endured mass layoffs, the Associated Press reported.
Those programs will be repackaged as federal public benefits, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced earlier this month. The move is part of a broad effort to limit access to federal benefits for immigrants who lack legal status and protect “vital resources for the American people,” Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated.
This comes two months after the department celebrated the 60th anniversary of the federally funded program, when Kennedy said he would “ensure that the next generation of families living in poverty have access to this vital program that offers what they need to thrive.”
Head Start educators in Vermont told VTDigger declined to comment as they wait to receive further guidance. 
Meanwhile, Vermont is among 20 states that filed a lawsuit Monday challenging the Trump administration’s broad demand to screen legal statuses before allowing people to access a slew of federally funded services – from domestic violence shelters to soup kitchens – including Head Start.
According to an agreement reached Friday, the federal government will pause implementation of the new restrictions until at least September 3rd.
The lawsuit claims restricting enrollment based on immigration status violates federal law. Two of the seven programs could be affected by the rule change, while five appear to be exempt based on their private, non-profit status, according to Swenson, who sits on the board of the National Head Start Association.
“I filed the lawsuit because the Trump Administration cannot violate the Constitution or federal law. These unlawful attempts to restrict access to critical safety net programs will harm many of our neighbors here in Vermont and undermine the health and wellbeing of entire communities,” Attorney General Charity Clark wrote in an emailed statement.
The challenge argues the federal government acted unlawfully by issuing these changes without following required procedures under the Administrative Procedure Act, and by misapplying the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act to entire programs rather than to individual benefits. 
The mandate further violates the Constitution’s spending clause by imposing new funding conditions on states without fair notice or consent, the lawsuit states.
More than 750,000 children have access to Head Start programs nationwide this year through schools, non-profits and community organizations, according to the department’s May 19 press release. 
In Vermont, Head Start has more than 12,000 students enrolled across seven programs, employs more than 600 staff, and had a budget of $26.8 million in fiscal year 2024, according to a program factsheet. The programs run by Capstone Community Action in Barre and the Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity in Burlington are the two largest and serve multiple counties. 
The program has far-reaching effects beyond helping the children enrolled, Swenson said. For instance, it also served 203 unhoused families, 17 military members or veterans, 352 fathers and employed 752 families in school or training.
Others denounced the latest federal policy as un-American and difficult to implement because Head Start has for 60 years been open to any child based on their age or their family’s income, regardless of immigration status.
“When we deny children access to early learning opportunities like Head Start, we not only undermine their chances of success in elementary school and beyond, we also place additional pressure on our elementary schools due to the child’s lack of preparedness,” Erica McLaughlin, assistant executive director for the Vermont Principals’ Association, wrote in an email.
As an elementary teacher and principal, she said she saw first-hand the benefits of the program that has historically played a pivotal role in leveling the playing field, giving low-income and marginalized children a strong start to thrive academically, socially and emotionally. This includes access to health screenings, nutrition assistance and early identification of special needs and developmental resources that are “lifelines for children who already face significant barriers and/or have experienced significant trauma.”
“Restricting Head Start access based on immigration status will have profound and far-reaching consequences, especially for our most vulnerable children,” she added.
The effort mainly affects undocumented children and families and those who don’t have paperwork at hand. Some immigrants, such as children of Green Card holders and certain refugees, remain eligible to enroll, but no further guidance has been issued. For now, the classes in Vermont continue.
“Programs funded by U.S. taxpayers must follow federal law in determining eligibility,” a spokesperson with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement. “This ensures fairness and integrity in the use of public resources, particularly in programs that serve vulnerable populations.”
Eligibility will be “based on the immigration status of the child” and new guidance will be issued soon by the Administration for Children and Families, the statement said.
Head Start officials are not sure how to implement the mandate in the interim because they don’t know what documentation would be required to determine U.S. citizenship or legal immigration status, according to Swensen.
“We do not want to see an added burden for children to enter our programs. Many families of our enrolled children do not have legal documentation at hand even though they have been U.S. citizens for generations,” she wrote.
Rebecca Callahan, a professor and researcher of education policy with a focus on immigrant children at the University of Vermont, is concerned about how the rule will impact immigrant families. 
She emphasized the importance of the landmark 1981 Plyler v. Doe Supreme Court decision that guarantees education for all children regardless of immigration status, including undocumented children. 
“The vast majority of our children of foreign-born parents are U.S. citizens themselves. And one of the protections that’s been in place for K-12 and for preschool, for Head Start students, has always been the Plyler v. Doe decision,” she said.
Because the new rule does not distinguish between undocumented parents, undocumented students, Green Card holders, refugees or others who are in the country legally, Callahan said she is worried it will have a chilling effect and deter parents from enrolling their children in the longstanding program.
She referred to recent incidences of federal immigration overreach in Vermont. “They’re blurring everybody together, they’re stopping U.S. citizens,” she said. 
The mandate “hurts our society in the long run,” Callahan said. “These are low-income children and our society is strong because we educate our youngest and are our least able to fend for themselves. That’s why we’ve been a strong society.” 
Gov. Phil Scott has said the focus should not be on law-abiding people, especially children, and that Vermont will continue to be a welcoming place for those seeking a better life for themselves and their families, according to an emailed statement from Scott’s office. 
“It’s long past time for Congress and the President to pass legislation to allow greater pathways to citizenship rather than forcing them to live in the shadows,” the statement reads.

BURLINGTON — Marlene Tromp — the University of Vermont’s new president — says she wants to prioritize in-state student enrollment, collaborate with the Legislature and city leadership, and plans to protect academic freedom in the face of the Trump administration.
Tromp, the former president of Boise State University in Idaho, took the reins in Vermont this month at a precarious time for higher education in the country.
President Donald Trump’s administration has targeted universities like Harvard and Columbia, cut federal research funding, and has cracked down on protests on campus.
Many leaders in higher education have resisted, and in June, hundreds of colleges and universities — UVM included — signed on to a letter protesting the “unprecedented government overreach and political interference.” Other institutions, like Dartmouth, have taken a more neutral stance.
Meanwhile, the University of Vermont faces its own challenges internally, including how it manages in-state versus out-of-state enrollment, how it balances its overall enrollment against the realities of the local housing market, and how it manages budget pressures and tuition rates.
In a wide-raging interview, Tromp spoke with VTDigger about these and other issues.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
VTDigger: This year, the university was designated as an R1 institution. But it coincided with the Trump administration’s pausing, terminating and just general disruption of federal research grants. Could you describe what impact that has had on the university thus far and how the university is working around that?
Marlene Tromp: I don’t want to diminish the real impacts that those disruptions have had and the ways in which that can have real impacts on people and on places. The work that was being done with those grants, it could be vital research to health care. It could be vital research in a community. Those kinds of things are real. 
But it’s a really powerful moment — and this is happening now across higher education in the nation — for people to ask the question: Is this a time for us to ask questions about who we should be partnering with in order to make sure that the research that we do, that’s so valuable to the world, is well-funded and continues?
We’re also not being passive in the face of it. We’ve gone and met with folks, met with agencies and really tried to determine how we can work really actively to ensure that we restore as much of that funding as possible. But I think we have to really think carefully about going forward, how we partner, how we make sure that research is funded.
It’s real. It’s serious. We’ve had an awesome response here so far, and we’re looking forward, thinking about how we can get more creative going forward.
VTD: UVM has one of the lowest percentages of new in-state students of any large public university across the country. But last year, the percentage of enrolled in-state students increased for the second year in a row, bucking a longer-term decline in in-state enrollment. Is that a goal of yours, to continue to increase that, and how would you build off of that?
MT: For the (Vermont) students who choose to apply to college, so many of them apply here, and we accept a huge proportion of those students to UVM. But our population is so small that that really affects who comes to school. Even if we’re doing really well, proportionally, if other states were doing as well with in-state students as we were, they’d have a huge range of in-state students.
We’re actually helping to drive the economy by bringing students in from out of state. In fact, one of the most interesting things I’ve learned since I’ve been here is that for every Vermonter that graduates from UVM, two of their out-of-state peers end up staying and working in Vermont. It really helps for a state that has an upside down population (demographically), to drive the economy, and bring it vigor and vitality and new ideas into the state.
But the other part of your question, is that a priority to me? It’s absolutely a priority to me. Vermont and Wyoming are the only two states in the country that have a population smaller than Washington, D.C. The notion that there are talented people around the state who aren’t considering college or who aren’t considering UVM is significant to me.
The UVM Promise is a program that lets any family that has an income under $100,000, their students can basically come to school tuition free, and that means we’re really opening the doors for access. We want to make sure people know about that program.
But at my last institution, I built a lot of programs that were designed to really reach out into the state and make sure that students that were place bound had an opportunity to think about how they could still engage with the university.
While rural college attendance declined by about 50% nationally after the pandemic, we saw a 20% to 50% increase in those communities where we created a program that was about engaging in rural communities. So, I think there are some opportunities here to make sure people know that this is Vermont’s university, and we want those young people to come to school here.

VTD: Overall enrollment is increasing at UVM. But I wanted to ask about a law that was introduced this legislative session that proposed limiting enrollment to UVM when Burlington’s housing vacancy rate is below 5%. What do you think is the university’s responsibility in terms of managing enrollment against the realities of the housing market? How do you balance that?
MT: I do think the university has a responsibility to think about the community. I think it’s intimately connected to the community. I just met with (Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak) this afternoon, and she and I were talking about this very issue.
One of the things that I explained to her, and it’s probably something that you know about, is the demographic cliff. It’s the decline that we’re seeing in the pipeline of people who will age out (of) high school to be able to come to college. That percentage is declining over time, and (the decline is) the most significant in the Northeast.
There’s some states that are continuing to grow, like California, Texas, Arizona, Idaho, and those states are going to see less impact from the demographic cliff, because there’s so much in-migration to those states, but states around the Northeast are seeing actually a lot of out-migration.
We’re actually aiding the economy by bringing people in, but we also want to be really thoughtful to make sure that we have all the resources here that we need to serve the students, and that we’re partnering with the cities that surround us in ways that help us both thrive.
What happens in Burlington and South Burlington impacts the university and vice versa. In my conversation with the mayor today, one of the things we really talked about is, how can we be the kind of partners that help each other thrive. So that feels actually very exciting and positive to me, and less about a kind of adversarial relationship.
I did a lot of projects at my other institutions that were about how partnerships could actually increase housing options. We were partnering with the city of Boise, which was experiencing a lot of the same challenges. We were partnering with the city to think about how we could create projects that helped alleviate the stressors for both the city and the university.
VTD: That bill never made it far, but if it were to proceed, how would the university handle that?
MT: I would really want to talk to legislators to understand exactly what their concerns revolved around. Let’s actually work together and trace out where the concerns are, and think about how we can work together. I think that allows us to be responsive, and as a land grant institution, one of our great commitments is to the state, and to the well-being of the state, so I take that very seriously, and would want to think about: How do we work together to solve the common problems that we have.
VTD: Last year, the university increased tuition on both out-of-state and in-state students, the first time tuition had been increased for in-state students since 2019. University officials cited rising health care costs — like many other institutions in the state — and the school was forced to use reserve funds to fill a $10 million budget gap. Do you expect another budget gap this year, and do you expect to increase tuition again?
MT: I think we’re going to have to get all the data about our class, about what’s happening federally, because, as you noted, that’s a huge factor in how the university will operate. That’s a factor in our budget.
Whenever it’s possible, I don’t want to raise tuition. Nationally, what’s happened in the last couple of decades is states’ dollars, their public money coming into public universities, have decreased because they’ve had to spend money on a lot of other things. A lot of state monies have gone into things like corrections, health care. So, more of that cost is borne by students and their families. I’m very keenly aware of that.
We have to be really sensitive to those costs because we want to ensure that students have access to education. We also want to give them the best quality education that we can, and it is incumbent upon us to be as smart and creative financially as we can be, so that we can find ways to create efficiencies, reduce our own costs, so that we can become more and more efficient, so we’re not passing on the inflationary costs that every entity in the country has experienced.
We saw record inflation and didn’t even raise tuition here during that period of record inflation. It was only when it became absolutely necessary. I have a lot of respect for the people who made those hard choices to keep those tuition dollars flat. I hope we can continue to do that as much as possible, but as all these things are changing and factors are rolling in, we’re going to have to assess that. But we’re going to keep looking for ways to be really efficient.

VTD: UVM is the second largest employer in the state. When you were officially announced, the university was in a hiring freeze. Is the university still in a hiring freeze?
MT: Everything goes back to that first question you asked: Until we have a little more clarity about what’s going to happen with the federal funding dollars, we just want some of the dust to settle. We realize we may not have absolute certainty about what’s happening, but until some of that dust settles, I think it would be premature for us to lift the freeze.
VTD: There’s been some layoffs recently. An op-ed we published written by co-presidents of UVM Staff United — signed by a coalition of unions — called into question about a half dozen layoffs in various departments at the university. Could you respond to that? And maybe speak to the general economic climate around hiring and employment at the university, and where you draw the line in terms of cuts to staff and employees here?
MT: For me the priority is to care for our community in the best way that we can. We don’t want to create a situation where we have some costs that escalate so much that people can’t afford their own health insurance as these costs escalate.
It’s not a dualistic situation, where we either support our employees or we don’t. There’s so many factors, and it matters to me to be in dialogue with our unions and with our staff association and our faculty association, and to really create some transparency around budget issues so people actually have a deep understanding of how the university is making decisions.
Part of the reason it’s important to me to build a strategic plan is so that we’re all on the same page as a community, and understanding what our priorities are, and caring for our community is one of those priorities
I’m really sensitive to those issues, and nobody wants to go through the loss of people’s jobs. It’s hard on them, it’s hard on their families, it’s hard on the larger community outside of the university. But we don’t know what we’re up against. We have some really challenging issues on the national front that are putting a lot of pressure on the university, but I hope we can bring people together in a dialogue to talk about those.
VTD: I asked you this when you were announced as president, but to put it more pointedly, I’m wondering how much the political climate in Idaho motivated you to search for other jobs? And did the political climate of Vermont specifically draw you here and motivate you to pursue this role?
MT: I’m very conscious about how the institution that I served for a long time is implicated in your question. I felt very fortunate to serve there for six years. And I am so grateful to be in a place that cares so deeply about education and believes in education, and I feel so grateful to be in a place where people care about other people as a very high priority.
I feel really excited to be in a place that values public education, that values higher education, and so for me, it’s a thrill to be here. There’s challenges in every environment. I just went and spoke at a program for new university presidents where I was one of the speakers, and one of the questions people asked in a dozen different ways during that session was, help us understand how what you saw can help us understand what’s happening nationally right now.
We have an obligation to really deeply understand and to move nimbly as we move forward, and so I’m grateful to be in a place that’s committed to those kinds of things.
VTD: I did want to bring up some criticism you faced in your previous role, as detailed in a ProPublica story, that you capitulated to pressure from right-wing state lawmakers around DEI policies. Now that you’re here, in a state with a less hostile Legislature, would you operate differently? And what is your stance on DEI policies at the university, considering that that federal threat still looms?
MT: If you look at the period when that story was written, it was when the very first anti-DEI, anti-CRT legislation was being written in the country. And at that time, I don’t think anyone thought that that was a real threat, or that it was something that could really undermine the functioning of a university.
It comes from a specific moment in time, and it was written by somebody who was from a very progressive place, who had never seen those kinds of things happening before. Now, I think everybody in the country understands: We’ve seen universities make changes that people could have never imagined years ago.
We never compromised on serving our students, serving our faculty or serving our staff, and I am so proud of that because it was a very, very challenging period. There were stories circulating about the university, what our motives were, what we were doing, and we worked really hard, because the misconstruction of what we were doing on campus was so damaging to the university. So, we worked really hard to educate people, and we saw a lot of minds changed over those six years about the services that we were providing and the support that we were giving our students, faculty and staff, and the impact that was having.
I am really grateful that now I’m in a place where there’s people who really don’t see the work that we’re doing to serve our community as somehow disadvantaging other people. That’s an amazing context to operate in. But it was tremendously stressful and tremendously hard to face the mischaracterization of our work all the time.
I wish that there was a more rich national conversation right now because I think it becomes so polarizing so quickly, and it took years for us to help communicate with people in Idaho about what we were really doing.
Things have happened so fast nationally. It hasn’t given people a lot of time to even have the practice of having those conversations. But I believe universities are the place where just those kinds of conversations should happen, and so I think there’s a real opportunity, and I think the University of Vermont can be a real national leader in helping people understand how democracy works, what it means to be engaged in serving people, what freedom of expression and academic freedom are, and I think we can take a step up onto the national stage to do that work. That’s one of the things that excites me about the University of Vermont.
VTD: Students last year camped out on campus to protest the conflict in Gaza. How would you handle a similar protest, one that specifically violates university policy? Would you discipline students for that and how would you handle that type of situation?
MT: I can tell you what my philosophies are because I think so much depends on the specifics of what happens. We met with student groups across the university when I was president at my last institution, and we said, ‘We want you to have the opportunity to express your perspectives. We believe in freedom of speech and academic freedom,’ and there were state laws that prohibited some activities, and we wanted to educate them about the state laws because we wanted them to feel safe too.
We also recognize that there can be powerful collisions when people disagree. So one of the things we were very concerned about was making sure people really understood the (state) laws in our case and the policies that we had on campus. We often reached out to make sure that we were communicating those things with people, but we kept a lot of really open dialogue.
VTD: What would your stance or your strategy be if the Trump administration were to attack the University of Vermont?
MT: My priority is to protect academic freedom, freedom of speech, the work of our faculty and staff, and our students.
A lot of times that filters down to individual choices. So for example, does the faculty member think that what they’re doing is so important they need to take a stand? I want to support that.
I want to protect people’s academic freedom to make those choices, and that’s the hill we have to stand on. That’s what makes universities what they are.

This story by Liberty Darr was first published in The Citizen on July 24.
For Charlotte residents Shawn Dumont and his two kids, peace signs are more than just a symbol. Each one, they’ve found, also tells a unique story.
So, the Dumonts started documenting them. But quickly, the journey shifted from a pastime summer hobby — finding peace signs and photographing them — to discovering the essence of Vermont, and an ethos grounded in community, culture and the enduring spirit of the back-to-the-land movement. The exhibition, “Peace Signs of Vermont: The Visual Legacy of the Back-to-the-Land Movement,” runs at the Karma Bird House at 47 Maple Street in Burlington Monday-Saturday, through the end of August.
“We are peace people,” reads a mural hand-painted on the gallery wall by Dumont’s kids, Zoë and Jasper, ages 9 and 4. That’s what the family is known for around those parts as of lately. However, Dumont has an even deeper connection to the Burlington art scene, much of which is rooted in the same building where the exhibition is located. He also was the art director for Burton Snowboards for ten years.
His latest creative endeavor: crisscrossing across the entire state of Vermont with his kids in search of peace signs. And it turns out, once you start seeing them, they are almost unavoidable.
“I was just like, what makes this piece so special?” Dumont said, his kids sitting next to him, sipping on chocolate milk. “What makes it so incredible? The peace sign just became this symbol of that. It was so obvious.”
But the journey didn’t just involve stopping to take a passing picture of any given peace sign — usually located on someone’s house, barn or even mowed into the grass. It also involved a conversation with the owner about the symbol and what it means for them.
“I have this deep understanding of graphics and design symbols, and I had sort of had a tertiary respect for the peace sign, but then you meet the people who put them on their house, and then you’re just like, this really is significant,” Dumont said.

The interaction usually stood in stark contrast to how people nowadays communicate. Rather than sending a direct message over social media or a quick text through a cell phone, the family would knock on strangers’ doors and strike up a conversation.
And people, the Dumonts discovered, were always up for a chat.
“There’s this cool tension (initially), but then every single time we would meet these people, there was just beautiful kindness,’ Dumont said.
A lot of the people the Dumonts found were in their 70s, many of whom came to the state as part of the back-to-the-land movement. Others were younger people who came to Vermont more recently, but still in search of that same lifestyle.

He noted people like April Cornell, the designer, and Robin Lloyd, Burlington activist and philanthropist who co-founded the Peace & Justice Center, as some prominent names whose peace signs have found themselves on the exhibition wall.
But among some of the more well-known peace sign carriers are the people who have laid the foundation for the state in a quieter way.
“Like the people who moved up here and then started running the library. I get goosebumps,” he said. “Because maybe they’re not living these big lives, but they’re super important. They’re raising kids here who understand how important it is to take care of your environment and how important food systems are and how important it is to take care of our waterfront and make sure that it’s for everybody.
“We’re living in such a unique, wonderful place because of the foundation that they laid for us.”
Part of his mission now, through this art display, has been to tell those stories.
But while the family has been retelling these stories through photographs, they have also been writing their own story. As Dumont puts it, the summer months in Vermont aren’t for screen time and staying in the house; it’s about family time and for them, setting off in any given direction with no plan in mind, just seeing what adventure might be before them.
“My wife was like, the fact that you found something you get to do with your kids that fills your creative cup is really the biggest gift,” he said.

Twenty-eight-year-old Michaela Bonner has been working 12-hour shifts as an emergency medical technician in Norfolk, Virginia, for the past four years, while attending and paying for college to finish her prerequisites for medical school.
But now that President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending law bars students from borrowing more than $50,000 annually in unsubsidized federal loans for medical school, Bonner is worried her dream of becoming a doctor is financially out of reach.
“I get told, ‘Well, we really need you. We have a physician shortage, and you’ve done all this work leading up to this point,’ and that’s true as well, and it’s not that I want to quit,” Bonner said in a recent interview. “But there are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can’t take out the full cost of living through loans.”
The tax and spending law includes provisions that significantly alter the student loan process for higher education. The law halts current student loan repayment plans for loans that are granted on or after July 1, 2026. On that date, the law also terminates Grad PLUS loans, which have helped people pay for their higher education degrees and total cost of attendance. Current borrowers will be grandfathered in.
The federal law gives current borrowers enrolled in loan repayment plans for students based on income — such as those plans known as SAVE or IBR — until July 1, 2028, to switch to a new plan. Interest collection will resume Aug. 1 for students enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE plan.
At the same time, medical or law school students hoping to get unsubsidized federal loans — in which the borrower is responsible for paying the interest at all times rather than the government — will only be able to borrow $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in areas such as history or philosophy have a $100,000 lifetime cap.












There are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can't take out the full cost of living through loans.


– Michaela Bonner, aspiring medical student




The average yearly cost of medical school for the 2024-25 academic year ranged from around $42,000 to $72,000, depending on whether the school was private or public and whether the student was a resident or nonresident, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Some congressional Republicans say that students need to be working harder to pay for higher education, like medical school, on their own. Others say the caps put the onus back on colleges and universities to rein in the rising cost of tuition. But critics of this legislation say the loan caps are only going to harm students, especially from lower-income backgrounds, and will exacerbate physician shortages.
In recent years states have tried to ease physician shortages by implementing various policy solutions. Since 2023, at least nine states have made it easier for doctors trained in other countries to get medical licenses. States have also participated in interstate licensing compacts, allowing nurses and physician assistants to travel across state lines to work, so long as they are licensed in one state within the compact.
 Over 20 states passed laws for medical student loan forgiveness. Idaho refused to expand its program focused on rural doctors.

For student loan relief, more than 20 states have enacted legislation to address student loan forgiveness, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a group that tracks states policies. Georgia passed a measure that will expand a cancelable loan program for physicians working in rural and underserved areas. Idaho also created the Rural Nursing Loan Repayment Program, offering nurses $25,000 in forgivable loans after three years of service in a rural area.
Idaho budget committee rejects governor’s request to expand physician recruitment program

McKenzie Richards, a health care policy fellow at the conservative think tank Cicero Institute who has been studying the pace of physician shortages, told Stateline that the national physician shortage could potentially exceed 100,000 by 2034. At the end of 2024 that projected number was closer to 64,000 physicians.
Richards said states will be looking toward more policy solutions should the student loan changes exacerbate physician shortages.
“We know what’s going to be happening coming down the line in just five years, so I think policies that states can adopt to get out of this are really important to be looking at now,” she said.
“The hope is that by capping [federal loans], it will encourage schools to lower tuition prices,” Richards added. “Then maybe they need to be admitting more students, which would have a great downstream effect for getting more doctors through.”
Other students will be in the same boat, said Lesley Turner, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Chicago and an economist.
“This is going to hit some students worse than others,” Turner told Stateline. “Those [students] in more expensive programs tend to borrow more, and so for those students they will need to return to private student loans or other ways of financing their graduate education.”
Many students were already questioning their capacity to go to medical school before the student loan caps, said Shannon Jimenez, dean of the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine.
“I expect that this bill, this cap, is going to push people out of primary care and into specialties to help pay off those higher interest rate loans,” Jimenez told Stateline. She added that caps will likely deter students from lower socioeconomic statuses from going into primary care — important in places like Arkansas, where she says there is a “maldistribution of physicians.”
“Many schools like us try to attract those students, because they’re more likely to go into primary care and serve in underserved areas. So it’s going to tie our hands in a lot of ways.”
Hospital CEO says Idaho Legislature not doing enough to support medical workforce

 Large and rural states will be most affected, expert says

Large states and more rural states will feel the gaps more deeply, said Richards, of the Cicero Institute. Louisiana, for example, is projected to be short almost 5,000 doctors from a variety of specialties by 2030, including close to 400 primary care doctors. Already more than a third of Louisiana physicians are close to retirement age — similar to the situation in neighboring Arkansas.
As for whether schools will just be able to lower tuition, Jimenez said, “it makes no sense.”
“We still function in a somewhat market-driven economy and have to compete with other schools around us, so our cost is based mostly on what we have to pay our faculty, and that’s not going to go down,” she said. The annual cost of attendance at her school is between $80,000 and $85,000.
Bonner, the EMT, holds a political communications degree from Regent University and now is studying biomedical sciences at Old Dominion University. She already has $20,000 in loans, she said, and for the rest of college tuition, she has paid out of pocket. Since she’s supporting herself, she hasn’t been able to save much.
She’d planned to take the medical school entrance exam next spring, but now worries about how she’d pay for living expenses while attending. “Medical school scheduling doesn’t allow for working, so you have to take out loans for living expenses,” she said.
“A lot of people, I feel, would be panicked if you had worked for eight to 10 years of your life and found out that all the systems that you were banking on in a really academically challenging space are disappearing,” Bonner said.
“I don’t see a path forward for certain, but I’m fighting to make one.”

(Photo by Jnaiah Price)Twenty-eight-year-old Michaela Bonner has been working 12-hour shifts as an emergency medical technician in Norfolk, Virginia, for the past four years, while attending and paying for college to finish her prerequisites for medical school.
But now that President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending law bars students from borrowing more than $50,000 annually in unsubsidized federal loans for medical school, Bonner is worried her dream of becoming a doctor is financially out of reach.
“I get told, ‘Well, we really need you. We have a physician shortage, and you’ve done all this work leading up to this point,’ and that’s true as well, and it’s not that I want to quit,” Bonner said in a recent interview. “But there are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can’t take out the full cost of living through loans.”
The tax and spending law includes provisions that significantly alter the student loan process for higher education. The law halts current student loan repayment plans for loans that are granted on or after July 1, 2026. On that date, the law also terminates Grad PLUS loans, which have helped people pay for their higher education degrees and total cost of attendance. Current borrowers will be grandfathered in.
The federal law gives current borrowers enrolled in loan repayment plans for students based on income — such as those plans known as SAVE or IBR — until July 1, 2028, to switch to a new plan. Interest collection will resume Aug. 1 for students enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE plan.
At the same time, medical or law school students hoping to get unsubsidized federal loans — in which the borrower is responsible for paying the interest at all times rather than the government — will only be able to borrow $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in areas such as history or philosophy have a $100,000 lifetime cap.
The average yearly cost of medical school for the 2024-25 academic year ranged from around $42,000 to $72,000, depending on whether the school was private or public and whether the student was a resident or nonresident, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Some congressional Republicans say that students need to be working harder to pay for higher education, like medical school, on their own. Others say the caps put the onus back on colleges and universities to rein in the rising cost of tuition. But critics of this legislation say the loan caps are only going to harm students, especially from lower-income backgrounds, and will exacerbate physician shortages.
In recent years states have tried to ease physician shortages by implementing various policy solutions. Since 2023, at least nine states have made it easier for doctors trained in other countries to get medical licenses. States have also participated in interstate licensing compacts, allowing nurses and physician assistants to travel across state lines to work, so long as they are licensed in one state within the compact.
For student loan relief, more than 20 states have enacted legislation to address student loan forgiveness, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a group that tracks states policies. Georgia passed a measure that will expand a cancelable loan program for physicians working in rural and underserved areas. Idaho also created the Rural Nursing Loan Repayment Program, offering nurses $25,000 in forgivable loans after three years of service in a rural area.
McKenzie Richards, a health care policy fellow at the conservative think tank Cicero Institute who has been studying the pace of physician shortages, told Stateline that the national physician shortage could potentially exceed 100,000 by 2034. At the end of 2024 that projected number was closer to 64,000 physicians.
Richards said states will be looking toward more policy solutions should the student loan changes exacerbate physician shortages.
“We know what’s going to be happening coming down the line in just five years, so I think policies that states can adopt to get out of this are really important to be looking at now,” she said.
“The hope is that by capping [federal loans], it will encourage schools to lower tuition prices,” Richards added. “Then maybe they need to be admitting more students, which would have a great downstream effect for getting more doctors through.”
Other students will be in the same boat, said Lesley Turner, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Chicago and an economist.
“This is going to hit some students worse than others,” Turner told Stateline. “Those [students] in more expensive programs tend to borrow more, and so for those students they will need to return to private student loans or other ways of financing their graduate education.”
Many students were already questioning their capacity to go to medical school before the student loan caps, said Shannon Jimenez, dean of the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine.
“I expect that this bill, this cap, is going to push people out of primary care and into specialties to help pay off those higher interest rate loans,” Jimenez told Stateline. She added that caps will likely deter students from lower socioeconomic statuses from going into primary care — important in places like Arkansas, where she says there is a “maldistribution of physicians.”
“Many schools like us try to attract those students, because they’re more likely to go into primary care and serve in underserved areas. So it’s going to tie our hands in a lot of ways.”
Large states and more rural states will feel the gaps more deeply, said Richards, of the Cicero Institute. Louisiana, for example, is projected to be short almost 5,000 doctors from a variety of specialties by 2030, including close to 400 primary care doctors. Already more than a third of Louisiana physicians are close to retirement age — similar to the situation in neighboring Arkansas.
As for whether schools will just be able to lower tuition, Jimenez said, “it makes no sense.”
“We still function in a somewhat market-driven economy and have to compete with other schools around us, so our cost is based mostly on what we have to pay our faculty, and that’s not going to go down,” she said. The annual cost of attendance at her school is between $80,000 and $85,000.
Bonner, the EMT, holds a political communications degree from Regent University and now is studying biomedical sciences at Old Dominion University. She already has $20,000 in loans, she said, and for the rest of college tuition, she has paid out of pocket. Since she’s supporting herself, she hasn’t been able to save much.
She’d planned to take the medical school entrance exam next spring, but now worries about how she’d pay for living expenses while attending. “Medical school scheduling doesn’t allow for working, so you have to take out loans for living expenses,” she said.
“A lot of people, I feel, would be panicked if you had worked for eight to 10 years of your life and found out that all the systems that you were banking on in a really academically challenging space are disappearing,” Bonner said.
“I don’t see a path forward for certain, but I’m fighting to make one.”

Jon Ossoff after a private phone call with Gov. Brian Kemp, who told King and other candidates he would not support their campaigns as he works behind the scenes to anoint a preferred candidate. “I got into the U.S. Senate […]","Gov. Brian Kemp is reportedly working behind the scenes in support of his preferred U.S. Senate candidate, Derek Dooley, a former coach at the University of Tennessee. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGeorgia Insurance Commissioner John King on Thursday suspended his bid to challenge Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff after a private phone call with Gov. Brian Kemp, who told King and other candidates he would not support their campaigns as he works behind the scenes to anoint a preferred candidate.
“I got into the U.S. Senate race to beat Jon Ossoff, not distract from the mission,” King said in a statement shared on X. “Right now it’s clear there’s little path forward to the nomination, so today I’m suspending my campaign.”
He said he now plans to run for a second full term as insurance commissioner.
King, a Spanish-fluent native of Mexico, was appointed to his post by Kemp in 2019 and became the state’s first elected Hispanic statewide official when he secured a full term in 2022. He was previously a street cop before working his way up to police chief in Doraville, a majority-Hispanic suburb of Atlanta.
He also came into the race with an extensive military background, having spent a combined four decades in the U.S. Army and the National Guard. His missions included deployments to the Middle East, building pop-up hospitals during the coronavirus pandemic and cracking down on illegal immigration at the U.S. border with Mexico, according to his campaign website.
Despite his impressive resume, his campaign left a lot to be desired. He lacked the financial resources of his rivals and wasn’t able to unite the party’s competing factions: MAGA diehards who prioritize loyalty to President Donald Trump and establishment-minded conservatives who would much rather talk about things like tax cuts.
His exit comes as the governor is said to be working the phones in support of Derek Dooley, a former coach at Tennessee and the son of the late Georgia coaching legend Vince Dooley. It’s not clear when or if the younger Dooley will join the contest, but he is lining up a political team full of staunch Kemp allies and has been sounding a lot more political in interviews despite having never run for office before.
Kemp might have nudged King out of the race, but his involvement doesn’t seem to be deterring other candidates — at least not yet. U.S. Rep. Earl “Buddy” Carter, a wealthy pharmacist, was the first to enter the contest in an effort to try and lock up the MAGA lane, even switching a lot of his social media photos to pictures of himself sharing a thumbs-up with the president.
The St. Simons Island Republican’s campaign did not hold back when asked about Kemp’s involvement: “Politicians don’t elect our Senators,” his campaign said. “The people of Georgia do.”
After announcing that he wouldn’t run himself, Kemp had committed to working with the White House toward a consensus candidate. But his moves behind the scenes to elevate the former Volunteers coach have “frustrated and p—d off” those close to the president, as one advisor said to Fox News.
And U.S. Rep. Mike Collins, who has been hinting at a Senate run for months, seems likely to enter the race within days. A trucking company owner from Butts County, Collins’ father Mac spent most of the 1990s representing the same northeast Georgia district his son now holds.
Collins’ support for immigration crackdowns and his bombastic presence on social media have made him something of a celebrity in MAGA world, which means the party could be headed for the proxy war it wanted to avoid. The conservative congressman was also an early supporter of Trump’s 2016 bid for the White House, while Dooley doesn’t appear to have much of a voting history.
“When Mike Collins enters the race, he will likely become the frontrunner,” says Martha Zoller, a radio host who is close with the governor. “His work on the Laken Riley Act cannot be underestimated regarding how that resonates with Republican primary voters.”
Zoller added that the candidates are only speaking to primary voters right now and suggested that whoever wins the primary will need to recalibrate before going toe-to-toe with the well-funded Ossoff.
“The general election is a whole different ball game.”

This story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center.
When Jarvis Parker was looking to buy a house in Waterbury in late 2019, he had several basic criteria.
He wanted to avoid properties with leaking roofs and flooded basements. And he needed a place with enough space for himself, his daughter and his now 4-year-old grandson.
The modest two-bedroom home that Parker eventually purchased in Waterbury’s East End checked all of those boxes.
Five years later, however, he’s confronting a problem he never saw coming: a potentially toxic water line. 
Parker was informed this year that a small pipe known as a service line, which connects his house to the larger water main that runs under the street, could be made of lead.

The news stunned Parker, a disabled military veteran. He was so concerned about the water line and what it could do to his family’s health that he stopped using the tap water until he could purchase a filter to install on his kitchen sink.
“I got things going on that the doctors can’t even figure out,” Parker said. “And now you tell me that I’ve got bad water, lead water coming in?” 
“That right there really scared me,” he added.
Home builders and water utilities were banned in the mid-1980s from using lead plumbing in order to prevent the toxic metal from leaching into tap water and poisoning children and adults.

But as Parker and thousands of people across Connecticut recently learned, there are a significant number of lead service lines installed before 1986 still supplying homes, apartments and other properties in the state. 
New data obtained by The Connecticut Mirror shows there could be as many as 8,000 lead service lines still in use in public water systems throughout the state — though that number is likely to change as water utilities continue to inspect basements, unearth pipes and comb through century-old records to verify how much lead remains in the ground. 
The data provides the first public look at how many people in Connecticut could be consuming water that travels through lead lines. And it highlights how that aging infrastructure is not distributed equally throughout the state. 
A majority of the suspected lead lines are located in lower-income neighborhoods in Bridgeport, Willimantic, Middletown, New London and Waterbury, places that have significant Black and Hispanic populations and are designated by the state as environmental justice communities.
Still, Connecticut’s wealthier suburbs were not spared entirely. More than 1,500 lead lines are also suspected in Greenwich, one of the state’s wealthiest enclaves.
The push to identify lead service lines in Connecticut is the result of a new federal regulation implemented in the aftermath of the Flint water crisis.
That federal rule, which was finalized in late 2024, requires public water utilities across the country — both large and small — to create an inventory of every lead service line in their systems and to replace all of those pipes within the next decade. 
The success of that mission, however, could depend on whether the new federal regulation can survive a legal challenge filed by the country’s largest water utility association and possible efforts by President Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans to roll back the new rule. 
A team of CT Mirror reporters spent more than six months reviewing records, analyzing data, knocking on doors and talking to residents and experts in order to understand the scope of the problem in Connecticut. 
While it is not yet known how Connecticut compares to other parts of the country, the numbers clearly show the state has a lot of work to do before all of the aging lead pipes are out of the ground. 
The data on the lead lines was contained in hundreds of reports assembled by the state’s water utilities and submitted to the Connecticut Department of Public Health, which regulates drinking water safety.
The properties flagged in that data include a variety of locations that serve young children, who are at the greatest risk of developmental delays from lead poisoning.  
The CT Mirror found examples where in-home daycares, a local Boys and Girls Club and older elementary schools were listed among the properties with suspected lead lines. That includes Waterbury’s Margaret M. Generali and Frank Regan elementary schools, which predominantly serve students of color.

The number of lead lines located in minority communities was expected. In fact, officials with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency predicted much of the country’s leftover lead plumbing would be found in lower-income and minority neighborhoods, where there is older housing stock and a lack of investment.
U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal referenced that reality during a press conference in New London last year, arguing that the state and federal government had a “moral obligation” to remove every remaining lead service line.
“There is a real environmental justice issue here. It’s the dark side of this problem,” Blumenthal said while brandishing a lead pipe that had just been pulled from a home. “Much of this danger is determined by the ZIP code where a child lives, and all too often it’s a ZIP code that affects children of color.”

Questions and concerns
The leaders of some of Connecticut’s largest water utilities said that further inspections and investigations will be required before they can get a true count of how many lead service lines remain in their systems. 
They also emphasized that they treat their water with what are known as corrosion inhibitors — compounds that help prevent service lines and older plumbing from leaching significant amounts of lead into people’s drinking water. 
Even so, several engineers and former regulators interviewed for this story warned that the aging lines pose a risk to people’s health. And they noted that treating the water supply does not guarantee that lead from older service lines won’t end up in the tap water. That’s especially true if the pipes are disturbed during sidewalk and road repairs or when the water in a building isn’t used every day, like in the cases of schools and daycares. 
“Corrosion control does help reduce the amount of lead that gets into water. It does not prevent lead from getting into water,” said Elin Betanzo, a professional engineer who helped uncover the Flint water crisis in 2014, which set off a public reckoning over lead contamination in drinking water. 
You can’t see, taste or smell lead in water. So the best way to ensure lead service lines aren’t poisoning people, Betanzo said, is to remove the pipes from the ground.  
That’s exactly what the new federal drinking water regulations, which were enacted under President Joe Biden’s administration, are expected to do. 
The EPA set a deadline late last year that requires any water utility serving at least 25 people to identify and remove every lead service line within the next 10 years — a monumental undertaking that is expected to cost tens of billions of dollars. 
In the meantime, utilities in Connecticut are sending out notices advising customers with confirmed or suspected lead lines to purchase water filters or to flush their sinks for several minutes before consuming the water.
Those notices have ignited concerns and sowed confusion among some Connecticut residents, like Parker. The Waterbury resident doesn’t understand why he is just learning that the water line for his home is potentially made of lead. 
“How can you give certain people lead-filled water and not even come and test the water or do nothing?” Parker asked. 
“Who’s checking? Who’s doing rounds and telling us?” he added.

Gaps in communication
The CT Mirror spent months knocking on doors at properties with suspected lead service lines, and the reactions from residents at those locations varied from town to town and street to street. 
Some said they’d recently been notified that their service line might need to be replaced, while others said they’ve known for years that their property was supplied by a lead service line.
Bill Flaherty, a Willimantic resident, said he learned about the lead line supplying his house in the southeast end of town after utility crews unearthed it during a water main replacement years ago. But he said utility officials repeatedly told him not to worry about it because the water was being treated to prevent corrosion. 
Flaherty said he began to question that, however, after he received a notice in the mail last year informing him that utility officials wanted to replace his service line and the more than 300 other lead lines that remained in town.
Denise Deleon, a 48-year-old Waterbury resident, said she did not receive a notice that her apartment had a suspected lead service line, and she would remember seeing that type of information, since she has a history of dealing with lead exposure.
Years ago, while she was living in New York City, Deleon said her daughter began struggling to concentrate in school, and doctors found elevated levels of lead in her blood. As a result, Deleon said her family moved out of their home in the Bronx to prevent her daughter from being further exposed. 
While her daughter is now grown, Deleon was troubled to learn that her community may be home to hundreds of lead water lines. She worries what effect those lines could have on the kids she sees playing in her neighborhood. 
“I see a lot of children around here, and I’m concerned because I went through that,” said Deleon. “I think about the children around here and if it’s going to affect them the same way it affected my daughter.”

The gaps in communication surrounding lead service lines did not surprise Arthur Denze Sr., a lifelong Waterbury resident. People in Waterbury, he said, have been dealing with environmental hazards for decades, including concerns about air pollution and other contamination from old industrial sites. 
“Years ago, we fought tooth and nail against a lot of companies coming in and polluting the area,” said Denze, 87, head of a council that represents the city’s neighborhood associations. “I used to get out of work at night, and a smokestack was sending plumes up. You could see it all the way down the valley. We probably have some of the highest asthma rates in the state.” 
He said the city’s water department could be more proactive in informing residents about lead lines and potential health risks that come along with them.
“That should be discussed within the city. It’s a big item. God knows how much they used [lead lines] years ago,” Denze said. 
Bradley Malay, the superintendent of Waterbury’s Water Department, said the city sent out notices to properties with suspected lead lines earlier this year. It also provided information about lead service lines to every water customer in the utility’s most recent water quality report. 
Malay emphasized that the city is in the very early stages of identifying potential lead service lines, and he said it was largely relying on historical records, which can sometimes be unreliable or out of date.  
The city, Malay added, is currently developing a multi-year plan for how to replace the lead lines it finds, and he said the city intends to prioritize line replacements at schools and similar locations first.

‘What do we have to do to protect ourselves?’
Many of the properties that CT Mirror reporters visited for this story were older, three-story walkup apartments and brick duplexes built in the early 1900s — places where tenants are also at heightened risk of exposure to lead paint.
The EPA published research in recent years that found census tracts where lead service lines are located often have higher percentages of renters, low-income residents and people of color.
Federal officials also produced studies that suggest the owners of rental properties are not always as engaged in the conversations and activities surrounding lead service line replacements, partly because they are not the ones drinking the water. 
That has not been a problem in Greenwich, however, where most of the suspected lead lines are supplying single-family homes. 

The news that hundreds of properties in Greenwich could contain a lead service line drew significant attention in the town, where the median household income is $180,000 per year and more than 60% of the housing is owner-occupied.
Jill Boullin, a homeowner in Greenwich’s southwest corner, said she was surprised by the letter she received from Aquarion Water late last year identifying her home as one the properties with a suspected lead line. 
“The next thought was, what do we have to do to protect ourselves?” said Boullin, who has two young children, ages 2 and 5.
Bouillin, who closed on her house in 2024, said she quickly contacted the town’s state-certified laboratory to purchase a water testing kit. But by that point, she said, the lab had already been swamped by other homeowners who were seeking to verify that their water was safe to drink. 
“They were overrun with the amount of people calling,” said Bouillin, who is now weighing whether to purchase a water filtration system for her and her family.

Warnings
Many of the lead service lines flagged in Connecticut have been in place for more than a century.  
The data collected by water utilities shows many were installed between the 1870s and early 1930s, long before the federal ban on lead plumbing. 
Lead was used during that time frame because it’s pliable, which made it ideal for snaking under sidewalks and into basements. It is also durable, which is why the federal government estimates there are still between 6 million to 10 million lead service lines in the ground nationwide.
“Lead service lines and lead bearing plumbing have basically been forced on people,” said Yanna Lambrinidou, a co-founder of the national nonprofit Campaign for Lead Free Water. “People did not go to the store and choose lead service lines.” 
“Lead lines in many cases were imposed through local plumbing codes and local laws that made them mandatory, or that made them at least one of the acceptable materials until they were banned,” she added. “People were never really told what the health risks would be in essentially using a lead straw to pull in water to drink and cook with.”
Public health officials and advocates warned for decades about the threat those forgotten lead lines could pose to human health. There were high-profile examples over the years, including in Washington, D.C., that highlighted the damage that can be done to children and communities when lead service lines are allowed to corrode and poison people’s drinking water. 
But it wasn’t until after the Flint water crisis that federal officials acted by requiring utilities to identify and replace all of the remaining lead service lines in the country. 
Flint was a worst-case scenario. Tens of thousands of children and adults were exposed to high levels of lead after the city switched the source of its drinking water to the Flint River and failed to properly treat the water to prevent corrosion in lead service lines and other plumbing. 
In the end, the crisis resulted in a massive spike in the number of children in Flint with elevated levels of lead in their blood. 
Betanzo, who now runs a company that consults on drinking water safety, said Flint is a dramatic example, but it is also an indicator of what can happen in any community where lead service lines are allowed to remain in the ground. 
“Every time there’s lead in the pipes, there is a risk of lead in the water,” Betanzo said. “There is no need for anyone to drink lead in their water.”
“The issue in Flint is that we used children as our warning system,” she added. “And once you test it in children, it’s too late.”

A quiet threat
Lead is not like iron and zinc, which people need trace amounts of. There is no safe level of lead in the human body. 
In adults, lead can affect kidney function and can contribute to cardiovascular problems. And in children, elevated lead levels can cause developmental delays, learning difficulties and behavioral problems. 
When someone swallows lead particles, the metal accumulates in the body. It gets stored over time in the blood, bones and organs. 
Lead-based paint, which was widely used on homes built before the late 1970s, is the biggest contributor to lead poisoning in children throughout the United States.
More than 66,000 children in Connecticut were tested for lead in 2023, the most recent year that data is available. And more than 1,600 of them had lead in their blood above 3.5 micrograms per deciliter, which is the new reference level for when cases get flagged. 
Local health officials also performed inspections on 96 different properties that year in an attempt to identify the source of the lead poisoning cases. None of those cases was attributed to lead in water. 
But public health experts said lead service lines represent another potential source of lead exposure, and the EPA estimates that drinking water can make up 20% or more of a person’s total exposure to lead.
Dr. Carl Baum, a pediatrician who has treated lead poisoning cases in Connecticut for more than 20 years, said infants who are consuming baby formula that is mixed with tap water are at the greatest risk from lead water lines. Another vulnerable population is pregnant women. 
Baum, the director of the lead poisoning treatment center at Yale New Haven Children’s Hospital, said the only foolproof way to protect infants and other people from lead service lines is to eliminate the source of potential exposure. 
Lead exposure, Baum explained, is often a silent disease, meaning parents and doctors don’t realize there is a problem until lab testing finds elevated levels of lead in a child’s blood. In Connecticut, the state has a universal testing requirement. 
All children between nine months and 35 months must be tested annually for lead in their blood. There are further testing requirements for children who are at heightened risk. 
“Unfortunately, we use kids as biological monitors,” Baum said. “We are allowing kids to go into homes where there is a probability that there is lead either in the water or in the paint and we wait until they get a lead level checked and then we say, ‘Oh, this kid is lead poisoned.’” 
David Cash, the former regional administrator for the EPA in New England, said the quiet threat that lead poses to children is why the Biden administration adopted regulations that require lead service lines to be removed within the next decade. 
“If we care about children’s health and neurological development and success in school, then we should care very much about this,” Cash said. 
“You know, having a kid who grows up with full mental and neurological abilities is great for that kid and great for their family,” he said. “But it’s also great for the community, great for the economy.”

‘We saw the writing on the wall’
Connecticut’s community water systems, which collectively serve more than three quarters of the state’s population, are at varying stages of pinpointing and eliminating their lead service lines.
In New London, contractors are already in the process of ripping out and replacing more than 500 lead service lines identified in the city. The city was celebrated in recent years — including at an event at the Biden White House — as one of the most proactive municipalities in the country when it comes to addressing its aging lead lines.
“We saw the writing on the wall after Flint that this was going to become a major problem,” said Joseph Lanzafame, New London’s Director of Public Utilities. 
Other utilities, however, are just beginning to research how much lead remains in their systems. 
Some of the state’s water systems told state regulators late last year that they were not sure what most of their service lines are made of. 
The Southington Water Department, for instance, classified 89% of its service lines as “lead status unknown.” The Manchester Water Department listed 81% of its service lines in the same category. And in Meriden, the city’s water division, said it was uncertain about 84% of its roughly 20,000 service lines.
Dr. Manisha Juthani, Connecticut’s public health commissioner, said those cases highlight the difficulty many utilities are facing, especially when there isn’t historical documentation about each service line.
“For some, it’s very challenging,” Juthani said. “They’re going back to records — literally, paper cards and things — from the 1800s.” 
William Norton, Meriden’s director of public utilities, said his team recently asked property owners to help document what their water lines are made of by taking photographs of the pipes where they enter people’s homes. And the utility’s employees are excavating several hundred service lines this year to confirm whether they contain lead.
Many utilities are also using computer modeling and machine learning to help predict where lead service lines are located, based on the age of a home or whether other properties on that street have a confirmed lead line.

Officials with the Metropolitan District Commission and Regional Water Authority, which provide drinking water to more than 800,000 people in and around Hartford and New Haven, said they do not expect to find a large number of lead lines in their systems based on the modeling they’ve done up to this point.
The MDC, which serves the Hartford region, told state regulators that it was confident that roughly 86% of its service lines were lead free. And the Regional Water Authority, which covers all of New Haven, similarly reported that at least 93% of its more than 125,000 service lines did not contain lead. 
Meanwhile, Aquarion Water, which serves a large portion of Fairfield County, is estimating it could find nearly 4,000 lead lines in Bridgeport and surrounding towns, based on its current projections.

A financial burden
Identifying the lead lines is difficult enough, but utility officials said replacing all those pipes is likely to be an even bigger feat. 
In many systems, water customers own at least part of the service lines — meaning utilities need permission from each property owner before they can begin pulling lead from the ground.
Utility officials said tracking down hundreds or thousands of property owners is an enormous challenge, especially in cities where there are a substantial number of rental properties and absentee landlords. 
But the biggest impediment to replacing all of Connecticut’s lead service lines is likely to be money. The EPA estimated in 2019 that it could cost roughly $4,700 on average to replace a single service line. 
Lanzafame, who is overseeing New London’s lead service line program, said the price has been even higher in his experience. 
Part of the cost of replacing lead lines in New London is being covered by a $6.9 million federal loan, a portion of which will be forgiven. Without that assistance, Lanzafame said, it would be far more difficult for the city to complete the work. 
“It is a big financial burden. I think that is one of the biggest challenges, especially being a distressed community,” Lanzafame said. “Without the grants and the funding that we’re getting from the federal government, we wouldn’t be able to carry out this project.” 
Federal lawmakers and the Biden administration set aside more than $15 billion through the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to help utilities across the country to identify and replace lead service lines. Connecticut received $99 million from that pot of money over the past three years, which the state is making available to water utilities through grants and low-interest loans.
But some groups are estimating the price tag for replacing every lead line nationwide could be up to $45 billion or even $90 billion — meaning some replacement projects may not receive federal support. 
Lambrinidou, of the Campaign for Lead Free Water, said utilities cannot rely on individual property owners to pay out-of-pocket for the cost of replacing their service lines. If they do, she said, those lead lines will likely remain in the ground. 
Many Connecticut utilities told CT Mirror they intend to cover the entire cost of replacement, but in order to do so, they may need to raise utility rates. The Connecticut legislature passed a bill this session that would allow investor-owned utilities, like Aquarion and the Connecticut Water Company, to create a surcharge on people’s water bills to cover the cost of lead removal projects. 
Lambrinidou, an affiliate faculty member at Virginia Tech’s Department of Science, Technology and Society, said that is also problematic. It would be far more equitable for the federal government to pick up the tab for service line replacements, she said.
“In many communities, it’s going to be the people — the victims — who are going to be required to pay, at least partially,” Lambrindou said. “If that’s not an environmental injustice, I don’t know what is.”
Does your address have lead pipes?
This table shows addresses served by 60 of Connecticut’s public water systems. Together, they serve nearly 90% of Connecticut’s population that is connected to a public service line.
To look up your address, type it in the “Street Address” field, like the Park Street example. You can also filter by town or by what the lines are made of using the “Entire Service Line Classification” field.
If you can’t find your address, try different formats or abbreviations like “st” for street. GRR means “galvanized requiring replacement.”
If you don’t find your address, you may be in the 10% of the population served by a smaller water system or not served by a public water system at all.

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)How’s your tap water?
Here in Emporia, we supposedly have the best-tasting water anywhere. I wouldn’t know, because the stuff that comes out of the kitchen faucet seems ordinary enough to me. Maybe I’m spoiled because I’ve been drinking it for 20 years. But judges have given Emporia’s municipal water a couple of gold medals for taste.
There really is a competition to judge tap water, and it’s called the Berkeley Springs International Water Tasting. It’s a big enough deal that the Washington Post devoted nine photos and about a million words in February to cover the event, which is held in West Virginia and began as a way to generate tourism in the off-season.
It was a cute piece, breathlessly reporting the event as the Oscars of H20. There are other international water tastings, the story noted, and at those other ones the judges are actually water connoisseurs. At Berkeley Springs, the judges typically come from the travel and media industrial complex.
“The gold medal for tap went to Emporia, Kansas, its second since it began competing,” the story noted. “Berkeley Springs took silver.”
Quite a coincidence that the town that has hosted the competition for 35 years also placed. Chalk it up to home team advantage. No reason to question the integrity of a fun little contest that, frankly, does no harm, generates some positive PR and allows city water workers to take some pride in their jobs. Right?
“Emporia’s water is sourced and treated with state-of-the-art technology and rigorous quality control measures, ensuring it meets and exceeds health and safety standards,” the city said in a press release. “Winning Gold at this prestigious competition is a testament to the dedication of the City of Emporia’s Water Department in delivering clean, refreshing, and top-quality water to the community.”
But recently Emporia has achieved another first, one that won’t be generating glowing press releases anytime soon: It topped the list of cities with the highest unemployment in the state.
The unemployment rate is 5.8%, according to the latest figures from the Kansas Department of Labor. That’s double the 2.9% unemployment KDOL recording for the city this time in April 2024.
What happened?
The massive Tyson Beef Plant closed, with a loss of more than 800 jobs. Tyson announced the closure in December 2024 (here comes Santa Claus) and said it would be effective by Feb. 14 (just in time for Valentine’s Day). Really, who picks these dates?
Tyson said it was shutting down the Emporia plant to improve efficiency. That means it was losing money. The company’s beef unit logged a $291 million loss in fiscal 2024, and because the Emporia plant primarily produced ground beef, it had to go.
The plant was one of the things that made Emporia, well Emporia, kind of like the weirdly sweet smell from the Dolly Madison plant on Industrial Road. Dolly, which employs several hundred, closed in 2012 after strikes and union woes. Hostess, the parent company, went bankrupt. The Dolly bakery was reopened in 2013, following its acquisition by a private equity firm. It still makes Twinkies, but as the Dolly Madison Cake Co.
The smell coming from the beef packing plant, however, was never sweet.
The plant was once owned by Iowa Beef Processors, the nation’s biggest beef packer, before Tyson bought them out in 2001. Cattle were still slaughtered at Emporia then, and a variety of smells emanated from the massive facility nearly the railway tracks on Prairie Street, especially on “blood burning” days. I don’t know if that’s what actually happened, but it sure smelled like it.
Tyson wasn’t the only cause of Emporia’s recent gold in unemployment.
Assorted smaller layoffs contributed. Tyson wasn’t Emporia’s biggest employer, but it was in the top three, after Simmons Pet Food and the local school district.
Emporia’s unemployment stats shot up this summer, as the Tyson closing was fully felt. Unemployment here is now greater than the state average of 3.8% or the national, 4.1%.
I asked the Kansas Department of Labor for the city’s unemployment rate for the last 20 years, and its staff provided a handy spreadsheet. Here are the highlights: The seasonally unadjusted unemployment was 5.3% in June 2005, about the same as the state level. Then the Great Recession hit us hard, and in 2008 we logged 8.4%, double the state average. Then it went back down but spiked at 8.9% in late 2012 and early 2013, after the Dolly plant closed. There followed a gradual decline to 1.6% in November 2021, the lowest in the 20 years. It remained at or under 4% — generally following the state level — from then until January 2025, when it began its current climb.
If you live in Emporia, you don’t need statistics to know the community is in sudden trouble. There is the former Tyson plant, of course, the gates of which have been fenced and padlocked like a scene from “Citizen Kane.” And there are other casualties, such as the United Parcel Service customer center just down the street.

The UPS center was only open from 4:30 to 6 p.m. on weekdays, and parking was problematic. But when I went to drop off a couple of packages there recently, I found the only thing worse than an inconvenient UPS center was none at all. A note taped to the door said the center had closed. The UPS website directed me to an “access point” at a nearby hardware store, where a helpful but harried clerk took my packages. She said the last few months had been a challenge, especially when customers didn’t have prepaid labels.
The UPS store was one of 70 facilities closed in the past few months, including locations in Dodge City and Lawrence. UPS dropped Amazon to boost profits, then sacked 20,000 employees in a massive overhaul.
A small inconvenience for consumers, but a major indicator of tectonic shifts in the economy. Since the pandemic, living in a small town like Emporia has felt not as neighborly and far less secure.
Just a few years ago, our neighborhood on Constitution Street woke up before dawn. All down the block, you could hear the racket of cars and trucks starting, the blare of music from radios or decks, and sometimes a few words of goodbye as people started off to work or school. Now it’s ghostly quiet. The cacophony used to annoy me. Now I miss it.
The guy who does our lawn was among those sacked by recent layoffs. He also has cancer. But he still cuts our grass because he says he feels OK. We’re also talking about some badly needed house painting, which I will pay him for, but I have to go buy the paint. Frankly, I’m dragging my feet on the paint because it is so damned hot out. It was 96 today.
There is a sadness to my friend, and I worry about him.
To be laid off is a trauma that only those who have gone through it can understand. It not only creates an immediate fiscal crisis — really, how many of us are lucky enough to go more than a few weeks without a paycheck? — but is an injury to one’s sense of self.
I know, because I was laid off in 2022.
It was the only time I’ve been fired, and it wasn’t my fault.
Sometimes I imagine actual physical trauma would have been easier to deal with, like a gunshot wound or fracture. I wrote about the runup to the layoffs at my university, and may write again about the aftermath, but not yet.
Being stone cold fired from a job you love — or a job you need — is a special kind of hell. Shortly after it happened to me, I went downtown to one of the older taverns in Emporia and had a bourbon. When the bartender found out what happened, she gave me another, on the house. I got some change and fed some quarters into the pinball machine in the back room. It was the best five bucks I ever spent.
I’m mostly fine now, I think. But it took a while.
The experience made me more sensitive to things I knew about but never took personally. Like how Kansas is ranked among the 10 worst states when it comes to the rights of workers. How losing a job is one of the most unhealthy things that can happen to you and can also damage your family. And how insensitive or downright offensive some officials can be when talking about unemployment statistics.
A case in point is Lyle Butler, interim director of the Emporia Regional Development Association. The RDA is a nine-member board to promote economic growth. In a press release, Butler called the city’s unemployment rate a “small uptick,” as if he were talking about the price of ground beef.
“Kansas and the nation are seeing similar short-term increases in unemployment as the job market adjusts to inflation and seasonal shifts,” Butler said in the statement. “Despite the local uptick, Emporia remains near ‘full employment,’ typically defined as below 5%, which reflects normal workforce movement — not widespread job loss.”
Similar short-term increases? Seasonal shifts? Normal workforce movement?
Apart from the dismissive and defensive tone of Butler’s release — move on, nothing to see here — and his obvious break with economic reality, there’s the question of just how callous the entire statement is. Even if there is some grain of truth beneath all that posturing, imagine for a moment you were one of the 809 individuals laid off from Tyson.
You’re just an uptick, a seasonal fluctuation.
Butler may be a decent guy, but he’s tone deaf.
I hope the RDA manages to help some of the people terminated by Tyson and other employers to find jobs. I hope Butler is ultimately right to be optimistic and that our title as unemployment capital is brief. I hope that Emporia thrives and that our neighborhood will fill back up with students and workers.
But what the unemployed need, other than a job, is empathy. Can’t any city leaders talk about how tough it really is to be laid off? What it’s like to look for a job when you’re young or old or too sick to work or have just lost your confidence through a series of tough breaks?
Emporia needs compassion for those hardest hit by the layoffs. Yes, I know there have been job fairs and other events to help individuals find work. But we also need confident and fact-based leadership, and somebody who understands that a doubling of the city’s unemployment rate in just 14 months affects just about every family in some way, and has been devasting for some. This is a crisis, not a fluctuation.
We’ve endured tougher collective times. National unemployment is estimated to have been 25% in March 1933, during the Great Depression. But that was before most of us were born. Right now, Emporia is experiencing a job slump surpassed in recent memory only by the Great Recession and the Dolly plant closing.
There’s a lot of families worried about how they’re going to cover the rent, buy food, and pay the water bill. Here on Constitution Street, the city utility bill — water, trash, sewer — has gone up 25% in two years, and is now $95.70.
Personally, I’ve never found Emporia’s water to be “refreshing” in ways that other water isn’t. Also, I’ve found the occasional boil advisories annoying and inconsistent with the goal of delivering clean, top-quality water. Right now, there are 10 jugs of bottled water in our kitchen waiting for the next trouble at the water plant.
What we don’t need is somebody handing us a glass of water and telling us it’s wine.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Tyson-7.23.25-Fence-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-27 04:56:49.721112

Riding the ancient Danbury branch of Metro-North is hard enough, but now it’s going to be shut down for two weeks, the trains replaced by buses from August 1 through the 17th.


The 24-mile-long, mostly single-track railroad from South Norwalk to The Hat City carries about 2,000 daily riders at an average speed of 27 mph.  Now those riders will get to enjoy the “bustitutes” which will make the journey faster than the train.
During the train outage, crews will improve the tracks and several grade crossings. What won’t be addressed is the long-discussed re-electrification of the line.  Yes, the Danbury line used to be electrified, just like the main line along the Connecticut coast.
It was in 1959 that the last electric locomotive pulled a train on the Danbury branch, “under the wire.”  Why did that change?  Here’s a synopsis of what I wrote a couple of years ago…
Most rail historians, like former New Haven and Metro-North veteran Jack Swanberg, blame one man for the de-electrification:  Patrick B McGuiness, then-President of the New Haven Railroad.  “He was not a good railroad man,” said Swanberg, a master of understatement.  In his two years running the mighty, private and once profitable New Haven Railroad, McGuiness made terrible choices we’re still living with today.
At the NH Railroad, predecessor to Metro-North, McGuiness cut maintenance and laid off staff, trying to goose up the stock price.  But it was when General Motors came calling that he made his biggest error.
The New Haven’s real profits came from running passengers and freight on the main line from New York City to Boston.  Because steam and diesel locomotives were not allowed in Grand Central, the New Haven was one of the first railroads to electrify, starting in 1909, but only as far as New Haven.
Trains running north to Boston needed to waste time and expense changing engines (from electric to steam and later diesel) in New Haven. McGuiness thought he could avoid that when GM introduced its hybrid FL-9 locomotive, railroad’s Prius of its day: running all electric in third rail territory, then running diesel.
In the 1950’s the New Haven ordered 60 FL-9s from General Motors, replacing their classic but boxy looking EP-2 electrics built by General Electric.  By 1959 that meant no more electric service on the Danbury branch.  In 1965 they finally took down the copper-wire catenary, selling it for scrap like some sort of junkie.
But the FL-9s were not performing well. 
While the original EP electrics had 4,000 hp, the hybrid FL-9s were less than half that.  And that meant poor acceleration and longer travel time, especially on commuter trains making a lot of stops.  Longer trains that used to have one electric locomotive now required two or three FL-9s.  And on the steep Danbury line where it’s a 360-foot climb from the coast to The Hat City, keeping traction on slippery tracks is a problem even today in the fall and winter.
The FL-9s were also expensive to maintain and dirty, even before we cared about air pollution.  In cold weather the diesels had to be kept running all night, just idling in the yard (creating noise and air pollution).  Their 25-year life expectancy wasn’t impressive and overhauls were costly.
“It was a mistake to take down the wire [on the Danbury branch],” says Swanberg who has written extensively on the topic.  
Now the Connecticut Department of Transportation seems to have given up on re-wiring the line as we await delivery of shiny new unpowered railcars from Alstom (costing $5.25 million apiece) to be pulled by new hybrid locomotives costing about $15 million each.

Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, and Democrat Nathan Sage gave their pitches for why they could be the best choice to unite voters in the upcoming election.
Both Democrats are running as contenders to become the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate in 2026 who will compete against the Republican candidate in the upcoming midterms. Speaking before at the potluck hosted by Iowa Farmers Union, a progressive organization focused on Iowa agriculture, the two candidates spoke about issues from air and water quality, food security and Medicaid cuts.
The U.S. Senate race in Iowa has been in the spotlight, in part, because of criticisms of incumbent U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst. The Iowa Republican’s response “well, we all are going to die,” at a May town hall to a person saying Medicaid cuts will cause people to die gained national attention. She has also received some flak from the right over her criticisms of U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth during the nomination process despite her ultimately voting to confirm him.
Ernst has not officially announced whether she plans to run for another term, and Politico reported Senate Majority Leader John Thune has said he is working to encourage her to run. She has hired a campaign manager and plans to hold her annual fundraiser, “Roast and Ride,” in October.
Both candidates made references to Ernst’s comments, with Sage, executive director of the Knoxville Chamber of Commerce, saying he starts every speech with “just saying I want everybody to here to live a long and prosperous life.”
Attendees at the gathering were largely Democrats, and people already looking for their choice to defeat the Republican nominee in 2026. Ardyth Gillespie, who has a farm near Atlantic, said while she believes all three of the Democrats running for the U.S. Senate seat would be better to have in the Senate than Ernst, she was most interested in seeing which candidate could build a coalition to win in the state where Republicans have seen overwhelming victories for many years. Iowa’s federal delegation is currently all Republican, and there is a GOP trifecta at the Statehouse.
Breaking that hold, and winning against Ernst, will require a candidate who can find ways to build “community,” including with people who may have previously supported Republicans or who are not involved in politics, Gillespie said.
“I think somebody that can bring people together — we really need that, really badly,” Gillespie said. “I haven’t figured out who’s going to do that, but that’s why we’re here.”
Wahls said in the time since launching his campaign, he has heard from Republicans and independents who have expressed frustrations with Ernst and Republicans in power in Congress. Democrats have to be willing to “extend an open hand” to these voters and ensure these voters will be able to support Democratic candidates, he said.
“Because I will tell you, the agenda that this administration is putting forward, and that Senator Ernst has been a complete rubber stamp for, it is uniquely bad for a state like Iowa, right?” Wahls said. “… But when you talk about things like the Medicaid cuts, the tariffs, the fact that you are now talking about this mass deportation scheme, you almost could not design a worse agenda for our state. And fundamentally, the job of being a U.S. senator is to say, you’re going to have your party politics — they always have to come second serving your constituents.”

Sage said he is coming into the race as someone who is not a seasoned politician, and can offer a perspective — and a disruption to politics as usual — that people of different political backgrounds can appreciate, as a veteran and business leader who grew up in poverty.
“I’m not your run-of-the-mill politician,” Sage said. “I don’t have one-liners. I’m not going to say things just to say them, I’m not going to talk about political rhetoric, I’m not going to joke around about things that are not funny to a lot of people. I’m here to fight. I fought in Iraq three fun-filled times. I stood up and did that. And right now, what I feel like, we have a lot of people in this world that need somebody to fight for them. They need somebody to look up and go, ‘This guy’s willing to do it.’ That’s what I’m trying to do.”
Cole Lindaman, who runs an urban agriculture business in Ames and works with the Story County Democrats, said he believes the budget reconciliation bill will also have a negative impact on farms because of the cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). He said earlier federal cuts to local foods programs for schools also negatively impact small agriculture producers in the state, in addition to harm to people receiving food benefits.
He said Ernst has been “selling out the state” and said he is looking for a candidate who can represent Iowans’ best interests in Congress — something he did not believe Ernst was doing.
Wahls said he disagreed with U.S. Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minnesota, who is the House Agriculture Committee ranking member, for comments on shutting down negotiations on the farm bill because of disagreements about SNAP and food assistance cuts.
“I understand that there’s frustration about how they decoupled SNAP, and those changes that were in the bill that they passed,” Wahls said. “However, I just  — anytime you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu. And so I’m just, I’m really concerned about the fact that Democrats have walked away from negotiations, but I think it’s clear that if we had a Democratic senator from Iowa who was serving on the Agriculture Committee, we’d get a real voice in that conversation. Because right now, really, we’re not getting it from Joni Ernst or Chuck Grassley.”
Bonnie Winslow-Garvin, a 69-year-old farmer from Belle Plaine, said she liked hearing from both Sage and Wahls — but that she wanted to hear more specific policy ideas, especially on how to improve Iowa’s air and water quality.
“I think there’s a lot of people coming out to run, and that’s fantastic, and I’m excited,” Winslow-Garvin said. “And it may be hard to pick the right candidate, the best candidate. So … I think as time goes on and they say more specific things, that I’ll be watching.”
Sage said he had a personal connection to the need to improve Iowa’s air and water quality, particularly as it potentially relates to rising cancer rates in the state, as both his parents died from cancer.
“I have a personal stake in this game,” Sage said. “I’m here to fight for Iowans. I’m here to fight for workers, here to fight for farmers.”
In the most recent Federal Election Commission campaign finance reports, Sage had raised the most in the Democratic field at $709,000 from April 1 through June 30. His haul was followed by Wahls with $656,000 and Iowa Rep. J.D. Scholten, R-Sioux City, with $175,000 in the same time period. Both Wahls and Scholten entered the race in June.
All three Democrats raised less than Ernst at almost $723,000 in the reporting period — though her fundraising fell behind her fundraising total from the same time period during the 2020 election season, leading to further speculation that she may not run for reelection.
Wahls noted there is “speculation” that Ernst may not run, but pointed out that if she does run again, she is breaking the commitment she made in 2014, while running for her first term in office, to only serve two terms. In the two terms since Ernst took office, Wahls said Iowa’s public schools have fallen behind, the state’s economy has suffered and air and water quality problems have gotten worse.
“Assuming that she does, in fact, move forward with a third term, what does she have to show for her 12 years in Washington, D.C., except from all the things that I just mentioned?” Wahls said. “It’s clear to me that Joni Ernst did not change Washington, D.C., Washington, D.C. changed Joni Ernst.”

We need to ensure our system is as strong and resilient as possible today, before federal government and market forces exert even more pressure tomorrow. 
The post The urgency of tackling health care affordability  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","OUR STATE has a chance to make big changes in our health care system right now – the kind of transformation that can only come about in a crisis.  
There’s no question we’re in a critical moment. The new federal tax and spending bill is likely to pose extraordinary challenges to our hospitals, health plans, and ultimately, many of our neighbors in the Commonwealth who will need health care in the years to come.  
But our problems predate the legislation President Trump signed earlier this month.  
There has long been a chasm between government reimbursement for care and its actual costs – and that gap has long been filled by commercial plans like ours, with our employer customers and members picking up the tab. That structure is straining under recent unprecedented cost increases for drugs and medical care. 
Businesses are forced to make painful choices between investing productively in new hires, wage increases, new equipment — or sinking their funds into health insurance. 
A recent poll we commissioned found 40 percent of Massachusetts residents say they’ve delayed getting care due to the cost. Many say they’ve faced a choice between paying for medical care or housing, food, or gas. 
Hospitals are short-staffed, paying more for people, devices, medications – everything it takes to provide our state’s famously world-class care.  
Many not-for-profit health plans are experiencing unsustainable losses as they strain to cover rising costs for care. Last year, Blue Cross lost $400 million, the biggest loss in our history.  
There’s never been a greater need for us to work together and do things differently. There’s no better place, either. 
We have an excellent track record in our state of collaboration between health plans, clinicians, business, labor, and policymakers. 
Landmark health reform led to near-universal coverage here. And the value-based care model widely adopted in our state — largely replacing the old fee-for-service system — slowed cost increases, spurred innovation, and improved quality for many years. 
But that’s under threat now.  
So how do we build a more affordable system that can withstand old and new pressures?      

Enforce the state health care spending benchmark: It’s intended to protect consumers from unaffordable annual cost increases. But the benchmark, established as part of health care reform legislation in 2012, has been breached for so many years it’s been rendered nearly meaningless. Let’s strengthen our regulators’ enforcement capability with real penalties and performance improvement plans for health plans and health providers that exceed the benchmark.  


Control what we can. Private insurers don’t have to wait for state action. We can commit to keeping the average price increase we pay providers below the 3.6 percent state benchmark.  This month, my company notified providers in our network that we intend to do exactly that.  


Establish a pharmacy drug affordability board to review high-cost prescription drugs and set limits to how much the costs can grow. 


 Explore ways to live within a budget for health care services. Some states have had success setting price controls, including Rhode Island and Maryland. We may choose another route, but evaluating innovative options, with curiosity and transparency, can help catalyze meaningful change.  


Develop and require payment models that reward outcomes over volume to ensure patients are getting the right levels of care at the right time in the right setting. Value-based care has proven effective in primary care and offers potential in other areas as well.   


Expand independent lower-cost treatment options including primary care, urgent care, and ambulatory surgical centers to relieve the long wait times and overcrowded emergency rooms at our hospitals and doctors’ offices. 


Learn from the collapse of Steward Health Care to ensure for-profit health care organizations in our state enhance the quality of care and decrease the cost.  

In short: We need to ensure our system is as strong and resilient as possible today, before federal government and market forces exert even more pressure tomorrow. 
Building that system will take deep collaboration between our state’s hospitals, drug companies, not-for-profit health plans, policymakers, regulators, and employers.  
We can’t just ride out this storm. The headwinds are too strong. But we can come together to harness the power of this moment for meaningful change.

Kennedy Jr. at the National Governors Association in Colorado Springs on July 26, 2025. (Andrew Fraieli for Colorado Newsline)Governors from across the country played host to a variety of health conspiracy theories in Colorado Springs on Saturday, as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. expounded on his “Make America Healthy Again” initiative in a fireside chat.
With Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee moderating, Kennedy repeated a litany of false and misleading claims, including assertions that aluminum in vaccines causes food allergies and that diabetes can be cured through diet, to about a dozen governors gathered together for their National Governors Association summer meeting.
He also suggested the use of AI in telemedicine and said “fee-for-service medicine” gives doctors and insurance companies “the incentive to keep Americans sick.”

One initiative Kennedy elaborated on was the Department of Health and Human Services’ collection of Medicaid data from states with the intention of anonymizing it to create a public database for independent scientists to be able to study. He claimed that “the medical establishment and the government were not able to give good data to people” during COVID, in response to a question from Lee on how to measure the efficacy of federal and state approaches to public health.
As governor of Tennessee, Lee banned mask mandates during the pandemic and “touted Tennessee for being one of the last to close early in the pandemic and among the first to reopen,” according to the AP.
Kennedy was confirmed as President Donald Trump’s pick for the nation’s top health official in February despite a long history of false statements about vaccine safety, among other conspiracy theories. Throughout the panel he repeatedly referred to the country being in a “chronic disease epidemic,” going so far as to question whether the real reason the U.S. had a high COVID death rate — about 3,000 deaths per million, the 17th highest rate in the world — was due to chronic disease in America.
“So what was killing them?” he asked. “Was it COVID, or was it the chronic disease?”
Kennedy previously visited Utah lawmakers in April after they passed multiple bills aligning state law with MAHA initiatives, such as banning fluoride in water. In late June he visited Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican, as he signed a bill claiming processed foods are “poisoning” children.
With this summer meeting, Kennedy was able to pitch his MAHA agenda to Democratic governors as well, including Gov. Jared Polis, who asked why nothing has changed in treating allergies that are well-known, such as peanut allergies.
Kennedy claimed that it is not known why peanut allergies develop, and repeated his false claims that aluminum in vaccines are causing allergies, specifically targeting the Hepatitis B vaccine in the meeting. In reality, some vaccines contain aluminum salts that help bolster immune responses.
Polis cheered Kennedy’s appointment in a a November social media post, saying that he was “excited” by Trump’s pick for health secretary.
“He helped us defeat vaccine mandates in Colorado in 2019 and will help make America healthy again by shaking up HHS and FDA,” Polis said at the time. “I hope he leans into personal choice on vaccines rather than bans (which I think are terrible, just like mandates).”
As health secretary, Kenedy has scrutinized children’s vaccine schedules in a May report without evidence, ousted the entire scientific committee that advised the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine use, and most recently, rescinded federal approval for a flu vaccine with a specific preservative that vaccine skeptics have falsely linked to autism.
Polis is currently chair of the NGA, a bipartisan public policy organization made up of governors across the country that formed in 1908. According to their website, they help challenge and shape federal policy across party lines.

(Photo courtesy Kyle Roerink)Water in Lake Mead is on course to fall to the lowest level in recorded history by 2027, according to a recent forecast by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.
Water levels in the reservoir have steadily dropped over the years as the Colorado River – the lake’s biggest source of water – has been choked by rising temperatures, prolonged drought and growing demand.
If reservoir storage continues on its current trajectory, Lake Mead’s water elevation is likely to drop to about 1,038 feet by the end of June 2027 – two feet lower than when it fell to a record low in July 2022, according to a two year forecast released by the federal agency last week.
That projection is based on the most probable scenario, but federal water managers also considered what the lake could look like if the next two years are drier than usual.
In the worst case scenario, Lake Mead’s water elevation could fall even further to about 1,026 feet – one foot short of the most severe water shortage level defined by BuRec which would trigger record cuts to water use in Arizona and Nevada.
Lake Mead is already under a Tier 1 shortage – the least severe level – which mandates a 21,000 acre-feet annual reduction in the state’s share of the Colorado River. That shortage level, and the reduction in Nevada’s water allocation, is likely to continue next year under current projections.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But steeper water cuts are likely to take place in 2027 under the most probable scenario, according to the study.
Federal water managers projected Lake Mead’s elevation would likely drop to below 1,050 feet by July 2026, triggering a more severe Tier 2 shortage which would reduce annual available water for Nevada by another 4,000 acre-feet.
Federal water managers decide shortage levels each year in August, based on projected water levels at Lake Mead and Lake Powell for the start of the following year.
The troubling projections come as the seven states that share the Colorado River’s water are in deadlocked negotiations over how the river and its reservoirs should be managed after current guidelines expire at the end of 2026.
The states — Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming — primarily disagree over which of them should have to decrease their water use, and by how much.
‘Uncertainty is difficult to plan around’
Negotiations have continued behind closed doors for months as water officials try to reach an agreement.
The federal government has given the states until mid-November to come up with a draft for a new plan. If they can’t reach a deal ahead of a 2026 deadline, the federal government can step in and make those decisions itself.
The lackluster reservoir forecast follows a winter of below-average snowpack across the Upper Colorado River Basin, a major source of snowmelt for Lake Mead and Lake Powell.
Climate scientists studying water supply on the Colorado River were not surprised by the latest projections, which reflect a two decade trend of decreasing streamflow into the river and its reservoirs.
“I’ve been warning about this situation since last fall. The worst has come true,” said Utah State University professor Jack Schmidt.
Without an effort to seriously recover water storage in Lake Mead and Lake Powell in order to withstand dry years, the river could be on the “brink of crisis,” said Schmidt.
Severe drought causing Utah reservoir levels to drop at ‘concerning’ rate

Schmidt said reservoir storage across the Colorado River will only gain a fraction of the water collected in previous years due to below-average snowpack and warmer temperatures.
This year snowmelt inflow to Lake Powell is predicted to be about half of average, one of the lowest inflow years in the past two decades. Lake Powell’s water levels directly affect Lake Mead because streamflow to Lake Powell is eventually released to Lake Mead.
“We’ve got the onset of an extremely dry year, and we’re on the brink of collapsing the system,” Schmidt said.
Two consecutive winters with robust snowpacks in 2023 and 2024 gave states that rely on the Colorado River a few more years of stability, but with a dismal water year approaching Lake Mead and Lake Powell are on a path to record low elevations.
“We’ve done a poor job since then and never significantly recovered storage,” Schmidt said.
Schmidt emphasized the need for immediate water conservation efforts to reduce water use across all seven states that rely on the river to protect the river and its reservoirs from collapse.
“The system we have is not good enough, and it’s not working, so this is a warning that we need to become far more flexible and far more adaptable,” he said.
Despite drought challenges, Southern Nevada remains one of the most water-secure areas along the Colorado River.
Southern Nevada hasn’t used its full allocation of Colorado River water for years. Conservation efforts have helped Southern Nevada use 36% less water from Lake Mead than it did two decades ago, according to the Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA).
The water authority also said it’s confident Southern Nevada can weather even the most severe water shortage, Tier 3, which would require Nevada to give up enough water to supply about 60,000 households for a year.
Bronson Mack, the outreach manager for SNWA, said Lake Mead’s water levels over the next two years will depend significantly on winter snowpack and soil conditions in the Upper Colorado River Basin.
“The potential for historically low lake levels is what catalyzed our community’s adaptation toward using less water more efficiently,” Mack said.
“Water conservation continues to be critical throughout the Colorado River Basin, and the Bureau of Reclamation’s most recent 24-month study further emphasizes that,” he continued.
Still, the lack of agreement between states on future guidelines has also created a lot of uncertainty for water users, said Kathryn Sorensen, the director of research at the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University.
“There’s a total unknown still about what happens after the current shortage sharing guidelines expire, and what will be the new operating guidelines. There’s a lot of uncertainty, and uncertainty is difficult to plan around,” Sorensen said.
Sorensen said record low water elevations at Lake Mead and Lake Powell are “the new normal,” adding that water utilities should prepare for a future where the most severe water shortage level is more and more common while communicating risks to customers.
“This latest 24-month study report is not good news, but it is what many have been warning about. The river is just producing less on average,” Sorensen said.

In the second image, a younger Duncan is pictured with his parents, Sharon and Bennie. (Kathleen Flynn for ProPublica)Longtime death row prisoner Jimmie Duncan, whose 27-year-old murder conviction was vacated this spring, will have to wait a few more days to find out if he will be able to walk out of the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. After a three-day hearing on whether to release Duncan, a Ouachita Parish judge said Thursday that he will not rule until Monday at the earliest.
In April, Judge Alvin Sharp set aside Duncan’s 1998 conviction for murdering 23-month-old Haley Oliveaux, his then-girlfriend’s daughter. Sharp agreed with Duncan’s attorneys that an analysis performed on the girl that purported to match marks on her body to Duncan’s teeth — a key piece of evidence in the trial — was based on discredited science.
As ProPublica and Verite News reported in March, the effort to secure Duncan’s freedom has become more urgent in recent months due to a renewed push by Gov. Jeff Landry to restart executions in the state following a decade-plus pause.
Attorney Scott Greene, who is part of Duncan’s legal team, said during the hearing that Duncan has “enormous support” from his family, the community and Haley’s mother, Allison Layton Statham. Now that his conviction has been vacated, Greene argued, Duncan should be freed on bail pending another trial.
This week’s hearing on that request began Tuesday and continued until Thursday afternoon. It descended into chaos on Wednesday as prosecutors grilled Statham, who supports Duncan’s release.
At one point during a tense back-and-forth with Ouachita Parish Assistant District Attorney Michael Ruddick, Statham asked what became of Dr. Steven Hayne. Hayne, who died in 2020, was half of the team that was responsible for the bite mark analysis. Ruddick replied that Hayne was in the same place as her daughter — “six feet under the ground,” drawing shouts of outrage from the audience.
The Ouachita DA’s office maintains that Duncan is guilty of raping and murdering Haley in 1993. The office has appealed the April ruling setting aside Duncan’s conviction. Ruddick urged Sharp to keep Duncan locked up pending the outcome of the appeal. Prosecutors have argued that Duncan is “a safety risk to not only the victim’s family, but also the general public.” Early in the hearing, Ruddick unsuccessfully moved for Sharp to recuse himself, arguing that his earlier ruling nullifying Duncan’s conviction made him biased and unfit to decide whether or not to grant him bail.
He’s on Louisiana’s death row, his attorneys say, for a crime that didn’t happen

Duncan’s attorneys, however, cast him as a law-abiding man who had been railroaded by the legal system. Prior to his now-vacated murder conviction, Duncan had never previously been convicted of a crime, noted attorney Chris Fabricant with the Innocence Project. What’s more, Fabricant said, the child’s family, including her mother, support Duncan’s release.
In an interview published earlier this month, Statham told Mississippi Today that she believes Duncan “was falsely accused of a crime he didn’t commit.”
“I loved him,” Statham said from the stand.
‘Not scientifically defensible’
Duncan was babysitting Haley in West Monroe on Dec. 18, 1993 when, he said, he heard a noise coming from the bathroom, where the toddler was taking a bath. When he went to check on her, he found her floating face down in the water. She was pronounced dead a few hours later.
Hayne, a pathologist who worked on hundreds of criminal cases in Mississippi and Louisiana over his decades-long career, conducted Haley’s medical exam. He claimed he found evidence that she was sexually assaulted and intentionally drowned.
He also claimed to find bite marks on the girl. Michael West, a forensic dentist who worked with Hayne in a number of cases in the 1990s and early 2000s, analyzed the marks and found that they were a match for Duncan’s teeth.
Based in part on those findings, Duncan was charged with first-degree murder. After about two weeks of testimony in 1998, the jury found Duncan guilty and sentenced him to death.
But a team of post-conviction attorneys later uncovered evidence that, they say, proves his innocence.
Judge nullifies Louisiana death row inmate’s murder conviction based on junk science

The most effective arguments concerned Hayne and West’s bite mark evidence. The type of analysis West performed — matching a suspect’s teeth to purported bite marks — while frequently used in criminal cases at the time of Duncan’s trial, has since been widely discredited and dismissed by experts as “junk science.”
Duncan’s attorneys also questioned whether the supposed “bite marks” were even bite marks at all. In a video of West’s 1993 examination of Haley — which was not shown to jurors at the trial — West can be seen taking a mold of Duncan’s teeth and grinding it into the girl’s body. (West has previously said he was simply using what he called a “direct comparison” technique — in which he presses a mold of a person’s teeth directly onto the location of suspected bite marks.)
In his April ruling vacating Duncan’s conviction, Sharp said the work Hayne and West did on Duncan’s case was “no longer valid” and “not scientifically defensible.”
Robert Tew, district attorney for Ouachita and Morehouse parishes, argued in a June 16 filing that bite mark evidence was an accepted science at the time of Duncan’s trial and that some experts still consider it to be a useful forensic methodology. He also noted that Hayne, who died in 2020, served as the pathologist for the district for over a decade and during that time “there has been no cases overturned because of Dr. Hayne’s autopsy.”
Over the past 27 years, nine prisoners have been set free after being convicted in part on inaccurate evidence given by West and Hayne. Seven of those convictions had involved bite mark identification analysis, a discipline that has been called into question. And three of the freed men had been sentenced to die.
‘My daughter is in heaven’
Throughout the hearing, the small courtroom was filled with Duncan’s supporters, including family members, a community pastor and Sen. Katrina Jackson, D-Monroe, who said she came to support Duncan’s release on bail. Also in the court was Detective Chris Sasser, who originally investigated the case in 1993.
Duncan was brought into court this week with his feet shackled, a chain around his waist connected to a pair of handcuffs that kept his wrists flush to his stomach. He wore an orange prison jumpsuit that was faded yellow in various spots. The sides of his head were shaved and his dark, dreadlocked hair pulled back into a ponytail.
Duncan’s attorneys made the case that he was not a danger to the public. They told the court that Duncan had never been arrested prior to 1993, that he didn’t have a history of violence, and that he had a clean disciplinary history in prison for more than 20 years. They also read a letter of support from a death row corrections officer, and noted that Duncan tutored his fellow death row inmates, helping at least 17 achieve their GEDs.
Fabricant argued that the state’s odds of convincing a jury a second time that Duncan is guilty are basically nonexistent given the new evidence, science and testimony they would be able to produce that was not available or allowed at the first trial.
Along with insisting that Duncan is guilty of murder and therefore a danger to the public, Ruddick also argued that Landry’s recent push to restart executions in the state could turn Duncan into a flight risk. If state appeals court judges side with the DA’s office and overturn Sharp’s April order vacating Duncan’s conviction, Ruddick said, then Duncan, fearing his execution is imminent, might flee.
“I’m gone,” Ruddick said, imagining what Duncan would be thinking.
Tension in the courtroom boiled over Wednesday when Ruddick called on Haley’s mother to testify. Statham had stepped out of the courtroom that afternoon as she was growing increasingly agitated.
Sharp sent several deputies outside to bring her back. Statham was visibly upset as they walked her through the hallway back into the courtroom, loudly complaining that Ruddick only wanted her to testify so he could harass her. Statham took the stand as five deputies positioned themselves in front of the door and on either side of the bench.
Staring directly at Ruddick, Statham said she has waited 30 years to look him in the eye and tell him that her daughter wasn’t killed. Haley was sick and died in a tragic accident, she said, and the DA’s office lied to make it look like murder.
She then brought up Hayne, the pathologist from Mississippi, saying it was wrong for the district attorney to bring in a doctor with such a questionable history to conduct her daughter’s autopsy.
“Where is he now?” she asked Ruddick, referring to Hayne, who died in 2020.
“He’s in the same place your daughter is,” Ruddick snapped back, “six feet under the ground.”
The audience erupted. People shouted at Ruddick while others gasped in shock. Statham stood and yelled at Ruddick that he was “sick” and that his lies have caused her family and Duncan’s nothing but pain and misery for decades.
Then she said of Hayne: “He’s in hell for what he did. My daughter is in heaven.”
Throughout Statham’s testimony, Duncan wept as his attorneys attempted to console him.
Tew’s office did not respond to requests for comment.
The next day in court, Ruddick apologized to the judge, the defense team, and those in the audience who witnessed his interaction with Statham. When prompted by Sharp, he also apologized specifically to Statham.
Closing the hearing on Thursday, Sharp gave both the prosecution and defense until 10 p.m. Sunday to submit any additional materials before he renders a decision.

(Photo courtesy U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Throughout his 2024 campaign to return to the White House, President Donald Trump promised to implement the “largest deportation program” in the nation’s history.
And since he assumed office on Jan. 20, that promise has not only led to a surge in Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests, it’s shifted the agency’s tactics as well.
New data shows that Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests have more than doubled since the beginning of the second Trump administration. ICE made 1,736 arrests this year in Maryland — 1,683 since Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration — through June 26, according to data compiled by the Deportation Data Project, a research team based in Berkeley, California.
That’s an average of about 9.8 arrests per day in Maryland in 2025. For comparison, there were 1,343 arrests in Maryland throughout all of 2024, for an average of about 3.7 arrests per day.
Cori Alonso-Yoder, a professor at the University of Maryland Carey School of Law and director of its Immigration Clinic, said the rise in immigration arrest is “a political message,” and part of a larger trend to punish states that aren’t in political alignment with the administration.
“The underlying mechanisms have been there, predating the election, and certainly predating the second Trump administration,” she said. “But what we’re seeing is sort of them being pushed to their ultimate limit.”

The increase in ICE activity in the state has led to several high-profile incidents in Maryland over the last six months, including that of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was arrested by ICE agents in Baltimore on March 12 and wrongfully deported to El Salvador due to what the Trump administration called an “administrative error.”
Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center three days later, despite having a previous court order from an immigration judge protecting him from deportation to the country due to his risk of persecution if returned to El Salvador. He has since been returned to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges, and is currently being held in Tennessee.
And on Monday, Daniel Fuentes Espinal, a local pastor described as a pillar of his Talbot County community, was stopped and arrested by ICE while on his way to work. Fuentes Espinal was born in Honduras, and entered the U.S. illegally after fleeing from violence in the country in 2001. He has no criminal record.
After initially being held in a facility in Baltimore, he was transferred and is now being held in Louisiana.
Several Maryland leaders, such as Rep. Glenn Ivey (D-4th), have criticized these new tactics and the impact they have on immigrant communities.
“It is shocking that the Trump Administration is now targeting churches and other places of worship for ICE raids,” Ivey wrote in a statement in January. “The risk of racial profiling makes this unconscionable defiance of basic constitutional protections even worse.”
But others, like House Freedom Caucus Chair Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st), have praised ICE for its increase in arrests.
“Criminal illegal aliens don’t belong in our communities. They belong in custody — and out of this country,” Harris wrote in a post on X earlier this month.
While Trump has said the deportations will target criminals, 40% of those who have been detained by ICE had no criminal record. About 45% detained had been convicted of a crime, while another 15% had criminal charges pending, according to ICE. 
Eastern Shore pastor detained by ICE transferred to Louisiana facility

ICE did not reply to multiple requests for comment.
Eric Lopez, deputy program director at the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, which provides legal services for immigrants facing detention or deportation, said ICE has become “incredibly aggressive” in its tactics.
“What we’re seeing is an escalation in not just the number of arrests that are happening, but also an escalation in terms of who’s being detained, who’s being arrested, what practices are being used to arrest people,” Lopez said.
Lopez said that many of the people that the Amica Center has worked with have been arrested while going to work or attending regular ICE check-ins. The range of people getting arrested varies drastically, he added.
“People who have never had any contact with the criminal system, not even minor infractions,” he said. “We’re seeing high school students being arrested and transferred out of state. We’re seeing parents who’ve been here for decades, who have no prior contact with law enforcement, arrested and transferred out of state.”
Alonso-Yoder said the impacts of these daily arrests will last for generations.
“Families who are separated today, they are going to be feeling that separation for generations to come,” she said.
Alonso-Yoder emphasized “how flimsy this concept of doing immigration the ‘right way.’”
“Doing it legally has just been utterly upended,” she said, noting people who went through legal processes, like Abrego Garcia, or those waiting through the asylum process continue to get arrested.
“The administration has really obfuscated and confused what it means to be a criminal alien,” she said. “I think what we’re just really seeing is that there is not this massive group of criminals in the United States who were not supposed to be here.”

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)If you’ve ever suffered from that nagging feeling that the Legislature is systematically trying to undermine your right to petition something onto the ballot, you’re not alone. I’ve had it, too.
We need to start trusting that gut feeling. It turns out we weren’t wrong. That’s exactly what the Republican majority in the Legislature has been trying to do. It has just been proven by three authors of a South Dakota Law Review article: “Have Recent Legislative Changes in South Dakota Made Using the Initiated Measure Process More Difficult?”
It seems the answer to the question in the title of the article is yes, and how.
South Dakota’s legacy of citizen ballot questions is under threat, law review authors warn

You can find the article on the Law Review’s website. Be warned: at 40-some pages, it’s not an easy read. There are footnotes strewn about and readers may struggle with some of the world’s ugliest charts. However it still tells a compelling tale of how, since 2017, the Republican super-majority in the Legislature has been whittling away at the rights of citizens to petition measures onto the ballot.
Republicans may scoff at the article as so much whining from the left as two of the authors are well-known Democrats: activist Cory Heidelberger and former State Sen. Reynold Nesiba. While a Republican byline would have been nice for the sake of balance, there’s no disputing the truth of the facts they have compiled. These bills were filed and are there for anyone to look up.
Their paper gets particularly interesting when it goes about listing the Legislature’s 14 worst bills designed to cut back the rights of citizens to petition an initiative onto the ballot. Those range from insisting on a larger font size on petitions to make them unwieldy, to allowing petition signers to later withdraw their names after the petition has been submitted, and a couple of attempts to raise the vote total needed for passage of the initiative beyond a simple majority.
Some of these attacks on our rights were defeated at the ballot box; some were challenged in court where they fell short of being entirely constitutional. Sadly, some were enacted into law. At least now, through the work of the article’s authors, the grim history of the war on ballot initiatives in South Dakota is summed up in one place.
Unfortunately, while that history has been chronicled, the siege still continues. The authors go on to mention seven petition-related bills and five constitutional amendments submitted in the 2025 legislative session, 10 of which, they say, sought to curtail the rights of citizens to initiate ballot measures.
When legislators want to amend the state constitution themselves, they have to convince a majority of their colleagues to send the amendment to voters. This legislative quest to get on the 2026 ballot through constitutional amendments comes from the same party that tries to curtail voter access to the petition process by claiming that voters have ballot fatigue with so many issues to decide on Election Day. This ignores the fact that in each case, more than 17,000 South Dakotans applied their signatures to petitions, a sure sign that there are plenty of people who think the ballot issue is something that should go before voters.










At least now, through the work of the article’s authors, the grim history of the war on ballot initiatives in South Dakota is summed up in one place.


This years-long attempt to curtail the initiative process is nothing more than a means for the Republican super-majority to solidify its power by cutting off people they don’t agree with from access to the ballot. Republican efforts aren’t trying to make the process better or more secure. They’re just tired of beating back attempts to legalize marijuana and abortion.
The irony here is that in the Statehouse, no piece of legislation is ever blocked. Sure, there may be some arm-twisting that could lead to a bill being tabled or withdrawn, but each bill is handled in the light of day. These same Republicans who are so upright and transparent with legislation are working overtime to have darkness descend on the ballot box.
Their attempts to slow or stop citizen access to the ballot initiative process is a sign of the power that citizens wield. The recent law journal article has proven that this notion that our rights are under attack is more than just a gut feeling. We now have a historic record that spells out the way Republicans have been trying to take away the power of citizens to petition their government.

(Photo courtesy Fuentes Espinal family)An Eastern Shore pastor who was arrested by immigration agents Monday and taken to Baltimore for processing is in good spirits and is preaching to fellow detainees — but that preaching is now being done at a detention center in Louisiana.
Daniel Fuentes Espinal, an undocumented immigrant from Honduras with no criminal record, was transferred Thursday from Baltimore to the Winn Correctional Center outside New Orleans, a family friend said Friday.
“He’s a remarkably resilient man, and for all of the trauma that he has been subjected to and the stress that’s been inflicted upon him and on his family, he is upbeat and his spirits are good,” said Len Foxwell, speaking for the family.
Fuentes Espinal’s daughter, Clarissa Fuentes Diaz, had been speaking for the family earlier this week, but is now declining interviews for fear of retaliation, Foxwell said.
Fuentes Diaz spoke to her father Thursday before his transfer. Foxwell said. He said Fuentes Espinal’s attorney filed a motion for a bond hearing, which was approved and will take place next week.
Fuentes Espinal, his wife and daughter fled violence in their native Honduras in 2001, when Clarissa was 8 years old, and eventually came to the Eastern Shore where they put down roots and where two more children were born.
Beloved Talbot County pastor picked up in dragnet of ICE arrests

Since 2015, Fuentes Espinal has been pastor of Jesus Te Ama Iglesia del Nazareno [Jesus Loves You Church of the Nazarene] in Easton — an unpaid position. He works in construction to pay the family’s bills.
Fuentes Espinal had gone to a hardware store for construction materials for his job on Monday and was on his way to work when he was stopped by unidentified agents and arrested on immigration charges and taken to Baltimore. The family only learned of his whereabouts when he called later that night, as the family was about to file a missing persons report, his daughter said earlier this week.
Fuentes Diaz recently learned that she had been approved for U.S. citizenship, after a 16-year wait, and said both parents had been working to get documentation. “I was going to help my dad and mom get their papers straight,” but that was before her father was arrested, she said earlier this week.
His arrest comes amid a surge in immigration detentions, part of President Donald Trump’s campaign pledge to enact mass deportations if reelected. The pressure to make arrests has led to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents frequenting areas where day-laborers gather, raiding businesses and sites that had previously been off-limits, like courthouses — and, according to critics, engaging in racial profiling to stop people simply for looking Hispanic.
In Maryland, immigration arrests jumped from about 3.7 per day in 2024 to 9.8 per day since Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, according to data from the Deportation Data Project.
While Trump and Department of Homeland Security officials have said their immigration enforcement actions are aimed at removing the “worst of the worst” undocumented criminals in the U.S., only 45% of those arrested this year have criminal convictions and 40%, like Fuentes Espinal, have no criminal charges.

Fuentes Espinal’s case has drawn extensive media coverage as well as the attention of immigration advocates and members of Maryland’s congressional delegation. Foxwell said a gofundme page he set up for the family quickly surpassed its original goal of raising $15,000, and then a second goal of $25,000. As of Friday, it was inching toward a new goal of $40,000, which he said will come in handy if the Fuentes Espinal has to travel to Louisiana.
In the meantime, Fuentes Espinal remains upbeat and is trying to console his family, Foxwell said Friday.
“His exact words to his daughter were: ‘This must be God’s plan,’” Foxwell said.
Fuentes Espinal said he has been ministering to his fellow detainees, both in Baltimore and in Louisiana, Foxwell said. 
“A preacher is going to preach, and he doesn’t necessarily need a church to talk about the grace of God,” Foxwell said. 
Fuentes Diaz told Foxwell that her father said he’s aware of the coverage his case has attracted, and he is grateful.
“He is a true man of faith who embodies the teachings of Christ each and every day of his life,” Foxwell said. “He is remaining upbeat and resilient under a set of circumstances that would break most other people.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2.-IMG_2263-cropped-e1753504625106.jpg,,,2025-07-26 10:56:17.780640

But as his administration pares back federal rules and programs designed to protect patients from the high cost of health care, Trump risks pushing more Americans into debt, further straining family budgets already stressed by medical bills.
Millions of people are expected to lose health insurance in the coming years as a result of the tax cut legislation Trump signed this month, leaving them with fewer protections from large bills if they get sick or suffer an accident.
At the same time, significant increases in health plan premiums on state insurance marketplaces next year will likely push more Americans to either drop coverage or switch to higher-deductible plans that will require them to pay more out-of-pocket before their insurance kicks in.
Smaller changes to federal rules are poised to bump up patients’ bills, as well. New federal guidelines for covid-19 vaccines, for example, will allow health insurers to stop covering the shots for millions, so if patients want the protection, some may have to pay out-of-pocket.
The new tax cut legislation will also raise the cost of certain doctor visits, requiring copays of up to $35 for some Medicaid enrollees.
And for those who do end up in debt, there will be fewer protections. This month, the Trump administration secured permission from a federal court to roll back regulations that would have removed medical debt from consumer credit reports.
That puts Americans who cannot pay their medical bills at risk of lower credit scores, hindering their ability to get a loan or forcing them to pay higher interest rates.
“For tens of millions of Americans, balancing the budget is like walking a tightrope,” said Chi Chi Wu, a staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. “The Trump administration is just throwing them off.”

White House spokesperson Kush Desai did not respond to questions about how the administration’s health care policies will affect Americans’ medical bills.
The president and his Republican congressional allies have brushed off the health care cuts, including hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicaid retrenchment in the mammoth tax law. “You won’t even notice it,” Trump said at the White House after the bill signing July 4. “Just waste, fraud, and abuse.”
But consumer and patient advocates around the country warn that the erosion of federal health care protections since Trump took office in January threatens to significantly undermine Americans’ financial security.
“These changes will hit our communities hard,” said Arika Sánchez, who oversees health care policy at the nonprofit New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty.
Sánchez predicted many more people the center works with will end up with medical debt. “When families get stuck with medical debt, it hurts their credit scores, makes it harder to get a car, a home, or even a job,” she said. “Medical debt wrecks people’s lives.”
Medicaid changes: Q&A with Jeff Reynolds, Rural Hospital Coalition of Louisiana

For Americans with serious illnesses such as cancer, weakened federal protections from medical debt pose yet one more risk, said Elizabeth Darnall, senior director of federal advocacy at the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Action Network. “People will not seek out the treatment they need,” she said.
Trump promised a rosier future while campaigning last year, pledging to “make America affordable again” and “expand access to new Affordable Healthcare.”
Polls suggest voters were looking for relief.
About 6 in 10 adults — Democrats and Republicans — say they are worried about being able to afford health care, according to one recent survey, outpacing concerns about the cost of food or housing. And medical debt remains a widespread problem: As many as 100 million adults in the U.S. are burdened by some kind of health care debt.
Despite this, key tools that have helped prevent even more Americans from sinking into debt are now on the chopping block.
Medicaid and other government health insurance programs, in particular, have proved to be a powerful economic backstop for low-income patients and their families, said Kyle Caswell, an economist at the Urban Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C.
Caswell and other researchers found, for example, that Medicaid expansion made possible by the 2010 Affordable Care Act led to measurable declines in medical debt and improvements in consumers’ credit scores in states that implemented the expansion.
“We’ve seen that these programs have a meaningful impact on people’s financial well-being,” Caswell said.
Trump’s tax law — which will slash more than $1 trillion in federal health spending over the next decade, mostly through Medicaid cuts — is expected to leave 10 million more people without health coverage by 2034, according to the latest estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The tax cuts, which primarily benefit wealthy Americans, will add $3.4 trillion to U.S. deficits over a decade, the office calculated.
The number of uninsured could spike further if Trump and his congressional allies don’t renew additional federal subsidies for low- and moderate-income Americans who buy health coverage on state insurance marketplaces.
This aid — enacted under former President Joe Biden — lowers insurance premiums and reduces medical bills enrollees face when they go to the doctor or the hospital. But unless congressional Republicans act, those subsidies will expire later this year, leaving many with bigger bills.
Federal debt regulations developed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under the Biden administration would have protected these people and others if they couldn’t pay their medical bills.
The agency issued rules in January that would have removed medical debts from consumer credit reports. That would have helped an estimated 15 million people.
But the Trump administration chose not to defend the new regulations when they were challenged in court by debt collectors and the credit bureaus, who argued the federal agency had exceeded its authority in issuing the rules. A federal judge in Texas appointed by Trump ruled that the regulation should be scrapped.

Almost half of the 63 million Americans who care for a family member say they struggle financially to do so. (Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)More than 63 million Americans are caregivers for a family member with complex medical needs, a 20 million increase over the past decade, according to a new report.
But state policies, workplaces and the American health system haven’t kept up with this surge in family caregiving responsibilities, said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, a physician and the CEO of the AARP, which released the report with the National Alliance for Caregiving, a nonprofit policy and research organization.
“Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences, draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing,” Minter-Jordan told reporters on a call this week.
One of the biggest reasons for the surge in family caregivers is that Americans are living longer, yet they’re not necessarily healthier. There’s a 12-year gap between the average number of years that Americans live and the number of years they’re healthy.

The caregiving role typically involves helping a family member with daily tasks like bathing, dressing and eating. But more than half of caregivers also perform more complex medical tasks, such as managing catheters or administering injections, the report found.
A growing number of caregivers are so-called “sandwich caregivers” — parents caring for their children as well as for an adult family member, such as an aging parent. About 17 million people are sandwich caregivers, compared with 11 million a decade ago. And most caregivers are also working a job.
And while the bulk of caregiving still falls on women, 40% of American caregivers are men.
Some states have heeded the growing calls for action.
Earlier this year, Maine lawmakers created a state program to provide respite care, which includes services such as adult day care that give family caregivers a temporary break.
Also this year, Tennessee extended its pilot program that provides respite care for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, and also passed a bipartisan bill that directs the state Medicaid program to develop guidelines to allow family caregivers to be paid for their work.
Last year, Nebraska passed a tax credit for family caregivers; Oklahoma passed a similar law the year before. And while the United States is one of few countries that doesn’t mandate paid family leave at the federal level, 13 states and the District of Columbia have established their own paid family leave rules.
Meanwhile, the historic cuts to Medicaid enacted as part of the GOP’s Big, Beautiful Bill Act will shift health costs to states, leaving experts worried that family caregivers could lose Medicaid-funded services they rely on.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Gov. Mike Dunleavy allowed three bills to become law this week without his signature, creating two fishing-related laws and one that updates the rules governing accountants in the state.
Under the Alaska constitution, a governor may sign a bill into law, veto it, or allow it to become law by taking no action on it after it is transmitted to him by the Legislature.
House Bill 31, from Rep. Louise Stutes, R-Kodiak, eliminates a state law that required fishing boats to register with the Alaska Division of Motor Vehicles every three years. Now, any boat that’s actively in use fishing and registered with the Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission and the U.S. Coast Guard will not have to also register with the DMV.
In a written statement, Stutes said the DMV registration — passed by the Legislature in 2018 — turned out to be excessive, particularly in rural Alaska.
“A lot of these communities don’t even have a DMV. Alaska’s commercial fishing industry is facing historically challenging times, and I’m glad we could implement this small step to make getting started for the year a little easier,” she said in the statement.
The second fishing-related bill was House Bill 116, which allows commercial fishing cooperatives to act like insurance without being regulated like insurance.
In some cases, fishing boat owners create pools of money to act as insurance funds to pay liability and damage claims themselves, bypassing the high rates charged by insurance companies.
Three pools already exist in Alaska but are organized under Washington state law because Alaska did not permit them. The new law enables pools under Alaska law, encouraging a cheaper alternative to traditional insurance.
House Bill 121, which also became law this week, lowers the training requirement for new accountants if they can substitute experience for classroom time. It also aligns some state accounting laws with model legislation used in other states.

Matt Jennings, 35, reached a plea agreement this week on two charges of violating the federal Lacey Act, which prohibits interstate commerce for wildlife taken in violation of state regulations. He is the host of “The Game,” which streams on YouTube and CarbonTV.
​“HUNTING is all I’ve ever known, to kill to eat… it’s what makes my heart pound and my soul fulfilled,” Jennings says on the show’s website.
According to court documents, Jennings primarily lives in Bowdon, Georgia, and sometimes resides in Woodland, Alabama. He traveled to Kansas in November 2022 with a tag that allowed him to take an antlered deer within a hunting area near WaKeeney in northwest Kansas.
On Nov. 11, 2022, Jennings killed an antlered deer near Florence in the central part of the state, which wasn’t covered by his tag. He drove to Oklahoma the following day to register the kill there, then returned to Kansas.
A week later, he killed another deer near WaKeeney. Although it was in the area allowed under his tag, the second kill violated state law by exceeding the bag limit of one antlered deer per season.
A joint investigation between the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service confirmed Jennings’ movements through phone data and social media posts.
Jennings featured the kills on “The Game,” which the show’s website describes as “a dark, in your face, more serious look at what makes a hunter tick.”
“It’s about pushing one’s self to the breaking point, and then looking back on the experience to learn from it,” the website says. “Matt Jennings takes you to the frontlines weekly to destinations in your backyard or worlds away. Either way, the intensity and drive this man has for the hunt will draw you to him and to what crazy things he will do next.”
Episodes feature him as a skilled bow hunter dressed in camouflage, with black grease around his eyes and cheeks. More than 62,000 users subscribe to the show’s YouTube channel. The most recent episode is from 11 months ago.
Recent comments on the videos berate Jennings.
“Hey Kansan here, stay in Georgia with that Poaching s***,” someone with the username “@Jimmy2toes4u” wrote in a comment on one of the shows. “Bad enough to see all the out of town plates much less guys who think their … ‘hunting show’ gives em the right to do whatever they want.”
The most recent post to the show’s YouTube account, from July 11, is a short promotional clip titled: “One day your life will flash before your eyes. Make sure it’s worth watching.”
Someone with the username “@lifesshort69” commented: “One day your show will flash before your eyes. Make sure your not a poacher and its worth watching.”
Under federal charges, Jennings faced up to a year in prison and as much as a $100,000 fine. Under the plea deal, he will serve five years of unsupervised probation and pay a $10,000 fine. He also will pay $15,000 in restitution to the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks Law Enforcement Fund in Pratt. He has to surrender the two illegally taken deer mounts, and he must retake an Alabama Hunter Education Course.
Jennings is prohibited while on probation from hunting, trapping, fishing or being with anyone engaged in those activities in Nebraska, Missouri, Oklahoma, Colorado, Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois and Minnesota. He agreed to a lifetime hunting and fishing ban in Kansas.
In exchange for the plea, the federal government dismissed a charge from the original complaint and agreed not to file additional charges — unless Jennings denies his illegal activity or engages in additional criminal conduct.
Jennings didn’t immediately respond to Kansas Reflector requests for comment by phone and email.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)If the Supreme Court overturns Plyler v. Doe, the fallout will be devastating.
The 1982 decision, which affirmed that undocumented children have a constitutional right to attend public school, is already under siege. States like Tennessee and Oklahoma, are laying the legal groundwork to exclude or penalize these students, daring the court to strike down a precedent they never liked to begin with.
With the current court’s appetite for overturning landmark protections, that dare might just work. That’s why Maryland must act.
Our state should enshrine the right to public education in its constitution for all children, irrespective of immigration status. This isn’t just good policy; it’s a moral obligation. Marylanders say every child deserves a chance, that has to mean every child. Maryland’s Constitution, under Article VIII, already mandates a “thorough and efficient system of free public schools.” But nowhere does it guarantee that the children sitting in those classrooms can’t be turned away based on what documents they or their parents do — or do not — have. That silence is dangerous.
According to the Migration Policy Institute, approximately 15,000 undocumented children and youth are currently enrolled in Maryland’s public schools. If Plyler falls, and Maryland has no constitutional backstop of its own, the door cracks open to policies that chill enrollment, stigmatize immigrant youth and jeopardize public education.
Earlier this year, Tennessee lawmakers sought to enact legislation allowing school districts to verify immigration status and deny enrollment or charge tuition to undocumented students. It’s a clear challenge to Plyler, designed to climb its way to the Supreme Court.

Oklahoma sought something similar: an administrative rule requiring schools to collect immigration data at enrollment. These policies are strategic efforts, encouraged by groups like the Heritage Foundation, to chip away at the principle that every child deserves to learn.
In contrast, Maryland has the chance to lead. Again. In 2012, it was the first state to legalize same-sex marriage by popular vote. In 2024, voters enshrined reproductive freedom in the state constitution, among the first states to do so. In both cases, Maryland didn’t wait for disaster to strike. It acted. Not out of fear, but conviction.
The same boldness is needed now.
By amending the Maryland Constitution to protect the right to education for all students — no matter their immigration status — the state would provide clear, unambiguous legal protection. It would ensure that no future legislature or county board of education can quietly impose exclusionary policies. It would strengthen legal defenses in the event of federal overreach or local backlash. And it would say to the 7,000 DACA recipients and 31,000 TPS holders who live here: You are part of this community, and your children belong in our schools.
Courts in Maryland have already interpreted “thorough and efficient” to mean an adequate education under contemporary standards. In Hornbeck v. Somerset County, and later in Bradford v. Maryland State Board of Education, judges affirmed that education is a fundamental right in practice, if not fully in law. But without constitutional clarity, those interpretations are vulnerable.
We’ve already seen what happens when ambiguity meets political hostility. In 2024, more unaccompanied migrant children arrived in Maryland than any other state. These kids aren’t numbers on a spreadsheet — they’re human beings seeking stability, safety and schooling. And in high-profile cases like that of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident wrongfully deported to El Salvador, we’ve learned how fragile legal protections can be without explicit state recognition.
This amendment would be a declaration of who we are. By enshrining the right to education regardless of immigration status, Maryland will boldly affirm that every child belongs. It will fight exclusion, drive down dropout rates and open the door to opportunity for thousands of students who’ve been told — explicitly or not — that they don’t count.
Their dreams do matter. A child’s worth is not — and never should be — measured in immigration papers.
Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson saw it coming in her dissent in Trump v. CASA, warning of a growing “zone of lawlessness” targeting “the poor, the uneducated, and the unpopular.” That zone is spreading fast. Every time the federal courts step back from civil rights, the ground beneath us cracks a little more. Maryland can’t fix the whole foundation — but it can fortify its corner.
Let’s call this what it is: a test of whether Maryland’s values are weatherproof. When federal safeguards fall apart, do we hold the line? Or do we let fear and politics chip away at who gets to learn and who gets left behind?
Maryland has led before.  It can lead again.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/immigrationjan2222025-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-07-26 08:57:30.307420

Frank/NPS)Members of Montana’s congressional delegation have introduced bicameral legislation implementing a presidential order that will charge international visitors to America’s national parks an additional fee.
The state’s western congressional Rep. Ryan Zinke, a former Interior Secretary during President Donald Trump’s first term, along with junior U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy, introduced the Protecting America’s Treasures by Raising Inflow from Overseas Tourists in Parks Act (PATRIOT Parks Act), which could address maintenance backlogs at some of the country’s most popular sites.
“National Parks are Americas best idea and maintaining that legacy for future generations means making smart investments in the management of the parks,” Zinke said in a press release. “Americans already pay for parks in our tax dollars as well as at the gates. It’s unfair to American taxpayers to foot the bill for millions of foreign visitors. Almost every other country charges foreign visitors more, it’s common sense. President Trump and Secretary Burgum did the right thing directing the National Park Service implement a foreign visitor fee. This legislation will codify the policy and ensure Americans are put First in our own parks.”

The idea to raise additional funds from foreign tourists has long been championed by the Property and Environment Research Center, a Bozeman-based a “free market environmentalism” nonprofit think-tank. Sheehy once served on its board.
In preliminary Interior budget documents for the 2026 fiscal year released this spring, the federal government proposed a new fee on foreign visitors to address some of the shortfall in National Park Service budgets, but simultaneously showed an agency request of just $2.1 billion, roughly two-thirds of the NPS budget in 2025.
However, the latest version of the Interior appropriations bill, which passed through committee this week, showed a budget recommendation $3.1 billion — roughly holding current funding levels intact.
Last year was the busiest on record for the NPS, with more than 331 million visitors spending time at the 433 NPS units, including historic sites, battlefields and monuments, in addition to the 63 national parks.
The increased traffic at the nation’s crown jewels have added to a deferred maintenance backlog of nearly $23 billion to maintain roads, buildings, utility systems and other facilities across the park system.
According to researchers with PERC, because roughly 80% of entrance fees charged by some NPS sites are retained at the site they are collected, increasing gate revenue could help address specific maintenance backlogs at heavily trafficked sites.
In a study using NPS data showing baseline entry fee revenue of $349 million, PERC calculated a $16, $25 and $40 surcharge for foreign visitors, with an estimate that the surcharge would correspond with a roughly 3% decrease in visitation.
The smallest surcharge would generate an additional $211 million annually, while the highest would bring in $528 million — more than doubling the current revenue.
“The current system is relatively blunt — there are lots of margins you can refine in a logical way,” Watkins said. “That’s where I think you can see big changes happen.”
Early versions of the federal directive to increase fees on foreign visitors cited an additional $90 million in fees, but neither Trump’s executive order, the latest appropriations documents, nor the newly introduced legislation have specific dollar amounts set as revenue goals.
The PATRIOT Parks Act was co-introduced in the respective chambers with Rep. Riley Moore, R-West Virginia, and Sen. Jim Banks, R-Indiana.
“Our national parks drive Montana’s tourism economy by bringing in visitors from all over the world and define our way life by offering an experience you can only find in America,” Sheehy said in a statement. “Implementing a foreign visitor fee is an America First, commonsense way to secure affordable access for American families, improve our national parks for all visitors, and better manage our treasured public lands. It’s not too much for Americans to ask that their government puts them first, and that’s why I’m proud to support the PATRIOT Parks Act so more American families can enjoy our national parks for generations to come.”
Officials who have spoken about the proposed fee changes cite other parts of the world where foreign tourists are charged more than locals. The Galapagos Islands are commonly referenced, where foreign tourists pay $200, while Ecuadorian adults pay just $30.
“It is the policy of my Administration to preserve these opportunities for American families in future generations by increasing entry fees for foreign tourists, improving affordability for United States residents, and expanding opportunities to enjoy America’s splendid national treasures,” Trumps executive order stated.
The foreign surcharge, as defined in the PATRIOT Parks Act, would only apply to NPS sites that already charge entrance fees, and exempt monuments in Washington D.C.
Canadian citizens visiting Glacier National Park are also exempt from the fee, recognizing the joint stewardship of the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park.

Twenty-eight-year-old Michaela Bonner has been working 12-hour shifts as an emergency medical technician in Norfolk, Virginia, for the past four years, while attending and paying for college to finish her prerequisites for medical school.
But now that President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending law bars students from borrowing more than $50,000 annually in unsubsidized federal loans for medical school, Bonner is worried her dream of becoming a doctor is financially out of reach.
“I get told, ‘Well, we really need you. We have a physician shortage, and you’ve done all this work leading up to this point,’ and that’s true as well, and it’s not that I want to quit,” Bonner said in a recent interview. “But there are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can’t take out the full cost of living through loans.”

The tax and spending law includes provisions that significantly alter the student loan process for higher education. The law halts current student loan repayment plans for loans that are granted on or after July 1, 2026. On that date, the law also terminates Grad PLUS loans, which have helped people pay for their higher education degrees and total cost of attendance. Current borrowers will be grandfathered in.
The federal law gives current borrowers enrolled in loan repayment plans for students based on income — such as those plans known as SAVE or IBR — until July 1, 2028, to switch to a new plan. Interest collection will resume Aug. 1 for students enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE plan.
At the same time, medical or law school students hoping to get unsubsidized federal loans — in which the borrower is responsible for paying the interest at all times rather than the government — will only be able to borrow $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in areas such as history or philosophy have a $100,000 lifetime cap.











There are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can't take out the full cost of living through loans.


– Michaela Bonner, aspiring medical student


The average yearly cost of medical school for the 2024-25 academic year ranged from around $42,000 to $72,000, depending on whether the school was private or public and whether the student was a resident or nonresident, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Some congressional Republicans say that students need to be working harder to pay for higher education, like medical school, on their own. Others say the caps put the onus back on colleges and universities to rein in the rising cost of tuition. But critics of this legislation say the loan caps are only going to harm students, especially from lower-income backgrounds, and will exacerbate physician shortages.
In recent years states have tried to ease physician shortages by implementing various policy solutions. Since 2023, at least nine states have made it easier for doctors trained in other countries to get medical licenses. States have also participated in interstate licensing compacts, allowing nurses and physician assistants to travel across state lines to work, so long as they are licensed in one state within the compact.
For student loan relief, more than 20 states have enacted legislation to address student loan forgiveness, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a group that tracks states policies. Georgia passed a measure that will expand a cancelable loan program for physicians working in rural and underserved areas. Idaho also created the Rural Nursing Loan Repayment Program, offering nurses $25,000 in forgivable loans after three years of service in a rural area.

McKenzie Richards, a health care policy fellow at the conservative think tank Cicero Institute who has been studying the pace of physician shortages, told Stateline that the national physician shortage could potentially exceed 100,000 by 2034. At the end of 2024 that projected number was closer to 64,000 physicians.
Richards said states will be looking toward more policy solutions should the student loan changes exacerbate physician shortages.
“We know what’s going to be happening coming down the line in just five years, so I think policies that states can adopt to get out of this are really important to be looking at now,” she said.
“The hope is that by capping [federal loans], it will encourage schools to lower tuition prices,” Richards added. “Then maybe they need to be admitting more students, which would have a great downstream effect for getting more doctors through.”
Other students will be in the same boat, said Lesley Turner, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Chicago and an economist.
“This is going to hit some students worse than others,” Turner told Stateline. “Those [students] in more expensive programs tend to borrow more, and so for those students they will need to return to private student loans or other ways of financing their graduate education.”
Many students were already questioning their capacity to go to medical school before the student loan caps, said Shannon Jimenez, dean of the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine.
“I expect that this bill, this cap, is going to push people out of primary care and into specialties to help pay off those higher interest rate loans,” Jimenez told Stateline. She added that caps will likely deter students from lower socioeconomic statuses from going into primary care — important in places like Arkansas, where she says there is a “maldistribution of physicians.”
“Many schools like us try to attract those students, because they’re more likely to go into primary care and serve in underserved areas. So it’s going to tie our hands in a lot of ways.”

Large states and more rural states will feel the gaps more deeply, said Richards, of the Cicero Institute. Louisiana, for example, is projected to be short almost 5,000 doctors from a variety of specialties by 2030, including close to 400 primary care doctors. Already more than a third of Louisiana physicians are close to retirement age — similar to the situation in neighboring Arkansas.
As for whether schools will just be able to lower tuition, Jimenez said, “it makes no sense.”
“We still function in a somewhat market-driven economy and have to compete with other schools around us, so our cost is based mostly on what we have to pay our faculty, and that’s not going to go down,” she said. The annual cost of attendance at her school is between $80,000 and $85,000.
Bonner, the EMT, holds a political communications degree from Regent University and now is studying biomedical sciences at Old Dominion University. She already has $20,000 in loans, she said, and for the rest of college tuition, she has paid out of pocket. Since she’s supporting herself, she hasn’t been able to save much.
She’d planned to take the medical school entrance exam next spring, but now worries about how she’d pay for living expenses while attending. “Medical school scheduling doesn’t allow for working, so you have to take out loans for living expenses,” she said.
“A lot of people, I feel, would be panicked if you had worked for eight to 10 years of your life and found out that all the systems that you were banking on in a really academically challenging space are disappearing,” Bonner said.
“I don’t see a path forward for certain, but I’m fighting to make one.”

Colorado, California, and Montana are among the states that have recently required safeguarding brain data collected by devices outside of medical settings. That includes headphones, earbuds, and other wearable consumer products that aim to improve sleep, focus, and aging by measuring electrical activity and sending the data to an app on users’ phones.
A report by the Neurorights Foundation, an advocacy group that aims to protect people from the misuse of neurotechnology, found that 29 of 30 companies with neurotechnology products that can be purchased online have access to brain data and “provide no meaningful limitations to this access.” Almost all of them can share data with third parties.
In June, the American Medical Association called for greater regulation of neural data. In April, several Democratic members of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether companies are exploiting consumers’ brain data. Juliana Gruenwald Henderson, a deputy director of the FTC’s Office of Public Affairs, said the agency had received the letter but had no additional comment.
Although current devices gather relatively basic information like sleep states, advocates for brain data protection caution that future technologies, including artificial intelligence, could extract more personal and sensitive information about people’s medical conditions or innermost thoughts.
“If you collect the data today, what can you read from it five years from now because the technology is advancing so quickly?” said Democratic state Sen. Cathy Kipp, who sponsored Colorado’s 2024 neural data protection bill when she was in the state House of Representatives.
As both excitement and trepidation about AI build, at least 28 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands have enacted some type of AI regulation separate from the privacy bills protecting neural data. President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” included a 10-year halt on states passing laws to regulate AI, but the Senate stripped that provision out of the budget reconciliation bill before voting to approve it on July 1.
The spirit of laws in Colorado, California, and Montana is to protect the neural data itself, not to regulate any algorithm or AI that might use it, said Sean Pauzauskie, medical director for the Neurorights Foundation.
But neurotechnology and AI go hand in hand, Pauzauskie said. “A lot of what these devices promise is based on pattern recognition. AI is really driving the usability and significance of the patterns in the brain data.”
Cristin Welle, a professor of neurosurgery at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, said that AI’s ability to identify patterns is a game changer in her field. “But contribution of a person’s neural data on an AI training set should be voluntary. It should be an opt-in, not a given.”
Chile in 2021 became the first country to adopt a constitutional amendment for neurorights, which prioritize human rights in the development of neurotechnology and collection of neural data, and UNESCO has said that neurotechnology and artificial intelligence could together pose a threat to human identity and autonomy.
Neurotechnology can sound like science fiction. Researchers used a cap with 128 electrodes and an AI model to decode the brain’s electric signals from thoughts into speech. And two years ago, a study described how neuroscientists reconstructed the Pink Floyd song “Another Brick in the Wall” by analyzing the brain signals of 29 epilepsy patients who listened to the song with electrodes implanted in their brains.
The aim is to use neurotechnology to help those with paralysis or speech disabilities, as well as treat or diagnose traumatic brain injuries and brain disorders such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s. Elon Musk’s Neuralink and Synchron, funded by Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, are among the companies with clinical trials underway for devices implanted in the brain.
Pauzauskie, a hospital neurologist, started worrying four years ago about the blurring of the line between clinical and consumer use of neural data. He noted that the devices used by his epilepsy patients were also available for purchase online, but without protections afforded by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in medical settings.
Pauzauskie approached Kipp two years ago at a constituent meetup in his hometown of Fort Collins to propose a law to protect brain data in Colorado. “The first words out of her mouth that I’ll never forget were, ‘Who would be against people owning their own brain data?’” he said.
Brain data protection is one of the rare issues that unite lawmakers across the political aisle. The bills in California, Montana, and Colorado passed unanimously or nearly unanimously. Montana’s law will go into effect in October.
Neural data protection laws in Colorado and California amend each state’s general consumer privacy act, while Montana’s law adds to its existing genetic information privacy act. Colorado and Montana require initial express consent to collect or use neural data and separate consent or the ability to opt out before disclosing that data to a third party. A business must provide a way for consumers to delete their data when operating in all three states.
“I want a very hard line in the sand that says, you own this completely,” said Montana state Republican Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, who sponsored his state’s neural data bill and other privacy laws. “You have to give consent. You have the right to have it deleted. You have complete rights over this information.”
For Zolnikov, Montana’s bill is a blueprint for a national neural data protection law, and Pauzauskie said support of regulatory efforts by groups like the AMA pave the way for further federal and state efforts.
Welle agreed that federal regulations are needed in addition to these new state laws. “I absolutely hope that we can come up with something on a national level that can enshrine people’s neural rights into law, because I think this is going to be more important than we can even imagine at this time.”

“Without my family, I’m nothing,” read the subject line of an email sent by then-state Rep. Gabe Evans to supporters on Sept. 10, 2023.
The email announced Evans’ candidacy for Colorado’s toss-up 8th Congressional District, and it began with a story the Fort Lupton Republican has told countless times throughout his political career — the story of his grandfather, Cuauhtemoc Chavez, who was born in Mexico and earned U.S. citizenship through his Army service in World War II.
“My family fought tooth and nail for the American dream so that future generations like me could have a better life,” Evans wrote. “And I plan on making that up to them in full.”
As a rising star in the Colorado GOP and loyal supporter of President Donald Trump’s agenda in Congress, Evans has leaned heavily on his Mexican-American heritage and the man to whom he referred in a campaign launch video as his “abuelito Chavez.” Telling and retelling the story of his grandfather, who died in 2014, is Evans’ go-to means of putting a more moderate face on the historically extreme mass-deportation policies backed by Trump and his top advisers.
“We are a nation that is ruled by law,” Evans told moderators at a January 2024 debate, responding to a question about how “millions of people living in the U.S. illegally” should be treated. “You need to go stand in that line and do it the right way, do it the legal way, so you are not leapfrogging over those folks like my grandfather, who did it the right way and did it the legal way.”
But Evans has mischaracterized the story of how his Depression-era ancestors achieved the American dream, and misstated key dates and details in his grandfather’s biography, according to documents obtained by Newsline through archival research and government records requests.
Those records show that the Chavez family, and a young Cuauhtemoc in particular, were squarely on the wrong side of the “strong immigration policies” his grandson now invokes his name to champion.
A 1941 Immigration and Naturalization Service document, obtained through a records request with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, shows that Cuauhtemoc entered the country unlawfully with his mother and siblings in 1929, at the age of 5, and resided unlawfully in Texas for the intervening 12 years. The document, known as an alien registration form, or an AR-2, was prepared shortly after Cuauhtemoc, then 16 years old, was arrested for an “immigration violation” in El Paso and “made the subject of deportation proceedings.”
At least two of Cuauhtemoc’s sisters were arrested by immigration agents on the same day, according to the nearly identical documents prepared for them. All three reported crossing the Santa Fe St. Bridge into El Paso on Dec. 9, 1929. Under a field for listing their reason for traveling to the U.S., the same typewritten words appear on all three documents: “to live, illegal entry.”
Cuauhtemoc’s AR-2 form also lists a prior, undated arrest for “attempted burglary,” placing the 16-year-old in a category of immigrants that Evans has said without exception should be deported. Evans was a vocal supporter of the Laken Riley Act, which was passed by Republican congressional majorities in January and requires federal immigration agents to prioritize the detention of any undocumented immigrant arrested for a “burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting offense.”
In the weeks preceding publication of this story, Evans appeared to acknowledge or accept the assertion that his grandfather had entered the country unlawfully in at least two interviews. His office could not point to any examples of similar disclosures during the 2024 election or before. Delanie Bomar, his spokesperson, first claimed that Evans had been “very consistent” and “clear about his family’s story,” but subsequently said his past comments may have been “confusing.”
“In Hispanic culture, immigrating the ‘right way’ generally means working hard, contributing to their community, and not causing problems — not necessarily that something is 100% perfectly legal,” Bomar wrote in an email.
Evans has described his grandfather immigrating “legally” or “the legal way” on multiple occasions, and as recently as June 24. Bomar declined to respond to questions about that language on the record and denied or ignored repeated requests to interview Evans for this story. After being sent a detailed list of questions about the documents Newsline obtained and Evans’ history of false statements about his grandfather’s immigration history, his representatives stopped responding to inquiries and ignored more than a dozen follow-up messages via phone, text and email.

“I’m more surprised than anything, but also at the same time, it doesn’t really shock me,” said Keilly Leon, north regional organizer for the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition.
“I think it just goes to show how harmful this rhetoric is — ‘I did it the right way’ versus ‘I did it the wrong way,’” added Leon, a Greeley resident and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipient. “Even folks that immigrated decades ago … experienc(ed) this way that the government has continuously allowed this broken system to separate families and force people to find other ways to come into the country.”
 Familiar anti-immigrant attitudes

By Evans’ own reckoning, his family’s story resonated with voters in Colorado’s battleground 8th District, where more than 3 in 10 residents are Mexican-American, helping propel him and other Republicans to victory in a 2024 election defined in large part by immigration and border issues. The 8th District, drawn by an independent redistricting commission in 2021, encompasses Denver’s northern suburbs and parts of rural Weld County.
“My story is the same as so many other stories in the Hispanic community that did it the right way,” he said in a June 24 radio interview. “They took the time and the effort to come here legally, to build a business, to start a family. And then they turn around and they see a bunch of folks rolling across the southern border, literally getting handed out taxpayer money for all of the different things that the Biden administration threw at them.”
Such rhetoric from Evans, Trump and other right-wing politicians did lead to a “fracturing” among Latino voters, said Romeo Guzmán, an assistant professor of history at Claremont Graduate University who studies immigration. But he said that may be changing fast as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents begin to carry out the Republican agenda. A CBS News poll released Sunday showed support for Trump’s immigration plans has fallen, with a narrow majority of Americans now opposed to his deportation program.
“There’s a kind of tension happening now, with folks who may have voted for Trump, thinking they’re somehow different from these unauthorized, quote-unquote ‘illegal’ immigrants,” Guzmán said. “What they’re finding out is that actually, for the Trump administration, for ICE, those differences are not as clear as maybe they imagined.”

Long before his grandson’s repetition of his story on the campaign trail, Cuauhtemoc Chavez belonged to a previous generation of immigrants who faced obstacles and prejudices closely resembling the ones faced by immigrants today.
In the wake of their country’s long and bloody revolution, record numbers of Mexicans entered the U.S. both lawfully and unlawfully during the 1920s. The arrivals fueled a restrictionist campaign that led to passage of the Undesirable Aliens Act of 1929, which expanded federal deportation powers and, for the first time, made crossing the border without authorization a misdemeanor criminal offense.
Evans’ great-grandmother, Luz Garcia Chavez, crossed into El Paso with her children five months after that law took effect, the INS records show. Without proof of lawful entry, the Chavez family became part of a large population of foreign nationals considered “deportable aliens” under U.S. immigration law.
Anti-immigrant sentiment deepened throughout Cuauhtemoc’s childhood in the 1930s. As the Great Depression set in, immigrants were blamed for taking jobs away from citizens, and for straining state and federal welfare programs. Young Mexican-Americans were vilified first as liquor-smuggling gangsters and then, after Prohibition’s repeal in 1933, as peddlers of marijuana and other drugs. Deportations increased, while as many as 1 million new arrivals and their children, some of them U.S.-born, were pressured into returning to Mexico as part of what became known as the “repatriation” movement.
“There is a lot of coercion that takes place, and a lot of fear tactics,” Guzmán said. “One of the ones that’s really well documented is this big raid of La Placita Olvera in L.A. that is very similar to the sort of raids that we’re seeing now — trying to have a show of force as a way to get people to go back.”
 Misrepresentations and discrepancies

At times, Evans’ statements about his grandfather have contained clear misrepresentations, such as a June 24, 2024, Facebook post stating that Cuauhtemoc had “immigrated … in search of a safer place to raise a family.” A day later, Jennifer Chavez, Cuauhtemoc’s daughter and Evans’ aunt, replied to his post.
“When your grandfather immigrated from Mexico, he was 5 years old,” Jennifer wrote. “Don’t be misleading.”
In a 2022 statement to Spanish-language newspaper La Prensa de Colorado, Evans, then a first-time state House candidate, wrote that Cuauhtemoc had “acquir(ed) citizenship in 1943,” while serving in the Army. In fact, records show that he did not apply for naturalization until several years later, in 1946. The discrepancy is significant because Cuauhtemoc’s naturalization petition indicates that he was granted citizenship under a 1944 law that eliminated proof of “lawful entry” as a requirement for naturalization.
Evans repeated the inaccurate timeline during his 2024 congressional campaign. He told the Berthoud Weekly Surveyor that it “took (Cuauhtemoc) 13 years to get his citizenship,” likening his wait to a story he’d heard on the campaign trail of a Colorado resident who “legally pursue(d) citizenship for 17 years.” But Cuauhtemoc affirmed twice — first on his 1941 AR-2 form and then on his 1946 petition for citizenship — that he had not previously applied for naturalization.

When contacted by Newsline, Jennifer Chavez said that while she wasn’t shocked by the news that her father’s family entered the country unlawfully — “that was just the way of life back then,” she said — their undocumented status was not common family knowledge.
“I don’t think anyone in the family has ever seen any of that,” Jennifer said of the INS forms Newsline obtained.
Like many American families, the present-day Chavezes are divided by politics, and Evans’ repeated invocation of Cuauhtemoc ​​to defend Republican policies drove the wedge further. Jennifer, who said she last saw Evans in person at a wedding in 2020, wrote an op-ed last year opposing his congressional candidacy. In an interview, she said her father and her nephew were on opposite sides of an estrangement in the family stretching back decades.
“Gabe, in reality, barely knew my dad,” she said. “They just didn’t see each other very often. My sister (Evans’ mother) just didn’t click with the family anymore. … He’s trying to cultivate the Latino heritage thing, but he really didn’t know my father, because he rarely saw him.”
Evans’ representatives didn’t respond to repeated requests to respond to Jennifer’s characterization of his relationship with his grandfather.
“For Gabe to portray my dad as being in support of someone like Trump would have gone over like a lead balloon,” Jennifer added. “He really misrepresented who my father was.”
When asked about another line from Evans’ campaign announcement email — in which he said that his mother, Rebecca Chavez, “thought she would spend her whole life in a one-room hut with a dirt floor in Juarez, Mexico” — Jennifer Chavez burst out laughing.
“We were raised in a middle-class neighborhood in El Paso,” she said. “We went to Eastwood High School, which was predominantly Caucasian. … To this day, none of us are fluent in Spanish.”
 ‘You need to go back’

During the 2024 campaign, Evans, though reluctant to answer the question directly, repeatedly affirmed his support for Trump’s plans to deport all of the estimated 12 million people living in the country without permanent legal status.
“​​If you are not lawfully here, you need to go back,” he said when pressed on whether he supported Trump’s “deport them all” agenda during a June 2024 primary debate. “Yeah, you go back, and you wait in line the way everybody else does in a law-abiding society.”

He softened that stance with his July 15 cosponsorship of the Dignity Act, a bipartisan proposal to provide relief from deportation to some undocumented immigrants.
The proposed relief falls far short of measures that once allowed Evans’ grandfather and other members of the Chavez family to acquire U.S. citizenship. Only those who entered the country prior to 2021 would be eligible for the program. Those who qualify would be required to pay $7,000 in restitution and be barred from accessing federal benefits, and the program would offer legal status but no pathway to citizenship — not even for so-called Dreamers, who, like Evans’ grandfather, were brought to the U.S. as children.
“No amnesty. No handouts. No citizenship,” Evans’ cosponsor, Florida Republican Rep. María Salazar, said in a press release announcing the bill.
Evans did not respond to questions about whether he supports the DACA program or a pathway to citizenship for anyone currently in the U.S. unlawfully, or why he believes immigrants today should be treated differently than his grandfather’s family was. He did not respond to questions about whether he feels he misled the public about his grandfather’s history and if he plans to change how he talks about it going forward.
Tensions have risen across the country in recent months as ICE agents begin the dramatic operational shift necessary to achieve Trump’s mass-deportation targets. The share of people in ICE detention without a criminal record has risen sharply, according to agency data analyzed by the University of California Berkeley School of Law’s Deportation Data Project. In Colorado, those recently arrested by the agency have included a family with a 1-year-old child attending an immigration court hearing in Denver; a 19-year-old Utah nursing student with no criminal record, detained after a traffic stop near Grand Junction; and prominent immigrant rights advocate Jeanette Vizguerra, a grandmother taken into custody outside her workplace, Target.
Evans has dismissed concerns about expanded ICE activity, accusing critics last week of “vilifying the law enforcement agents working to make our communities safer.” He championed the recent Republican reconciliation bill’s expansion of the agency’s funding, an $80 billion package aimed at quadrupling the scale of its detention and removal operations. He has continued to echo the anti-immigrant rhetoric that targeted young men like his grandfather a century ago, including by spreading false claims about crime rates following an influx of immigrants to Denver, and assailing Colorado’s “sanctuary” policies and a state-run program that offers health coverage to undocumented children.
There’s growing fear about Trump’s crackdown, Leon said, among immigrants in Weld County, a more rural area that lacks the vocal and organized network of advocacy groups that exists in Denver.
“We’re seeing that ICE agents are becoming more unpredictable,” said Leon. “These billions that are being thrown at ICE just harms our communities, it scares our children, who are a huge part of the Greeley community.”
“The idea that a group of people do it ‘the legal way’ or ‘the right way’ — the reality is that those categories have been slipperier and much more confused than we imagine,” Guzmán said. “Because ‘the right way’ is historically contingent on the laws that are impeding your movement.”
Soon after his inauguration, Trump launched an effort to end the centuries-old legal bedrock of birthright citizenship, a move Evans has refused to take a position on. In recent weeks, the president has threatened to “denaturalize” many legal immigrants, including New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani and other political opponents. Millions of people who entered the country over the last five years did so as lawful asylum seekers or under humanitarian parole designations like the temporary protected status program — legal avenues the Trump administration has moved aggressively to shut down.
“If you’re a refugee, what does ‘the right way’ mean?” Guzmán added. “It means you show up to the border and claim refugee status.”
“This is not a diss on anybody; people are not historians,” said Guzmán. “The problem, of course, is when people start claiming that their family did it one way, (and say) ‘why can’t you do it that way?’ — usually that’s code for both a lack of knowledge of their own family history but the larger ways in which immigration history has functioned for us.”

Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.

The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.










The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling.


– Oregon Republican state Rep. Cyrus Javadi


Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.

“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.
Trump’s deportations could cost 6M jobs, report finds

Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.
If Trump wants more deportations, he’ll need to target the construction industry

Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

Pete Ricketts could be a lot of negative as the ""same mistakes"" won't be made by Republicans.","A Dan Osborn flyer in a bar in downtown Lincoln on July 24. 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — On the same July day that registered nonpartisan labor leader Dan Osborn announced his bid against Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts in the 2026 midterms, the National Republican Senatorial Committee released a digital ad saying a social media account with ties to Osborn had liked gay porn.  
And Osborn, known for leading the pandemic-era strike for Kellogg’s workers in Omaha, argued that his working-class background makes him ideal to stand up to Ricketts and the billionaire class now running the country, alluding to the wealth of a family that created the company that became TD Ameritrade and owns Major League Baseball’s Chicago Cubs.
The tone of the NRSC ad and the Osborn rollout offer a stark contrast to the 2024 race between U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., and Osborn — and could signal the type of race to come between the industrial mechanic and a former two-term governor with Nebraska’s dominant political operation behind him.
Osborn’s bid against a senator with access to personal, political and Senate-incumbent money to campaign comes in an election year when Republicans, like most of the time when a party is in power, could lose seats and control of Congress. And it hits when some voters are losing faith in institutions and seeking alternatives. 
Attention paid
Osborn, who formally kicks off his campaign in Omaha this weekend, has Team Ricketts’ full attention after running a closer-than-expected bid against Fischer, who largely ignored him until he built a populist brand by barnstorming the state.
Populism, the political approach of appealing to ordinary people by saying their concerns have been ignored by the financial and political elites, is a driving force in modern politics. It was how President Donald Trump took over the GOP. And it feeds much of the populist left, including U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. 
Sanders, who stopped in Omaha to kick off his effort to motivate Democrats and independents after the re-election of Trump, figures prominently in some of the attack lines likely to be used against Osborn. Osborn said during his last race that as a labor leader he sometimes agreed with Sanders.
Dona-Gene Barton, a political science professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln who studies political behavior, including how people react to political messaging, said the race will get negative sooner this time around. 
“Fischer wasn’t really taking him seriously at the beginning of the campaign,” Barton said. “[Osborn] didn’t have as much name recognition, so she didn’t think that this was a serious contender.”

Ricketts told Lincoln ABC affiliate KLKN, that he and his campaign team “are going to continue to talk about and expose how left Dan Osborn really is.” 
When Fischer engaged later in her race against Osborn, she labeled him a Democrat in sheep’s clothing. 
John Dolan, Osborn’s campaign manager, said the message of the campaign against Ricketts is “fundamentally the same, but much easier to understand.” 
“Pete Ricketts is the living embodiment of everything we talk about. Billionaires own our political system,” Dolan said. 
Osborn flew under the radar against Fischer, Barton said. who treated him like an “unserious” candidate, employing a common strategy of not giving him free media coverage by discussing them during the early stages of the campaign. 
But Osborn, with a blend of economic populism and tough talk on some issues, including border security, devised an unorthodox platform that yielded one of the best performances for any nonpartisan Senate candidate in Nebraska. 
Fischer and her campaign “were caught a little flat-footed,” Barton said. 
He attracted an extraordinary fundraising haul for a federal candidate in Nebraska without direct ties to a major party, of $14 million. Fischer and Nebraska Republicans alleged that many of the millions that poured into Osborn’s 2024 campaign came from Democrats and Democratic-leaning donors. 
Fischer still beat Osborn by about six percentage points. But the race raised Osborn’s political profile. He launched a political action committee to support working-class candidates and encourage more “plumbers, carpenters, teachers, nurses, and factory workers to run for office.”

Some U.S. Senate strategists and Nebraska Republicans said Osborn could already have had his “one bite of the apple” as an independent candidate. 
The Ricketts campaign team has relentlessly criticized Osborn, pointing out that he uses ActBlue, a fundraising tool often used by Democrats, and criticizing him for paying himself and his wife a salary with fundraising money, according to the latest campaign finance filings. 
Candidates who aren’t incumbents can receive a salary, and campaign funds can be used to pay them salaries as long as the pay represents a “fair market value” for “bona fide services,” according to the Federal Election Commission. Osborn paid himself while running against Fischer, too, saying he needed to be able to campaign without shorting his employer and co-workers by constantly leaving work.
Ricketts, as expected for an incumbent senator and a former governor, significantly outraised Osborn in the second quarter of 2025, according to campaign finance filings. 
Osborn reported raising $196,541 since his July announcement, while Ricketts raised $901,113 and his separate Pete Ricketts Victory Fund raised $1.2 million. His victory fund can be used for multiple races, political parties, and causes. 
Avoiding same mistakes
Ricketts has been a dominant political force in the state. He has used his own money to influence Nebraska politics. His endorsement carries weight. Some Republicans who crossed him in the Legislature have lost seats. And his operatives have a reputation for bare-knuckled brawling in political mailers.
One example came in 2020, when the formerly Ricketts-steered state GOP set its sights on long-time GOP volunteer, Janet Palmtag, because she ran against a fellow Republican, State Sen. Julie Slama of Dunbar in 2020.
Ricketts, who was then governor, appointed Slama to the Legislature in 2019 after former State Sen. Dan Watermeier left to become a member of the Nebraska Public Service Commission. 
The state GOP at the time paid for mailers that claimed Palmtag “broke the law” and “lost” her real estate license and was unfit to become a state senator. The claims were based on a 2017 case before the Iowa Real Estate Commission in which Palmtag, the owner of a real estate firm that operated in Nebraska, Missouri and Iowa, agreed to pay a $500 fine on behalf of her firm to resolve a mistake made by one of the firm’s agents.
The agent, who had been gravely ill, failed to obtain all the necessary signatures to transfer an earnest deposit for the sale of a home in Iowa, and Palmtag owned the real estate firm, so she was responsible for the firm’s work.
Palmtag sued the party for defamation in 2020. This year, a jury agreed with her that she had been defamed by the mailers and awarded her $500,000. The new post-Ricketts leadership of the state GOP did not appeal the verdict.
Some regional and national Republican strategists, including one from the group responsible for policing Osborn’s likes on social media, said the “same mistakes” made by the Fischer campaign would not be repeated this time around. 
“Pete Ricketts is a conservative champion who is working in lockstep with President Trump to protect the Good Life and put America first,” said Joanna Rodriguez, the communications director for the NRSC and a former Ricketts staffer. 
Will Coup, a Ricketts campaign spokesperson, told the Examiner, “Senator Ricketts has consistently worked for and voted to secure the border and cut taxes for Nebraska workers, families, and seniors.”
Rodriguez described Ricketts as a “strong messenger to call out Dan Osborn’s collusion with national Democrats to try to infiltrate Nebraska with their radical agenda.”
Osborn’s relationship with Democrats in the state is complex. He flirted with seeking Democratic support in 2024 until it was too late for the party to run its own candidate, which led to some Democrats grumbling at Osborn and his supporters for trying to minimize the number of names on the general election ballot for his Senate race, other than his and Fischer’s. 
Many Democrats kept the independent at arm’s length until later in the campaign. But he has many Democratic supporters, and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee gave him money once national leaders saw his momentum. 
State voting records show Osborn as a registered nonpartisan since at least 2004, as the Examiner previously reported. Osborn said he has maintained independence from the Democratic Party and, if elected, won’t caucus with either party. 
“I didn’t ask for that money,” Osborn said. “This time around, I’m not going to ask for it again.” 
The Nebraska Democratic Party has indicated that it has no plans to recruit a Democratic candidate to the race, saying in a statement that, “Breaking up the one-party stranglehold on our state is going to take an unlikely alliance of Democrats, Republicans, and Independents coming together to fix a very broken Washington, D.C.” A Democrat could file to run anyway. 
Osborn told the Examiner that Democrats and Republicans are “going to do what they do,” but he wants to show people that a candidate without a party can win in Nebraska or any state. He plans a retail campaign, centered around the “old school politics” of hosting about 300 public events around Nebraska. 
The “secret sauce,” he said, is to meet people and learn about the issues that voters face the most, because he is “applying for a public service job.” He said he knows winning, especially against Ricketts, would require strong fundraising numbers. 
Voter turnout in midterm elections is often lower than in presidential years. which could benefit Democrats as the party out of presidential and congressional power, Republicans have benefited more from high-turnout elections when Trump is on the ballot. 
Osborn says he wants to drive up turnout, because he’s at a “stronger” starting point now than in 2024 — with more people in the state who know who he is. They know that he’s “unapologetically for the workers and their issues.”
‘Does this guy have a shot?’
Another difference in this race is that Ricketts just won a special election to hold the Senate seat in November. So, the former governor could benefit from having been recently on the ballot, where he overwhelmingly defeated Democratic challenger Preston Love Jr., an Omaha civil rights activist.
Barton, the UNL professor, said Ricketts also is polling higher than Fischer in early polling compared to 2024. 
Osborn’s exploratory committee released a poll earlier this year, indicating he is statistically tied with U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts. The Ricketts camp called it “fake polling” meant to generate hope. 
Barton said she was one of the few Nebraska political observers who said Osborn had a chance in 2024. This time around, she said it would be a tall task for the former Omaha labor leader. 
“Does this guy have a shot? I would say no,” she said. “We have the results from that election that help us see what might happen this next time around.”
The nonpartisan Center for Politics, the home of Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball, changed the rating of Nebraska’s 2026 Senate race from Safe Republican to Likely Republican after Osborn’s announcement, a hint that Ricketts could be in for a fight. The Cook Political Report has the race listed as solid Republican.
“Senator Ricketts will work as hard for this election as he has for every election,” Coup said. “He’s taking nothing for granted and will earn the trust of voters.”

(Courtesy of Buffett Early Childhood Institute) OMAHA — Earlier this year, Omahan Walter Gilliam was invited to talk to Connecticut lawmakers about the benefits of what soon became a $300 million endowment fund to reduce child care costs for families and create thousands of new preschool slots in that state.
Last week, Gilliam, executive director of the University of Nebraska’s Buffett Early Childhood Institute, said he was on the phone advising Kentucky officials who want to pass similar legislation.

But in the state he’s called home since 2023, Gilliam said he has not witnessed meaningful movement toward legislation that would grow the amount of child care spaces. The inertia comes as the Buffett group puts the gap between potential need and capacity in the state at roughly 17,500 slots, despite Nebraska legislators saying child care should be a priority.
“States all over the country — red, blue and purple, contact us to be able to make a difference for child care in their state,” said Gilliam, who grew up in Kentucky and came to Nebraska from Yale University in Connecticut. “I can assure you their need is no greater than in Nebraska.”
More proactive states, Gilliam said, have “less of a gap between intent and action.” He is hoping that a new poll — aimed at better understanding what Nebraska Republicans, the state’s dominant voting bloc, think about child care — will help spur change. 
 ‘Serious’ challenge 

Buffett partnered with Washington D.C.-based Bipartisan Policy Center on the survey, which indicated 83% of Nebraska respondents agreeing (and 47% “definitely” agreeing) that child care is “essential for working families and a strong economy.”

Yet 75% said finding affordable and reliable child care was a serious challenge in their community. Nearly 53% named cost as the biggest barrier.
According to the national Economic Policy Institute, average annual expenses for infant care in Nebraska have reached $14,106, or about $5,000 more per year than in-state tuition for four-year public college. For a 4-year-old, child care costs have approached nearly $12,000 a year.
Among poll highlights: 

About 60% of respondents were concerned that child care barriers could disrupt the hiring and retention of workers.
Nearly 45% said they knew someone who turned down a job, promotion or reduced hours or quit working for lack of affordable and reliable child care.
Asked to select two sources most responsible for helping parents access quality child care, top picks went to: parents or families (56.6%); religious organizations (26.6%); employers (25.3%); community organizations (22%); state government (16.2%); local government (9.4%) and the federal government (7.8%).

 Intimately aware

Gilliam said child care is not a viable business model, as providers face high staff turnover and low employee pay. He said states such as Connecticut and Montana recognized that by this year creating state-driven trust funds to support early childhood education programs. 
He pointed out that New Mexico lawmakers established a similar fund in 2020 with about $300 million in seed money. The state designates a portion of surplus oil and gas revenues to help sustain the trust fund. In 2022, voters also approved a ballot initiative to provide further financial support for early childhood education programs.
Not every state has a surplus to dedicate, Gilliam acknowledged, but he said many do at various times. He views early childhood care as an infrastructure investment that helps grow a state’s workforce and economy.

State Sen. Brian Hardin, a Republican who chairs the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee, said he is intimately aware of the demand, need and challenges of child care — he co-owns a child care center in Denver. But when it comes to further government subsidies at taxpayer expense, the Gering lawmaker is wary.
“We are really good at starting entitlements,” said Hardin. “We are really really bad at shutting them down.”
He pointed to budget woes already facing the state and lawmakers in the coming session. Nebraska’s latest financial update puts the state’s current two-year budget in the red, facing a projected deficit of $95.3 million.

The solution to more accessible child care, Hardin said, lies in a multi-pronged “community” approach that starts with private businesses and employers. 
“A lot of employers have kind of sat back and kept their heads down, frankly, and have ignored that they have to step up … to offset some of that cost,” he said.
 Rural, urban, all idealogies

State Sen. John Fredrickson, an Omaha Democrat on the Health and Human Services Committee, said no one should be surprised by the results of the Buffett poll. Indeed, much of the Nebraska survey results align with a related national poll, which indicated that about 90% of surveyed Republican voters said child care was critical to families and the economy.
Fredrickson called child care a universal concern of Nebraskans — urban and rural parts and of all ideologies.
The Nebraska Legislature’s Planning Committee has called child care and affordable housing top state priorities, based on survey responses from state lawmakers. 
Next month, the committee is to hold another meeting on child care. But Fredrickson is not holding his breath for “transformational” child care-related legislation in the coming session.

“We seem to acknowledge these are top priorities, yet we have yet to make transformational and courageous investment in them,” he said. “Instead we’re glamorizing this idea of cutting, cutting and cutting at all costs.”
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen recently asked state agencies to submit proposals on how they’d reduce general fund spending by 10% next year, and he continues to repeat his pledge to run government like a business.











“We are really good at starting entitlements. We are really really bad at shutting them down.”


– State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering



Fredrickson said he hopes lawmakers still will make inroads for the child care industry, partly by continuing a push for fewer unnecessary regulatory or bureaucratic impediments. He noted the recent passage of a bill that streamlined background checks for child care providers.
Said Gilliam: “It doesn’t grow the amount of child care slots, but it does try to stabilize the child care workforce.”
 Steps forward 

Gilliam and others said Nebraska has implemented other changes that collectively have made child care more accessible to families.
In 2021, for example, the Legislature enacted a key measure championed by State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha, which expanded income eligibility levels for the child care subsidy program. According to First Five Nebraska, which focuses on early childhood care, that legislation made assistance accessible to roughly 2,500 more families. 
Fredrickson expects the Legislature during its next session to consider DeBoer’s Legislative Bill 304, which would make permanent the expanded income eligibility levels that went from 130% to 185% of the federal poverty level. 
A sticking point in LB 304, which stalled in committee state last session, is which funding source would cover added costs. 
If the measure dies, expanded income eligibility will expire in October 2026. And First Five says Nebraska “will plummet to the bottom of the nation for access to the child care subsidy, based on household income.”

 Rough fiscal climate 

First Five’s  2025 legislative roundup said the state’s fiscal climate made it hard this past session to advance major early childhood priorities, but it said the state did preserve “several critical early childhood initiatives that had been at risk of cuts or rejection.”
Deputy Director Elizabeth Everett of First Five wrote, for example, that the Legislature protected funding for the Sixpence early childhood education endowment cash fund. 
Progress last year included legislation, introduced by Fredrickson, that allowed a child care program to receive a subsidy reimbursement for kids under the direct care of their own parents who are employed by the program. 
First Five leaders also note a measure that incorporated the Nebraska Child Care and School Readiness Tax Credit Acts. The combined tax credits, they said, could provide up to $25 million in annual credits starting in 2024 to ease financial pressures on families, develop the early childhood workforce and incent private sector contributions to child care. 
“I think it’s fair to say that when it comes to child care in the state of Nebraska, nobody – parents, policymakers, or advocates – would say they are satisfied,” said First Five executive director Jason Prokop. “More work still needs to be done, and additional state investment should be made to help Nebraska’s families have better access to reliable, safe and affordable child care options.”



Sizing up Republican views 
About 475 Nebraskans, largely Republicans and a slice of nonpartisan voters, were surveyed in June as part of a larger national poll that included an oversample of Nebraskans by the polling firm Cygnal. 
The poll was commissioned by Washington D.C.-based Bipartisan Policy Center and the Omaha-based Buffett Early Childhood Institute covered the oversample cost.
More of the Nebraska results:

About 47% of respondents supported and 29% opposed increasing public funding for child care services. Nearly 19% were neutral.


About 33% supported and 44% opposed a potential tax or fee hike to increase public funding for child care services. About 18% were neutral.
About 46% said they’d be more likely to vote for an elected official who supports increasing funding for child care services; 23% were less likely, and 22% said it made no difference.",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Educare_Indian-Hill_photo-option3-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-26 06:56:14.704006

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)State lawmakers across the country filed more bills to restrict or protect libraries and readers in the first half of this year than last year, a new report found.
The split fell largely along geographic lines, according to the report from EveryLibrary, a group that advocates against book bans and censorship.
Between January and July 2025, lawmakers introduced 133 bills that the organization deemed harmful to libraries, librarians or readers’ rights in 33 states — an increase from 121 bills in all of 2024. Fourteen of those measures had passed as of mid-July.
At the same time, legislators introduced 76 bills in 32 states to protect library services or affirm the right to read, the report found.

The geographic split among these policies is stark.
In Southern and Plains states, new laws increasingly criminalize certain actions of librarians, restrict access to materials about gender and race, and transfer decision-making power to politically appointed boards or parent-led councils.
Texas alone passed a trio of sweeping laws stripping educators of certain legal protections when providing potentially obscene materials; banning public funding for instructional materials containing obscene content; and giving parents more authority over student reading choices and new library additions.
Tennessee lowered the bar to prosecute educators for sharing books that might be considered “harmful to minors.”
A New Hampshire bill likewise would’ve made it easier for parents or the state attorney general to bring civil actions against school employees for distributing material deemed harmful to minors, but it was vetoed by Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte.
In Nebraska, a new law allows for real-time alerts for parents every time a student checks out a book. South Dakota requires libraries and schools to install filtering software. New laws in Idaho heighten the requirements to form library districts and mandate stricter internet filtering policies that are tied to state funding.

In contrast, several Northeastern states have passed legislation protections for libraries and librarians and anti-censorship laws.
New Jersey, Delaware, Rhode Island and Connecticut have each enacted “freedom to read” or other laws that codify protections against ideological censorship in libraries.
Connecticut also took a major step in modernizing libraries in the digital age, the report said, becoming the first state in the nation to pass a law regulating how libraries license and manage e-books and digital audiobooks.

(Photo: Energy & Policy Institute)As North Carolina lawmakers prepare to override Gov. Josh Stein’s veto of a controversial energy bill, constituents are receiving mailers from a dark money entity with ties to Duke Energy’s industrial and commercial customers.
Citizens for NC Jobs registered with the state as a nonprofit in January and launched a Facebook page three days after lawmakers introduced the legislation in March. The group is specifically targeting Democrats who voted with Republicans to pass the measure, likely aiming to maintain the members’ support ahead of the override vote.
Senate Bill 266 eliminates Duke Energy’s 2030 carbon emissions limits and shifts costs and risks from the company’s shareholders and industrial customers – including power-hungry data centers – to residential users. Eleven Democrats in the House and three Democrats in the state Senate broke with their party last month and joined the Republican majority to pass the controversial bill.
The measure aims to make building large-scale methane gas and nuclear plants more economically attractive for Duke Energy by forcing customers to pay for them before the plants are operational through a financing mechanism called construction work in progress or CWIP. With CWIP, customers rather than shareholders would be on the hook for repayment if a project falls through. The consequences of CWIP continue to be evident in South Carolina, where Santee Cooper customers are still paying $9 billion for an abandoned nuclear reactor project at the V.C. Summer plant, which never generated power due to delays and cost overruns.  After the Summer project collapsed, four executives from a partner utility company involved in the project were criminally sentenced for fraud and lying to federal investigators.
S. 266 would also shift costs from large-load customers to residential users. Currently, Duke Energy’s residential customers in North Carolina use just over 40% of all the power the company purchases, rather than generates itself, and they pay for about 41% of the costs. An analysis by EQ Research found that under S. 266 residential customers would continue to use the same 40% of purchased power but would bear almost 49% of the costs. This cost shift to smaller-load users is being considered as a growing number of power-hungry data centers are eying North Carolina for expansion.

Source: EQ Research
Another analysis released this week by BW Research found that S. 266 would also lead to a loss of over 50,000 jobs and $1.5 billion in unrealized state tax revenue due to a decline in power sector investments, and to a state energy capacity shortfall of as much as 12 gigawatts. The analysis used modeling by the North Carolina Public Staff, which advocates for customers’ interests at the state Utilities Commission.
S. 266 was introduced by former state Sen. Paul Newton, who retired from his job as Duke Energy’s North Carolina president in 2015. He claimed the bill would save the utility’s North Carolina customers $13 billion but did not release the analysis or explain how the figure was calculated. In response, a trio of North Carolina State University professors specializing in utility economics conducted their own analysis of the proposal and found it could potentially raise customers’ bills by $23 billion by 2050 due to volatility in the price of methane gas, upon which Duke Energy is becoming increasingly dependent.
Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, vetoed S. 266 earlier this month. He said the bill’s climate provision was “sending the wrong signal to businesses that want to be a part of our clean energy economy,” while the cost-shift section meant “families will pay more so that industry pays less.”
Legislators may vote to override the veto as early as July 29 when the Senate and House reconvene.  The House passed S. 266 by a final vote of 75-36 and the Senate by a vote of 29-11. Overriding a governor’s veto requires a three-fifths supermajority of lawmakers present at the time the vote is called, so the margin needed can vary. Assuming full attendance, Republicans hold a supermajority in the Senate, but House Republicans have only 71 members – one short of a supermajority.
Industrial interests tied to the mailers
Constituents of some of the Democrats who voted with Republicans on S. 266 have received mailers from an obscure nonprofit about the upcoming override vote that repeats challenged claims about cost savings to customers and asks recipients to call and thank their representative for supporting it.
The Energy and Policy Institute obtained a copy of the mailer targeting state Rep. Ray Jeffers, a Democrat who voted for S. 266. He represents parts of Durham County and Person County, where Duke Energy is among the largest employers and taxpayers.
The text on the mailer says it was paid for by Citizens for NC Jobs, a nonprofit that registered with the state in January 2025 and launched a Facebook page on March 13, three days after the legislation was initially introduced as S. 261. Newton, the former Duke Energy executive, resigned from the Senate to take another job, and the text was cut from his bill and pasted into a stripped-out S. 266 that had been introduced to speed rebuilding in the western part of the state after flooding from Hurricane Helene.
In paperwork filed with the state, Citizens for NC Jobs disclosed its registering entity as “WASLAW” and gave among its addresses that of Ward and Smith, a North Carolina law firm. Ward and Smith practice before the North Carolina Utilities Commission as counsel for two organizations representing the interests of Duke Energy’s large industrial and commercial customers: Carolina Industrial Group for Fair Utility Rates (CIGFUR) and Carolina Utility Customers Association (CUCA). Susan Vick, a lobbyist for the groups, told EPI that her firm merely registered the paperwork for the nonprofit, has had no further contact, and was unaware of the mailers.
Citizens for NC Jobs’ registration paperwork also lists the exact same mailing and principal office address, down to the suite number, as the North Carolina Chamber, the state’s top business lobby. Duke Energy is a top-tier “Pinnacle” member of the NC Chamber, with a seat on its strategic board. Last year, Duke’s state president Kendal Bowman co-chaired a Chamber fundraising campaign. The NC Chamber did not respond to EPI’s request for comment.
The NC Chamber has lobbied legislators to support S. 266. In an email obtained by EPI, NC Chamber lobbyist Alyssa Morrissey accused Gov. Stein’s veto statement of “cherry pick[ing]” data on the bill’s cost. In lobbying materials reviewed by EPI, the NC Chamber dismissed the N.C. State analysis as a “scare tactic” and urged a vote to override Stein’s veto. In another email obtained by EPI, Morrissey told lawmakers this week that utilities have addressed the methane gas price volatility issue, arguing that they have “various mitigation strategies” to manage it. However, an analysis conducted last year by EQ Research for the Environmental Defense Fund showed that since 2017 methane gas has been the primary driver behind rising Duke Energy electric bills in North Carolina.
The vote to override Stein’s veto of S. 266 will take place in a legislature awash with Duke Energy and other industry money. Over the past decade, Duke Energy has contributed over $2.5 million to North Carolina politics; among its top recipients were Newton’s campaign as well as that of state Sen. Dan Blue, one of the Democrats who voted for S. 266. Over the same period, the NC Chamber has contributed over $438,000 to North Carolina politics, and Newton and Blue were also among its top beneficiaries. On Aug. 13, Blue will be among the featured speakers at a Citizens for NC Jobs conference in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, along with U.S. Rep. Tim Moore, state Senate leader Phil Berger, and state House Speaker Destin Hall, all Republicans.

(AP Photo/Olga Fedorova)All modern U.S. presidents, both Republican and Democratic, have attempted to reduce the population of millions of undocumented immigrants. But their various strategies have not had significant results, with the population hovering around 11 million from 2005 to 2022.
President Donald Trump seeks to change that.
With harsh rhetoric that has sowed fear in immigrant communities, and policies that ignore immigrants’ due process rights, Trump has pursued deportation tactics that differ dramatically from those of any other modern U.S. president.
As a scholar who examines the history of U.S. immigration law and enforcement, I believe that it remains far from clear whether the Trump White House will significantly reduce the undocumented population. But even if the administration’s efforts fail, the fear and damage to the U.S. immigrant community will remain.
 
Presidents Bush and Obama
To increase deportations, in 2006 President George W. Bush began using workplace raids. Among these sweeps was the then-largest immigration workplace operation in U.S. history at a meat processing plant in Postville, Iowa in 2008.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement deployed 900 agents in Postville and arrested 398 employees, 98% of whom were Latino. They were chained together and arraigned in groups of 10 for felony criminal charges of aggravated identity theft, document fraud and use of stolen Social Security numbers. Some 300 were convicted, and 297 of them served jail sentences before being deported.
In 2008, Bush also initiated Secure Communities, a policy that sought to deport noncitizens — both lawful permanent residents as well as undocumented immigrants — who had been arrested for crimes. Some 2 million immigrants were deported during Bush’s two terms in office.
The Obama administration limited Secure Communities to focus on the removal of noncitizens convicted of felonies. It deported a record 400,000 noncitizens in fiscal year 2013, which led detractors to refer to President Barack Obama as the “Deporter in Chief.”
Obama also targeted recent entrants and national security threats and pursued criminal prosecutions for illegal reentry to the U.S. Almost all of these policies built on Bush’s, although Obama virtually abandoned workplace raids.
Despite these enforcement measures, Obama also initiated Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, in 2012. The policy provided relief from deportation and gave work authorization to more than 500,000 undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children.
Obama deported about 3 million noncitizens, but the size of the undocumented population did not decrease dramatically.
 
The first Trump administration and Biden
Trump’s first administration broke new immigration enforcement ground in several ways.
He began his presidency by issuing what was called a “Muslim ban” to restrict the entry into the U.S. of noncitizens from predominantly Muslim nations.
Early in Trump’s first administration, federal agents expanded immigration operations to include raids at courthouses, which previously had been off-limits.
In 2017, Trump tried to rescind DACA, but the Supreme Court rejected those efforts in 2020.
In 2019, Trump implemented the Remain in Mexico policy that for the first time forced noncitizens who came to the U.S. border seeking asylum to wait in Mexico while their claims were being decided. He also invoked Title 42 in 2020 to close U.S. borders during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Trump succeeded in reducing legal immigration numbers during his first term. However, there is no evidence that his enforcement policies reduced the size of the overall undocumented population.
President Joe Biden sought to relax — although not abandon — some immigration enforcement measures implemented during Trump’s first term.
His administration slowed construction of the border wall championed by Trump. Biden also stopped workplace raids in 2021, and in 2023, he ended Title 42.
In 2023, Biden sought to respond to migration surges in a measured fashion, by temporarily closing ports of entry and increasing arrests.
In attempting to enforce the borders, his administration at times pursued tough measures. Biden continued deportation efforts directed at criminal noncitizens. Immigrant rights groups criticized his administration when armed Border Patrol officers on horseback were videotaped chasing Haitian migrants on the U.S.-Mexico border.
As of 2022, the middle of the Biden’s term, an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants lived in the U.S.
 
A second chance
Since his second inauguration, Trump has pursued a mass deportation campaign through executive orders unprecedented in their scope.
In January 2025, he announced an expanded, expedited removal process for any noncitizen apprehended anywhere in the country — not just the border region, as had been U.S. practice since 1996.
In March, Trump issued a presidential proclamation to deport Venezuelan nationals who were members of the Tren de Aragua gang, designated a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department. In doing so, he invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 — an act used three times in U.S. history during declared wars that empowers presidents to remove foreign nationals from countries at war with the U.S.
Declaring an “invasion” of migrants into the U.S. in June, Trump deployed the military to assist in immigration enforcement in Los Angeles.
Trump also sought to dramatically upend birthright citizenship, the Constitutional provision that guarantees citizenship to any person born in the U.S. He issued an executive order in January that would bar citizenship to people born in the U.S. to undocumented parents.
The birthright executive order has been challenged in federal court and is mostly likely working its way up to the Supreme Court.
Under the second Trump administration, immigration arrests are up, but actual deportation numbers are in flux.
ICE in June arrested the most people in a month in at least five years, roughly 30,000 immigrants. But deportations of noncitizens — roughly 18,000 — lagged behind those during the Obama administration’s record-setting year of 2013, in which more than 400,000 noncitizens were deported.
The gap between arrests and deportations shows the challenges the Trump administration faces in making good on his promised mass deportation campaign.
Undocumented immigrants often come to the U.S. to work or seek safety from natural disasters and mass violence.
These issues have not been seriously addressed by any modern U.S. president. Until it is, we can expect the undocumented population to remain in the millions.

Michael Gordon is one of three Department of Justice (DOJ) employees who filed a lawsuit on Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. All three previously worked on the prosecution of January 6th defendants, indicating that their terminations were “retaliations for prosecutions that were perceived as politically affiliated,” according to the lawsuit.
Gordon says he was conducting a virtual witness preparation interview for an upcoming criminal trial on June 27 when an administrative officer asked him to pause the call as he was handed a one-page document signed by Bondi informing him that he was being removed from his position as an Assistant U.S. Attorney “effective immediately,” with no justification given to why he was being fired.
The heart of the lawsuit filed by Gordon and his two DOJ colleagues – Patricia Hartman and Joseph Tirrell – is that Bondi disregarded long-standing protections that govern how and when members of the civil service can be terminated.
“The laws on the books are crystal clear about the procedures that have to be followed to fire federal employees who are protected by them,” Gordon said while speaking to this reporter on WMNF 88.5 FM on Friday. “Crystal clear. It’s not a gray area. And here, the DOJ has just completely ignored the law.”
 Retribution

The Trump administration hasn’t been subtle about trying to remove anyone in the federal government who has been involved in investigations stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. 
ABC News reported in late January that the DOJ asked for information about potentially “thousands” of FBI employees across the country who were involved in that investigation, and they have subsequently fired dozens of career prosecutors during the past six months, the Washington Post reported last week.
Gordon says that morale in his office “is in a bad place right now” with DOJ employees around the country asking, “am I next?”
He says they’re asking questions that Americans shouldn’t want federal prosecutors to answer, such as: “The facts and the law say that I should charge this case, but is this going to be something the president wants? Am I going to be fired for this down the line?”
 Mike Gordon v. the United States

“I have been a professional fighter on behalf of the government for my whole legal career,” he says. “Now I’m on the other side of it. I’m fighting against the government. I have been standing up in court for eight-and-a-half years and I start by saying, ’Your honor, Mike Gordon for the United States.’ Now my name is on a federal lawsuit, where it’s Mike Gordon v. the United States. Which is a bizarre place to be.”
Gordon began working in the Middle District of Florida in January of 2017. He worked in the violent crime and narcotics section but volunteered to prosecute January 6 rioters after he watched the attack on the Capitol that day from his home office in Tampa. 
He ended up as a senior trial counsel in the Capitol Siege Section of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Washington, prosecuting some of the more recognizable defendants, such as Richard Barnett, the man who was seen putting his feet up on a desk in the office of then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Ray Epps, who became a target of conspiracy theorists that he was an undercover agent who helped instigate the uprising. 
At the time of his termination, Gordon was counsel of record in 17 cases for the Middle District of Florida, had 20 ongoing investigations, and was slated to have at least six trials between now and September, the legal filing says.
During the 2024 campaign, Trump said if elected he would grant clemency to at least some of his supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, which Gordon said he expected would happen if Trump were re-elected.

But Gordon says he was absolutely “shocked” when Trump commuted the sentences of some individuals convicted of events on that day and granted a full and unconditional pardon to more than 1,000 others who were charged in the attack on the U.S. Capitol.
“As much as Donald Trump had campaigned on many issues, one of the things that he had done is he had hugged law enforcement,” he says. “He said that he ‘backed the blue,’ that he was a big supporter of law enforcement. So I never thought that he would pardon people who were either convicted of ,or pled guilty to, assaulting law enforcement officers. And I thought that not just because it was morally and ethically wrong to do that, but also because I thought that would politically inflame his base.”
He’s never met Bondi
Gordon says he’s never met Bondi even though prior to her appointment as AG they both lived in Tampa and have a lot of mutual acquaintances in the legal world.
“This is my speculation, but I suspect she has no idea who I am,” he says. “She might now given the news. I think someone else identified me somehow for political revenge or political retribution, put my name in a letter, put it on her desk, and she probably signed it.”
Gordon says he intends to use the public attention focused on him right now to voice his concerns about what’s happening with the justice system  under the Trump administration.
“The Trump administration is walking around the house, dousing it with gasoline and playing with matches in the corner,” he says. “And we all have to stand up and shout from the rooftops before that match gets lit and the house goes up in flames.”

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)A mistake by a state emergency operations center worker inadvertently sent emergency alert test messages to cellphones across Alaska on Wednesday afternoon.
Mark Roberts, head of the emergency operations center, said the error occurred when a worker was conducting a regular weekly test of the Emergency Alert System, which broadcasts disaster warnings by radio and TV.
“When our operator went to select that test, they inadvertently selected the wireless emergency alert test as well,” he said.
The Wireless Emergency Alert system, mandated by the federal government, distributes emergency messages to every cellphone in an area specified by emergency managers.



How do I enable warning messages on my phone?
All new cellphones come with emergency alerts enabled by default. Test messages are not enabled.
To enable test messages or to double-check that emergency alerts are active on your phone, search for “government alerts” or “emergency alerts” in your cellphone’s settings.
On an iPhone, they can be found under Settings > Notifications > Government Alerts. Many Android phones have the setting under “state and local tests.”



Unlike a notorious 2018 incident in Hawaii, when a test failure caused a statewide missile attack alert, Alaska’s Wednesday alert was clearly identified as a test and was distributed only to Alaskans who have manually enabled test alerts in their cellphone settings.
“This was not a live alert, so it didn’t go out to everybody,” he said. “They come, by default, not enabled … so mainly the folks that got it were emergency managers we work with within the state.”
Though inadvertent, the alert was a successful test of state officials’ ability to trigger the Wireless Emergency Alert network.
A nationwide test took place in October 2023, and emergency officials issued a statewide Amber Alert to cellphones in June 2023, but until Wednesday, there had been no statewide alerts since then. 
Some alerts have gone out locally. Earlier this month, tsunami warning messages were thrown to cellphones in Anchorage and along the coast after a major earthquake near Sand Point.
No impactful tsunami resulted from that incident, but in other states, the use of local cellphone alerts has saved lives. In some cases, failures to issue an alert may have cost them.
Earlier this month, more than 130 people died in Texas amid widespread flash flooding. Officials there failed to use the federal cellphone warning system, which likely contributed to the death toll. 
In California and Hawaii, Wireless Emergency Alert messages about deadly wildfires also failed to reach people in time.
In the City and Borough of Juneau, officials are preparing for what’s known as a jökulhlaup — a glacial outburst flood — of the kind that inundated parts of the city last year. 
A new flood is expected in early August, and though local officials have since constructed flood barriers, they’re also preparing for another disaster.
At 3:30 p.m. Thursday, the city successfully tested a local emergency message sent through the Wireless Emergency Alert network to phones in the area.
Additional disaster preparation is already underway in the city, with organizations scheduled to fill and distribute sandbags this weekend.

The island, now part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, was the site of atomic weapons tests in 1965, 1969 and 1971. (Photo provided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)This July marked 80 years since the U.S. government detonated the first atomic bomb in the desert of southern New Mexico, marking the start of the nuclear age — and an ongoing nightmare for the people who call the area home.

Compensation program for health damage from Alaska weapons tests is extended

	That test, known as Trinity, blanketed rural communities in radioactive fallout. No one was warned. No one was evacuated. Families drank radioactive rainwater, breathed in ash, and were left to carry the burden in silence.
Now, for the first time in history, those communities will finally be acknowledged.
Earlier versions of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), originally passed in 1990, offered compensation to “downwinders” impacted by nuclear testing in Nevada and to others who’d worked as uranium miners before 1971. But New Mexicans and other long suffering communities were left out.
But now that law, which expired last year, has been renewed and expanded to include New Mexico’s Trinity downwinders, post-1971 uranium mine workers, and other affected communities in Missouri, Tennessee, Alaska, Kentucky, and beyond.
But this long-overdue justice comes with a gut punch: the RECA expansion is buried inside Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” the GOP budget that slashes Medicaid, SNAP, and rural health care — lifelines for the very people this bill claims to protect — to finance tax cuts for the wealthy.
This is not justice.
I come from generations of Nuevomexicanos who’ve lived and worked on these lands for decades. Both of my grandparents have battled cancer. And while we may never get a clear answer, we can’t help but wonder if it was because of exposure to the radioactive legacy that’s haunted New Mexico for generations.
These aren’t isolated stories. They’re echoed across our pueblos, acequias, and towns. From the Navajo Nation, where uranium miners were sent underground without protection, to the 1979 Church Rock disaster — the worst nuclear spill in U.S. history — our communities have borne the brunt of nuclear colonialism while being erased from the story.
When RECA was passed in 1990, it excluded us. Even as cancers and birth defects multiplied, even as we buried our elders and our children, we were told our suffering didn’t count. When the program expired in 2024, it slammed the door shut on new claims.
Now, with a revival of RECA on the table, it’s a historic moment. But the same bill that expands RECA also threatens to strip millions of people of their basic health care.
I crunched the numbers in a new fact sheet for the Institute for Policy Studies.
In the 16 RECA-eligible states alone, I found that this bill will rip health insurance away from over 3.9 million people — including 103,719 in New Mexico, the very state whose residents were sacrificed to build the U.S. nuclear empire.
The total figure includes over 1.4 million people losing Medicaid coverage and another 2.5 million losing Affordable Care Act coverage. On top of that, a total of 240 rural hospitals in these states are considered at risk of closing.
These are not just numbers — they are lives. Aging uranium miners. Downwinders living in remote, medically underserved areas. Elders in rural towns who have no alternative when their hospital closes.
This bill gives with one hand and takes away with the other. That’s not justice — it’s policy murder.
I welcome the long-overdue recognition of downwinders from New Mexico and other impacted communities in RECA. But what does that mean if those same people are losing access to health care? Many rely on Medicaid and rural hospitals. If those lifelines vanish, how will they get diagnosed, let alone treated?
Even this “win” is short-lived: RECA would only be extended until the end of 2028, far too little time to reach, enroll, and support impacted communities.
Justice must come with real care. We shouldn’t have to trade one harm for another. We deserve compensation without compromise. RECA should be expanded for longer — without compromising Medicaid or rural health care.
We demand justice without sacrifice.

Vermont Green Football Club prevailed in the United Soccer League’s second-tier Eastern Conference finals at the University of Vermont’s Virtue Field on Friday evening, further extending the best season in club history.
The team defeated Virginia-based Lionsbridge Football Club 3-1 in overtime. Vermont Green will  play Alabama-based Dothan United in the league’s national semifinals on Sunday at 6:30 p.m., retaining the home advantage at Virtue Field.
Excitement has been building steadily this season around the Green’s success. Friday’s game sold out in under 30 seconds, the hosts said, and tickets for last Sunday’s 3-2 home playoff win over FC Motown were also gone within a few minutes.
The atmosphere at Vermont Green’s Burlington games has become an attraction in itself, with capacity crowds overflowing onto the unticketed hill overlooking the field. The team’s fan group, the Green Mountain Bhoys, drive high-energy crowds in chants, cheers and choreography. Long lines build at the stands of local vendors — Ben and Jerry’s, Shacksbury Cider, and others.
Since the club’s founding in 2022, the club has garnered national attention for its socially conscious, locally focused approach to soccer, especially in relation to environmental justice. 
The club has also become more successful on the pitch, recruiting top college players from around the world, including from the UVM team which won the NCAA national title in December.
The 2025 season has been the club’s highest-achieving by far, with a 16-match undefeated record, a first-place finish in the northeast division, and an ongoing deep run into the playoffs. In 2024, the Green placed third in its division and won two playoff matches, but were ultimately knocked out by the nationally top-ranked Seacoast United of New Hampshire.

(Photovs iStock/Getty Images)Starting next month, Louisiana residents will be allowed to have darker tint on the front side windows of their vehicles than has been allowed in decades. 

Louisiana lawmakers overwhelmingly voted to reduce the amount of light that tinted front side windows allow inside a vehicle from 40% to 25% through Act 143, sponsored by Rep. Daryl Deshotel, R-Marksville. 
The 25% light transmission level is already allowed on rear side windows, and 12% is allowed on back windows. No tint is not allowed on most of the front windshield. 

Deshotel said earlier this year he brought the bill because his daughter was taking medication that made her sensitive to sunlight, and he wanted to put a darker tint on her vehicle windows. 
Current state law allows for an exemption to tint restrictions for medical conditions, which require a written explanation and diagnosis from a medical doctor or optometrist. A vehicle owner must also get Louisiana State Police approval for the exception and place a special decal on their car. 

Restrictions on window tints have typically been put in place at the request of law enforcement groups, which worry that dark windows can make officers vulnerable when they approach drivers and passengers. 

Deshotel’s legislation only garnered tepid opposition from public safety organizations. 
Kevin Hayes, a lobbyist for the Louisiana Association of Chiefs of Police, submitted written opposition to the bill when it first came up for a hearing in the Louisiana House of Representatives. But he did not push back against the proposal when it moved to the Senate for its final votes. 

The Louisiana Sheriffs Association didn’t oppose the legislation. 

States surrounding Louisiana have similar tint restrictions on front side windows to the one taking effect next week. The allowed tint is 25% in Arkansas, 28% in Mississippi and 25% in Texas, according to Rayno Window Film, a tinting company.  
A person driving a vehicle that violates the state’s current or future window tinting restrictions can face a $150 fine for a first offense and a $350 fine for a third or subsequent offense.

Mike Dunleavy’s office.
A person familiar with Crum’s plans said he intends to run for governor in 2026, joining seven other Republican candidates. No independents or Democrats have filed for the primary election, which is 13 months away. 
Asked whether he will run for governor, Crum said by text message, “I’ve accomplished a lot to put Alaska on sound economic footing. I’ll have a formal statement on my last day, August 8th. Stay tuned.”
Crum has been part of Dunleavy’s cabinet since the governor took office in 2018. He initially served as commissioner of the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services, occupying that position during the COVID-19 pandemic and during an executive order that split the agency into two separate departments.
In 2022, Dunleavy named Crum as revenue commissioner, and he assumed a seat on the board of the Alaska Permanent Fund Corp., whose revenues are the No. 1 source of general-purpose dollars for state services and the Permanent Fund dividend.
Jason Brune, former commissioner of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, now fills a public seat on the Permanent Fund Corp. board.
Brune said he knows Crum has been considering a run for governor but could not confirm his plans.
“His departure is a big loss for the state,” Brune said by text. 
“It was an honor working with him for the five years we served together,” he said, referring to the time they spent on the Dunleavy cabinet.
In a written statement Dunleavy praised Crum’s performance during his time with the state.
“Commissioner Crum has been an exemplary leader whose unwavering dedication and innovative approach have significantly benefited Alaskans,” Dunleavy said. “During his time leading both the Department of Health and Social Services and the Department of Revenue, Adam consistently prioritized Alaska’s economic well-being, public health, and fiscal stability. His collaborative spirit and commitment to serving our communities have made a lasting, positive impact.”
The governor’s office said an acting commissioner will be named soon.

(NPS / Jacob W. Frank)Members of Montana’s congressional delegation have introduced bicameral legislation implementing a presidential order that will charge international visitors to America’s national parks an additional fee.
The state’s western congressional Rep. Ryan Zinke, a former Interior Secretary during President Donald Trump’s first term, along with junior U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy, introduced the Protecting America’s Treasures by Raising Inflow from Overseas Tourists in Parks Act (PATRIOT Parks Act), which could address maintenance backlogs at some of the country’s most popular sites.
“National Parks are Americas best idea and maintaining that legacy for future generations means making smart investments in the management of the parks,” Zinke said in a press release. “Americans already pay for parks in our tax dollars as well as at the gates. It’s unfair to American taxpayers to foot the bill for millions of foreign visitors. Almost every other country charges foreign visitors more, it’s common sense. President Trump and Secretary Burgum did the right thing directing the National Park Service implement a foreign visitor fee. This legislation will codify the policy and ensure Americans are put First in our own parks.”
The idea to raise additional funds from foreign tourists has long been championed by the Property and Environment Research Center, a Bozeman-based a “free market environmentalism” nonprofit think-tank. Sheehy once served on its board.
In preliminary Interior budget documents for the 2026 fiscal year released this spring, the federal government proposed a new fee on foreign visitors to address some of the shortfall in National Park Service budgets, but simultaneously showed an agency request of just $2.1 billion, roughly two-thirds of the NPS budget in 2025.
However, the latest version of the Interior appropriations bill, which passed through committee this week, showed a budget recommendation $3.1 billion — roughly holding current funding levels intact.
Last year was the busiest on record for the NPS, with more than 331 million visitors spending time at the 433 NPS units, including historic sites, battlefields and monuments, in addition to the 63 national parks.
The increased traffic at the nation’s crown jewels have added to a deferred maintenance backlog of nearly $23 billion to maintain roads, buildings, utility systems and other facilities across the park system.
According to researchers with PERC, because roughly 80% of entrance fees charged by some NPS sites are retained at the site they are collected, increasing gate revenue could help address specific maintenance backlogs at heavily trafficked sites.
In a study using NPS data showing baseline entry fee revenue of $349 million, PERC calculated a $16, $25 and $40 surcharge for foreign visitors, with an estimate that the surcharge would correspond with a roughly 3% decrease in visitation.
The smallest surcharge would generate an additional $211 million annually, while the highest would bring in $528 million — more than doubling the current revenue.
“The current system is relatively blunt — there are lots of margins you can refine in a logical way,” Watkins said. “That’s where I think you can see big changes happen.”
Early versions of the federal directive to increase fees on foreign visitors cited an additional $90 million in fees, but neither Trump’s executive order, the latest appropriations documents, nor the newly introduced legislation have specific dollar amounts set as revenue goals.
The PATRIOT Parks Act was co-introduced in the respective chambers with Rep. Riley Moore, R-West Virginia, and Sen. Jim Banks, R-Indiana.
“Our national parks drive Montana’s tourism economy by bringing in visitors from all over the world and define our way life by offering an experience you can only find in America,” Sheehy said in a statement. “Implementing a foreign visitor fee is an America First, commonsense way to secure affordable access for American families, improve our national parks for all visitors, and better manage our treasured public lands. It’s not too much for Americans to ask that their government puts them first, and that’s why I’m proud to support the PATRIOT Parks Act so more American families can enjoy our national parks for generations to come.”
Officials who have spoken about the proposed fee changes cite other parts of the world where foreign tourists are charged more than locals. The Galapagos Islands are commonly referenced, where foreign tourists pay $200, while Ecuadorian adults pay just $30.
“It is the policy of my Administration to preserve these opportunities for American families in future generations by increasing entry fees for foreign tourists, improving affordability for United States residents, and expanding opportunities to enjoy America’s splendid national treasures,” Trumps executive order stated.

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)A panel of Idaho legislators is looking to do one of the first major state government reorganizations since the 1970s, with the primary goal of reducing its size and improving efficiency. 
The Idaho Legislature’s DOGE Task Force — named for the federal Department of Government Efficiency that was previously led by billionaire Elon Musk before he left his role in May — met for the first time Friday afternoon at the Idaho State Capitol. The committee was inspired by Idaho’s House Bill 364, which passed the House in the 2025 legislative session but stalled in the Senate.

Committee co-chair Rep. Jeff Ehlers, R-Meridian, said the committee’s directive is to look into three primary focus areas: examine all departments and divisions for reduction, consolidation or elimination; eliminate unnecessary employee positions; and evaluate state travel. 
“There’s a lot to look at,” Ehlers said. “So we intend to do a lot in this interim, with the goal to really have some legislation and policy brought forth from this committee that we can implement in the next legislative session.” 
Ehlers also said the committee would take public input on existing inefficiencies and potential solutions in an online portal at legislature.idaho.gov/doge. 
Although the DOGE bill died during the Idaho legislative session, Idaho GOP legislative leaders announced the creation of the task force in April. Ehlers told the Idaho Capital Sun on Friday that legislative leaders have “broad authority” to create interim committees that meet outside of the approximately three-month legislative session.

  In 1970, Idaho constitutional amendment consolidated state government programs

Committee members on Friday heard staff overviews of existing state agencies and programs, and Transparent Idaho, a website that tracks state spending. 
Jared Tatro, who leads the Legislative Services Office Impact Review team, said that in 1970 the state passed a constitutional amendment to consolidate government programs into no more than 20 executive branch departments, excluding the offices of Idaho’s seven constitutional officers. 
This change was made by the Legislature and approved by the voters to make  it easier for people to access their government and to know where to go, Tatro said. 
Within each of the departments, there are many sub-units. For instance, within the Office of the Governor there are many other organizations, such as the Idaho Commission for the Blind or the Office of Drug Policy. 
Some state agencies, such as the State Board of Education, are set forth in the state Constitution, Tatro said. 
 In Arkansas, 2019 bill consolidated agencies. But savings weren’t tracked, official says

Lawmakers also heard from an Arkansas official, Amy Fecher, about her state’s more than two-year process to reorganize and consolidate its government. She helped lead the Arkansas Transformation Advisory Board, which worked with the Arkansas Legislature to pass a more than 2,000-page bill in 2019 that set up a framework for the reorganization to take the 42 cabinet-level agencies down to 15. 
“We asked the secretaries to evaluate their new departments and to make recommendations on things such as the fleet, the real estate, their staffing and other issues,” Fecher said.
She told lawmakers the cost savings from the changes weren’t able to be tracked. The state operates on a two-year budget, she said, so the officials operated within those previously set budgets. 
Several members of the public spoke in support of the task force’s mission. One speaker, Serge Brown, expressed skepticism at whether the group would “solve problems or simply recycle them.” 
Idaho Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, told Brown that lawmakers have limited time during the legislative session, and that the interim committee will allow them to “dig deeper.” 
“I would encourage you to be patient with us and let the system work,” Scott said, “and I truly believe you’re going to see some big things out of the committee.” 
Ehlers told the Sun he hopes the committee will meet monthly and have legislation ready to recommend for the 2026 Idaho legislative session.

Shelley Hughes has become the seventh Republican to announce a run for governor in next year’s election. Incumbent Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Republican, is term-limited and cannot seek reelection in 2026. 
With an announcement at Palmer’s Rebarchek Park on Thursday night, Hughes said that as governor, she would focus on energy costs and eliminating the state’s “brain drain” and its “brawn drain.”
“We need those people that can do the kinds of jobs, the resource-development kinds of jobs, that don’t take a master’s degree. And we also need the educated for certain positions, and we’re losing young people,” she said. 
Hughes, a conservative member of the Senate’s all-Republican minority caucus, was elected to the Senate in 2016 after two terms in the state House. She served as a majority leader for two years before the current bipartisan majority took control in 2023.
“I think the good Lord gave me the gift of being able to build consensus without forsaking my values and my principles,” she said during her announcement speech, “and so that is a skill set that is very, very important for a governor to have, because you’re not always going to be given the Legislature that you would maybe hand-pick yourself. You have to play the cards you’re dealt, right?”
Hughes joins an already-crowded field of Republicans seeking to succeed Dunleavy in office.
As of Friday, the six other Republican candidates included:

Lieutenant Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom
Former Fairbanks state Sen. Click Bishop
Longtime Republican campaigner and business owner Bernadette Wilson
Matanuska-Susitna Borough Mayor Edna DeVries
Anchorage podiatrist Matt Heilala
Angoon resident James Parkin

At least two other Republicans — revenue commissioner Adam Crum and attorney general Treg Taylor — may also enter the race. On Friday, Crum announced his resignation from state service, effective Aug. 8, and Taylor has been holding a series of public events similar to those conducted by prior prospective candidates.
Hughes’ decision to run for governor means there is no incumbent running in next year’s election for the Senate seat she occupies. No candidates have filed to run for that seat, which is in a district that has solidly voted Republican in recent years.
By text message after her announcement, Hughes said she doesn’t know if she will resign from her seat early, as current Gov. Mike Dunleavy did when he was a member of the Senate and ran for governor in 2018.
“That is a decision I will make later in the year, but it is a real possibility,” she said.
If Hughes were to resign, a replacement would be appointed by Dunleavy to fill the remainder of the term. That replacement would have to be confirmed by the Senate’s other 10 Republicans, said Scott Kendall, the Anchorage attorney who wrote the relevant law.
Five of those Republicans are members of the Senate’s bipartisan majority caucus; the other five are in the Senate’s all-Republican minority caucus. 
In a town hall meeting on July 3, Alaska Democratic Party chairman Eric Croft was asked when Democrats would begin filing for statewide elections, including the governor’s race, U.S. House and U.S. Senate. No Democrats have yet filed for any of those races.
“I think there’s a lot of those discussions going on,” he said. “There’s people interested. A lot of people (are) interested in what Mary Peltola does. I know people want it done right now, but it’s still a year and a half away, so I think (we need) a little bit of patience on that, but I understand the frustration.”
Sen. Scott Kawasaki, D-Fairbanks, said the national Senate Democratic Campaign Committee and its House counterpart “are trying to make sure that we’ve got a strong field of folks who want to run.”
Asked Friday whether anything has changed since that town hall meeting, Croft said by email that Alaskans deserve better than what they currently have in Congress and the governor’s office, and that he is confident that the party will have a strong candidate on the ballot next year.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Oklahoma’s House Speaker urged State Superintendent Ryan Walters on Friday to “turn over all relevant devices” and cooperate with an investigation after two board members reported that they saw naked women on his television screen.
The Oklahoman and NonDoc reported late Friday that board members Ryan Deatherage and Becky Carson said they saw the pictures on a television in Walters’ office during a State Board of Education executive session that was held the July 24.
“These are serious allegations made by two members of the State Board and an expeditious third-party review is warranted,” Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said in a statement. “I urge the State Superintendent to unlock and turn over all relevant devices and fully cooperate with an investigation.
“If no wrongdoing occurred, a prompt and transparent review should quickly clear his name.”
A spokesperson for Hilbert said he isn’t interested in determining who would investigate, but believes a probe is needed.
Walters and an agency spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Oklahoma Voice.
Earlier in the day, the agency told NonDoc that the accusations were “a junk tabloid lie,” and said that Walters was facing a “hostile board who will say and do anything except tell the truth.”
Carson could not be reached for comment Friday afternoon. 
Deatherage declined a request for an interview, but said in a text message that it is his top priority to protect students.
“We hold educators to the strictest of standards when it comes to explicit material,” Deatherage said. “The standard for the superintendent should be no different.”
The two board members were recently confirmed by the Senate. Deatherage was appointed by Gov. Kevin Stitt during a board restructuring that replaced three board members following what Stitt called “needless political drama.” Carson was appointed to fill a vacant position.
The board has questioned Walters’ actions and his authority in recent months. On Thursday, board members questioned Walters over his authority to require districts to provide free school lunches to all students, a controversial test he wants to require California and New York teachers to take before they can become certified to teach in Oklahoma, and a new partnership with a private, online Arizona-based school. The board wanted to know why they weren’t consulted.
Carson also publicly questioned Walters about why he didn’t provide them with a copy of a resignation letter that was addressed to both the board and Walters. 
Walters has been a vocal critic of pornography and sought to ban some books that he said contained it from school library shelves.

Almost half of the 63 million Americans who care for a family member say they struggle financially to do so. (Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)More than 63 million Americans are caregivers for a family member with complex medical needs, a 20 million increase over the past decade, according to a new report.
But state policies, workplaces and the American health system haven’t kept up with this surge in family caregiving responsibilities, said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, a physician and the CEO of the AARP, which released the report with the National Alliance for Caregiving, a nonprofit policy and research organization.
“Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences, draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing,” Minter-Jordan told reporters on a call this week.
One of the biggest reasons for the surge in family caregivers is that Americans are living longer, yet they’re not necessarily healthier. There’s a 12-year gap between the average number of years that Americans live and the number of years they’re healthy.
‘A purpose in this world’: Older adults fear elimination of program that helps them find work

The caregiving role typically involves helping a family member with daily tasks like bathing, dressing and eating. But more than half of caregivers also perform more complex medical tasks, such as managing catheters or administering injections, the report found.
A growing number of caregivers are so-called “sandwich caregivers” — parents caring for their children as well as for an adult family member, such as an aging parent. About 17 million people are sandwich caregivers, compared with 11 million a decade ago. And most caregivers are also working a job.
And while the bulk of caregiving still falls on women, 40% of American caregivers are men.
Some states have heeded the growing calls for action.
Earlier this year, Maine lawmakers created a state program to provide respite care, which includes services such as adult day care that give family caregivers a temporary break.
Also this year, Tennessee extended its pilot program that provides respite care for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, and also passed a bipartisan bill that directs the state Medicaid program to develop guidelines to allow family caregivers to be paid for their work.
Last year, Nebraska passed a tax credit for family caregivers; Oklahoma passed a similar law the year before. And while the United States is one of few countries that doesn’t mandate paid family leave at the federal level, 13 states and the District of Columbia have established their own paid family leave rules.
Meanwhile, the historic cuts to Medicaid enacted as part of the GOP’s Big, Beautiful Bill Act will shift health costs to states, leaving experts worried that family caregivers could lose Medicaid-funded services they rely on.

As Texas moves forward with an off-cycle redistricting to shore up Republicans’ narrow House majority, Gov. Gavin Newsom is plotting a Democratic response in California. But the state’s independent redistricting commission is a major obstacle.


What seemed a few weeks ago like a far-fetched political fantasy ahead of the 2026 midterms has quickly evolved into a high-stakes showdown enveloping states across the country.
As Texas this week began an off-cycle redistricting process meant to shore up Republicans’ slim House majority, Gov. Gavin Newsom appeared Friday with a group of Democratic legislators from that state, reaffirming his intention for California to respond with new maps of its own that would benefit Democrats.
Following a meeting with the Texas lawmakers at the historic governor’s mansion in downtown Sacramento, Newsom told reporters that “everything is at stake if we’re not successful next year in taking back the House of Representatives” — not only blunting President Donald Trump’s agenda, but protecting American democracy.
“If we don’t put a stake into the heart of this administration, there may not be an election in 2028,” he said. “They’re not screwing around. We can’t afford to screw around either. We have got to fight fire with fire.”
There’s one major obstacle to the governor’s ambitions, however: While the Legislature draws district lines in Texas, California relies on a bipartisan citizen redistricting commission protected by the state Constitution.
In 2008, voters narrowly approved an amendment removing California legislators’ power to draw their own seats. Two years later, voters overwhelmingly passed another amendment expanding the commission’s authority to congressional maps.
The independent commission in California became a national model for advocates who hoped to end the partisan gerrymandering that has contributed to a decline in competitive House seats and the country’s fractious, sectarian politics.
Now Newsom, who said he otherwise supports independent redistricting, is exploring multiple options for working around the commission to squeeze more Democratic districts out of California, if Texas follows through on its plan.
That would probably involve calling a special election, Newsom said, though he is still discussing with the Legislature what sort of proposal they might present to voters. Would it include a new map to approve or create another process to draw on? Would the commission be temporarily or permanently repealed?
“This is a fluid conversation,” he said. “We’re gaming all those things out.”
Trump turns up the heat in Texas
States typically redraw their congressional seats once per decade, after the census, to ensure the districts are all roughly equal in population. The most recent maps were drawn after the 2020 election and took effect in 2022.
But last month, Trump’s political team began pressuring Republican leaders in Texas to revisit the state’s district lines and create additional GOP seats. The party won a five-seat majority in the House last November, the narrowest in nearly a century, leaving little room for error as Trump tries to enact his legislative agenda and putting control of the chamber at risk if next year’s midterm is a wave election against the unpopular president.
Despite opposition from Republicans in the Texas congressional delegation — who worried that diluting their conservative voter bases in redistricting could inadvertently make their seats vulnerable — Gov. Greg Abbott earlier this month called a special session of the Legislature to redraw the maps. He is targeting four Democratic seats in the Dallas and Houston areas that the Trump administration has deemed “unconstitutional racial gerrymanders” because they have high numbers of Black and Latino voters. The first public hearing took place on Thursday, with Texas Democratic lawmakers slamming the move as a “power grab.”
The boldly political maneuver juiced similar efforts in other Republican states, including Ohio and Missouri, that could further pad a GOP majority, while setting off alarm bells among Democrats nationally.
But even as party leaders voice their outrage, they have fewer options to fight back, because congressional districts in many of the largest Democratic states, such as California, New York and New Jersey, are drawn by independent commissions.
No one has been more outspoken than Newsom, who weeks ago began publicly floating the idea of sidestepping California’s commission to redraw more congressional districts in Democrats’ favor if Texas moves forward with its plan.
But it’s no sure thing in California
It’s a legally dubious and politically fraught endeavor. Even some of Newsom’s fellow Democrats have expressed skepticism because of the precedent it would set, including Assemblymember Alex Lee of Milpitas, whose vote may be needed to place a measure on the ballot. Common Cause California, a nonprofit that advocates for government in the public interest and backed the formation of the independent commission, blasted it as a “dangerous move” that would “put our state’s democracy on the line during a time of national instability.”
Meanwhile, Republican gubernatorial candidate Steve Hilton is already threatening to sue to stop a new map and has added to his platform a plan to require the redistricting commission to include more GOP seats.
Because of the legal risks in having the Legislature simply draw new congressional districts, the most likely route is a special election asking voters to overturn the independent commission, said Paul Mitchell, a Democratic redistricting consultant.
The problem is that the commission remains highly popular with voters in polling, Mitchell said. To get around that, Newsom may need to make concessions, like a temporary pause that resumes the independent redistricting process in 2031, after the next census.
“It’s ‘in emergency, break glass,’ not ‘let’s burn down the whole building,’” Mitchell said.
Even then, he said, Democrats would need to maintain the drumbeat of frustration over how the party is being harmed in Texas for months to turn out a motivated electorate in an unusual special election.
“It’s like lightning in a bottle right now,” Mitchell said. “Are they going to be able to keep this a front-burner issue for people?”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/072525-Gavin-Newsom-Presser-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-25 19:57:06.506565

Photo by Emily Fitzgerald. If state funding for forest health and wildfire prevention isn’t ramped back up in the next legislative session, it could hinder efforts to prevent severe fires in the coming years, Washington’s top public lands official and others warned this week.
The state Legislature approved House Bill 1168 in 2021, which committed $500 million over eight years to the state Department of Natural Resources for wildfire preparedness and response. 
State spending had largely kept up with that target until this year, with the department receiving $115 million in the last two-year budget and $130 million in the one before that.  
Then this year, as lawmakers confronted a budget shortfall, they slashed the wildfire preparedness funding to just $60 million for the next two years. 
The Department of Natural Resources says it’s prepared for this fire season and has money left over from past years. But the funding rollback has sparked concerns. 
Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove raised the alarm this week during a press conference near the Burdoin Fire in the Columbia River Gorge. 
As of Friday, that fire had burned 11,269 acres on both sides of Highway 14 east of White Salmon and was just 13% contained. The blaze had also led to the closure of Highway 14 and other roads, and evacuation orders for hundreds of residents.
“If next year’s supplemental budget does not restore some of that funding, we’re going to see more fires like this, they’re going to be larger, and they’re going to cost the taxpayers a lot more money in the back end,” Upthegrove said during a press conference with Gov. Bob Ferguson.
Ferguson stopped short of calling for the funding to be boosted, but thanked the Legislature for the funds it did provide. 
“This is a reminder of the need for those resources … they’re truly making a big difference right now as we understand it from the experts here on the ground,” Ferguson said. 
The Department of Natural Resources has worked since receiving the dedicated wildfire preparedness funding in 2021 to thin out flammable vegetation in forests around the state.
But there’s plenty more to be done, both for fire mitigation and fire recovery, and the reduced funding is “not going to allow us to do as much work as we normally do,” said Collin Haffey, post-fire recovery program manager for the department. 
Haffey spoke during a tour of the Rimrock Retreat Fire area in the Yakima Valley this week. The fire burned roughly 46,600 acres over a month last year, between Rimrock Lake and Tieton in the Yakima Valley, after starting at a cabin.
The visit highlighted the department’s post-fire recovery efforts, as well as the pre-fire actions that officials say helped to significantly reduce the harm the fire caused the local ecosystem and surrounding community. 
While the fire burned severely in some areas, the damage wasn’t as bad in the Oak Creek drainage due to forest management actions the Department of Natural Resources took before the fire, officials said. 
Using House Bill 1168 funding, the Department of Natural Resources thinned trees and conducted prescribed burns in that area.
The goal with this kind of work is to restore a historically natural mix of clearings and densely forested areas, creating what forest scientists call a mosaic pattern. This can reduce the risk of high-intensity fires while also better supporting biodiversity than forests that get too dense. 
And when wildfires do burn on land that’s been treated in this way, it can be beneficial rather than catastrophic.
“This fire in the Oak Creek drainage, in terms of the impacts on forests and on wildlife overall, was good,” said Derek Churchill, a scientist with the Department of Natural Resources. 
“Now this watershed is in pretty good condition, at least for another 10 or 15 years, where we have really low fuel loads and lower fire risk,” he said. 
In contrast, areas in the footprint of the Rimrock Retreat Fire that weren’t pretreated suffered from high-severity burns that damaged the soil and decimated the vegetation.

Burns like this in that part of the state can end up converting forest habitat to a shrub steppe — at least for years to come, Churchill said. The scorched land can also invite invasive species and is at higher risk of landslides.
“If you lose your big trees in a fire like this, we’ve lost them for, I won’t say forever, but for a long time,” Churchill said. “These soils will come back eventually, but it definitely takes a lot longer when you cook the soil like this.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9214-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-25 19:57:06.506565

After withholding roughly $900 million from California’s K-12 and adult schools, the U.S. Education Department said today that it will release the money starting next week. But schools must agree to certain conditions first.


After withholding billions of dollars in school funding for nearly a month, the U.S. Education Department said today it would release the money, starting next week. 
But some school officials are still waiting until they have cash in hand before celebrating. 
“The only way to know is next week, which is when these funds are supposed to arrive, but I am worried about what sort of hoops they want us to go through to be compliant,” said Kindra Britt, a spokesperson for California County Superintendents, an organization that includes all of the state’s 58 county superintendents. 
Normally, California’s department of education begins working with the federal government in the spring so that K-12 and adult schools can start spending federal money on July 1 — but this year is different. On June 30, the state education department learned that the Trump administration planned to withhold more than $800 million intended to support a slew of essential services in California, such as after-school programs and professional development for teachers. The administration also said it would withhold roughly $100 million for adult education, including money for English-language learning and high school equivalency courses. 
Several California counties laid off workers soon after the announcement, said Britt. California Attorney General Rob Bonta sued U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon, arguing that the department is required to disburse the funds because Congress already appropriated them. 
Last week the Trump administration partly relented by allowing the money for after-school programs to flow, but on a condition that schools use the money in accordance with the U.S. Constitution and other federal non-discrimination laws. The administration has used similar language as a pretext to propose cutting or delaying funding for diversity initiatives. 
Today the administration said it would release the rest of the funds starting Monday, but the same conditions apply. In an email to adult education administrators, the U.S. Education Department said it was prepared to claw back any dollars used for “unallowable activities.” Based on the administration’s previous actions, those activities could include promoting diversity or allowing transgender girls to compete in girls’ sports.
“Nearly two weeks after California joined with 23 other states to sue the Trump administration and nearly a month after grants were due to states, the administration has finally announced a plan to release education funds that they are illegally withholding,” said Michelle Hatfield, a public information officer with the California Department of Education. “In the meantime, school is already in session in parts of California and the Trump administration’s actions continue to negatively impact California students.” 
Nonetheless, Hatfield said she’s hopeful that the Trump administration “follows through” and sends the money to California quickly. 
Bonta’s original lawsuit against the U.S. Education Department is still “ongoing,” said Elissa Perez, a spokesperson for the state’s justice department. “This is one of the latest examples of the Trump Administration sowing chaos to services and sectors that are critically important to Americans nationwide.”
Despite the potential for future litigation, many school officials say the release of federal funds is a victory and a testament to their advocacy. State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond spoke out repeatedly about the funding delays, and lawmakers, including Congressional Republicans, agreed.
“We’re moving in the right direction,” said Troy Flint, chief communications officer with the California School Boards Association. “The funds never should have been held in the first place.” Sharon Bonney, the CEO of Coalition on Adult Basic Education, said she was “elated” when the education department notified her. But she acknowledged that the month of delayed funding still had a serious impact. “There have been a number of programs that shuttered their doors or already started delivering a fraction of services.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/111523-Keyes-School-District-LV_CM-19.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-25 19:57:06.506565

Jared Polis discusses K-12 school funding with U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon at the National Governors Association meeting in Colorado Springs on July 25, 2025. (Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)Gov. Jared Polis and Education Secretary Linda McMahon talked K-12 school funding and strategies for getting students workforce-ready during a panel with governors from across the country on Friday in Colorado Springs. 
The panel was organized by the National Governors Association, which Polis currently chairs. The association convenes governors and their staff members, and serves as “a leading forum for bipartisan policy solutions.” 
The panel discussion started shortly after the Trump administration said it plans to release about $5 billion in federal K-12 school funds that have been frozen for weeks. The initial move to withhold the funding, which is designated for teacher training, migrant education, English-language learning and other programs, left Colorado school districts scrambling. About $80 million of the paused funds are earmarked for Colorado, and on July 14, state Attorney General Phil Weiser joined a lawsuit calling for their release.

“Many of us were very worried about several funds that our schools had expected,” Polis said. “We’re very pleased that you were able to announce earlier today that those funds have become unfrozen.”
Polis asked McMahon about “how can we prevent these kinds of communications gaps or discrepancies in the first place?” 
McMahon attributed the pause to “the transition aspect” and “taking time to really review the funding, to look at all the programs, before they were released.” She added, “that was satisfied.”
As chair of the association, Polis led the yearlong “Let’s Get Ready” initiative, focusing on ways that state governments can improve educational outcomes through better data collection and school accountability. The initiative recommends that states measure and publish information about academic indicators like students’ reading and math levels, but also workforce preparedness, civic engagement and mental health.
“We need to be making sure that we are truly making progress for students,” Polis said. “We are measuring the metric of improving graduation rates, and we want to make sure that one way that states can do that is not simply to dumb down the standards and make it easier to graduate. If we are looking at improving math scores, we want to make sure the answer is not just making things easier.”
McMahon called for an increased focus on postsecondary pathways beyond four-year university degrees, including apprenticeships and trade school.
“It comes down to the curriculum, which is on the state and local level, and what courses are being taught,” McMahon said. “I’ve heard a couple of governors say today, ‘wouldn’t it be cool to get back to shop?’ We want to get back to some of those subjects that can be taught in school that have been eliminated, that go into the development of our workforce.”
McMahon emphasized “returning education to the states” to regulate. President Donald Trump has ordered for the closure of the Department of Education, and the department has undergone mass layoffs.
The National Governors Association meeting is scheduled to continue on Saturday, when Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is set to speak.

Missouri House Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins of Bowling Green said he received a call Friday afternoon from the White House after staff read his comments published Thursday in The Independent.
“We do redistricting every 10 years,” Perkins said Thursday. “We’ve already done that. To do it again would be out of character with the way Missouri operates.”
‘We’ve already done that’: Missouri lawmakers show little enthusiasm for new congressional maps

During the call Friday, he said, after verifying he was quoted accurately, he was told it was important to President Donald Trump. 
“They said ‘well, we’re really going to try to do that’ and that might change the dynamic of it,” Perkins said.
The presumed target for the change is Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City, who has held the 5th District seat since 2005 and was re-elected in November with 60% of the vote.
Cleaver’s office did not respond to an email seeking comment on the White House effort to defeat him by altering his district.
Missouri’s other Democrat, U.S. Rep. Wesley Bell of St. Louis, represents the 1st District.
To achieve a delegation with seven Republicans, Kansas City would need to be sliced into multiple districts instead of being encompassed by one. Neighborhoods heavy with Democratic votes would be added adjoining districts — the 5th shares a border with the 6th District, held by Republican U.S. Rep. Sam Graves of Tarkio, and the 4th District, held by Republican U.S. Rep. Mark Alford of Raymore — or combined with enough Republican votes to make the 5th District a safe GOP seat.
The White House political staff who made the call, Perkins said, told him they would be calling every GOP member of the Missouri House delegation as well as Gov. Mike Kehoe to push the project forward.
Kehoe’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
 Missouri Congressional districts (Missouri Secretary of State’s Office.)
The reason the White House staff gave for the pressure is that Democrats are looking at redistricting California and Illinois to their advantage, Perkins said.
“That might be true, but I don’t like gerrymandering lines,” Perkins said. “I like things to be clear, concise and compact.”
The internal question for Republicans in the 2022 redistricting debate was whether they could reach for a 7-1 map without putting seats at risk by diluting their voting strength. That intraparty fight mixed with personality clashes in a dysfunctional state Senate that put passing any redistricting plan into question up until the final votes.
“To me, the arguments that were good arguments against it two years ago probably are still the same good arguments,” Perkins said Friday. “ But if someone comes up with a plan, we’ll take a look at it.”
The Missouri Freedom Caucus, the faction that clashed repeatedly with Senate GOP leadership, on Friday called for Kehoe to “immediately” call a special session for redistricting and changes to the initiative petition process.
“It’s time this super-majority Republican Party in Missouri grows a spine and actually delivers the Congressional map that reflects the strong conservative values of this great state,” the caucus posted on social media.
Other Republican lawmakers on Thursday told The Independent they weren’t excited about another round of redistricting, including Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin of Shelbina and state Sen. Mike Cierpiot of Lee’s Summit.
O’Laughlin did not respond to messages asking if she, too, had heard from the White House. Cierpiot said he had not.
If Republicans want to move forward, Kehoe could call a special session that would complete maps before the new election year begins. Otherwise, the work would take place in the regular session that begins in January and ends in May.
Democrats could filibuster any bill changing the districts and the only way to get it to a vote in the state Senate would be to use the rule to shut down debate, known as the previous question. It was used twice at the end of this year’s session, and Democrats have already vowed that Republicans will pay a price for that breach of bipartisanship.
Using it in a special session to gain a political edge for the GOP would make retribution worse, Perkins said.
“Then how does that break down how everything will run come January, because it will have consequences,” Perkins said.
The biggest impetus to move on redistricting, he said, would be a desire to please the president.
“If you’re a Republican state senator, a Republican state representative,” Perkins said, “you don’t want to be on the wrong side of this president.”

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — South Dakotans should know what stays and what goes at South Dakota Public Broadcasting — absent a philanthropic or state budget lifeline — within the next two weeks.
Whatever happens, SDPB’s director says, the public will have two months’ notice before programs and voices disappear. 
The recent congressional clawback of federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting cost SDPB about $2.2 million, which is about 20% of its budget.
SDPB is a state entity, and its staff members are state employees. The organization also receives support from the nonprofit Friends of SDPB.
Julie Overgaard, SDPB’s executive director, told budget committee lawmakers this week she’s looking at layoffs for up to 20 staff members and local content cuts across its radio and television operations as a result.
SD Public Broadcasting considering cuts, layoffs after Congress rescinds federal funding

The state’s Educational Telecommunications Board reviewed a proposed downsizing plan in a closed door session in Sioux Falls on Friday afternoon. The board’s charge is to ensure SDPB operates within the legal corners of its broadcast licenses.
After the executive session, Overgaard told South Dakota Searchlight “we’re going to do everything we can to save our statewide coverage and all of our broadcast licenses.”
“Nobody should see their SDPB radio or TV signal go away because of this,” she said.
The downsizing plan will have an audience with the board for the Friends of SDPB on Monday. 
After that, Overgaard will show the plan to the commissioner of the Bureau of Information Technology — the government office under which SDPB is nested — and Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen before offering it to Gov. Larry Rhoden for final approval. The governor needs to approve layoffs for state agencies, Overgaard said.
If Rhoden signs off, staff and the public — in that order — will be notified of “the people and programs we’re going to lose, if there is no fix applied.”
“It’s not the state’s job to fill that entire fiscal hole,” Overgaard said, but she hopes the governor will at least consider funding to help SDPB continue livestreaming state government proceedings. The state owns the equipment used to livestream legislative and other government meetings, while the money to operate it comes from the SDPB budget. 
Friends of SDPB intends to dip into its endowment to make sure none of the content changes come until Oct. 31, and Overgaard said the intervening months will determine how many of the plan’s listed layoffs and program cuts ultimately come to pass.
Trump signs law yanking $9B from NPR, PBS, foreign aid

“To the extent that we’re able to fundraise, find foundation support and find business support, those things will come off the list,” Overgaard said. “People will be reinstated, programs will be reinstated.”
Kay Jorgensen, president of the Educational Telecommunications Board, urged SDPB’s supporters to “do what they did during the legislative session,” by throwing their support behind the system. 
Former Gov. Kristi Noem had proposed an evisceration of SDPB’s state-level funding before her departure to join President Donald Trump’s cabinet as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. State lawmakers rejected those efforts.
Before the closed-door session, the board heard a report on the system’s financial health through June, the month before Congress opted to ax public media money. SDPB was in the black and living well within its means, Jorgensen said.
In the face of the new reality created by congressional recission, Jorgensen added, “our goal is to stay lit, and to serve the public as we always have.”
“We would ask the public to articulate their views on why public broadcasting is so important, to share it with their friends and neighbors, and certainly with the policymakers on the local, state and national levels,” Jorgensen said.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A judge has dismissed a lawsuit from environmentalists that argued Utah’s now-failed petition to the U.S. Supreme Court to gain control of millions of acres of federal land was unconstitutional, which would have prevented the state from bringing a similar case forward in the future.  
On Wednesday, 3rd District Court Judge Thaddeus May dismissed the lawsuit from the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, siding with the state in a case that stems from Utah’s 2024 petition to wrest control of 18.5 million acres of Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, land. 
But since the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Utah’s case, May said the environmental group’s argument is now moot. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“The non-existence of that suit is fatal,” May wrote, while also finding the group’s “statements about any future action to be too vague to be redressable.”
The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, or SUWA, disagreed with the ruling — since Utah leaders, including Gov. Spencer Cox, have suggested they will try to re-file the lawsuit in a lower court, they still have a case, the group said. 
Utah filed its lawsuit with the country’s high court in August of last year, arguing that it’s unconstitutional for the BLM to hold “unappropriated land” — land that lacks a formal designation — in perpetuity. Unappropriated land does not include national parks, monuments, or forests. It’s often used for cattle grazing or wildlife habitat, with much of it found in Utah’s west desert. 
SUWA filed a lawsuit in December arguing the petition violated the Utah Constitution. Utah, the constitution reads, must “forever disclaim all right and title to the unappropriated public lands.” 
But not long after SUWA filed its lawsuit, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Utah’s case, which the state was attempting to bring directly before the high court. State leaders, including Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, said they might try filing a similar lawsuit in a lower court. 
SUWA then filed an amended complaint, based on Cox and other leaders’ comments, in an effort to prevent the state from trying to revive its lawsuit. 
Could Utah re-file its public lands lawsuit? The state — and a judge — are deliberating

In a hearing last week, May heard arguments for and against keeping the lawsuit going. During the hearing, May seemed to suggest it would be easier for SUWA to sue Utah once they actually re-filed their complaint. 
“If the suit is unknown, why is it not better to wait for that suit to be filed in federal court and then have a reaction? Why does this court have to preempt that decision or that lawsuit?” May asked. 
In a statement, SUWA’s legal director Steve Bloch said he disagreed with the ruling, and was considering “potential next steps.” 
“We’re disappointed with today’s decision but grateful that the true intent of the state’s lawsuit has been made clear: to force the sale of millions of acres of public lands to the highest bidder and not to acquire these lands for the state, as its deliberately misleading media campaign suggests,” Bloch said. “It’s our position that with the repeated statements made by Governor Cox — doubling down on the state’s intent to refile its lawsuit in federal district court — Judge May had what he needed to proceed with our case and conclude that Utah’s constitution prohibits the state from bringing a lawsuit like this in the first place.”

Gov. Sara Rodriguez announced her campaign Friday and Attorney General Josh Kaul declined to comment on his plans.  (Photos by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner) Less than 24 hours after Gov. Tony Evers announced he wouldn’t run for another term in office, the field for the Democratic primary for governor is beginning to take shape as Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez launched  her campaign Friday morning while other potential candidates are still considering. 
Evers’ video announcing that he would retire because of his family ended months of speculation about a potential third term and triggered the start of the first open race for governor in Wisconsin since 2010. 
The Republican field is still shaping up, with Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann and Whitefish Bay manufacturer Bill Berrien have officially announced. Other potential candidates include U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany and businessmen Eric Hovde and Tim Michels, both of whom have recently lost statewide campaigns. 
The first Democrat in the race, Rodriguez in her campaign launch video took aim both at Republicans in Washington and at the GOP majority in the Legislature. 
“We’ve got a maniac in the White House. His tariffs are killing our farmers and his policies are hurting our kids,” Rodriguez said of President Donald Trump. “Our [state] Legislature refuses to expand Medicaid, even though 41 other states have done it. I mean Arkansas expanded Medicaid. Arkansas, but not Wisconsin. I’ll get it done.” 
Rodriguez was elected lieutenant governor in 2022, when Evers won his second term. She succeeded former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who ran an unsuccessful campaign for the U.S. Senate against Republican Sen. Ron Johnson that year. 
“I’ve been an ER nurse, a public health expert and a small business owner. I’m used to being on my feet and getting right to the point,” Rodriguez said in her video. “I have an announcement: I’m running for governor.” 
“I know what you’re thinking, you don’t have the time for the rest of this video,” Rodriguez said. “Look, I get it I’m a busy parent too, so here’s what you should know: I’ve got two kids that are way too embarrassed to be in this video, a dog named Chico and I met my husband salsa dancing – all true. My parents were Wisconsin dairy farmers. My dad served during Vietnam and fixed telephones at Wisconsin Bell. Mom was a union member who helped kids with special needs.”
Rodriguez got degrees in neuroscience and nursing before working as a nurse in an emergency room in Baltimore. She has also worked for the Centers for Disease Control and has served as vice president for several health care-related businesses, including at Advocate Aurora Health from 2017-2020.
Rodriguez said in the video that entering politics wasn’t part of her plan, but seeing “a broken system” she decided to run for the Assembly. She flipped a Republican seat that covered parts of Milwaukee and Waukesha in 2020 by 735 votes, and served for one term before making her run for lieutenant governor in 2021. After winning the Democratic primary, she joined Evers on the ticket. 
The Democratic Lieutenant Governors Association quickly endorsed Rodriguez Friday.
Rodriguez noted that control of the state Legislature is also at stake in 2026, with Democrats having the chance under new, fairer maps adopted in 2024 to win control. The last time there was a Democratic trifecta in Wisconsin was in the 2009-2010 session. 
“Look, we’ve got a real shot at flipping the state Legislature, and with a Democratic governor we can finally expand Medicaid and boost our health care workforce. We can strengthen our farms and unions and small businesses, fund our public schools and give teachers the raise they’ve earned. That’s the right path, and it’s what you and your family deserve,” Rodriguez said. “I can’t wait to earn your vote.”
Other Democrats on whether they’ll run
Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said in a statement Friday morning that he cares about the future direction of Wisconsin and that “I will be taking steps toward entering the race for Governor,” in the coming weeks. 
“The stakes are simply too high to sit on the sidelines,” Crowley said. “Governor Evers has laid a strong foundation. I believe it’s our responsibility to build on that progress — and I look forward to engaging in that conversation with the people of Wisconsin.” 
Crowley, 33, was elected to the county’s top office in 2020, the first African American and the youngest person to serve in the position. During his time in the job, Crowley has been a staunch  advocate for the state’s largest county, including helping secure a sales tax increase for Milwaukee. He also previously served for two terms in the state Assembly.
Asked whether she plans to run, state Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) told the Wisconsin Examiner Friday she is “giving it really serious consideration.” Roys came in third in the 2018 primary that nominated Evers.
“This is going to be a wide open primary,” Roys said. “I don’t think anybody has a strong advantage in it, and I think the stakes are incredibly high.” 
Roys said she thought Evers has “given more than anyone could ask to this state” and has earned the right to do whatever he wants. She said, however, that Democrats shouldn’t rely on old tactics in 2026 and that people want a candidate who will inspire them.
“Tony Evers has been a beloved governor of this state, and so I think he would have certainly been able to win a third term if that’s what he wanted to do,” Roys said. “At the same time, I think that there is a real hunger in the party and in the country generally, to see the next generation of leaders getting a chance, and we have a very strong bench in Wisconsin.”
Roys also ran for the U.S. House in 2012, losing in the primary for the 2nd District to U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan. 
Roys said that there is a lot at stake in the 2026 race. The country is at an “incredibly dangerous moment” with the Republican control in Washington, D.C., she said, and Wisconsin Democrats could have a “incredible opportunity” to deliver on an array of issues at the state level, including funding public education, supporting Wisconsin’s public universities and technical colleges, expanding access to health care, addressing the high cost of housing and child care, and protecting peoples’ rights and freedoms. 
For the last five years, Roys has served in the state Senate, including as a member of the Joint Finance Committee, and has been a strong advocate for funding child care and reproductive rights. 
Recalling her time in the Assembly from 2009-2013, including the last session when Democrats held a trifecta, Roys said Democrats didn’t accomplish enough.
“I’m determined to make sure that we do not blow this opportunity,” Roys said. “I think we need strong leadership from our next Democratic governor to make sure that we deliver for people in this state.” 
Roys said she is considering many factors in deciding whether to join the race, including whether she would be the right person for the position, her recent experience and her family, including their security.
Whether she runs or not, Roys said she will work across the state to help Democrats flip both houses. She isn’t up for reelection this year and Democrats have set a goal of winning control of the Senate and Assembly for the first time in over 15 years. 
“My hope is that all the candidates who are considering a run for governor are prioritizing flipping the Legislature,” Roys said. During Evers’ two terms with a Republican majority in both houses, “He wrote great budgets. They threw them in the garbage,” she said. “He wanted to pass a lot of great legislation that Democrats offered in the Legislature, and he could hardly sign many into law, because he was busy with that veto pen.” 
Attorney General Josh Kaul, who would likely be a top candidate if he runs, declined to tell reporters about his plans Friday, saying that it is important to reflect on Evers’ service and “the significance of where we’ve come in the last six and a half years.” 
“I don’t have any announcement today,” Kaul said. “I think in the next several weeks, you’ll hear from a number of people as to where they stand.” 
Kaul was first elected to the statewide position in 2018 and won a second term in 2022 in a close race against Eric Toney, a Republican prosecutor from Fond du Lac County. Since Trump took office for his second term, Kaul has joined several multistate lawsuits to push back on some of the federal government’s actions, including the withholding of funding
Other potential candidates include Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson and former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Lawmakers deliberated behind closed doors for more than an hour-and-a-half Friday afternoon about whether a high-ranking New Mexico senator will face discipline over alleged harassment of a legislative staffer.
Four state senators on the interim Legislative Ethics Committee and a retired New Mexico Supreme Court justice concluded their discussion before 5 p.m., but as of publication had not issued the written order containing its recommendations, according to  Chris Nordstrom, a spokesperson for Senate Democrats. Source will update this story when it does.
Friday’s hearing centered on whether an email exchange and phone call in February between Senate President Pro Tempore Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque) and legislative staffer Michelle Jaschke, violated the Legislature’s anti-harassment policy.
Jaschke did not respond to messages seeking comment Friday afternoon on the committee’s recommendation.
Employment and labor lawyer Lorna Wiggins, who served as special counsel in the matter for the Ethics Committee’s investigative subcommittee, on May 18 issued her report after interviewing Jaschke and Stewart. Source NM requested a copy of the report from the Legislative Council Service but did not receive a copy prior to publication.
On Friday, Wiggins summarized her findings to the committee.
Jaschke, the capital outlay programs coordinator for the Legislative Council Service, emailed Stewart on Feb. 27 some time after 5 p.m. to ask about her capital outlay funding request — to help finance projects in lawmakers’ districts which had been due at 5 p.m. the day before.
In response, Stewart wrote: “WE SENT IT TO YOU YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AROUND 3:30…” according to a copy of the email Stewart’s attorney Ray Vargas presented to the committee.
Moments later, Stewart called Jaschke, “screaming at her using what she deemed pejorative language, including calling her stupid for not knowing that the sheet had already been turned in,” Wiggins said.
Jaschke told Wiggins that Stewart’s “verbal attack” affected her mental and physical well-being, including her ability to sleep, and that she took at least one sick day because “she was angry and upset at the interaction.”
Wiggins said Stewart acknowledged yelling at Jaschke, admitted using an angry tone during their phone call and admitted she may have used the word “stupid” during the call. Stewart also conceded that using all-capital letters is the equivalent of yelling at someone, Wiggins said.
Wiggins argued Stewart’s actions rose to the level of harassment because a reasonable person in Jaschke’s position would view the email and call as “hurtful, demeaning and caused her discomfort,” and could conclude it was “humiliating, intimidating and insulting.”
In his defense of her, Vargas said Stewart regretted her actions and later apologized. Moreover, he argued, the policy’s harassment definition requires “threatening, intimidating or coercive” verbal or physical behavior.
Stewart, he said, in a “high-stress moment, lost her cool and she was impolite to Ms. Jaschke. No, she wasn’t just impolite, she was downright rude,” Vargas said. “What she wasn’t though, was harassing, certainly not under the way harassment is defined under this policy.”
Vargas read a statement from Stewart reiterating her regrets about the incidents:
“I believe it’s important that we legislators treat everyone with kindness and respect, especially our staff,” the statement said. “During the legislative session, when all of us are rushed, under pressure and tempers can flare, it’s even more important to exhibit calmness and kindness. I regret that I failed to do that with Michelle. When I was informed of her reaction, I sent her a letter of apology. I stand by that apology, I plan to continue to monitor my reactions to others. I’m seeing a mental health counselor now to ensure my kindness and respect for others is on solid footing, and I’m committed to always learning from others and growing in my ability to help others.”
Vargas warned that if the committee decided to punish Stewart, it could have far-reaching implications for the Legislature as a whole.
“Everyone in the Roundhouse will be walking on eggshells,” Vargas said. “Everyone will be afraid to say the wrong thing, or afraid that if they’re passionate about a subject, it’s going to get confused for harassment.”

Vermont Superior Court Judge Kerry McDonald-Cady ruled to dismiss the case with prejudice, meaning Moffitt can’t be tried on the same charges again. The decision has already been appealed.

The Vermont Supreme Court is set to decide whether the case against Deven Moffitt, accused of murdering his ex-girlfriend, has been too mishandled to see trial. 
For over a year, Moffitt’s lawyer has tried to get the case tossed out for good — claiming the prosecution lacks sufficient evidence to take Moffitt to court. 
Earlier this week, on June 20, Vermont Superior Court Judge Kerry McDonald-Cady ruled to dismiss the case with prejudice, meaning Moffitt can’t be tried on those charges again. An appeal of that decision will bring the dispute to the state Supreme Court. 
Moffitt’s lawyer alleged the prosecution made missteps properly confirming the identity of the human remains in the case. The state medical examiner’s office originally identified the remains as belonging to Lauren Hildenbrandt’s before Moffitt was charged with her murder in the second degree back in 2022.

But, in the years since, the prosecution failed to run more tests to confirm the original identification of the remains. 
“The state had more than two years to test the discovered remains and obtain additional DNA evidence for trial to confirm they were, in fact, the remains of Ms. Hildenbrandt,” wrote McDonald-Cady in the July 20 ruling. 
Back in January, prosecutors asked the judge to formally dismiss the case without prejudice, meaning they could refile the charge at a later date. In response, Moffitt’s lawyer motioned to dismiss the case with prejudice, meaning it could never be brought to court again. 
Deputy State’s Attorney Jared Bianchi argued against that motion. He explained that his office plans to press other criminal charges against Moffitt, and it would be most convenient to resolve them all in one trial, according to the ruling. 
That didn’t convince the judge. Over years, the state’s attorney’s office tried to press a number of additional charges against Moffitt, namely an alleged aggravated assault and multiple counts of obstruction of justice, court documents show. 
But on each count, the Bennington state’s attorney’s office had either failed to press charges swiftly enough, or the crime was committed in another county, putting it out of Bennington’s jurisdiction, McDonald-Cady wrote. 
Unconvinced by Bianchi’s arguments, the judge dismissed the case with prejudice, attempting to put the charge to rest for good.
“This Court recognizes the gravity of this decision for the State, the Defendant, the community, and especially the family and friends of Ms. Hildenbrandt,” wrote McDonald-Cady in her ruling. 
While permanently tossing the case out was an “extraordinary remedy,” she reasoned the prosecution had overstepped by drawing out the case, according to the ruling. 
Later this week, on July 23, Bianchi appealed McDonald-Cady’s ruling to the Vermont Supreme Court. There, justices can decide if Moffitt may be tried again for the same crime. 
Bianchi is still serving a 12 and a half year sentence for federal drug and firearm charges.

Donald Norcross and Herb Conaway say they have received no details about the Trump administration's push to house detained immigrants at the military base.,"Reps. Donald Norcross, left, and Herb Conaway speaking at the  Wrightstown Municipal Building about the Trump administration's plans to house undocumented immigrants at Fort Dix on July 25, 2025. (Morgan Leason | New Jersey Monitor)WRIGHTSTOWN — Reps. Herb Conaway and Donald Norcross expressed frustration Friday that they have not heard any more details from the Trump administration about its plan to house detained immigrants at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.
The comments from the congressmen, both Democrats, came following a tour of the base, about a week after Conaway received a letter from U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth revealing the plan. Military commanders at Fort Dix told the two men that there has not been an order yet to use the base’s facilities to house migrants, they said.
“I have never, in my 11 years of being in Congress … been shut out by our own government, trying to get the information on what might or might not happen on a base that happens to be in our backyard,” Norcross said.
Conaway said reports of poor conditions from other U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers across the country have him nervous about the Fort Dix plan.
“We’ve seen people, citizens and noncitizens alike, beaten on the streets. We have seen detainees who have been forced and remain in stress positions for a long period of time, indeed, with their hands tied behind their backs, forced to eat off plates, as a dog might have to eat,” Conaway told the New Jersey Monitor. “The people have been housed with feces and urine in their areas, where men and women have to use the same lavatory facilities, where little attention was paid to any health care needs, even clothing needs.”
Conaway added that detained migrants are often improperly cut off from legal counsel and family contact.
“You’re on American soil. You have the benefit and protection of the Constitution. That has long been understood,” Conaway said.
The Fort Dix plan is part of the Trump administration’s push to detain and deport millions of undocumented immigrants. The budget bill President Donald Trump signed earlier this month included $45 billion to build new immigration jails and hire 10,000 new immigration enforcement agents.
Democrats have assailed the plan, saying it would harm military readiness, while immigrant advocates said housing detained immigrants on a military base would hamper public oversight of migrant detention. Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former assemblyman seeking to become New Jersey’s new governor, has said this is a problem of Democrats’ own making, saying they put out a “welcome mat for illegal immigrants with their dangerous Sanctuary State policies.”
Conaway said he trusts that Fort Dix military commanders would act responsibly in hosting the detainees, but he would not say the same about the leadership at the Department of Homeland Security or ICE, which would operate the detention site independently of the military.
Spokespeople for the Department of Homeland Security and ICE did not respond to requests for comment.

The meeting in Jackson was a primer on Medicaid programs and provided a financial update for new members, most of whom were appointed in 2024 but have not yet participated in a meeting. 
The Medicaid Advisory Committee offers expertise and opinions to the state Medicaid program about health care services. It is made up of doctors, hospital executives, managed care organization representatives and other Medicaid stakeholders.

It includes two members of the recently formed Beneficiary Advisory Council, a group of Medicaid members and their families who advise Medicaid on their experience with the program. 
New federal policy seeks to heighten the role that beneficiaries play in shaping Medicaid programs and policy by mandating that members of the council serve on the Medicaid Advisory Committee. Ten percent of the group must be composed of beneficiaries or their families, a proportion that will rise in the coming years. 
Both committees are mandated by the federal government to meet quarterly. 
The last Medicaid Advisory Committee meeting, formerly known as the Medical Care Advisory Committee, was held on Dec. 8, 2023. 
Meetings were first set back in 2024 because state leaders, who were formerly charged with selecting members, were slow to make appointments. A meeting scheduled for October was postponed after former executive director Drew Snyder announced his resignation.

Meetings were then delayed further while the agency worked to sort out a discrepancy between state law and new federal guidelines, which mandated that committee appointments be made by the executive director of Medicaid and include members of the then-unformed Beneficiary Advisory Council. The new guidelines took effect this month. 
State lawmakers proposed language in several bills earlier this year during the legislative session that would have conformed state law to federal regulations. Two such bills were vetoed by the governor. 
Medicaid Executive Director Cindy Bradshaw said the agency decided to “honor the language” of the vetoed bills, conforming to federal guidelines without updating state law.

Melissa Bounty, the executive director of a nonprofit dedicated to supporting local businesses in central Vermont, was put on paid leave Monday pending the “outcome of an investigation.” It is unknown what the organization is investigating.The Central Vermont Economic Development Corporation is one of a dozen regional economic development corporations around the state dedicated to supporting local business. Close to all of the nonprofit’s revenue stems from state and federal dollars.  
The administrative leave letter, signed by the corporation’s Board Chair Ed Larson, Vice Chair Jody Emerson and Treasurer Reuben Stone, was obtained by VTDigger.
In the letter, directors told Bounty she was being placed on paid leave for the length of the inquiry. They wrote that Bounty being removed from the workplace was necessary to “allow for a thorough and impartial investigation.” The board also said placing Bounty on administrative leave was “not intended to imply wrongdoing or to prejudge the results of the investigation.
When asked about the investigation into Bounty, Emerson said she could not speak about any part of the investigation because the board cannot comment on “personnel matters.”“I stand by my work and my integrity,” Bounty wrote in a statement to VTDigger on Thursday. “I care so deeply for the Central Vermont business community and have been honored to learn more about the wonderful work happening in this vibrant region every day.”Bounty also noted the vague nature of the investigation.“I have not received any information about the concerns of my board or the reason for my administrative leave,” she wrote. “And I am fully committed to supporting a process that brings transparency about any questions in the work and output of the organization.”Bounty said she could not comment further.A police dispatcher at the Montpelier Police Department told VTDigger there was an “active investigation” into Bounty that did not allow for the retrieval of any records related to the matter.Washington County State Attorney Michelle Donnelly said her office had not yet been alerted to any investigation related to Bounty.According to Bounty’s yearly review, obtained by VTDigger through a source familiar with the matter, multiple business owners praised her for her work at the nonprofit.“Her abilities, experience and skills never cease to amaze me,” one business owner wrote.Another owner wrote that Bounty saved their business.“Without the support Melissa provided to our entire organization after the flooding in 2023 … [t]here would be 18 less good paying jobs in Central VT.”After VTDigger reached out to board members with questions about Bounty’s leave, the board’s lawyer John Valsangiacomo asked VTDigger to stop contacting board members.“We don’t have any comment,” the lawyer said Thursday.

Health officials are now testing mosquitoes for three viruses. No human cases of mosquito-borne illnesses have been reported yet this season.

In Rutland, the Jamestown Canyon virus has been detected in mosquitos for the first time in state history, the Vermont Department of Health announced Friday. Health officials also detected West Nile virus in St. Albans.
There have been no human or animal cases of mosquito-borne illnesses reported this season, but health officials are urging people to protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites. Jamestown Canyon virus can cause similar illnesses to other mosquito-borne diseases. Mosquitoes are being tested for West Nile virus, Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus — which last year caused two people to get ill and one of them to die — and Jamestown Canyon virus starting from this year.
“Every mosquito group is tested for all three viruses now,” said Natalie Kwit, a public health veterinarian at the Vermont Department of Health. “We added it (Jamestown Canyon virus) because it’s something we knew that’s been circulating in the Northeast, and we had a cost-effective test available that we switched to that included all three viruses.”
The Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets and the Vermont Department of Health decided to continue allocating funding to mosquito surveillance this year over tick surveillance to track illnesses like Eastern equine encephalitis after the cases occurred last year. The mosquito surveillance program generally runs from June to mid-October when mosquitos are more active.

Kwit said most people who become infected with these viruses don’t get sick, but some may develop symptoms a few days, or even weeks, after the mosquito bite.
Symptoms may include fever, body aches, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, rash and joint pains. The viruses can also lead to more serious illnesses like meningitis or encephalitis — an inflammation of the brain that can cause brain damage, stroke and death.
Cases of mosquitoes testing positive to Eastern equine encephalitis have increased significantly in recent years. According to data from the health department, in 2023, 14 groups of mosquitoes across three Vermont towns tested positive for EEE, whereas in 2024, 86 groups of mosquitoes across 16 towns tested positive.
Kwit said only about 5% of people infected with EEE develop a more serious illness. “The thing that worries us the most about Triple E is that about 30 to 40% of people with that severe form of illness die from the disease, so this one tends to be the most severe that we know of,” she said.
There are no vaccines to prevent Eastern equine encephalitis and Jamestown Canyon virus, nor medicines to treat them. The best way to limit the risk of infection is to prevent mosquito bites, according to the health department.
Recommendations from the Vermont Department of Health include wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants, limiting time outside at dawn or dusk when there are more mosquitoes, using insect repellent — the Environmental Protection Agency has a tool to help people identify the right repellent for them — fix holes in screens attached to doors and windows and get rid of standing water that might attract mosquitoes.

[…]","A combine harvester in wheat fields at P&J Ranches near Sheridan, MT, on on August 28, 2019. (USDA Photo / Lance Cheung)Montana ranchers, farmers and the state’s tourism industry expressed deep concern with President Donald Trump’s tariffs during a press call on Thursday.
Uncertainty is a major issue, they said, and the actions have set the United States up as an “unreliable trade partner” which is damaging to those who depend on markets outside the country.
The Trump administration recently announced new 30% tariffs on the European Union and Mexico, 35% tariffs on Canada, and 50% tariffs on Brazil. Montana exports $2.4 billion goods annually, with Canada accounting for 37% of the state’s total goods exports, according to statistics from Tariffs Cost US, an advocacy organization. 
“Instability is the bane of ag producers. We can plan ahead whenever we can. We have so many things we can’t plan for, weather, sickness, disease, all kinds of stuff that we have no kind of control over and never will,” said Benjamin Peterson, a farmer and rancher on E. L. Peterson Ranch, which is just north of Judith Gap. “And you add in governmental and trade instability, it makes it 100 times worse.”
Peterson specifically detailed an issue around markets in Pacific Rim countries like South Korea, Japan and Vietnam. American checkoff marketing campaigns had been effective in those countries — in fact, there’s an entire facility in Oregon dedicated to marketing American (including Montanan) wheat, catering to a number of international entities interested in wheat products from this country. Montana is the third-leading wheat producing state in the U.S. 
Markets in those countries for American products were built over years and fell in a day, Peterson said.
“Those areas and those markets are gone, and the chances of those of us getting those back are very low because they went over and bought cheaper products, maybe not as good a product, but cheaper product from Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Venezuela,” Peterson said about American beef. “We may never get those back.”
The price of beef is high right now, but it’s mostly a demand for low-quality, imported beef. The type many Montana ranchers are raising is of higher quality, and Peterson said the only thing anyone knows going into next year is that price will be volatile.
There’s also a shortage of high-quality cattle, Montana Farmers Union President Walt Schweitzer said. 
“Most of the livestock producing stage in the last five years have experienced severe drought, and we haven’t started rebuilding our herd,” Schweitzer said.”And so the reason our cattle prices are high is because of the shortage of live animals to harvest and I’m a little concerned that we’re not going to get through this as quick as we could, just because of the tariffs that are going to be imposed.”
Peterson said baseline costs on fertilizer and minerals have increased. Schweitzer added the tariffs have also put stress on the American food system, which already had a major shock from COVID.
Immigration policy is also a concern and adds cost if more food is grown outside the country.
“We use foreign labor because we don’t have a choice,” Schweitzer said. “So if you take that labor out of the system, food prices are going to go up, and food systems are going to move out of the country, as far as who’s going to grow them.”
Added Peterson: “Good, high-quality food is going to become the food of the rich.”
A farmer, John Wicks, the owner of Tiber Ridge Organics south of Chester, said parts for agricultural tools are becoming a major issue. He recently sold a piece of specialized equipment because the parts came from Europe and were about 24% more expensive this season. He lost money and said he’ll have to rent it if he needs it.
“It just didn’t pencil out to keep it and have that kind of liability if things broke,” Wicks said. “So that was kind of a really difficult period. And then, you know, Montana agriculture is a generational thing, and these policies and these tariffs are pushing for corporate farms to be able to come in and take over these small family farms.”
Larger companies have more capacity to absorb losses, which can put small producers in a bind. Peterson also made a comparison to the 1980s farm crisis, a broad term used to describe various issues that combined to transfer huge numbers of land held by small farmers to larger, sometimes corporate entities. 
It also forced numerous farmers to size-up their operations and rely on oft-discussed farm subsidies to make the farms pencil out economically.
“It’s back to the ‘80s of, get big or get out,” Peterson said. “They’re just doing it with a different method.”
Schweitzer also mentioned the alarming rate of mental health issues among farmers and ranchers. Suicides among agricultural producers skyrocked during the Farm Crisis and have remained high in the years since. Montana consistently has among the highest rates of suicide per capita in the country.
“It’s caused a lot of stress for farmers and ranchers,” Schweitzer said.
  Other impacts 

Federal policy changes continue impacting the state in other ways, including Montana’s tourism economy.
While Glacier and Yellowstone National Park visitation is up, federal cuts have meant fewer parks employees. That’s been an issue, Explore Whitefish executive director Zak Anderson said during the call.
“This affects visitor services and trail maintenance and traffic flow and really everything, and then that again, it puts more pressure on local businesses and infrastructure to pick up the slack,” Anderson said. “So I guess overall, I would say that what we’re looking for as a community is some stability from policymakers, like avoiding abrupt tariff hikes or policy policy shifts that then change at a whim.”
Anderson said Canadian tourism is down 25% in Whitefish.
There’s also new tariffs on graphite as well as copper, which could also impact Montana. In 2023, for example, there were nearly 400 people working for Montana Resources at the Continental Pit Mine in Butte.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/49392074813_187802035b_k-1024x763.jpg,,,2025-07-25 18:56:24.792231

Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) discusses her efforts to protect funding for Great Lakes restoration and protection efforts amid threats of cuts from the Trump administration. July 25, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceGreat Lakes advocates and researchers on Friday cautioned against funding cuts to a critical research institute, warning that the loss of staff and funding could have dire consequences.
That included U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor), who emphasized the importance of continuing to fund efforts to keep the Great Lakes clean and healthy. 
Dingell, alongside members of the University of Michigan Water Center, the Healing Our Waters-Great Lakes Coalition, the Alliance for the Great Lakes and the Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research, spoke about her concerns at Ann Arbor’s Matthaei Botanical Gardens on Friday.
The administration of President Donald Trump is proposing steep cuts to the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, and the group warned that the Great Lakes could lose another vital layer of protection as the president zeroes out funds for several key programs supported by the agency.
Mike Shriberg, director of the University of Michigan Water Center, noted that NOAA’s Great Lakes Environmental Lab had already lost 35% of its staff, while the remaining employees are under duress as they work to make up for their lost colleagues and face increased bureaucratic demands.

While the House and Senate have proposed bills maintaining funding for NOAA programs that the president eliminated, they do not restore the cuts that have already been made. 
The Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research is one agency at risk of losing its staff and funding, with Greg Dick, the institute’s director, emphasizing the critical nature of the group’s research.
The institute’s work centers on threats that impact the daily lives of the people of the Great Lakes Region, Dick explained, including threats like coastal flooding, oil spills and extreme weather.
One of the key ways the institute protects the health and safety of the Great Lakes region is through its work on harmful algal blooms, he added.
“These unsightly, smelly and highly toxic algae blooms now occur in all five Great Lakes,” Dick said. “They threaten the amazing waters that provide recreational opportunities, support numerous small businesses and serve as a source of drinking water for nearly 30 million people.”
In 2014, Toledo, Ohio lost access to drinking water for 72 hours due to a harmful algal bloom, leaving half a million people without access to tap water for a long weekend, Dick said. 
The homes, businesses and hospitals affected by the crisis were estimated to have lost a total of $65 million.
In combatting these growths, the team at the Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research takes weekly samples to measure the amount of toxins and the quality of the water, works with partners to develop a five-day forecast of how algal blooms will grow and move, and utilizes cutting-edge tools to track new toxins, Dick said.
The work is driven by 50 scientists and staff members at the University of Michigan, whose work is almost entirely funded by NOAA.
Laura Rubin, director of the Healing Our Waters-Great Lakes Coalition warned that cutting great lakes science programs will cost more on the back end, when the government ultimately has to address problems that arise from abandoning these efforts, like managing invasive sea lampreys and harmful algal blooms.
Additionally, every $1 invested into Great Lakes restoration and science produces $3 in economic benefit, Rubin said.
Rubin also stressed that these programs have succeeded due to their partnerships between state and federal governments. 
“States cannot do this job by themselves. The federal government provides the ability to manage large landscape restoration projects and scientific inquiry that demand coordination and strategic direction across state and international and sovereign boundaries, as well as integrated science monitoring and technical experience,” Rubin said.
Joel Brammeier, president and CEO of the Alliance for the Great Lakes, emphasized that the Great Lakes Restoration movement was built on decades of science that has largely been supported by federal funds. 
Dingell also called attention to the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which was established in 2010. The program provides funding to states, tribes and local communities, for on the ground efforts to address the largest concerns facing the Great Lakes.
In January, Dingell alongside U.S. Reps. Bill Huizenga (R-Holland Township), David Joyce (R-Ohio) and Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio), reintroduced the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act with the support of several other lawmakers from the Great Lakes region. The bill would extend funding for the program from 2027 through 2031. 
In the U.S. Senate, Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Twp.) and Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) also introduced legislation to extend funding for the initiative.
Although the initiative has extraordinarily high value, the program is designed to supplement organizations’ base funding, Shriberg said. If the core funding is lost, that supplementary funding is no longer useful. 
Dingell said she is also cosponsoring a bill to protect funding designated for NOAA, specifically for the National Weather Service and Great Lakes programs, from being reduced or redirected. It would also require the Administrator of NOAA to report to Congress each year that they are complying with the act’s requirements, Dingell said. 
“Here’s the new reality, we can require we pass it in the appropriations bills, and then the administration isn’t taking the money we’ve authorized and spending it,” Dingell said, noting the Great Lakes is one issue you can still bring the state’s Congressional delegation together on. “We have to find a way to make sure that funding authorized and needed is getting to where it needs to go, and it needs to be done in a bipartisan way.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7254154-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-25 18:56:24.792231

ISU’s proposed athletic budget for the 2026 fiscal year totals $141 million, exceeding the previous athletic budget by $27 million. According to board documents, “several transformational changes” in collegiate athletics over the past two years have resulted in projected $30 million “recurring annual financial repercussions” to the university’s athletics department, starting this year.
“ISU is engaging with the Big 12 Conference, ISU Foundation, sponsors, donors and other partners to explore additional opportunities to create growth in revenue sufficient to overcome future anticipated revenue shortfalls and to otherwise support the continued success and viability of the ISU Athletics Program,” the document stated. “ISU views this effort as one of the top priorities and challenges facing the university.”

Changes causing the fluctuation in funds include the new allowance for colleges to share revenue dollars with student athletes, the expansion of the Big 12 Conference to 16 teams and shifts in how revenue generated through the College Football Playoff is distributed among conferences, according to the document.
ISU has halted renovations to Hilton Coliseum and construction of a new wrestling practice facility, which would have cost a total of $45 million to complete, in order to help with the budget, the document stated. The university also implemented “cost reduction mandates” among each ISU sport and their support departments and put annual sales tax on sports ticket sales on the consumer — around $1.5 million annually — rather than absorbing it in the budget as an expense. This change is reflected in projected ticket sale revenue increases for fiscal year 2026.
Members of the Cyclone Club, the ISU athletic department’s donation platform and membership program, are also seeing a 20% increase in donation amounts required for membership, according to the document, which is expected to earn an additional $3 million in annual funding.
“Athletics will carefully monitor the impact of this increase on future donations,” the document stated.
While the university stated in the document it found around $8.7 million in annual savings for the athletic department, funding gaps averaging nearly $25 million annually are still projected through fiscal year 2031, when the Big 12 television contract expires. In total, the funding gap until that time comes to $147 million.
The Iowa State University Foundation is providing the athletics department with a one-time, $26.7 million transfer of athletics reserves to balance the fiscal year 2026 budget, the document stated, but those reserve dollars will not make up future gaps in funding.
Other transfers to athletics from the foundation include annual donations from the Cyclone Club, donations made for capital projects and “premium seating contributions,” according to the document.
“Historically, Athletics operated as a self-sufficient operation transferring the funds necessary to cover operating costs in the current fiscal year,” the document stated. “Prior to FY 2025 under the current administration, ISU Athletics had not incurred an operating deficit other than the COVID impacted season, which was absorbed by cash reserves.”
UI, UNI athletics budgets grow
At the University of Iowa, the athletics department’s budget is expected to grow more than 12% from last year and total nearly $170 million, according to the board document, mainly due to $20.5 million allocated for student-athlete revenue sharing.
Men’s and women’s wrestling ticket sales are expected to remain consistent with last year’s numbers, of which men’s wrestling revenues were above budget and women’s wrestling came in under what was expected. Ticket sales revenue for football is expected to increase by more than $3.3 million, putting the budget line at nearly $27.8 million and total income for fiscal year 2026 at close to $170 million.
As the only state university to provide institutional support for athletics programs, the University of Northern Iowa reported in the board document it will budget more than $5.4 million in university funding for athletics in operational support, scholarships and more. While funding for scholarships remained flat, institutional support for operations and supplemental funding both increased.
Women’s sports at UNI are expected to increase over last year, when they sold above what was budgeted. Higher ticket sales for wrestling and other men’s sports are also set to increase, according to the board documents.
UNI’s total athletics budget is projected to grow by more than $1.2 million to just under $16 million.
“Optional revenue sharing with student athletes is not budgeted at UNI for FY 2026,” the document stated.
The Iowa Board of Regents will discuss fiscal year 2026 budgets for each of Iowa’s public universities at its July 30 meeting.

The Providence City Council voted Thursday night to defeat a proposal crafted by its own president and the mayor that would have leased a vacant building to charter school Excel Academy.
But on Friday morning, the former Carl G. Lauro Elementary School was not exactly vacant. Workers went in and out of wide open doors on both sides of the 140,000-square foot building. The hum of several of the approximately 35 air conditioners could be heard from the sidewalk, as could the occasional power tool.  
The building at 99 Kenyon St. costs Providence about $300,000 annually, said Josh Estrella, a spokesperson for Mayor Brett Smiley. The work is essentially to keep the building from falling into disrepair, and Estrella said the costs include utilities, general maintenance, roof work, fire alarms, and labor. The building needs to be preserved because the state-run Providence Public School District (PPSD) still has plans to use it.
“The City spends approximately $300,000 a year to maintain this vacant, dormant building, which will have an active school presence connected to it, adding to the building’s security risk,” Estrella said. 
Going forward, the costs for renovating and maintaining the building to PPSD’s liking will fall upon the district itself. PPSD spokesperson Suzanne Ouellette said in a Friday email the district is reassessing construction timelines in the aftermath of the lease’s rejection, as it wants to use the school as a temporary swing space for students of Asa Messer Elementary School before they can attend classes in a facility that’s still being built.
“In the short-term, PPSD will be responsible for bearing the full cost of utilities, custodial, and maintenance for the Lauro building versus sharing them with Excel,” Ouellette wrote — bad news amid a potential $5 million drop in federal funding, she added. 
In the longer-term, Ouellette said the district is now without lease revenue it meant to use in support of school facility upgrades across the city.
The old elementary school once accommodated up to 1,050 students, but overly pricey needed upgrades led the state-run district to close the Lauro School in 2023. Since then the unoccupied building has become a testing ground for sparring ideas about education in not just the capital city but the state itself. 
“This was a chance to say yes to students, to families, and to a smarter future for Providence,” Victor Capellan, founder and CEO of Rhode Island Education Collective and a former senior adviser to the state education department’s commissioner, said in a Friday morning statement. “Instead, we are left with a building that continues to drain public resources while children are denied better options.”

Excel Academy, which has four existing locations in Massachusetts and one in North Providence, would have occupied the building through 2035 under the lease agreement that councilors rejected Thursday. It would have shared the space with Asa Messer students for the first five years of the lease.
“Despite this disappointing outcome, our families and our community remain undeterred,” Owen Stearns, superintendent of Excel Academy, said in a statement Thursday night. 
According to the Rhode Island Education Collective, the lease would have generated more than $80 million in local investment over time from Excel’s rent payments, capital improvements, philanthropy, and neighborhood beautification.
The City Council has twice shot down proposals to lease the building to a charter school, which are publicly-funded schools that limit enrollment via a lottery system. The Rhode Island General Assembly increased the number of charter school operators allowed in the state to 35 in 2010, and Excel already has approval to expand from the Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE). 
Capellan’s former boss at RIDE — state education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green — has noted the big demand for charter schools among the city’s parents. Infante-Green cited in a 2024 interview with The 74 that 19,000 Providence children apply to charter schools out of 22,000 students in the district.
“As a mother and educator, the Commissioner believes in parents’ ability to choose the best educational experience that meets their needs and priorities,” Victor Morente, a RIDE spokesperson, wrote in a Friday email. “Both charters and traditional schools are public schools, and she represents all public schools.”
A U-turn on Kenyon Street deal
The school building is in the district represented by City Council President Rachel Miller, who negotiated the lease terms herself alongside Smiley, who also chairs the Excel Academy Rhode Island Board of Trustees. The upcoming agreement, Miller said in a July 17 statement, was carefully vetted and vastly improved upon the previous year’s proposal.
But Miller lost confidence in the lease on Wednesday evening, and announced in a statement that she would vote against it.
“The city council will not hand the keys of a shuttered public school building to a charter school,” Miller wrote. “We need to ensure that our public spaces are utilized in ways that reflect the needs of surrounding communities.”
The next day, Thursday, the Council met and voted 8-4 on the lease approval, with two abstentions and one absence.
Miller’s change of heart provoked the ire of a number of charter proponents who had campaigned for months to see the lease approved, including the Providence Republican City Committee. In a press release issued shortly after midnight Friday, the Providence GOP noted bussing Providence students to Excel’s North Providence location is costly, to the tune of an estimated $200,000 a year. Providence kids comprise 85% of the student body at the North Providence Excel, according to the group.   
Miller’s maneuver also wounded and confused Smiley, who learned of her decision via her announcement, after hearing rumors earlier in the day. He described Miller’s reversal as “baffling” at a Thursday morning press conference ahead of the council’s vote.  
“If she thinks that this is going to somehow provide additional resources for Providence Public Schools, it will not,” Smiley said. “This not only doesn’t move education forward in the city, it actually creates a bunch of new problems that PPSD is going to have to solve.”

High emotions over valuable real estate
Miller did not have any additional comment on the vote Friday morning. City Council spokesperson Marc Boyd said via email there was “nothing else to add right now beyond what was in Wednesday night’s statement.”
But Miller did have more to say online Wednesday, when Boston Globe political columnist Dan McGowan critiqued her second thoughts.
“This council can’t get out of its own way,” McGowan wrote.
Miller wrote back: “I don’t know Dan — it’s my job to put forward the best option I can and then listen. My neighbors opposed this — nearly 150 residents contacted me since — politicians don’t change their mind publicly because folks are unwilling to admit their way might not be the only way.”
More city councilors and Providence School Board members weighed in on social media, dissatisfied with McGowan’s assertion that Miller’s reneging was not the best look as the city works to take back its schools from state control.
“Well, if she reneged, she did it for the right reason,” Providence School Board President Ty’relle Stephens responded. “I’d call that an A+ reneging.”
Stephens had also scheduled a press conference outside City Hall earlier in the week to oppose the lease approval. The event was postponed because of “unforeseen circumstances,” according to an email from Stephens. But it would have included three school board members, one state representative, and two state senators from Providence, including Sen. Sam Bell, a Democrat who represents the district where the Lauro building resides. 
“It’s no small thing to get the council president to reverse her position and oppose a lease agreement she negotiated,” Bell said via text Friday, praising the council’s decision. 
The building is also in the district of Providence Democratic Rep. John J. Lombardi, who wrote via email Friday that he was still “trying to understand the backstory” of the building’s saga. 
Still, Lombardi, a former city council president who temporarily served as the city’s mayor from 2002 to 2003, said a public school is his preference for the space. But he added that a “hybrid” public-private venture, like apartments with social service programs attached, would be even more “ideal” for the city.
The building, Lombardi said, is “too valuable a real estate footprint to remain vacant.”

The Trump administration announced Friday that it was releasing the money, which totals billions nationwide and pays for English language instruction, adult literacy and teacher professional development, among other things. 
When the federal government announced its decision to “review” the grant funding on June 30, the original amount was more than $6 billion, including $68 million in Mississippi. Later, the Trump administration unfroze $1.3 billion in grants that pay for afterschool programs, which totaled about $17 million in Mississippi.
Since then, $51 million was still on hold in the state. 
The freeze had prompted lawsuits and calls from Congress, which appropriated the money in a bill signed this year by Trump, to release it. School districts in Mississippi were scrambling to deal with with the freeze at the eleventh hour, just weeks away from the start of school. 
Spokespeople for the Mississippi Department of Education said they received notice from the national education department on Friday afternoon about the grants. The funds will be awarded beginning July 28, the state agency said. 
“We are relieved to learn that the U.S. Department of Education will release the funds that Congress committed to states,” said Lance Evans, state superintendent of education, in an emailed statement. “These funds are essential to providing education services to the students of Mississippi.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/12171730/Stewpot-summer-camp-4.jpg,,,2025-07-25 17:58:10.418693

A new analysis released on Wednesday by the national left-leaning nonprofit think tank found that  during President Donald Trump’s first six months, federal agencies — primarily the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation — have canceled more than 4,000 grant awards worth an estimated $7 billion at over 600 colleges and universities across the country as of early July. Between $3.3 billion to $3.7 billion in research grants have been targeted. 
Data for the analysis was pulled from DOGE’s “Wall of Receipts,” U.S. Department of Health and Human Services list of terminated grants and the U.S. Treasury Department’s Bureau of Fiscal Spending. The report looks at terminated grants, not grants that were paused or “frozen,” according to the analysis. 
Mississippi colleges and universities could lose $32,513,961 in federal research grants and funding cuts under the Department of Government Efficiency, according to the report. Mississippi State University would take the biggest hit, losing more than $25.6 million.
Earlier this year, Mark Keenum, president of the university, penned a letter of concern over the federal administration’s executive order to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion efforts linked to research funding, student aid and other school operations, calling the potential loss “catastrophic” to the university. 
In a press statement sent to Mississippi Today, Keenum said the institution has been working with state lawmakers and federal agency leaders to help recover funds that were threatened, particularly working with Republican U.S. Sen. Cindy-Hyde Smith to fund the school’s Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Fish research center. 
“We are deeply appreciative of the help of our Mississippi congressional delegation as they work to preserve MSU research programs and ameliorate cuts to our institution’s benefit. U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith worked particularly hard on the Senate Appropriations Committee to win concessions for our outstanding Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Fish research,” Keenum said. “I am proud of the way our faculty, staff, and students remained focused and disciplined in their reactions to these challenges. Because of that, we continue to serve as our state’s premier research and development hub.” 
Terminating millions of dollars in research grants at universities could strip schools and their communities of resources and job opportunities, Greta Bedekovics, co-author of the analysis and associate director of democracy policy at the national think tank, said in a press statement. 
“These data show that no institution, big or small, is safe from being targeted, and all states are suffering the consequences of cuts,” Bedekovics said. “The future success of many universities and colleges, their reputations, and their ability to attract talent is on the line.” 
Historically Black colleges and universities, as well as public land grant universities have also been affected, with more than two-thirds of all land grant universities and nearly half of HBCUs targeted for funding terminations, according to the report. 
The state has two land grant universities — Mississippi State University and Alcorn State University, the state’s oldest land grant university, which is targeted for $272,369 in cuts. Alcorn is also an HBCU, as is Mississippi’s Jackson State University targeted for $1,436,982 in cuts and Mississippi Valley State University with $59,962. 
Mississippi’s capitol city community colleges — Holmes Community College and Hinds Community College — could collectively lose $666,000. The University of Mississippi is targeted with a cut of $1,957,108. William Carey University, a private college located in the state’s southern region stands to lose $1.3 million.

(Photo by Getty Images, board seal courtesy the State of Iowa) The former president of the medical staff at a Sioux City hospital has been sanctioned by the Iowa Board of Medicine for sexual harassment.
According to board records, Dr. Rick Colwell, 66, was employed by UnityPoint Health’s St. Luke’s Regional Medical Center in Sioux City prior to being placed on administrative leave in 2022.
The board says Colwell’s personnel file indicates that sometime prior to 2015, he had been warned for the use of profanity and “abusive or demeaning behavior toward nurses,” and for verbal aggression and confrontational behavior. The board alleges that Colwell then hired an entity called Out of the Woods Inc. “to address these concerns.”
About 18 months later, the board says, Colwell was elected president of the medical staff at the Sioux City hospital, where he also served on the hospital’s board of directors.
In his role as medical staff president, one of Colwell’s “core duties” was to resolve issues involving inappropriate or unacceptable behavior by the medical staff, the board alleges.
At some unspecified point, the board alleges, UnityPoint Health fielded a complaint that Colwell had made sexually suggestive comments that made the complainant uncomfortable. An internal investigation allegedly concluded Colwell had violated UnityPoint Health’s sexual harassment policy by creating a hostile work environment.
According to the board, the hospital placed Colwell on administrative leave on Feb. 11, 2022. Three weeks later, on March 2, 2022, the board alleges, Colwell resigned prior to the conclusion of an internal investigation.
Board records indicate Colwell now works in emergency medicine as an as an independent contractor for Floyd Valley Hospital in Le Mars.
Earlier this month, as a result of the 2022 allegations, the Iowa Board of Medicine charged Colwell with sexual harassment. Colwell denied the allegations but agreed to a settlement that places his license on probation for one year subject to certain conditions.
As part of the settlement, Colwell will be required to complete a program for “distressed physicians” and submit to worksite monitoring by an individual who will meet periodically with Colwell and review his patient charts if needed. During his probation, Colwell is to continue seeing a mental health therapist who will supply the board with reports on a regular basis, according to the settlement.
The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Colwell for comment on Friday.



Other Iowa-licensed doctors sanctioned
Other Iowa physicians recently sanctioned by the Board of Medicine include:
— Dr. Theron Q. Jameson, an Iowa-licensed orthopedic medicine physician who works in the Des Moines area. The board alleges it has received information indicating that Jameson, at some unspecified time in the past, “behaved in an inappropriate and unprofessional manner, including sharing inappropriate details about his personal life and making both sexual and derogatory comments about and towards coworkers.”
Jameson has denied the allegations but agreed to a settlement that calls for him to complete training and educational courses on professional boundaries and medical ethics. As part of the settlement, he is also required to pay a $5,000 civil penalty, complete a multidisciplinary fitness-for-duty assessment, and comply with any recommendations as a result of that assessment.
— Dr. Gautam Jayaswal, who pleaded guilty to a felony criminal charge of conspiracy in 2023.  According to federal prosecutors, Jayaswal was an emergency medicine physician licensed in Iowa and at least seven other states when he contracted with Barton & Associates and 11 other companies that provide medical goods and services for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.
Through those companies, Jayaswal allegedly ordered medically unnecessary products and services for thousands of telemedicine patients, including orthotic braces for 1,433 patients at a cost of $1.3 million. Medicare was also billed for $14.7 million for unnecessary genetic tests Jayaswal ordered for 2,000 of his telemedicine “patients,” prosecutors alleged.
Court records show that immediately after he was charged, Jayaswal pleaded guilty to conspiracy, a crime punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine of $250,000. His sentencing has been delayed several times since May 2023 and is now scheduled for Sept. 4, 2025.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DOCTOR.jpg,,,2025-07-25 17:58:10.418693

But the president wants to upend two other core tenants of California’s homelessness response.,"In summary
Trump’s call to enforce bans on encampments echoes Newsom’s policy. But the president wants to upend two other core tenants of California’s homelessness response.


President Donald Trump’s new law-and-order approach to homelessness bears several striking resemblances to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s.
Trump wants cities to enforce laws that make it illegal for homeless people to sleep outside. So does Newsom. 
Trump threatened to withhold funding from places that don’t. So did Newsom. 
And the president wants to make it easier to force homeless people living with serious mental illness or addiction into treatment. So does Newsom. 
It’s rare for Trump and Newsom, typically adversaries, to see eye to eye on anything. But when the president signed an executive order this week pushing cities and states to use law enforcement to get unhoused people off the streets, some of it read like déjà vu to Californians. 
“I don’t know that there’s a huge contrast between parts of this order and what winds are already blowing toward in California,” said Ryan Finnigan, deputy director of research for the UC Berkeley Terner Center for Housing Innovation.
But Trump doesn’t want to stop at banning homeless encampments and pushing people into treatment, and that’s where he and Newsom diverge: The president wants to upend two core tenets of California’s homelessness policy.
Trump wants to abolish federal support for “housing first,” which is the idea that homeless individuals should get housing even if they are still using drugs, and “harm reduction,” which focuses on preventing overdoses and otherwise making drug use safer.
Both tenets are backed by research and have been the gold standard in California — and at the federal level — for years
The threat of abandoning those philosophies has left local service providers scrambling to figure out whether they’ll have to change how they’ve helped homeless Californians for years or risk losing out on federal funds. 
“For all of that to be upended, the entire structure of service delivery is going to be turned upside down,” said John Maceri, CEO of The People Concern, a nonprofit that serves unhoused people in Los Angeles.
More of the same in California?
Trump’s executive order, titled “Ending crime and disorder on America’s streets,” seeks to prioritize funding for states and cities that enforce bans on open drug use, camping, loitering and squatting. It also orders the Attorney General to make federal funds available for removing encampments in places where state and local resources aren’t enough. 
The order comes a year after the U.S. Supreme Court removed protections for people living on the streets in California and other western states, ruling cities can ban camping even if they have no shelter beds.
Newsom already was pressuring cities to crack down on homeless encampments long before Trump’s order. In May, he urged every city in the state to pass an ordinance making it illegal to camp on public property. As an example of how this should be done, he released a model ordinance that would make it illegal to camp in one place for more than three nights in a row, block streets or sidewalks and build semi-permanent structures. 
But Newsom was quick to distance himself from Trump’s policies.
“Like so many of Trump’s executive orders, this order is more focused on creating distracting headlines and settling old scores than producing any positive impact,” spokesperson Tara Gallegos said in an emailed statement. “But, his imitation (even poorly executed) is the highest form of flattery.”
Some experts say Trump, who has a history of holding funding hostage over perceived slights, could use his new executive order as a way to cut off money to California. 
The order doesn’t specify exactly what compliance looks like, Finnigan said. At least 50 California cities have banned homeless encampments in the past year, according to a study by UC Berkeley researchers. But if homelessness doesn’t decrease in a way Trump is satisfied with, the president could accuse California of failing to enforce those laws and cut the state’s funding, Finnigan said. 
That threat comes as the Trump administration already is cutting funds for homeless services, affordable housing and Medicaid. 
Trump’s order also prioritizes committing more people to institutions from the street. The order seeks to make it easier to commit people with mental illness who can’t care for themselves, while also promising grants and other assistance to help ramp up commitments, and threatening to divert funding away from places that don’t push people into treatment facilities “to the maximum extent permitted by law.” It also promises to prioritize funding to expand mental health courts and drug courts. 
Newsom, too, has made it a priority to get people living with mental illness and addiction out of encampments and into treatment — without their consent, if necessary. His CARE Court program, which went live in all 58 counties at the end of last year, allows judges to put people into mental health and addiction treatment plans, but stops short of allowing judges to force compliance. Newsom also supported a 2023 law that expanded who could be forced into treatment under a conservatorship. 
Trump’s order prompted a backlash from groups that support the civil rights of people with mental illnesses and disabilities. The National Alliance on Mental Health, which maintains that forced treatment should be used as a last resort, said Trump’s order raises “grave concerns.” Disability Rights California, which also opposed CARE Court, said Trump’s order goes a step beyond what California is already doing.
“The playbook looks similar,” said Greg Cramer, associate director of public policy. “But I think the consequences of the Trump action go even further.”
But the order doesn’t include funding for new mental health or addiction treatment beds. In a state already struggling with a lack of resources, some experts said Trump’s order for more forced treatment feels hollow.
“Even if they agreed to go into treatment, where are these facilities that they’re supposed to go into?” Maceri asked. 
No more housing first
In ending federal support for housing first and harm reduction strategies to fight homelessness, Trump’s order ends years of precedent. California has long practiced housing first, which means everyone is entitled to housing, even if they have an untreated mental illness or are using drugs. The idea is that it’s much easier to receive treatment or get clean while housed than it is on the street. 
Instead, Trump wants people in federal housing programs to have to submit to substance abuse treatment or mental health services as a condition of participation. His order also stops federal funding for harm reduction. 
The People Concern, which provides street outreach and runs permanent housing, offers the opiate overdose reversing drug Narcan to its clients. It gives out antiseptic wipes to help people who inject drugs avoid dangerous infections, and it doesn’t evict tenants just because they are using drugs. 
The organization also refers people to treatment programs. But not everyone is ready for that, Maceri said. The harm reduction strategies help build trust — and keep people safe — until they are ready to get clean, he said. 
The People Concern, like many nonprofits, uses state and private funds — not federal dollars — to pay for harm reduction services. 
But Trump’s order directs the Attorney General to review whether organizations that get federal funds and also “knowingly distribute drug paraphernalia” or “permit the use of distribution of illicit drugs” on their property are violating federal law – and bring civil or criminal actions against them if so. 
That could mean groups like The People Concern have to change their practices.
“If it goes that far,” Maceri said, “I’m certainly not going to put our staff or our clients in legal jeopardy.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/032223_SD_Encampment-Ban_KC_CM_05.jpg?fit=1024%2C676&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-25 17:58:10.418693

(Photo via Google Earth) A surgeon is suing an eastern Iowa county hospital, alleging officials there discriminated against her on the basis of gender, fired her and then falsely reported she had resigned.
Dr. Beth Hothan-Zielinski of Henry County is suing Jefferson County Health Center of Fairfield in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa based on a civil rights complaint she filed against the hospital in November 2024.
According to the lawsuit, the hospital hired Hothan-Zielinski as a general surgeon in April 2013. For the next 11 years, the lawsuit claims, Hothan-Zielinski performed her job and, for most of that time, was the only general surgeon at the hospital.
In November 2021, the lawsuit alleges, the hospital hired Dr. Scott Stoeger as a second general surgeon. Stoeger left Jefferson County in November 2023, and in September 2024,  Hothan-Zielinski allegedly learned that the hospital had paid him far more than her to do the same job.
The lawsuit claims that while Stoeger graduated medical school in 2013, Hothan-Zielinski had been a practicing general surgeon for 38 years, and yet Stoeger had a base pay of $480,000 per year, which was $105,000 more Hothan-Zielinski was paid.
Stoeger had no experience, education, skill or additional board certification that would have justified the pay difference, the lawsuit claims. It goes on to allege that the hospital “did not negotiate at all” the terms for Stoeger’s pay, offering him $480,000 and a $20,000 signing bonus, as well as an annual payment toward student loans, plus a $6,000 annual retention bonus for five years.
Hothan-Zielinski alleges she was never offered a signing bonus or a retention bonus.
The lawsuit goes on to allege that Jefferson County Health Center gives surgeons bonuses based on a formula using Relative Value Units, or RVUs, which are intended to reflect a physician’s volume of work and level of effort in treating patients. Typically, the more RVUs a physician generates, the greater the revenue for the hospital and the physician.
On Sept. 11, 2024, the lawsuit claims, hospital CEO Bryan Hunger told Hothan-Zielinski her contract was not being renewed for 2025. “Dr. Hothan-Zielinski was shocked,” the lawsuit alleges, adding that Hunger later attributed the decision to her “productivity.”
The lawsuit states that Hothan-Zielinski then “gave a large file with her surgery figures” to the hospital’s governing board and “fought for her job” during a public meeting, arguing that the hospital was incorrect in its calculation of her RVUs.
“The board fired her anyway,” the lawsuit alleges. “The meeting minutes claimed Dr. Hothan-Zielinski resigned. That was false; Dr. Hothan-Zielinski never resigned.”
The lawsuit alleges violations of the Iowa Civil Rights Act’s provisions on gender, sex discrimination and pay discrimination, as well as violations of the Equal Pay Act of 1963. It is seeking compensatory damages for lost wages, as well as tripled damages due to the discrimination involved.
The hospital has yet to file a response to the lawsuit, which was filed in state court last month before being transferred to federal court this week. The hospital’s spokesperson and its attorneys in the case could not be reached for comment Friday afternoon.

The Office of Secretary of State Steve Simon is denying a request from the Trump administration to submit Minnesota’s voter registration list to the U.S. Department of Justice.
In a letter to the DOJ, Justin Erickson, Simon’s general counsel, writes that the secretary of state’s office “will require clear legal justification for the data and sufficient information to show that the data will be protected and used properly before it can consider whether it is appropriate to share Minnesota’s voter registration list.”
The letter is addressed to Maureen Riordan, acting chief, voting section of the DOJ.
As Stateline reported recently, the DOJ is seeking the voter registration lists of Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin  — representing data on millions of Americans — and other election information ahead of the 2026 midterms, raising fears about how the Trump administration plans to use the information.


Erickson writes that the Trump administration hasn’t provided “any legal basis in its June 25 letter that would entitle it to Minnesota’s voter registration list.”
The Star Tribune was first to report Simon’s response Friday.
Other states recently received emails from a DOJ official asking for meetings to discuss information-sharing agreements.
As Stateline reported, the DOJ’s focus on elections comes after President Donald Trump directed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in March to seek information about suspected election crimes from state election officials and empowered her to potentially withhold grants and other funds from uncooperative states.

Grassley-led Judiciary Committee advances controversial U.S. attorney picks
Chairman Grassley voted alongside committee Republicans to advance all seven nominations for U.S. attorneys. 
In his opening statement, he referred to all U.S. attorney hopefuls as “highly qualified nominees.”
The committee voted along party lines to advance Pirro, a former Fox News host, to an influential seat as lead federal prosecutor for the District of Columbia. 
This decision was criticized during remarks by ranking member Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, who said: “Ms. Pirro’s fealty to President Trump extends to attacking any lawmaker who is not fully in line with his MAGA agenda, including many members on both sides of the aisle. Ms. Pirro’s record makes it clear that she will prioritize President Trump’s MAGA agenda, not the rule of law nor the Constitution.”
Minority party members Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut voted nay for all seven nominations.
Iowa Democrats criticize early House shutdown
Following tensions over Jeffrey Epstein’s case files, House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, announced legislative operations would be cut short on July 23.
The decision prompted criticism from Iowa Democrats, who released a list of questions for Iowa’s House delegation — stating they “have a lot to answer for.”
The list includes several targeted questions that criticize the delegates’ decision to pass the “big, beautiful bill” and their decision to end the session without addressing Iowa’s struggling economy. 
The group referenced a release from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which “in real, inflation adjusted terms” determined that Iowa’s economy contracted 6.1% in the first quarter of 2025, placing the state’s economy in 49th place overall compared to other states. 
“We’ve had over eight years of Republican rule, and nothing to show for it but farms that are now facing bankruptcy, struggling rural hospitals, and public schools that don’t know if they’ll have the funds to see tomorrow. Iowa needs change, ” said Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart.
Members of Iowa’s all-red federal delegation indicated they were supportive of releasing the Epstein case files but current congressional efforts are being used by Democrats for political gain.
Ernst seeks to ‘clear’ environmental regulations for unnavigable water sources
Ernst introduced a new bill to make permanent exclusions to sources of water that can be regulated by the “Waters Of The United States” rule.
The CLEAR act seeks to permanently ban regulation for “covered water features that do not interact with navigable waters.” A press release from Ernst’s office argued this would clarify that “waste treatment systems, temporary streams from rain, and groundwater are not navigable waterways.”

“WOTUS regulatory uncertainty has threatened the livelihoods of hardworking Iowa farmers, small businesses, and landowners for far too long, and I was thrilled to join EPA Administrator (Lee) Zeldin in announcing that the Trump administration is revising this misguided and harmful regulatory expansion,” Ernst said in the release. “After leading this fight for a decade, I am making it CLEAR that the federal government has no businesses regulating cooling ponds, municipal treatment plants, groundwater, and streams that only flow after rainfall under WOTUS.”
The bill received criticism from Food & Water Watch Legal Director Tarah Heinzen, who commented: “Iowa’s waterways are awash in pesticides and nitrate-laden factory farm waste – and it is one of just two states with increasing cancer rates. We can only achieve clean water and protect public health through commonsense regulation of the state’s largest polluters — industrial agriculture. This bill only takes things backwards. The only thing ‘clear’ from Joni Ernst’s crusade against clean water protections is that she represents the interests of Big Ag, not Iowans.”
Grassley seeks to bolster whistleblower protections
Grassley cosponsored a bill with Sen. Gary Peters, a Democrat from Michigan, to expand whistleblower protections. The act seeks to “close existing loopholes in whistleblower protection law” by clarifying that a nondisclosure agreement or “other conditions of employment” can’t be used to waive whistleblower protections.
“Whistleblowers working for federal contractors and subcontractors shouldn’t face retaliation for sounding the alarm on waste, fraud and abuse. These patriots are critical in safeguarding Americans’ tax dollars,” Grassley said in a press release. “As a long-time advocate for whistleblowers, I’m glad to sponsor this legislation to strengthen protections for whistleblowers and close the loopholes that have allowed retaliation.”
Grassley also called upon the Trump administration Friday to identify federal employees who were terminated after making a protected whistleblower disclosure. In his letter to the Oval Office, he requested that each case be individually reviewed for violations of protected disclosure and to ensure they were not part of the “Reduction in Force initiative.”
 Nunn-led bill to increase financial pressure on Kremlin-linked banks passes committee

The House Financial Services Committee voted to pass Rep. Zach Nunn’s PEACE act to tighten sanctions on foreign banks linked to the ongoing war in Ukraine.
The bill includes mandatory sanctions for banks engaged in transactions with Russian entities, a “sunset clause” to maintain sanctions on Russia’s “destabilizing activities in Ukraine.” The bill also stipulates a “narrow presidential waiver with Congressional oversight to ensure flexibility without undermining enforcement.”
“Words alone won’t stop Putin’s aggression—cutting off the money will,” Nunn stated in a press release. “As a combat veteran and intelligence officer, I’ve seen firsthand how financial pressure can be used to stop violence before it escalates. This bill delivers a clear message: if you’re bankrolling Putin’s war machine, you will pay the price. I’m proud to see it move forward with bipartisan support.”

Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia MercurySpecial tax credits that help people purchase health insurance are set to expire later this year if Congress doesn’t renew them. Virginia lawmakers are planning ahead should the credits lapse and trying to understand the ripple effects the loss would spur in the state.
Federal lawmakers didn’t take action to renew them when passing a reconciliation bill this summer (which will adjust other healthcare affordability measures in the future), leaving state lawmakers wondering how and if they will be able to make up for lost federal assistance. 
Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, sent a letter to Virginia’s insurance commissioner this week asking for an “urgent analysis” of how Virginians would be affected if the credits expire. 
About 400,000 Virginians purchase health insurance through the state’s exchange, and some of those people qualify for and use the enhanced premium tax credits that Congress created in 2021 and extended in 2022. The credits are meant to apply to people that earn between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level. 
Surovell is trying to determine not only how many people might face higher prices and decide to forego health care coverage for themselves if the credits disappear, but also if some insurers might feel inclined to leave the ACA Marketplace. 
This summer, Aetna announced plans to withdraw from the Affordable Care Act marketplace at the end of the year. The ACA marketplace was established by a 15-year-old federal law that allows people without employer-provided health care to purchase their own. Then, associated tax credits help further offset those costs, which is particularly helpful for low or middle-income earners. The Mercury asked if the uncertainty of enhanced premium tax credits’ fate were a factor, but Aetna representatives neither confirmed nor denied.
Certain Aetna health insurance plans leaving the Affordable Care Act marketplace next year

Just as Aetna has let customers know they will need to look elsewhere for coverage in 2026 onward, health care associations caution that people will start considering their options by the fall. 
Multiple associations — including those representing insurance companies —  recently sent a joint letter to members of Congress to try to persuade skeptics or opponents. 
“By October, millions of Americans will be ‘window shopping’ and see the full extent of these soaring premiums for 2026,” the joint letter said. “And already, many of the 24 million people enrolled in the individual market are receiving letters informing them that to maintain their coverage they will need to find hundreds or thousands of dollars in already stretched family budgets.”
While not all of the tax credits will go away in December, it’s the enhanced premium tax credits that reach further to those who need it that are at risk. If Congress lets them expire, credits would revert to pre-2021 levels and fewer people would qualify for them.
Virginia Health Benefit Exchange director Keven Patchett told lawmakers last week that an estimated 100,000 Virginians could fall off their insurance due to the cost. He also estimated that out-of-pocket premiums could rise 30% to 50% in January of next year.  
Representatives for the Exchange further confirmed the 100,000 figure Friday afternoon. The Bureau of Insurance also plans to provide presentations on proposed average changes to rates “as submitted by carriers” for 2026 that will be posted to the State Corporation Commission’s website on Aug. 7.
But loss of health care has consequences beyond the people who lose it, Julian Walker with the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association has also warned. 
In a recent conversation with the Mercury, he explained that people without health insurance are more likely to put off preventative care or seek treatment for conditions until emergencies arise. Emergencies are when costs of treatment also tend to be higher and hospitals must treat patients regardless of their payment or insurance status, per federal law. 
So, they end up absorbing the costs that they then sometimes seek to offset. As hospitals periodically negotiate with private insurers, rates could go up for employers and employees with private health insurance. 
With potential changes or tough choices about health insurance in the near future, Surovell told the Mercury he believes state lawmakers may “need to act on this in the next two months or so.”
Whether that means calling lawmakers back to the Capitol for a special session remains unclear, just like the future of the credits.
With Congress breaking for the summer, federal lawmakers could decide to take action on the credits later this year. The lack of addressing the credits in congress’ recent reconciliation bill could hint at their unlikely renewal, but some Republicans are split on preserving them. 
Virginia Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, was not available for an interview Friday and has yet to make a statement on the possibility of a special session to address the matter. 
There’s also $900 million Virginia has reserved to use as needed. When finalizing state budget amendments earlier this year, Gov. Glenn Youngkin chose to hold onto part of the state’s surplus as “cushion” for federal actions by Congress and President Donald Trump. 
A spokesperson for Youngkin did not follow through by the time of this publication when asked how much of the surplus he suspects the legislature could tap into for health care and if the governor would welcome it. By January next year, however, Virginia will have a new governor who could steer conversations with legislative leaders on how to spend or not spend the surplus. 
In the meantime, Virginia House Health and Human Services committee chair Del. Mark Sickles, D-Fairfax, is watching federal matters closely to see if lawmakers might need to assemble before the year’s end or wait to address things in their 2026 session. 
The idea of a special session is a “maybe,” he shared in a text message. No decision has been made yet by Democrats, who control both Virginia’s House and Senate chambers. 
“I need to find out how much it would cost to replicate recent results or produce something less useful but still worthwhile, ” Sickles said.

(Photo by Ylleana Berryhill/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — State officials on Friday celebrated the 35th anniversary of the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which they said continues to change Oklahomans’ lives for the better.
More than 100 people gathered at the Oklahoma History Center to celebrate the passage of the act and to discuss its impact on their lives and how far the state has come since its passage.
“It truly reshaped our communities, workplaces and public spaces for the better, both in rural and urban areas,” Lt. Gov. Matt Pinnell said. 
The civil rights law, signed by former President George H. W. Bush in 1990, prevents individuals with disabilities from facing discrimination. It mandates that employers must provide equal access to opportunities. It also requires governmental entities and businesses that are open to the public to provide accommodations for people with disabilities.
In 2023, 17% of Oklahomans reported having a disability, according to WHO. 
Nancy Ward, an advocate for disability rights, recalled when the law was first introduced. At the time, she was the self-advocacy coordinator for People First of Nebraska, which focuses on issues impacting disabled residents.
“At the time, the first version of the ADA had been introduced in Congress, but it mostly talked about the rights of people with physical disabilities. I realized that it didn’t really say much about people like me, people who have intellectual disabilities,” Ward said. “I knew we had to do something to change that.”
Ward retired after working for two decades at the Oklahoma Disability Law Center. At the time the law was passed, she said she, as well as a few other advocates, went from office to office in Washington D.C. to share their stories and discuss why the Americans with Disabilities Act was important. She said the act gave people an equal opportunity to live and work in their communities.
“It’s also important to remember that the ADA has always had support from both Republicans and Democrats because anyone can have a disability.” Ward said. “It doesn’t matter what party you’re in.”
Rep. John Pfeiffer, R-Mulhall, said changes were made to his school that impacted not just his brother, who was injured in a car collision, but for generations of students to come. He said the act guarantees everyone has access to the tools they need for success. 
Rep. Ellyn Hefner, D-Oklahoma City, said the federal law “did not just change buildings. It changed lives.” 
She said it gave individuals the opportunity to pursue the American dream, and that the passage of the law showed that “disability rights are not partisan. 
“They are human rights,” she said.",https://oklahomavoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7250135-1024x670.jpg,,,2025-07-25 16:56:39.583847

(Photo courtesy of Avangrid)With Massachusetts toying with the idea of procuring offshore wind energy from Canada, officials in Maine say they are keeping an eye on opportunities across the border as local development has been stalled.
In the first few days of his second term, President Donald Trump hit the breaks on new wind energy development by pausing all new federal permits for on or offshore projects. Just days before, the Maine Governor’s Energy Office released its strategic plan to provide affordable and reliable energy, while also meeting the state’s climate goals. The plan calls for a mix of clean energy sources, but is largely predicated on a goal to develop offshore wind in the Gulf of Maine.
Meanwhile, the latest federal tax bill created another roadblock for the clean energy industry by phasing out the tax credits for solar and wind projects that aren’t in service by the end of 2027.
Like Maine, Massachusetts is trying to shift its power mix to sustainable sources and has a statutory goal to lock in contracts for at least 5,600 megawatts of offshore wind by 2027. It has one project under construction that’s expected to be completed by the end of the year, but it won’t be enough to meet that objective. 
That’s why Massachusetts’s Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs is potentially looking to procure electricity from planned offshore wind farms in Canada — news first reported by Canada’s National Observer last month.
While turning north of the border won’t be without its own challenges, Massachusetts state Sen. Michael Barrett called it a “creative solution” and said he would work to extend the statutory deadline so the state can pursue this route. 
“This becomes a serious possibility for the mid-term and the long-term,” Barrett told CommonWealth Beacon. “It isn’t a short-term substitution for the damage that President Trump is doing to our current offshore wind projects, but there’s a lot of promise here.” 
The Governor’s Energy Office in Maine didn’t dismiss the idea. The office told Maine Morning Star that it is working with New England and Canadian partners to advance shared energy goals. 
“We’re closely tracking the development of offshore wind in Canada and considering how regional efforts may deliver reliable, affordable power, modern infrastructure, and broad economic benefits for Maine,” the office said in a statement Friday. 
Other proponents are divided 
Though Maine faces the same domestic roadblocks from the Trump administration, it has a longer statutory runway than Massachusetts. State law outlines a goal to develop 3,000 megawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2040. 
Given that timeline, Jack Shapiro, climate and clean energy director for the Natural Resources Council of Maine, said it’s probably too early for the state to procure energy from Canadian projects to achieve its offshore wind goals. Building a new industry was always going to require long-term planning and, unlike Massachusetts, Maine’s statutory timeline goes well beyond Trump’s term, he added. 
“We’ve got a long way to go before I think we need to give up on the idea of building an offshore wind industry for Maine, given how much we know about the economic benefits that will come along with that,” Shapiro said. 
Could Canadian offshore wind help meet New England’s climate goals?

Constructing a port to build floating offshore wind platforms could support more than 6,000 jobs during construction and an average of nearly 1,000 jobs annually through 2050 for a total economic benefit to the state of $6.6 billion, according to an economic impact analysis conducted by Karp Strategies on behalf of the Natural Resources Council of Maine. Proponents also say this would provide a new industry to anchor the local economy.
Rather than turn to Canada, Shapiro said the state can use the remainder of the Trump administration to continue researching the budding technology so that when the roadblocks clear it will be ready to keep moving forward on domestic offshore wind projects.  
Alternately, some argue that supporting Canadian projects would allow the industry to continue to advance and innovate so that when the political environment is more favorable, Maine and its workers would benefit. 
Cheyenne Gallivan, communications director for the Maine Labor Climate Council, said if New England states buying offshore wind power from Canada could jumpstart the industry, it’s worth considering. 
“We, of course, want Maine workers to be domestically producing our energy, but at a time when the federal and political environment is not amenable to our development of that homegrown offshore wind, we don’t see working with Canada as something that would hinder,” Gallivan said.
Though Maine workers would more easily benefit from domestic projects, workers who are citizens of tribal nations or members of international labor unions could theoretically work on projects in Canada, noted Grant Provost, business agent for Ironworkers Local 7 and vice president of the Maine AFL-CIO. But he added those dynamics could be complicated by current trade tensions. 
Pointing out that part of northern Maine is already intertwined with the electrical grid in New Brunswick, Provost said strengthening the regional market would benefit everyone.
“It’s better to have an industry move forward in an area so that it can grow to the whole northeast, at the end of the day, as opposed to not having that happen and then starting from scratch again in three and a half, four years,” Provost said.
While the future of Maine’s wind industry is dependent on who next occupies the White House, Gallivan said the next governor of Maine will also need to commit to developing offshore wind. The current governor, Janet Mills, will be termed out by the end of 2026. 
While Democrats in Maine, including Mills, are largely supportive of the state’s energy goals and the development of offshore wind, in particular, Republican legislators wrote a letter to Trump thanking him for his action on offshore wind and asking him to take it a step further by revoking the existing leases and permits in the Gulf of Maine. They argued it puts Maine’s fishing industry at risk, but the lease areas outlined by the federal government already avoid a vital fishing area.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan has raised $3.2 million over the last six months in his independent Michigan gubernatorial campaign, nearly matching the eye-popping fundraising efforts of his biggest potential rival in the Democratic Party and far ahead of his Republican opponents.
Duggan’s campaign on Friday announced that the mayor, who started the year with just $58,000 in his campaign coffers, is now flush with cash. Much of that was raised within the last three months, his campaign said in a news release.
That leaves Duggan with $2.3 million cash on hand with a little more than a year until November 2026.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe mayor was a longtime Democrat who stumped for his party relentlessly before deciding to run as an independent candidate for governor, which has rankled operatives on both sides of the political aisle.
His fundraising announcement came just a day after Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, announced that she has raised $3.5 million within the same period, outpacing all candidates.
But Duggan was still upbeat and grateful for the support he was getting from religious leaders, business groups, and disaffected Democrats and Republicans alike.
“Every place I go, the fundraising crowds are huge, but we started out with a disadvantage of not having party infrastructure,” Duggan said Friday in an interview with Michigan Advance. “We didn’t have a portal to take donations. We were using PayPal at first, we didn’t have a donor list, we didn’t have statewide networks, and it took us three months, basically, to build the infrastructure from scratch. And we raised this $3 million basically in the last three months.”
Duggan said his campaign had 30 fundraisers in 90 days, and that those events saw supporters and interested voters bringing friends and neighbors with them. After hearing him speak, Duggan said those plus-one attendees later hosted events for him, too.
“One after another, it just kept snowballing,” Duggan said. “We’ll have to see what Benson’s numbers look like as far as transfers in and raising when they’re disclosed, but I don’t think anybody predicted that I would outraise all the Republicans and be right there at the top of the list.”
As an independent candidate outside of the two-party framework, Duggan will not have to face an opponent in a grueling primary.
Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II, Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson and former Cape Coral, Fla., Mayor Marni Sawicki are seeking the Democratic nomination for governor.
On the Republican side, U.S. Rep. John James of Shelby Township, former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox, current state Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt and former Michigan House Speaker Tom Leonard are seeking their party’s nomination.
When asked what his fundraising numbers say about his ability to compete with the eventual party nominees, Duggan said his moves and endorsements thus far have been a shock to both parties.
“When 160 African American ministers came out and endorsed me, I know that was a shock to the Democratic Party, and you see in the most recent polls that I’m going to win Detroit by a huge number,” Duggan said, adding that several unions were also lining up behind him. “Then to get the business community in the greater Detroit chamber. We’re building a coalition of people who are just fed up with politics in Lansing.”
Party politics in the Michigan Legislature have ground the institution to a halt, and budget negotiations have hit a brick wall. The Legislature failed to meet its statutory budget deadline of July 1, and as the month comes to a close, a deal is nowhere in sight.
Democrats in the Michigan House and Senate have pointed fingers at Republican House leadership for failing to get a general budget deal done while it focused on road funding with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, and its controversial K-12 and higher education budgets.
Republicans in both chambers have cast blame on their Democratic colleagues for not devising a road funding plan first before passing their education and general government spending plans, which Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) has said was the key setback.
The Senate’s top Democrat in the appropriations process told the Advance this month that it can’t begin to fathom a roads plan until it sees all the Republican cards on the full budget for government spending.
‘I can’t punch air’: budget chasm continues as Michigan Legislature fails to hold session

Adding to the chaos were the defections of some House Republicans, absent during Thursday’s session – in protest of Hall not taking their priorities seriously. The absences prevented the chamber from passing basic policy bills.
A blame game also erupted Thursday over alleged deals that were made – and then broken – to get Democratic votes on those bills before they died on the House floor. A key Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, state Rep. Alabas Farhat of Dearborn, voted no against one of the bills addressing new sentencing guidelines to circumvent the Michigan Supreme Court’s ruling on life without parole sentences for 19- and 20-year-olds. Hall said they had an agreement for Democratic votes, but Farhat said they were just mere discussions.
Either way, the breakdown moved Hall to strip Farhat of his post as minority vice chair of the appropriations committee.
In the aftermath, Duggan said Friday that his campaign was the potential antidote to that mess.
“They can’t get anything done because Republicans and Democrats are so consumed with fighting with each other,” Duggan said. “And whenever they fight with each other, they all send out letters to their donors, saying ‘send me money, I’m fighting with the other side.’ That works for a couple of narrow segments of people, but most people in this state, they actually want problems solved.”
Farhat ousted from key budget post amid GOP standoff and failed Michigan House votes

Derrick Honeyman, a spokesperson for the Michigan Democratic Party, pushed back against Duggan’s fundraising efforts, claiming that the mayor “has always been for sale to the highest bidder, including corporate special interests and big billionaires.”
“Now, Duggan wants to put Michigan up for sale during his ego-driven vanity campaign,” Honeyman said. “From being at the beck and holler of corporate special interests, to courting the support of people like Elon Musk and Andrew Yang, Mike Duggan is only in this race to put himself and his wealthy friends first, not the people of Michigan.”
As for the Republicans in the race, Cox on Friday reported that he’s raised $2.4 million over the last six months with $1.9 million cash on hand.
Nesbitt said he raised $2.3 million with $1.9 million cash on hand.
James, who is facing headwinds from President Donald Trump and Republicans at home to drop out of the race, reported raising $7 million – but two Lansing political news and policy publications have reported that those numbers were off.
Gongwer News Service, a Lansing-based political newsletter, reported that James’ campaign only raised $2.3 million with a $750,000 transfer from his congressional committee.
Bridge Michigan also noted that the $7 million was a culmination of an additional $5 million from the wealthy DeVos family that was given to a political action committee supporting his run for governor.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AMR_0052-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-25 16:56:39.583847

State […],"Louisiana State Police have made a fee for requesting video footage from body and dashboard cameras permanent. (Raymond Clark images)The fee Louisiana State Police charges to the public to provide video footage from body cameras and vehicle dashboards is now permanent after being applied temporarily for the past year. 
The law enforcement agency requires $10 for video recordings 20 minutes or less and 50 cents more for every additional minute beyond that timeframe. State police had been using this fee schedule for a year through an emergency declaration and adopted it permanently through a new government rule published last week. 
The fees also apply to any video footage state police releases from a third-party security camera. 
Body and dashboard camera footage is often sought when law enforcement officers are suspected of wrongdoing, such as using excessive force during an arrest or motor vehicle stop. The videos can also be used to clear an officer of misconduct allegations.

Louisiana State Police reported an uptick in video records requests. In 2024, it received 980 public records requests for body-worn camera footage. The average number of videos per request was four, according to a state financial analysis of the rule. 
State troopers started wearing body cameras in 2017, and the increase in requests followed the release of footage in 2021 that made national headlines when the Associated Press reported on its contents. Those videos taken in 2019 showed troopers beating motorist Ronald Greene and restraining him face down on a Northeast Louisiana roadside. Initially, state police claimed Greene, who was Black, died instantly after hitting a tree during a high-speed car chase. 

The footage made it clear Greene was not dead and, in fact, pleading for mercy from the troopers after the crash. He only went limp and became unresponsive several minutes after the troopers shackled him. 
It’s unclear what state police had been charging the public for its video footage before 2024. Capt. Russell Graham, a spokesman for the agency, said the fees were likely “inconsistent” across the state when asked about the previous rates. 

“There has been an increase in records requests for dashcam and bodycam footage, and this does take a considerable amount of time and effort on the part of our agency,” Graham said in email Thursday. “Personnel have to review every second of every video that is a responsive record.”
Graham said the software used to review the video and to make redactions when required also costs the agency money. 
“While these fees do not recoup all of the funds expended, it was determined to be a reasonable and appropriate amount to defer the costs,” he wrote.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/16087811409_6949ee5840_b.jpg,,,2025-07-25 15:57:01.343359

(NIOSH | Courtesy photo)A mobile unit that provides free black lung screenings to coal miners is up and running again this month after federal cuts led to the service’s pause earlier this year, according to a news release from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The mobile testing unit — run by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health — will be offering screenings in Morgantown next week and in Marion County on Aug. 5. An additional screening event will be held in nearby Maryland on Aug. 27.
Details for the visits are as follows:

8 a.m. – 4:30 p.m. from Tuesday, July 29 to Thursday, July 31 at the National Mine Rescue Association’s Post 5 Mine Rescue Contest at Mylan Park (500 Mylan Park Lane, Morgantown, WV 26501)
8 a.m. – 3:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 5 at the Price Cutter in Mannington (1 Rainbow Plaza, Mannington, WV 26582)
8 a.m. – 3:30 p.m. on Aug. 27 at the Grantsville (Maryland) Volunteer Fire Department (178 Springs Road, Grantsville, MD 21536)

While appointments are recommended, they’re not required.
All coal miners — current and former, and from any part of a mine — are encouraged to take advantage of the free health assessments, which include a black lung screening as well as tests to analyze general lung health. All reports and screenings are confidential.
Assessments will take about 30 minutes per a person and include a work history and respiratory questionnaire, a chest X-ray, a blood pressure screening and a spirometry breathing test.
Those who participate in the screenings should receive results in eight to 10 weeks, per the release. 
These screenings are crucial to helping with the early detection of black lung disease. Earlier detection of black lung allows miners to practice better mitigation, which can help slow the disease from progressing into more complicated and debilitating forms.
There is no cure for black lung. Experts say the best treatment is minimizing exposure to dangerous silica dust.
If miners receive a black lung diagnosis — either from the NIOSH mobile unit or another health care provider — they may qualify to apply for a Part 90 transfer through the federal Coal Mine and Safety Act of 1969. Part 90 transfers allow miners to relocate to a less dusty part of a mine without facing negative consequences like a cut in hours, pay or other retribution from mine operators.
NIOSH is the only entity qualified to certify X-ray results that are submitted as part of a Part 90 transfer request. 
Earlier this year, the federal government made NIOSH a target for cuts through the new Department of Government Efficiency. All employees within the agency’s Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program — which oversees the mobile unit as well as the certification of black lung X-rays — were put on administrative leave in April with permanent firings initially scheduled for June and July.
In late April, a class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of a West Virginia coal miner against the federal Department of Health and Human Services. Harry Wiley, the lead plaintiff on the suit, had been diagnosed with black lung in November 2024. Because of the federal cuts, Wiley was unable to receive a response to his Part 90 transfer request or have his X-ray results certified by NIOSH, leaving him further exposed to silica dust that is known to worsen his condition.
In May, attorneys successfully argued that the federal government’s cuts were in violation of congressionally mandated rights afforded to Wiley and other coal miners in similar situations. 
On May 13, U.S. District Judge Irene Berger issued a preliminary injunction in the class action case that ordered the “full restoration” of services at NIOSH’s Respiratory Health Division, which houses the CWHSP. 
The federal government issued a certification to the federal court on June 2 testifying that employees were back at NIOSH in both the RHD and the CWHSP. At that time, however, more work remained to get the mobile unit back on the road. This month’s screening dates are the first to occur since the federal cuts took place.

Article Summary

U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly, a Matteson Democrat, is running for Illinois’ open U.S. Senate seat, emphasizing accomplishments throughout her career.
It’s the third match-up between Kelly and a candidate backed by Gov. JB Pritzker.
Kelly has more than $2 million in her campaign fund, putting her second in the Democratic primary in fundraising.
Gun violence prevention has been one of her top priorities as a member of Congress and she said she believes Democrats are gaining more support on the issue.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

The Democratic primary for Illinois’ open U.S. Senate seat features three of the state’s most notable Democrats, but U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly isn’t worried big spending or endorsements for her opponents will drown out her voice.
“I’m used to tough races and really I’ve been motored by the people and that’s what it really comes down to,” Kelly told Capitol News Illinois. “I get out there, I grind, I meet everybody I can, and when I am in my position, again, I do the work.”
Kelly was the second Democrat to announce her intentions to replace retiring Sen. Dick Durbin in the 2026 election. She entered the race in early May about two weeks after Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton announced her candidacy that quickly came with endorsements from Gov. JB Pritzker and other Illinois Democrats.
U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi entered the race shortly after Kelly and brought with him more than $21 million in campaign funds to use as of the July fundraising report — nearly 10 times the $2.2 million Kelly has on hand.
Stratton had raised about $1 million but had about $666,000 on hand as of the end of June. Pritzker hasn’t put his full financial might behind Stratton yet, which could boost her fundraising totals and put Kelly up against more financial firepower. Kelly said she believes she can compete regardless of the financial landscape of the primary race.

“I would not have gotten into the race if I didn’t think I would have the resources to win,” Kelly said. “And I’m looking at what I’m doing and what I need to do – yeah they could spend more money, I know that’s a possibility, but again, my races have always been powered by the people.”
She cited recent examples of races around the country where the winning candidate didn’t raise or spend the most money. Kelly previously told voters at an event in Peoria earlier this month that she wants to get money out of campaigns but said in an interview that would have to be done through the legislative process.
Leaning on experience 
Kelly, of Matteson, said her experience at a variety of levels of government sets her apart from her opponents. She also argued her ability to pass legislation is something voters want.
As an elected official, Kelly has represented Illinois’ 2nd Congressional District since 2013 after winning a crowded special election to succeed former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., who resigned from Congress and later went to prison after pleading guilty to fraud charges. Jackson is now reported to be interested in running again for Kelly’s open seat.
Before serving in Congress, Kelly served two terms in the Illinois House before becoming chief of staff to then-Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias in the late 2000s. In 2010, she mounted an unsuccessful campaign to be Giannoulias’ successor, coming up short to Republican Dan Rutherford. After the failed 2010 campaign, Kelly became a top staffer for Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle until she was elected to Congress in the 2013 special election.
Kelly sought to elevate her stature in the Democratic Party of Illinois in 2021 after Mike Madigan resigned his role as party chair. Kelly won an internal party vote for the chairmanship over Chicago Ald. Michelle Harris, who was backed by Pritzker. But the following year, Pritzker-backed Rep. Lisa Hernandez, D-Cicero, successfully ousted Kelly.

“The people in the party, they know me, they know the work that I’ve done,” Kelly previously told Capitol News Illinois following an event in Peoria. “Despite what happened, I’ve still been an effective leader.”
Kelly pointed to her legislative experience, saying “I get things done.”
Gun violence prevention 
Preventing gun violence has been one of Kelly’s top priorities in Congress. She earned national headlines in 2016 when she led a sit-in in the U.S. House alongside late Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., and Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass., to protest the lack of gun restrictions coming out of the Republican-controlled House. Kelly said one of her goals by staging the sit-in was to draw attention to individual lives lost to gun violence beyond headline-grabbing mass shootings.
Nine years after that protest, Kelly believes Democrats have moved the needle of public opinion on gun violence.
“People are hearing the message,” said Kelly, the vice chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. “Yes, gun violence might happen more in some places. But as you see, bullets don’t know zip codes.”
She pointed to the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, a 2022 law designed to quell gun violence through stronger background checks and more mental health services.
“I think people are paying attention,” Kelly said. “We just have to make sure it’s not normalized.”
Kelly does not believe her strong stance on guns would be a deterrent for voters in a statewide election, partly because she already represents one of the most geographically diverse congressional districts in the state. Her district stretches from Chicago’s Hyde Park neighborhood through a narrow stretch of the city along Lake Michigan before picking up the bulk of the district’s population in south suburban Cook and Will counties. From there, the district stretches deep into central Illinois to Danville and Pontiac.
Kelly said she wouldn’t own a gun herself but understands the various reasons why people have one.
“It’s about gun safety. It’s not about taking your gun away,” she said.
Countering Trump
The primary race between the three high-profile Democrats has remained cordial as they have focused their political attacks on Republicans rather than each other. Each has been jockeying to set themselves up as the most vocal critic of the Trump administration.
Read more: Trump’s big bill takes center stage in Illinois’ U.S. Senate race
Democrats will have to work to undo much of Trump’s accomplishments to address voters’ economic concerns if the party takes control of Congress, Kelly said.  
“We will have to spend some time changing what’s already been put into law,” Kelly said.
While Trump sought to capitalize on economic concerns during last year’s election, Kelly said she believes he has lost high ground on the issue.
“He fooled the people since he said he was going to bring down prices on Day 1 while you see in the big, ugly bill that passed he kind of went the opposite way: taking away people’s health care; education is at stake, all those things,” she  said.

(Photo by Mitch Diamond/Getty Images)Utah’s Republican leaders are applauding plans to downsize the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s workforce in Washington, D.C. and send employees to five regional hubs, including one in Salt Lake City.
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox thanked Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins in a post on X Thursday for “choosing Utah as a new (USDA) hub.”
“This move brings the Department closer to the people it serves and strengthens its core mission to support farmers, ranchers, and rural families,” Cox said. “Utah is proud to partner in advancing American agriculture and rural prosperity.”
The department plans to reduce its workforce in the National Capital Region (which includes the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia) from about 4,600 employees to less than 2,000.
In addition to Salt Lake City, it also plans to add workers to regional offices in Raleigh, North Carolina; Kansas City, Missouri; Indianapolis; and Fort Collins, Colorado.The “reorganization,” which is expected to take years, according to a memorandum signed by Rollins, is meant to move the USDA geographically closer to its constituents of farmers, ranchers and foresters, Rollins said in a press release.

“American agriculture feeds, clothes, and fuels this nation and the world, and it is long past time the Department better serve the great and patriotic farmers, ranchers, and producers we are mandated to support,” Rollins said.
“President Trump was elected to make real change in Washington, and we are doing just that by moving our key services outside the beltway and into great American cities across the country,” Rollins added. “We will do so through a transparent and common-sense process that preserves USDA’s critical health and public safety services the American public relies on.”
In response, Democratic members of Congress in the National Capital Region issued a joint statement condemning the move as a “betrayal of American farmers, and an attack on the federal workforce that will severely damage services that the American people depend on.”
“We are disappointed but not surprised that the Trump administration is continuing its attacks on the federal workforce, this time through wasting taxpayer dollars to relocate key USDA facilities,” the joint statement said. “Let us be clear: these haphazard, unlawful relocations do not save taxpayer dollars or improve agency efficiency. We’ve seen this tactic before, and we know that it only results in brain drain, crushed morale, and cuts to vital programs American farmers depend on.”
Republicans, including Utah Sen. Mike Lee, applauded the move.
“The people making decisions about how our forests are managed and our food is grown shouldn’t be distant bureaucrats,” Lee said in a news release, congratulating the department for “decentralizing from Washington and relocating staff to Salt Lake City and other regional hubs.”

“Not only is this a big win for Utah’s farmers and ranchers, but also for our land managers as the department moves closer to the people who live, work, and rely upon these lands,” Lee added.
Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, also thanked Rollins, calling it a “bold move to shift USDA operations out of Washington, D.C., and into the communities they’re meant to serve.”
“This is smart government — more local, more accountable, and a better use of taxpayer dollars,” Schultz said. “Utah is proud to be one of just five new locations selected nationwide.
Schultz added the move will “strengthen our economy, support Utah families and ag producers, and ensure USDA resources are placed where they’re needed most — on the ground, serving our farmers and ranchers.”
“It’s a win for rural communities, for agriculture, and for restoring trust in how government serves the people,” he said.
U.S. Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minnesota — the top Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee — criticized the plan, saying it would diminish the department’s workforce. She also argued Rollins should have consulted with Congress before putting it in place.
Craig also pointed to a move under President Donald Trump’s first administration that shifted the USDA’s Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture out of Washington, D.C., which she said resulted in a “brain drain” in the agencies, as 75% of affected employees quit.
“To expect different results for the rest of USDA is foolish and naive,” Craig said. “Sadly, farmers will pay the price through a reduction in the quality and quantity of service they already receive from the department.”

(File photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman, a longtime member of the ultra-conservative U.S. House Freedom Caucus, is entering the 2026 South Carolina governor’s race.
The eight-year congressman is running to “finally clean up Columbia,” the campaign said in a statement. He plans to advocate for improvements to the state’s roads and schools, as well as term limits for state legislators. All would require the Legislature’s approval. Previous proposals to get legislators to vote term limits on themselves have gone nowhere.
A formal launch event is planned for Sunday in his hometown of Rock Hill.
Norman is by far the wealthiest member of South Carolina’s congressional delegation, according to annual disclosures. Before running for office, he grew his father’s construction business, the Warren Norman Company, into one of the state’s most successful commercial real estate firms.
He has been weighing a bid for the Governor’s Mansion for some time, hinting at a potential run to reporters in October 2023.
Norman, 72, spent about a decade total in the state House before voters elected him in 2017 to represent South Carolina’s 5th Congressional District. Anchored in his home county of York, just south of Charlotte, it stretches from a chunk of Spartanburg County along the state’s border with North Carolina southeast to Sumter County.
First elected to the state House in 2004, Norman gave up the Rock Hill seat in 2006 for an unsuccessful bid to defeat U.S. Rep. John Spratt, a longtime Democrat. Voters returned Norman to the state House in a 2009 special election.
Eight years later, he won a special election to replace former U.S. Rep. Mick Mulvaney, who left Congress when President Donald Trump tapped him to lead the Office of Management and Budget in his first term. After emerging from a seven-way GOP primary, Norman defeated Democrat Archie Parnell, a former Goldman Sachs executive and tax lawyer, with 51% of the vote.
Norman has not faced a primary challenger since that special election.
Two GOP candidates officially enter SC governor’s race

But he joins a crowded field for the 2026 governor’s race. Republicans who have already announced bids over the last month are Attorney General Alan Wilson, state Sen. Josh Kimbrell of Spartanburg County, and Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette.
Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina’s coast 1st District also is considering a bid.
Norman, who’s built a reputation as a fiscal haw, has spent his political career on the fringes, even within his own party. In spring 2022, he helped launch the South Carolina affiliate of the Freedom Caucus in the state House.
In Congress, he sits on the House Budget, Financial Services and Rules Committees. He gained that third committee appointment after working to first block, then supporting, Kevin McCarthy as speaker in 2023.
During his time in the Statehouse, Norman was one of just two House members to vote against a $120 million incentive package for Boeing’s North Charleston expansion in 2013, arguing there was no accountability for how the money would be spent.
Most recently, he joined Freedom Caucus leaders threatening to oppose the massive tax cut and spending bill to fund President Donald Trump’s priorities.

“We need to ensure good policy isn’t poisoned by bad spending,” Norman wrote on social media. “Congress should prioritize fiscal responsibility, transparency, and results. NOT rushed deals.”
Norman also made headlines in 2018, when he pulled out his loaded .38-caliber Smith & Wesson handgun during a meeting with constituents in what he said showed that guns are dangerous only in the hands of criminals. The demonstration brought criticism from even staunch Second Amendment enthusiasts. Despite calls for his resignation and prosecution, Attorney General Wilson declined to press charges.
And three days before former President Joe Biden’s inauguration in 2021, Norman was in the national news for texting former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows calling for martial law to keep Trump in office. “Our LAST HOPE is invoking Marshall Law!!” it read. He also voted against both House attempts to impeach the president during his first term.
But unlike other candidates that have sought to align themselves with Trump, Norman’s relationship with the president has been checkered. Norman’s campaign told The Associated Press he won’t seek the president’s endorsement.
An ally of former Gov. Nikki Haley, Norman was among the few elected officials to back her successful 2010 run for the Governor’s Mansion. He also was the lone member of Congress to endorse Haley over Trump in the 2024 Republican presidential primary, appearing frequently with her on the campaign trail.

Free.,Appeals court affirms nationwide block on birthright citizenship order,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/appeals-court-affirms-nationwide-block-birthright-citizenship-order,,"WASHINGTON —  A federal appeals court dealt a setback for President Donald Trump’s offensive to end birthright citizenship, even after the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the lower courts to avoid overly broad immigration rulings. The decision likely sets the stage for the high court to again hear arguments related to the constitutional right for babies born on U.S. soil.Judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit issued a 2-1 decision late Wednesday declaring Trump’s policy unconstitutional. The ruling upheld a lower court’s nationwide injunction against the controversial order.The original complaint was brought by Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon over the economic hardship states would bear if birthright citizenship was stripped from the Constitution.Writing the majority opinion, Judge Ronald M. Gould affirmed the district court rightly made its ruling nationwide, despite the recent Supreme Court decision.“The district court below concluded that a universal preliminary injunction is necessary to provide the States with complete relief,” Gould wrote. “We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in issuing a universal injunction in order to give the States complete relief.”An injunction covering only the states that challenged the order would be impractical because migrants covered by the order would inevitably move between states, Gould, who was appointed by Democratic former President Bill Clinton, continued, explaining that states would then need to overhaul verification for numerous social safety net programs.“For that reason, the States would suffer the same irreparable harms under a geographically-limited injunction as they would without an injunction,” he wrote.Judge Michael D. Hawkins, also a Clinton appointee, joined the majority opinion.In a dissent, Judge Patrick J. Bumatay, appointed to the bench by Trump in 2019, wrote that courts must be “vigilant in enforcing the limits of our jurisdiction and our power to order relief. Otherwise, we risk entangling ourselves in contentious issues not properly before us and overstepping our bounds.”The U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond for comment.Supreme Court rulingThe decision comes less than two weeks after a district judge in New Hampshire issued a preliminary injunction blocking Trump’s policy to end birthright citizenship and granted a class certification to infants who would be affected by the order.The suit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of immigrants whose babies would be affected by the order shortly after the Supreme Court narrowed lower courts’ abilities to impose nationwide orders.The Supreme Court’s conservative majority issued the 6-3 decision on June 27 after the justices reviewed three cases consolidated into one that brought together plaintiffs from Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin. The District of Columbia and the county and city of San Francisco also joined.The justices ruled that Trump’s directive to end birthright citizenship can go into effect within 30 days of their ruling in all non-plaintiff states.",,,,2025-07-25 15:57:01.343359

The Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act would lift the federal limit on the number of Medicare-funded residency slots, raising the total number by 14,000 over seven years. Arkansas would be among the states the bill prioritizes because of its rural areas, new medical schools such as the Alice L. Walton School of Medicine and hospitals that serve areas designated by the U.S. Health Resources & Services Administration as health professional shortage areas, according to a Thursday news release from Republican U.S. Sen. John Boozman.
The number of residency slots in Arkansas increased from 210 to 356 between 2017 and 2023, but the number of Arkansas medical school graduates outpaced the number of in-state residency slots from 2021 to 2023, according to the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement (ACHI).

Most doctors continue to practice medicine in the state in which they completed their residencies, according to the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC). As of 2021, there are 5.7 active full-time primary care physicians per 10,000 Arkansans, a decrease from 6.0 in 2020, according to ACHI.
“There is an urgent, demonstrated need to strengthen our health care system by combating the alarming shortage of providers, particularly in rural areas,” Boozman, an optometrist from Rogers, said in the news release. “Lifting the outdated cap on residency positions supported by Medicare can expand the supply of physicians while helping ensure access to quality care and treatment in more communities nationwide.”
The AAMC, the National Rural Health Association and the American Medical Association all support the Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act, according to the news release.
“With the nation facing a persistent physician shortage, this bipartisan bill would enhance and build on the investments academic health systems are making to strengthen the physician workforce by increasing Medicare support for physician training,” AAMC President and CEO David Skorton said in the news release.
The bill’s lead sponsors in addition to Boozman are Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat; Sen. Raphael Warnock, a Georgia Democrat; and Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican.
Boozman is also sponsoring the Physicians for Underserved Areas Act, which would change the residency distribution process to give areas where a hospital has recently closed a greater chance of receiving new residents, and the Resident Education Deferred Interest Act, which would allow medical and dental school graduates to pause student loan payments and interest accrual during their residencies. He has introduced both bills in previous sessions of Congress.

Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont and MVP cited a new state law on prescription drugs as one factor in the adjustment downward.  
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont health insurers reduce requests for 2026 premium increases .","After three years of double-digit insurance premium hikes, Vermont’s two health insurers have lowered the percentage increases they are seeking for plans sold on the state insurance marketplace in 2026, citing a new state law on prescription drugs as one big factor.
The state’s health care regulator, the Green Mountain Care Board, reviews the pricing for plans qualified to be sold the following year on Vermont Health Connect, the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace. The board held hearings on the 2026 rate proposals this week for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont and MVP, the only two insurers that sell health insurance plans there. 
Vermonters without access to an affordable health plan through an employer can purchase plans on the individual market for themselves and their families. Businesses with 100 employers or less can buy small group plans. These plans provide health coverage for fewer than 70,000 Vermonters, according to insurer filings with the Green Mountain Care Board. But the trends that lead to price increases for those health insurance plans affect other commercially available plans as well.

Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont lowered its initial request from an average premium rate increase of 23.5% for individual plans down to 15.1%. It amended the requested average premium rate increase for small group plans from 13.5% down to 7.4%.
Facing financial headwinds, Blue Cross has been on the brink of insolvency after a yearslong surge in the cost of insurance claims, ending 2024 with a record deficit of $62 million. 
Double-digit premium rate hikes every year are not sustainable for Vermonters, said Charles Becker, a staff attorney at the Office of the Health Care Advocate, which represents consumers at the rate hearings. That’s especially true when the hikes are “not even enough to keep Vermont’s sole home state insurer solvent given the extraordinarily high cost of care.”
MVP, which sells the large majority of its plans in New York state where the company is based and only 8% of its plans in Vermont, asked for a lower increase in May and revised the request even lower. The company is now requesting an average premium increase of 2.98% for small group plans, down from 7.5%, and of 2.84% for individual plans, down from 6.24%.
MVP’s financial problems have not fully resolved, but the company trimmed administrative costs and is projected to be in the black for 2025 after years of losses for individual plans in Vermont, while still seeing losses from their small group plans, said the carrier’s top actuary Eric Bachner at the rate review hearing.
The reduction in rates for MVP has a “clear and positive impact,” Vermont’s Chief Health Care Advocate Mike Fisher said during the MVP rate hearing. However, the widening divide between the cost of the plans from the marketplace’s two insurers is concerning. 
“A large and growing price variation between the two carriers has a substantial and real negative impact on many Vermonters,” Fisher said at the MVP hearing. 
That’s because federal tax credits that subsidize the purchase of individual health insurance plans on the marketplace, to an amount depending on household income, are set based on lower cost plans, Fisher explained in an interview. If the benchmark for the credits is based on the roughly 3% increase of MVP plans, people on Blue Cross’ plans will likely face higher premium costs due to the disparity in rate increases. 
Meanwhile, expanded tax credits for medium-income households put in place during the Covid-19 pandemic, called Enhanced Premium Tax Credit, are set to expire at the end of 2025 if Congress does not extend them. 
The enhanced subsidy “provided for a really substantial improvement of premium affordability for Vermonters,” Fisher said. He said he is worried about the return of a sharp end to all subsidies above 400% of the federal poverty line — roughly an income of $62,000 for a one-person household — once enhanced tax credits disappear. That may lead some Vermonters just over that line to forgo insurance altogether, he said.
Alongside the phase-out of the Enhanced Premium Tax Credit, Vermont officials project 45,000 Vermonters will lose access to health insurance — both Medicaid and marketplace plans — under new regulatory requirements included in President Donald Trump’s recently signed “One Big Beautiful” tax bill. 
During a public comment period, Grace Powers, 27, said she opted into a Blue Cross insurance plan because the enhanced federal tax credits made it affordable. As a result, Powers said she was able to get surgery necessary to improve her quality of life. 
With the expected sunsetting of the federal enhanced subsidies and the requested rate increases for both Blue Cross and MVP, Powers said she will no longer be able to afford any health insurance plan in Vermont. Her only access to health care will be the emergency room if her “health deteriorates enough to be treated there.” 
“Without insurance, I won’t be able to access primary and preventive care,” Powers said. “I’m urging you to reject these increases because it will make accessing any health care unaffordable for myself, my loved ones and my community.”

‘Bankable savings’
The curtailment of Vermont insurers’ proposed premium rate increases follow a handful of health care bills Gov. Phil Scott signed into law in June. 
Act 55 curbs the amount Vermont’s larger hospitals can charge for outpatient prescription drugs, particularly injection or IV-administered drugs for the treatment of cancers or autoimmune diseases. Act 68 sets forth a long-term plan to transform the health care system, including the implementation of reference-base pricing for health care providers. Act 49 designates emergency authority to the Green Mountain Care Board to set hospital prices in case of insurer insolvency.
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont is able to trim its premium increase request because the Act 55 cap on some prescription drugs will result in a “measurable, bankable set of savings” in 2026, Michael Donofrio, a lawyer for the insurer, said during the hearing. 
Another Blue Cross attorney, Bridget Asay, warned that if the Green Mountain Care Board rejects the rates the company is requesting, it “will not reduce the cost of health care.”
“What it will do is threaten the company’s solvency and ability to serve Vermonters,” she said.
Part of why Blue Cross needs a larger increase than MVP is the insurer’s need to replenish the reserves it uses to pay claims, said the insurer’s Chief Financial Officer Ruth Greene. The company expects to place 7% of premium earnings back into those reserves, she said, calling it a “critical component” of the insurer’s financial recovery plan. 
MVP estimated that just 2% of its premiums would need to be allocated to reserves in 2026 to maintain them.
But for Blue Cross, savings are “dangerously low,” Greene said, noting the insurer took out a $30 million loan at the end of last year from its parent affiliate Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan.
Becker, the consumers’ attorney, said that a large percentage contribution to insurer reserves was “once unthinkable.”
Vermonters should not be “forced to hand over 7% in premiums each year for who knows how many more years in order to rebuild Blue Cross’ depleted reserves and to pay back Michigan,” he said.  
Vermonters ‘need serious relief’
A Vermonter named Melissa from Westfield said in a written comment that her family is insured through a small business plan, and pays over $1,500 a month with a $14,000 deductible. 
When asked by Becker how Melissa’s situation made him feel, Andrew Garland, a Blue Cross vice president, said it was “very upsetting.”
“That’s not what we want for our customers. The cost of care is too high,” Garland said. “We have to find a way to break that cycle and bring it down. It is not affordable.”
In the Blue Cross hearing, Green Mountain Care Board Chair Owen Foster said the state’s health care leaders came together in May for emergency talks about how to address health care affordability concerns, but produced “$0.00 of savings.”
“We have to be accountable to results right now, not just effort,” Foster said. “It’s just not okay to say to Vermonters, ‘We couldn’t come up with anything amongst all these health care leaders. Nothing we could do,’ is not an acceptable answer to Vermont right now.”
The Green Mountain Care Board asked for additional data and analysis from the two insurers as members evaluate the proposed insurance rate increases in the coming weeks. 
The requested hikes for small group and individual plans come after the Green Mountain Care Board approved double digit increases to the baseline for insurance premiums for large employers last month.
Former Blue Cross lobbyist Sara Teachout was appointed to the Green Mountain Care Board by Gov. Scott earlier in July, and is set to start her role July 28. Teachout will not be participating in the 2026 Qualified Health Plan rate review as the companies’ filing were submitted in May and the process started internally in the fall of last year, according to the Board’s Communication and Information Officer Kristen LaJeunesse.
At the close of the Blue Cross hearing, Foster said the board will seek to balance the risks the insurer will face without the proposed premium increases with the interests of Vermonters who “need serious relief.”

Sherman Smith/Kansas ReflectorTOPEKA — A Georgia man who admitted to illegally killing deer in Kansas and featuring the kills on his YouTube hunting show will pay $25,000 in fines and restitution, and is forever banned from hunting in Kansas.
Matt Jennings, 35, reached a plea agreement this week on two charges of violating the federal Lacey Act, which prohibits interstate commerce for wildlife taken in violation of state regulations. He is the host of “The Game,” which streams on YouTube and CarbonTV.
​“HUNTING is all I’ve ever known, to kill to eat… it’s what makes my heart pound and my soul fulfilled,” Jennings says on the show’s website.
According to court documents, Jennings primarily lives in Bowdon, Georgia, and sometimes resides in Woodland, Alabama. He traveled to Kansas in November 2022 with a tag that allowed him to take an antlered deer within a hunting area near WaKeeney in northwest Kansas.
On Nov. 11, 2022, Jennings killed an antlered deer near Florence in the central part of the state, which wasn’t covered by his tag. He drove to Oklahoma the following day to register the kill there, then returned to Kansas.
A week later, he killed another deer near WaKeeney. Although it was in the area allowed under his tag, the second kill violated state law by exceeding the bag limit of one antlered deer per season.
A joint investigation between the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service confirmed Jennings’ movements through phone data and social media posts.
Jennings featured the kills on “The Game,” which the show’s website describes as “a dark, in your face, more serious look at what makes a hunter tick.”
“It’s about pushing one’s self to the breaking point, and then looking back on the experience to learn from it,” the website says. “Matt Jennings takes you to the frontlines weekly to destinations in your backyard or worlds away. Either way, the intensity and drive this man has for the hunt will draw you to him and to what crazy things he will do next.”
Episodes feature him as a skilled bow hunter dressed in camouflage, with black grease around his eyes and cheeks. More than 62,000 users subscribe to the show’s YouTube channel. The most recent episode is from 11 months ago.
Recent comments on the videos berate Jennings.
“Hey Kansan here, stay in Georgia with that Poaching s***,” someone with the username “@Jimmy2toes4u” wrote in a comment on one of the shows. “Bad enough to see all the out of town plates much less guys who think their … ‘hunting show’ gives em the right to do whatever they want.”

Someone with the username “@lifesshort69” commented: “One day your show will flash before your eyes. Make sure your not a poacher and its worth watching.”
Under federal charges, Jennings faced up to a year in prison and as much as a $100,000 fine. Under the plea deal, he will serve five years of unsupervised probation and pay a $10,000 fine. He also will pay $15,000 in restitution to the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks Law Enforcement Fund in Pratt. He has to surrender the two illegally taken deer mounts, and he must retake an Alabama Hunter Education Course.
Jennings is prohibited while on probation from hunting, trapping, fishing or being with anyone engaged in those activities in Nebraska, Missouri, Oklahoma, Colorado, Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois and Minnesota. He agreed to a lifetime hunting and fishing ban in Kansas.
In exchange for the plea, the federal government dismissed a charge from the original complaint and agreed not to file additional charges — unless Jennings denies his illegal activity or engages in additional criminal conduct.
Jennings didn’t immediately respond to Kansas Reflector requests for comment by phone and email.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-25 19:18:14+00:00,CT Mirror,Connecticut forced to ‘ration’ EV rebates ahead of expiring federal tax credits,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/25/ct-electric-vehicle-rebates/,"Consumer rebates for purchases of new EVs and plug-in hybrids will decrease from $1,500 to $500 starting Aug. 1.","A recent spike in demand for electric vehicles ahead of soon-to-expire federal tax credits has led Connecticut to lower some of its own incentives for car buyers, officials said this week.
The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection announced on Thursday that it would lower its standard rebate for purchasers of new EVs and plug-in hybrids from $1,500 to $500, due in part to what officials said was a more than 30% increase in demand for the rebates before federal tax credits expire on Sep. 30.
During a virtual meeting with reporters and public stakeholders Thursday, DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said the sudden spike in demand had forced the agency to begin “rationing” its incentives to ensure the ongoing fiscal health of the Connecticut Hydrogen and Electric Vehicle Purchase Rebate program.
“The budget that we have for the CHEAPR program is finite,” Dykes said. “We’re trying to be good stewards of that money.”
The new, lower standard rebates will take effect Aug. 1. The state’s “Rebate+” incentives, which are available to certain prequalified low- and moderate-income buyers, will remain the same for the time being, DEEP said.
Federal tax credits are expiring as a result of Republicans’ tax and spending plan, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed on July 4. The law ended tax credits of up to $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used vehicles.
While DEEP did not immediately provide data on the number of state rebates that have been requested or approved since the federal law took effect, automakers have been publicly pushing customers to take advantage of the tax credits before they go away.
Tesla — which cannot sell its cars directly to buyers in Connecticut — recently published a banner advertisement on its website about the expiring tax credits, urging customers to “Take Inventory Now.”
The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. 
Barry Kresch, the president of the EV Club of Connecticut, said that while he understood DEEP’s rationale for lowering its incentives, the move comes at a precarious time for the industry. Nationally, EV sales are expected to hit a slump later this year after the expiration of the tax breaks, he said. 
“I’m sad to see the reduction of the incentive, because I think it was effective,” Kresch said. “Hopefully it can come back, depending on how the market looks.” 
The number of EVs in Connecticut has quadrupled since 2020, but still only account for about 2.7 % of registered vehicles in the state. Despite the limits on direct sales, Tesla cars are by far the state’s most popular brand of EVs, followed by Toyota, Jeep and Chevrolet. 
Oliver Johnson, a sales manager at Toyota of Stamford, said his dealership has experienced a slight increase in interest in the automaker’s EV lineup — led by the plug-in hybrid RAV 4 — since the new law went into effect. The dealership typically sells under a dozen EVs a month, he said, meaning the bump resulted in about three to four additional sales. 
Johnson said that customers in the market for EVs are well aware of the deadline. “Everyone knows about it,” he said.
Since launching in 2015, the CHEAPR program has issued more than 21,000 rebates worth over $42 million, according to DEEP. The program is funded through a fee assessed on new vehicle sales and registrations.
This year’s standard rebate was already reduced in January from last year’s maximum of $2,250, due to strong demand. It had previously been set to drop again in August, to $1,000, prior to DEEP’s announcement of further cuts on Thursday. (Rebate+ incentives for new vehicles previously been expected to increase as part of the August changes, before being held flat).
In its announcement on Thursday, DEEP said officials would work with the CHEAPR Board to discuss potentially increasing incentives again to meet demand following the expiration of the federal tax credits in September.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tesla-charging-station-1024x761.jpg,,,2025-07-25 15:57:01.343359

He also will pay $15,000 in restitution to the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks Law Enforcement Fund in Pratt. He has to surrender the two illegally taken deer mounts, and he must retake an Alabama Hunter Education Course.
Jennings is prohibited while on probation from hunting, trapping, fishing or being with anyone engaged in those activities in Nebraska, Missouri, Oklahoma, Colorado, Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois and Minnesota. He agreed to a lifetime hunting and fishing ban in Kansas.
In exchange for the plea, the federal government dismissed a charge from the original complaint and agreed not to file additional charges — unless Jennings denies his illegal activity or engages in additional criminal conduct.

Free.,US Education Department to unfreeze contested K-12 funds,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-education-department-unfreeze-contested-k-12-funds,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said Friday it’ll soon release billions in Education Department funding that has been frozen for weeks, delaying disbursements to K-12 schools throughout the country.The funding — which goes toward migrant education, English-language learning and other programs — was supposed to go out before July 1, but the administration informed schools just one day before that it was instead holding onto $6.8 billion while staff conducted a review. Members of both parties in Congress objected to the move.The Education Department released $1.3 billion for before- and after-school programs as well as summer programs in mid-July, but the rest of the funding remained stalled.Madi Biedermann, a Department of Education spokesperson, wrote in an email to States Newsroom that the White House budget office “has completed its review” of the remaining accounts and “has directed the Department to release all formula funds.”The administration will begin sending that money to school districts next week, Biedermann wrote.Appropriators cheerMaine Republican Sen. Susan Collins, chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, wrote in a statement the “funds are essential to the operation of Maine’s public schools, supporting everything from classroom instruction to adult education.”“I am pleased that following outreach from my colleagues and me, the Administration has agreed to release these highly-anticipated resources,” Collins wrote. “I will continue working to ensure that education funds are delivered without delay so that schools have adequate time to plan their finances for the upcoming school year, allowing students to arrive back to class this fall to properly-funded schools.”Collins and nine other Republican senators wrote a letter to Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought earlier this month asking him to “faithfully implement” the spending law Congress approved in March.“The decision to withhold this funding is contrary to President (Donald) Trump's goal of returning K-12 education to the states,” the GOP senators wrote. “This funding goes directly to states and local school districts, where local leaders decide how this funding is spent, because as we know, local communities know how to best serve students and families.“Withholding this funding denies states and communities the opportunity to pursue localized initiatives to support students and their families.”West Virginia Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, chairwoman of the appropriations subcommittee that funds the Education Department, wrote in a statement released Friday she was glad to see the funding unfrozen.“The programs are ones that enjoy longstanding, bipartisan support like after-school and summer programs that provide learning and enrichment opportunities for school aged children, which also enables their parents to work and contribute to local economies, and programs to support adult learners working to gain employment skills, earn workforce certifications, or transition into postsecondary education,” Capito wrote. “That’s why it’s important we continue to protect and support these programs.”",,,,2025-07-25 15:57:01.343359

(Photo by Mitch Diamond/Getty Images)Utah’s Republican leaders are applauding plans to downsize the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s workforce in Washington, D.C. and send employees to five regional hubs, including one in Salt Lake City. 
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox thanked Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins in a post on X Thursday for “choosing Utah as a new (USDA) hub.”
“This move brings the Department closer to the people it serves and strengthens its core mission to support farmers, ranchers, and rural families,” Cox said. “Utah is proud to partner in advancing American agriculture and rural prosperity.”
The department plans to reduce its workforce in the National Capital Region (which includes the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia) from about 4,600 employees to less than 2,000. 
In addition to Salt Lake City, it also plans to add workers to regional offices in Raleigh, North Carolina; Kansas City, Missouri; Indianapolis; and Fort Collins, Colorado.The “reorganization,” which is expected to take years, according to a memorandum signed by Rollins, is meant to move the USDA geographically closer to its constituents of farmers, ranchers and foresters, Rollins said in a press release.

“American agriculture feeds, clothes, and fuels this nation and the world, and it is long past time the Department better serve the great and patriotic farmers, ranchers, and producers we are mandated to support,” Rollins said. 
“President Trump was elected to make real change in Washington, and we are doing just that by moving our key services outside the beltway and into great American cities across the country,” Rollins added. “We will do so through a transparent and common-sense process that preserves USDA’s critical health and public safety services the American public relies on.”
In response, Democratic members of Congress in the National Capital Region issued a joint statement condemning the move as a “betrayal of American farmers, and an attack on the federal workforce that will severely damage services that the American people depend on.” 
“We are disappointed but not surprised that the Trump administration is continuing its attacks on the federal workforce, this time through wasting taxpayer dollars to relocate key USDA facilities,” the joint statement said. “Let us be clear: these haphazard, unlawful relocations do not save taxpayer dollars or improve agency efficiency. We’ve seen this tactic before, and we know that it only results in brain drain, crushed morale, and cuts to vital programs American farmers depend on.”
Republicans, including Utah Sen. Mike Lee, applauded the move.
“The people making decisions about how our forests are managed and our food is grown shouldn’t be distant bureaucrats,” Lee said in a news release, congratulating the department for “decentralizing from Washington and relocating staff to Salt Lake City and other regional hubs.”

“Not only is this a big win for Utah’s farmers and ranchers, but also for our land managers as the department moves closer to the people who live, work, and rely upon these lands,” Lee added.
Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, also thanked Rollins, calling it a “bold move to shift USDA operations out of Washington, D.C., and into the communities they’re meant to serve.” 
“This is smart government — more local, more accountable, and a better use of taxpayer dollars,” Schultz said. “Utah is proud to be one of just five new locations selected nationwide. 
Schultz added the move will “strengthen our economy, support Utah families and ag producers, and ensure USDA resources are placed where they’re needed most — on the ground, serving our farmers and ranchers.”
“It’s a win for rural communities, for agriculture, and for restoring trust in how government serves the people,” he said. 
U.S. Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minnesota — the top Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee — criticized the plan, saying it would diminish the department’s workforce. She also argued Rollins should have consulted with Congress before putting it in place. 
Craig also pointed to a move under President Donald Trump’s first administration that shifted the USDA’s Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture out of Washington, D.C., which she said resulted in a “brain drain” in the agencies, as 75% of affected employees quit. 
“To expect different results for the rest of USDA is foolish and naive,” Craig said. “Sadly, farmers will pay the price through a reduction in the quality and quantity of service they already receive from the department.”

(Mia Maldonado/Idaho Capital Sun)A federal judge on Thursday extended a temporary legal block that prevents Idaho from verifying the immigration status of people receiving HIV treatment.
U.S. District Judge Amanda Brailsford issued a preliminary injunction, blocking Idaho from enforcing a new state law meant to prevent unauthorized immigrants from accessing public funded assistance. But the block only prevents enforcement for the HIV treatment program called the Ryan White Program. 
The injunction will prevent immigration status checks while the court considers a lawsuit brought by ACLU of Idaho and other legal groups on behalf of an Idaho doctor and immigrant patients. 
The lawsuit argues Idaho’s law would deny immigrants life-saving health care that prevents HIV transmission.
“This ruling saves lives,” Dr. Abby Davids, a doctor suing state officials, said in a statement.

 Ruling only protects HIV program. Other challenges to Idaho’s new law being explored, ACLU attorney previously said

Soon after Idaho’s new law, House Bill 135, took effect July 1, the judge temporarily blocked Idaho officials from applying it to the HIV treatment program in response to a lawsuit by ACLU of Idaho and other legal groups. The judge also provisionally certified class-action status in the lawsuit, extending the protections to any immigrant patients who are or could benefit from the program in the future.
The law cuts the few publicly funded services that unauthorized immigrants can receive in the state. Idaho’s law applies to a range of public benefits, beyond the HIV treatment program. ACLU is considering legal challenges for other programs affected by the law, an ACLU of Idaho attorney previously told the Idaho Capital Sun.
“We are pleased that the Court blocked Idaho officials’ attempts to sidestep federal law and ignore legal precedent,” ACLU of Idaho Staff Attorney Emily Croston said in a statement. “We will continue to fight these unconstitutional attacks on our immigrant neighbors. Immigrant communities form the backbone of Idaho, and they deserve better.”
The Idaho Attorney General’s Office could not be immediately reached for comment.
 Judge finds plaintiffs ‘likely to succeed on the merits’ of federal preemption claim

Attorneys for the ACLU and other legal groups who sued over the law argued Idaho’s new law is preempted by federal law that exempts certain public benefits from immigration status verification. 
In the preliminary injunction order, the judge wrote that the groups “are likely to succeed on the merits of their” preemption claim.
In a court hearing earlier this month, an attorney for the Idaho Attorney General’s Office representing Idaho officials in the lawsuit argued that the suing patients and doctor lacked a right to enforce federal law — and argued that extra eligibility requirements can be added to public benefits.

(Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images for SEIU)Colorado State Treasurer Dave Young’s sister Dorothy has relied heavily on Medicaid “for health care and for life-sustaining support” as she lives with severe cognitive and physical disabilities.
“It really has been a true lifeline for the entire family,” Young said in a press call Thursday. “We have tried to provide care for my sister, and her needs are so demanding, so extreme, that a family by itself can’t manage to make this work. We need help, we need support, we’ve thrown ourselves into this to the extent that we can, but many, many other families are in similar situations.”
Young said that when Medicaid cuts hit Colorado in the past, the state could no longer provide residential care for his sister. She went through 20 different residential facilities in a span of 18 months, all of which were “inadequate” because they did not have proper funding, he said.
“Often, she was ejected from a placement because she overwhelmed the providers, sometimes without even a phone call,” Young said.
Young and financial officials from four other Democratic-led states — including Minnesota State Auditor Julie Blaha — participated in a call hosted by Americans for Responsible Growth, a national advocacy group that works with state financial leaders. They warned about how Republicans’ recent policy law, called by President Donald Trump the “big, beautiful bill,” will negatively affect Medicaid and Medicare recipients ahead of the 60th anniversary of the programs.
The law cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, a state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes.
Dave Wallack, executive director of Americans for Responsible Growth, said that since the Trump administration took office, Republicans have “systematically gutted health care programs, fired thousands of federal workers, and slashed more than a trillion dollars for Medicaid, the largest cut in the program’s history.”
Wallack said the cuts will lead to 17 million Americans losing health care coverage and more than 50,000 preventable deaths annually. Young said in Colorado, more than 375,000 recipients could lose Medicaid coverage. Democratic officials from New Mexico, Illinois, Minnesota and Maryland all said that rural communities in their states will be hit hardest by the cuts, and they will feel the effects first.
Rural hospitals at risk
Laura Montoya, the New Mexico state treasurer, said her state is the No. 1 recipient state for Medicaid in the nation, and 80% of the babies born in New Mexico are born into Medicaid. She said the federal law’s changes to Medicaid will “force hospitals and clinics to either raise premiums or copays or shut down entirely,” and 15 hospitals in rural communities are already at risk of closing their doors.
“Our state’s entire provider network depends on the state’s current Medicaid coverage landscape,” Montoya said. “These cuts will increase health care costs for all New Mexicans regardless of Medicaid enrollment, not to mention more uninsured individuals could end up skipping preventative care leading to worsened health outcomes, higher cost for emergency care, and more crowded emergency rooms and urgent care facilities, placing even more strain on an already overwhelmed system.”
The shift of responsibility for states to fund Medicaid could also destabilize New Mexico’s entire support network, including housing assistance, early childhood education, public safety and economic development, Montoya said. The New Mexico Legislature passed a measure creating a Medicaid trust fund to safeguard services amid federal cuts, she added.
Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs said 44% of the Medicaid recipients in his state are children, 9% are seniors, and 7% are adults with disabilities. Nine rural hospitals in Illinois, all in Republican districts, are at risk of closing because of funding cuts, he said.
“When hospitals close and health care providers cut back, people lose their jobs. They lose their income, and their health insurance,” Frerichs said. “Illinois’ economy will be destabilized. The cruel, inhumane Trump big bad budget bill will wreak havoc across Illinois for years to come.”
Minnesota’s Blaha said about 25% of Minnesotans are enrolled in the state’s Medicaid program, which also supports 30% of births. For Black and Indigenous communities, those numbers are even higher: The state’s medical assistance program covers 80% of Black babies born in the state and 90% of Indigenous babies.
Blaha said it is more cost-efficient to keep people on these health care programs in a stable place, as it’s more expensive “to pull somebody up who’s fallen through.”
“It is time to stand up and tell Congress and tell Trump to roll back these terrible cuts and try to stop the avalanche before it crushes us all,” Blaha said.
Brooke Lierman, the Maryland state comptroller, said 42% of her state’s population is supported by Medicaid or Medicare. She said the two programs were designed to take care of “vulnerable Americans” who would be “sicker and worse off” without the coverage they provide.
“These programs are economic powerhouses that drive prosperity in our communities and strengthen our state’s fiscal foundation,” Lierman said. “Cutting Medicaid is both fiscally reckless and morally bankrupt, abandoning our most vulnerable residents, including our seniors and people with disabilities, while destroying the economic foundation that so many of our communities depend on.”
‘Among the greatest policy achievements’ 
Health care is a “major economic driver” in Colorado, Young said, as hospitals employ about 1 in 5 Colorado residents and generate $1 billion in tax revenue yearly. Reduced federal investment in health care will lead to clinic closures and reduced tax revenue that will affect quality of life for “Coloradans of every age and income bracket,” he said.
“Colorado cannot afford to downsize our health care sector,” Young said. “We’re already facing dire workforce and health care shortages, especially in rural and frontier communities. The state can’t make up for these losses either.”
Medicaid and Medicare are “among the greatest policy achievements in American history,” Young said, as the programs strengthen health care systems and lift people out of poverty. He said the programs can be strengthened while saving money, but “this slash and burn technique” will be “devastating.”
“When people get the care they need, they hold down jobs, they provide for their families and avoid catastrophic medical debt,” Young said.L

(Source: UNC-Asheville) Even as North Carolina’s institutions of higher learning face financial headwinds, the UNC Board of Governors gave the greenlight on Thursday for UNC-Asheville to move to forward with an ambitious, multi-purpose soccer stadium occupying 54 acres of green space.
Thursday’s vote is seen as an initial step allowing UNC-A to enter into a ground lease with the University’s Endowment Fund negotiating with the developer for the mixed-use stadium involving its millennial campus property.
UNC Board of Governors committee chair Kirk Bradley said the board will take whatever time is necessary to ensure critical questions are answered before final approval is given.

“This is a challenging time for higher education and will continue to be so in the 21st century,” said Bradley. “I’m glad we have leaders on our campuses like Chancellor van Noort, who are paying attention to the windshield as to what’s coming and what needs to be done versus focused primarily on the rear-view mirror of how things have always been done.”
Working to woo a professional team
Dr. Kimberly van Noort explained that the Asheville City Soccer Club currently plays at a facility on the school’s campus. The city club is currently U.S.L. Division II, which is the highest amateur level. The team is planning to bring Division I professional soccer to Asheville.
“In order to bring that professional team here, they are required to have a 5,000-seat stadium. And we were approached by the Asheville City Soccer Club about some of our millennial campus projects, and we agreed to allow them to enter into a conversation with us to take a look at the different parcels that we own, because we felt that this would be a very mutually beneficial project,” van Noort told the board.
The UNC-Asheville Endowment Fund would execute a 99-year ground lease with the developer. The project would go well beyond being a professional soccer venue. The stadium will eventually host concerts and festivals and other entertainment events throughout the year.
“It will be the only outdoor facility of this size in western North Carolina, and we anticipate great demand, including from local youth sports organizations and quite probably high school sports as well as this will be a very versatile stadium able to host football as well as soccer,” the chancellor offered.
  Dr. Kimberly van Noort (UNC-BOG videostream/PBSNC)
The project as envisioned would be built in two phases. The first being the stadium, followed by student community housing and retail space. The preliminary budget is estimated at $201.4 million, according to documents shared by UNC-Asheville.
The timeline would see the stadium completed by the end of 2028 with the housing and retail phase opening by the spring of the following year.
Community opposition
Van Noort’s enthusiasm for the project was somewhat tempered by members of the Board of Governors who have heard from nearby homeowners who are angry about the loss of woodlands near their homes.
“This would destroy our neighborhood and our way of life, full stop, no question,” Chris Cotteta, president of the Five Points Neighborhood Association, told the Asheville Watchdog in a June interview. Cotteta believes the project will have a negative impact on residential property values, forcing some to move.
Others have noted the loss of green space would adversely impact biology and environmental science classes that routinely use the wooded property.
Jennifer Haygood, the Senior Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer for the University of North Carolina System, said “guardrails and some basic expectation” would be put in place to ensure the developer bears the risk, should the project continue to move forward.
Board member Gene Davis, a real estate attorney, cautioned his colleagues that long-term leases can be tricky.

“I also want to encourage them to negotiate such that the property, the underlying property that’s being leased by UNC Asheville for this development, is never collateral for any loans. The collateral should be in my view the leases and the improvements but never the land. In short, the land should never be put at risk,” advised Davis.
Even as Bradley sought to move the conversation along, Davis said that it would be critically important that the development partners share UNC Asheville’s commitment to environmental stewardship.
“As chair of buildings and grounds at NC Museum of Art, I participated and led a development that was both beautiful and environmentally responsible in our art park. UNC Asheville should require the same from this development and from this developer, something that is both environmentally responsible and beautiful.”
Board member Sonja Phillips Nichols said she’d like to see the Board of Governors keep tighter control of the project, rather than turn over the lease to the university’s Endowment Fund.

“There’s a part of me that just feels like, ‘okay, so I’m getting ready to give something to someone and then they get to make all the decisions and now it’s out of our hands,'” Nichols said.
Bradley reassured Nichols that the proposal was no different than large scale projects explored by other UNC institutions.
“I am bothered by the amount of emotion that the community is sharing,” Nichols continued. “So, I appreciate that you are meeting with them and that you’re going on what I think needs to be a big deal PR tour and making them feel comfortable about this. I’m feeling the community.”
Bradley acknowledged the stadium project had drawn a fair amount of criticism, based on the unknown.
“I’ve always found that volume and vitriol does not go that far in trying to prove your point. And there are certainly some people that have exceeded that and made some personal attacks that I think are despicable.”
Bradley said the Board of Governors along with UNC-Asheville will study the facts and listen to subject matter expertise and move forward.
A lone voice of opposition
The harshest criticism for stadium project came from Swadesh Chatterjee.
  UNC Board of Governors member Swadesh Chatterjee (Courtesy photo)
Chatterjee who has served on the board the last two years, said he could not understand the rush to move forward with a project, even before the chancellor had the chance to meet with local residents.
“Why can’t we first let the chancellor meet with the community, feel the pulse and calm them down? If we go to the community after we agreed to give it to endowment fund, they think that this [decision] has already been made.”
Chatterjee noted that if student housing was needed, which is phase two of the stadium project, the UNC System could address that need.
UNC-Asheville’s student headcount for the Spring 2025 semester was 2,801, a modest increase from the previous year as the university continues to recover from Hurricane Helene.
Chatterjee said retention should be the university’s focus now. In the five years prior, UNC-Asheville saw a 25% decline in its student body, forcing it to cut more than a dozen programs and majors.
“How is it going to help students and academics?” Chatterjee asked. “I have not seen anywhere by building a soccer stadium that we attract and more students. I am not convinced.”
Chatterjee was the lone member on the Board of Governors to vote against the multi-purpose stadium project on Thursday.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/UNC-A-Stadium-Blueprint-1024x584.jpg,,,2025-07-25 14:56:32.580687

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Funding for more police officers, parking requirements for new housing and penalties for littering.
These are just a few of the issues covered by 333 new Washington state laws set to take effect Sunday. July 27 marks 90 days since the end of the 2025 legislative session in Olympia, when most bills signed by Gov. Bob Ferguson go into force.
A handful of bills became law July 1. Some legislation can take years to go into effect.
Here’s a look at some of the laws on the books starting Sunday.
Clergy
Perhaps the most controversial legislation taking effect Sunday requires religious leaders to report child abuse or neglect, adding them to a list of mandatory reporters that includes school staff, psychologists and many more. 
But a federal judge ruled last week that Catholic priests can’t be mandated to disclose this information if they learn of it in a confession. The ruling came in response to litigation brought by three Catholic bishops over this aspect of the law. The U.S. Justice Department has also waded into the case on the side of the bishops.
For now, the requirement for priests to report suspected abuse or neglect they learn of during confessions is temporarily blocked pending further court proceedings. The rest of the law will take effect.

Police funding
When Ferguson entered office in January, he vowed to only sign a state budget that included $100 million in grants to hire police officers, as Washington ranks last in the country in cops per capita.
House Bill 2015 delivers on that promise, creating the grant program. But a compromise with progressive Democrats will allow the funding to go to more than just bringing aboard more officers.
Peer counselors, behavioral health co-responders, training and other broader public safety efforts are among the other eligible options.
To access the grants, cities and counties need to either implement a new 0.1% sales tax for public safety or have already imposed a similar tax. They also need to follow state model policies as well as collect and report use-of-force data.
The state’s Criminal Justice Training Commission must award the money by June 30, 2028.

Parking
Advocates believe one of the biggest obstacles to building much-needed housing in Washington is local parking requirements that drive up costs and take up valuable space.
A new state law is considered one of the strongest state-level efforts in the nation to relax parking requirements.
Now, cities and counties won’t be able to mandate more than one spot for every two units. They also can’t require builders to include more than one space per single-family home. 
Jurisdictions also can’t force commercial developers to build more than two parking spots per 1,000 square feet.
No parking minimums are allowed for existing buildings converted from nonresidential to residential use, homes under 1,200 square feet, commercial spaces under 3,000 square feet, affordable housing, child care facilities or senior housing. 
The rules don’t affect cities with under 30,000 residents.
Condos
Condominiums can serve as a path into homeownership for first-time buyers. But builders have long shied away from building out of fear of litigation due to the state’s liability laws, seen as overly protective of consumers. 
A new bipartisan law looks to reduce liability risks for developers.
Transit-oriented development
Washington is looking to accelerate the construction of housing near transit, so-called “transit-oriented development.” A new law allows for more dense housing, which Washington desperately needs, while also potentially reducing pollution as more people use buses and rail to commute instead of driving.
The law requires Washington cities to allow housing development near transit.
It also requires 10% of units to be considered affordable and 20% set aside for workforce housing for the next 50 years. The legislation defines affordable as not costing more than 30% of the income for renters who make up 60% of the county’s median income or homeowners who make 80% of the median.
Developers who meet those requirements would get a 20-year multifamily property tax exemption. And they’d get half-off discounts on local impact fees meant to help pay for transportation projects to accommodate the population growth.
While the legislation takes effect Sunday, implementation of the new requirements could come as late as the end of 2029 for cities that updated their comprehensive plans last year. Cities that next revise their plans later than 2024 must follow the new rules within six months of updating. 
Special education
Washington’s public school students will be offered special education services until the end of the school year in which they turn 22 or graduate high school, whichever comes first. The current age limit is 21.
Lawmakers made the change in response to a court ruling from last year that found Washington violated a federal law dealing with how long states must provide “free appropriate public education.”
The Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction estimates 300-1,200 students could benefit from the raised age limit. A fiscal analysis found serving them for an extra year will cost between $6.8 million and $27 million per school year.
Clean fuels
As the federal government steps back from reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Washington wants to double down. 
The state is accelerating its limits on emissions from transportation. By 2038, the state needs to reduce transportation emissions 45% or 55% below 2017 levels. Each year, Washington’s Clean Fuel Standard will now aim for emission drops between 3% and 5%, up from 1% to 1.5%.
The legislation narrowly passed the Legislature amid concerns the change could raise gas prices.
Medical debt
Washingtonians don’t need to worry about medical debt appearing on their credit reports anymore. 
That debt can stop people from getting approved for car or home loans or result in them being denied health care services due to the outstanding bills.
Then-President Joe Biden imposed a similar rule at the federal level, but the Trump administration paused that effort so it never took effect. This week, a federal judge in Texas struck down the federal proposal.
Diapers
One new law looks to increase diaper changing stations. 
The statute now mandates baby diaper changing stations in women’s, men’s, or gender-neutral bathrooms in new public buildings or existing ones that undergo remodels costing $15,000 or more.
Littering 
Washington faces 42% more litter along state roads than the national average, according to a state Department of Ecology report from 2023.
So the state is toughening its littering penalties. A new law raises the punishment from a class three to a class two civil infraction and fines from $50 to $125.
The littering fine applies to amounts up to one cubic foot, or roughly the size of a backpack. 
The fine is in addition to a separate $93 traffic infraction for throwing garbage onto state highways. 
Bail bonds
Lawmakers passed a number of measures this session aimed at protecting immigrants from deportation. 
One stipulates that it is unprofessional conduct for bail bond agents to enforce a civil immigration warrant. The law also prevents agents from sharing immigration information with anyone outside their business. 
Those who violate the law could face disciplinary action from the state Department of Licensing. 
Antitrust
Washington will be the first state in the nation to require companies to notify the state attorney general of a business merger.
Businesses already have to file a premerger notification with the federal government. Attorney General Nick Brown hopes this change will give the state more time to analyze potential anticompetitive consequences from mergers.
The law covers companies based in Washington or that do a certain amount of business here.
“Washington is a trailblazer for the rest of the nation in adopting a premerger notification law,” Brown said in a statement. “This will allow state antitrust enforcers to protect consumer interests in an even more effective way.”
Eid
More than 100,000 Muslims across Washington celebrate Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. Those celebrations are now on the list of the state’s unpaid holidays.
When he signed the bill, Ferguson, the first-term Democratic governor, said Washington is the first state in the country to designate Eid as a state-recognized holiday.
Eid al-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan, and Eid al-Adha the completion of the pilgrimage to Mecca and commemorates the prophet Ibrahim’s willingness to sacrifice his son at God’s request.

Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder (2024 file photo)In a special meeting held Thursday, Georgia’s State Election Board voted to hire Hope Coan, the wife of the board’s former executive director Mike Coan, as a temporary paralegal. 
Coan’s hiring came at the request of James Mills, the new executive director who joined the board in May. He personally requested Coan for the role, citing staff shortages and a high volume of cases before the board. The previous director, Mike Coan, resigned from his role in January according to the AJC.
The three Trump-aligned members of the board — Janelle King, Janice Johnston and Rick Jeffares — voted to approve Hope Coan over the objections of Chairman John Fervier, who raised questions about her fitness for the role. The final vote was 3-0.
“I do not believe this particular individual meets the necessary qualifications for this job and the hiring process itself was improper,” Fervier told the board ahead of Thursday’s vote.
“That is out of order,” Mills replied. 
Democratic appointee Sara Tindall Ghazal abstained from casting a vote, saying she had not been provided “any information whatsoever about any of the candidates” for the role.
The former CEO of Coan Construction, Hope Coan’s LinkedIn page lists her as the current VP of commercial development at a real estate investment firm. Her profile does not list any paralegal experience, and she has not replied to a request for comment.
Hope Coan will replace former paralegal Alexandra Hardin, who has started a new role with the secretary of state’s office.
The board has weathered a number of controversies since the 2020 election, when President Donald Trump falsely stated that the ​​election was stolen from him in Georgia and several other swing states. Since then, the State Election Board has been deluged by conservative activists urging them to overturn Georgia’s 2020 election results, as well as implement sweeping changes they say will boost confidence in the outcome of the elections, including mandatory ballot hand-counts and the elimination of the state’s voting machines.
At a campaign rally last August, Trump highlighted King, Jeffares and Johnston’s efforts, calling them “pitbulls fighting for honesty, transparency, and victory.” The board later attempted to implement a number of last-minute election rule changes heralded by Trump’s supporters that would have, among other things, mandated hand-counts of ballots, expanded poll-watching areas and given election officials greater leeway to delay election certification. However, those changes were invalidated ahead of the 2024 election by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Thomas A. Cox Jr., who said members of the board were illegally usurping legislative authority.
The board’s next meeting is scheduled for July 29.

Frank of the National Park Service). Counties in Montana will receive $46.5 million in federal payments this year to cover a lack of property tax revenue coming from federal lands.
The payments are part of more than $644.8 million that will be distributed to 1,900 state and local governments this year. According to the Association of Montana Counties, this is the largest state payment in the PILT program’s history, a 7.5% increase over 2024.
The Payments in Lieu of Taxes, or PILT, funds are directed toward counties where large tracts of land are administered by federal government agencies and thereby cannot be taxed. Payments are calculated based on population and acreage of federally owned acreage, as well as additional revenue sharing payments allocated to the municipality. The money helps local governments construct public schools and roads. It also helps fund police, firefighting, and search-and-rescue operations.
“The Trump administration is committed to empowering local communities and ensuring that the federal government is a strong partner, not an obstacle,” Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a department press release. “PILT payments support vital services that help rural counties and towns thrive, from public safety to infrastructure and education. We recognize that local governments are the backbone of our nation, and we will continue working to support their efforts to grow local economies and serve their citizens.”
Sixteen Montana counties are slated to receive more than $1 million in federal PILT for 2025.
Flathead County will receive the most —$4,001,549 — for its more than 2.4 million acres of federal land.
Ravalli and Lewis and Clark counties are each slated to receive more than $3.3 million; Missoula, Gallatin and Park counties will receive more than $2 million.
In March, Montana Sen. Steve Daines, a Republican, introduced the “Small County PILT Parity Act” to allow counties with populations under 5,000 to receive increased Payment In Lieu of Taxes (PILT) payments to create parity with larger counties where per capita funding increases as population decreases
“PILT payments are essential for many of Montana’s rural counties, and they provide funding for essential services like emergency response and transportation. I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan bill to bring parity to the PILT program and ensure our rural and low-population counties are treated fairly,” Daines said in a press release at the time.
Daines has previously introduced similar legislation that has not made it through the lawmaking process
Since PILT payments began in 1977, the Interior Department has distributed more than $12.6 billion to states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
The Department collects more than $20.7 billion in revenue annually from commercial activities on public lands. A portion of those revenues is shared with states and counties. The balance is deposited into the U.S. Treasury, which in turn pays for a broad array of federal activities, including PILT payments.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/51355926125_fa9c016e83_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-25 14:56:32.580687

(Amy Dalrymple/North Dakota Monitor)The developer of the Dakota Access Pipeline has asked a North Dakota judge to stop Greenpeace from counter-suing it in the Netherlands.
Energy Transfer says Greenpeace is trying to undermine a March jury verdict that ordered the environmental group to pay the company more than $660 million, finding it responsible for defamation and inciting illegal behavior by anti-pipeline protesters. Greenpeace supported the protests started by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in 2016 against the pipeline’s construction.
Greenpeace denies Energy Transfer’s allegations, and has accused the company of bringing the lawsuit solely out of a desire to punish the environmental group for opposing the pipeline project.
Energy Transfer’s lawsuit is against three Greenpeace entities: Greenpeace International, Greenpeace USA and Greenpeace Fund, its U.S. fundraising arm. Not long before the North Dakota lawsuit went to trial, the Netherlands-based Greenpeace International filed its own lawsuit against Energy Transfer in a Dutch court, arguing Energy Transfer’s legal challenge violated its rights.
Greenpeace seeks reversal of verdict, arguing jury wanted to ‘punish’ someone for pipeline protests

Greenpeace says the case is the first filed under a European Union directive meant to prevent organizations from weaponizing the courts to silence speech they don’t like.
Energy Transfer this week called on Southwest Judicial District Court Judge James Gion to issue an emergency order telling Greenpeace it cannot pursue its lawsuit in the Netherlands as long as the North Dakota case and any appeals are pending.
“This extraordinary measure is necessitated solely by Greenpeace’s bad-faith tactics,” Trey Cox, the lead attorney representing Energy Transfer in the lawsuit, wrote in a Tuesday letter to Gion.
It is “well settled” that American courts can prohibit people under their jurisdiction from suing in other countries, Energy Transfer argued in court records.
Energy Transfer in the filing acknowledged that there are no known instances of a North Dakota court blocking a lawsuit in a foreign country, but added that this doesn’t mean Gion doesn’t have the power to do so.
Stephen Caplow, an attorney representing Greenpeace International in the North Dakota lawsuit, in a Wednesday letter to the judge said Energy Transfer’s allegations about the nature of the Dutch lawsuit lacked any “evidentiary or factual basis.”
He also questioned why the energy company waited until July to request Gion to stop the suit.
“A lawsuit that a party has known about for more than five months is not an ‘emergency,’” Caplow wrote.
He also said Energy Transfer’s court filings make it seem as if all three Greenpeace organizations involved in the North Dakota lawsuit are also parties in the Netherlands case, despite that only Greenpeace International is pursuing the Dutch lawsuit.
 
More Dakota Access Pipeline coverage


Gion has yet to issue a judgment in the North Dakota case. Greenpeace has requested that Gion overturn the jury’s verdict, or at least reduce it. Gion has not yet made a decision on those requests either.
Energy Transfer this week told Gion he should enter a judgment against Greenpeace soon in light of the Dutch lawsuit.
Caplow in his letter said Gion cannot issue a judgment until he sorts out Greenpeace’s motions to throw out or reduce the jury’s verdict. He also wrote the judgment should not be issued “for any reason other than a determination of the merits.”
Greenpeace International will file a more detailed response to Energy Transfer’s motion on Aug. 5, Caplow wrote.
Gion will hear arguments on the motion on Aug. 20.

Santiago/Getty Images).Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.
The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.
Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.
Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.
Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

,DC,2025-07-25 17:45:47+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Former EPA officials say Trump proposal will gut agency’s power to curb emissions,Allison Prang,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/former-epa-officials-say-trump-proposal-will-gut-agencys-power-curb-emissions,,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has submitted a proposal to scrap a years-old finding that greenhouse gas emissions threaten the environment and public health, a move that former agency officials say would gut the EPA’s authority to reduce emissions and is sure to end up in the courts.The EPA sent a draft proposal to the White House late last month calling for scrapping what’s referred to as the endangerment finding on top of vehicle emissions standards for certain cars and trucks. The White House Office of Management and Budget could finish reviewing the draft on Monday and some expect an announcement on the issue the last week of July, Joe Goffman, a former assistant administrator for the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation, said in an interview.Former EPA officials say such a move would gut the agency’s own power to curb greenhouse gas emissions, which have been widely found to cause global warming.“It'll be the most decisive step taken to make the agency totally irrelevant, which then will become an excuse to just get rid of it,” Christine Todd Whitman, the EPA administrator from 2001 to 2003 under President George W. Bush, said in a phone interview.Whitman said she thinks “the long-term goal of all of this is to ensure that the agency can't do regulations.”‘Suffocating its own authority’The EPA finalized what it is known as the endangerment finding in late 2009. It said that greenhouse gases are a threat to both the environment and public health and that emissions from vehicles pollute the air with greenhouse gases. The finding is what obligates the EPA to address greenhouse gas emissions, Goffman said.“Essentially what the EPA is doing is suffocating its own authority under the Clean Air Act…to establish programs and rules to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” said Goffman, who worked at the EPA during the administrations of Democratic Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama.“They’re making it impossible to take steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions” in a deliberate fashion, he said.EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced back in March that the agency was going to reconsider the finding.Its proposal — which was submitted to the executive branch’s Office of Management and Budget on June 30 — will be shared for public comment following interagency review and after Zeldin has signed it, an EPA spokesperson said Thursday in an email.The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment.Court fight aheadThe Trump administration’s moves to scrap the finding and vehicle emissions standards are its latest plays to dial back U.S. climate policy and efforts to fight climate change.President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans scaled back support for renewable energy projects and other climate policies in the budget reconciliation bill signed into law July 4.Trump also signed executive orders during his first days back in office to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement again and to aid fossil fuel production.The EPA said the endangerment finding went beyond the agency’s statutory authority under the Clean Air Act, according to a summary of part of the proposal that was sent to the White House.The Clean Air Act “does not authorize the EPA to prescribe emission standards to address global climate change concerns,” an executive summary of the proposal sent to the White House states, according to an excerpt obtained by States Newsroom.Because of that, the agency is proposing rescinding “the Administrator's findings that GHG emissions from new motor vehicles and engines contribute to air pollution which may endanger public health or welfare,” it said.The agency in its proposal also raises a key 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision in the case of Massachusetts v. EPA that determined the EPA is allowed to regulate greenhouse gases as part of the Clean Air Act because they pollute the air.The EPA argued that the decision doesn’t support how the agency has carried out the Clean Air Act. On top of that, the agency says that the “EPA unreasonably analyzed the scientific record” and that “developments cast significant doubt on the reliability of the findings.”Similar to numerous other executive actions taken by the Trump administration, Whitman and Goffman said they expect this latest move will end up in the courts.“This is the beginning of a long, long saga,” Goffman said.",,,,2025-07-25 13:57:19.419402

Jeff Landry was eager to get the word out this week, welcoming General Motors Insurance to Louisiana in a news release.

Jeff Landry. (Greg LaRose/LAI; Getty Images)Gov. Jeff Landry was eager to get the word out this week, welcoming General Motors Insurance to Louisiana in a news release. The governor described the occasion as “a new milestone in affordable, consumer-focused auto coverage for the state’s drivers.”
“General Motors Insurance coming to Louisiana is a testament to the work we accomplished this legislative session to bring about real insurance reform,” Landry said.
Later in the day, Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple rained on Landry’s parade, noting in his own statement that General Motors Insurance has been doing business in Louisiana since 2006. 
Late last year, GM Insurance submitted a new product to the Louisiana Department of Insurance for its customary review, Temple said. That review took place in February, and the state gave its approval in March. The product became available this month.
There’s clearly more than a dispute over semantics happening between the governor and insurance commissioner. Both Republicans have spent the past several months at odds over how to bring down Louisiana’s auto and home insurance rates. There’s actually common ground between the two in terms of their policy stances, but politics has overshadowed their efforts to curb what’s become an economic development crisis for the state. 
In his statement on General Motors, Landry noted the announcement came just weeks after he signed “the largest tort reform package into law.” Temple largely concurred with the governor’s review, calling it “a handful of great legal reform bills.”
It will be months, if not years, before the true impact of Landry’s legislative package can be ascertained. More salient factors affecting the cost of insurance are out of his control, including how soon Louisiana – or any U.S. locale, for that matter – faces another catastrophic weather event. Poor transportation infrastructure is another issue that won’t change overnight.
Landry can count at least one insurance-related win so far on the legislative front. Against Temple’s wishes, the governor pushed through Act 11, which gives the insurance commissioner  the power to strike down any insurance rate increase considered “excessive” or unreasonably high. That decision can take place without a public hearing to review whether market competition factors should be considered.
Critics of the legislation say what seems like a measure that would favor Temple is actually a move by the governor to potentially place blame on the insurance commissioner if Louisiana doesn’t see an appreciable drop in insurance rates. Temple has said it could also create the impression that he makes rate-increase decisions as political favors, to speak nothing of the message it would send other insurers.
Speaking of which, the way the governor ended his news release could give some the impression he’s giving more than just a friendly welcome to General Motors Insurance. 
It’s common that government agencies provide basic information about a company when making an economic development-related announcement. These details are typically a quick backstory about the business and its presence in the state. 
For General Motors Insurance, Landry’s statement gets into selling points for its coverage, including its “in-vehicle technology … to offer personalized rates based on safe driving habits. “Safer drivers can earn lower premiums along with benefits like accident forgiveness and deductible waivers,” the statement continues, noting that the company offers third-party coverage options for homeowners and renters, “making it easier for Louisianians to bundle and save.” The governor’s office also provided a website link to GM Insurance “to learn more or get a quote.”   
None of this instills great confidence that the governor has made insurance affordability his highest priority. The same goes for the policy changes he and Temple ushered through the legislature. More insurance competition is certainly welcome in Louisiana, but it’s far too soon for either official to claim any wins based on new policy changes while the paint on them is still drying.  
Until lower coverage prices – and not politics – make the news, let’s hope our state leaders don’t pull a muscle trying to pat themselves on the back.

(Courtesy of Sioux Falls School District)I didn’t speak English in kindergarten. I didn’t even start learning it until first grade. And I didn’t really get it until second grade, when I met Mrs. Cavanaugh.
Every week, she would pull three of us out of class — a Vietnamese refugee (me), an Iraqi refugee, and a classmate whose parents had just opened a Mexican restaurant — and bring us into a little room with a round table. That’s where I learned what English could do. Not just how to use it, but how to love it.
That’s where I learned that my family had survived war, and that my classmate’s family had fled violence, too. That’s where we learned to listen to each other’s stories, and feel less alone in our own.
It’s hard to explain how much that meant, but I know what it gave me: everything.
Federal funding uncertainty risks destroying adult education programs in SD, directors say

I eventually transferred to Catholic school, where I got straight A’s, won essay contests, read my writing aloud to rooms full of parishioners, and even had some haikus published in a national anthology. We didn’t have the money to buy the book, so I never told my teacher I couldn’t share it with my mom. She was always working. She learned English the way a lot of immigrants do: on the job, because they can’t afford to take a class.
By sixth grade, I gave the class commencement speech. Same thing in eighth grade. In high school, I competed at nationals for speech and became editor of the paper. My senior year superlative was “most likely to be president,” even though I was one of the few who could never be.
All of that started in a small room at Anne Sullivan Elementary. It started with a public school teacher who saw us, and gave us the tools to see ourselves.
That’s why it hurts to see lawmakers work to dismantle the federal Department of Education and freeze billions in funding meant for schools like mine. The department doesn’t dictate curriculum. What it actually does is distribute federal support for low-income students, multilingual learners, special education services, and civil rights protections in schools. These programs exist so that kids like me can find their footing.
After nationwide outcry, the department recently released a portion of the frozen funds, roughly $1.3 billion, targeted specifically at after-school and summer learning programs. That’s an important step, especially for working families who rely on these programs for safe, enriching environments outside of regular classroom hours. But more than $5 billion in other critical education funding remains on hold. That includes support for teacher training, English language services, migrant education, adult literacy and student enrichment programs — resources that help kids thrive during the school day, not just after.
Here in the Sioux Falls School District, the impact is still unfolding. Of the anticipated $3.5 million shortfall, only about $250,000 has been restored so far — enough to support after-school tutoring. Core staffing plans will remain in place this year, but some non-staff initiatives like professional development, supplemental programs and contracted services have been paused. While English learner support staff will continue, the district says further program expansion may be limited without additional funding. Special education and mental health services aren’t directly impacted by the freeze, but flexible funding that could have enhanced or expanded those supports has been lost — for now. The district, like many others, is still waiting for additional guidance from the state and federal government.

I wouldn’t be here without that support. And I worry deeply for the kids who won’t get what I got. The kids who won’t have a Mrs. Cavanaugh. The kids who will never find their way to the words that could change their lives.
And even worse than the cuts is the silence. The silence from leaders who know better. Who know that children like me can thrive when they’re cared for, but choose to look the other way. I’ve spent years ghostwriting for admirable leaders. But lately I’ve started to wonder what good that’s done if they’re quiet now — if they won’t fight for what saved me, and eventually benefitted them.
Children aren’t resources to be groomed. They’re not workers-in-waiting. They’re not numbers in a cost-benefit analysis. They’re kids. And if they feel loved and respected, they’ll pay that forward a hundred times over. I’m proof of that and I am far from alone.
I don’t know where my classmates from that little roundtable ended up. But if I had to bet, I’d bet long on them. Just like I’d bet on that quiet 6-year-old me.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Central Iowa Water Works is phasing out of its first-ever lawn watering ban, which has been in place since June 12 on account of sustained high nitrate levels in source water rivers. 
A comparison of nitrate levels in the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers, which feed plants in the CIWW system, shows nitrate levels were elevated nearly 40 more days in 2025 than in 2024. 
Utilities must keep nitrate concentration levels below 10 milligrams per liter to remain compliant with safe drinking water standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This becomes difficult to fulfill when both demand on the system and nitrate concentrations in the source water are high. 
 


Tami Madsen, CIWW’s executive director, said there are many factors that make 2025 worse, in terms of dealing with nitrate, than 2024. In addition to sustained, elevated levels in the rivers, the infiltration gallery at the Des Moines Water Works’ Fleur Treatment Plant has also been elevated. The infiltration gallery is a series of underground pipes that collects alluvial ground water through more than three miles in Water Works Park.
Beginning around June 8, 2025, all three of these sources were above 10 mg/L, meaning the plant couldn’t pull from less concentrated sources to dilute the higher concentrations. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Voluntary and then mandatory lawn watering bans were issued to significantly reduce demand on the system. The reduced demand meant CIWW facilities could process enough water within the federal limits to remain compliant. 
Voluntary water restrictions were issued last summer as well, which along with dropping concentrations in the Des Moines River by early July, relieved the system. 
Madsen said the system this year was also stressed because the timing of the nitrate peaks coincided with lawn watering season, which represents up to 40 million gallons of demand per day.
 


“This year is different from any other year in that all three of our water sources at the Fleur Drive Plant – the Raccoon River, the Des Moines River, and the infiltration gallery, were significantly higher than 10mg/L for 33 days between June 8 to July 15,” Madsen said. “This coincides with the time frame that water uses typically increases for the summer season.”
Finished water leaving the treatment plants has remained within the federal safe drinking water standards, or below 10 mg/L. High-nitrate water can lead to shortness of breath and blue-baby syndrome if consumed by infants. 
Some environmental groups and research however, hold that this standard might be outdated and that adverse health outcomes can occur from continued consumption of water with nitrate concentrations below the federal limit. They argue there are links to cancers, pre-term deliveries or birth defects.  
Water output from the L.D. McMullen Water Treatment Plant had finished water with concentrations above 5 mg/L from March 31, 2024, until July 25, 2024. The highest concentration during that more than 117 day period was 8.6 mg/L and the average was about 7.1 mg/L.
Finished water concentrations stretched higher than 5 mg/L in 2025 at the L.D. McMullen plant beginning March 15, 2025 and have not yet dropped below that mark. Since March 15, the average level has been 7.2 mg/L.








At the Fleur plant, nitrate concentrations remained above 5 mg/L from April 4, 2024 through July 29, 2024. The plant had a total of 117 days during the spring and summer with outputs higher than 5 mg/L and a high during the period of  8.97 mg/L. The average during the period was 7.48 mg/L.



According to Melissa Walker with Central Iowa Water Works, the nitrate removal facility ran for 68 days in 2024. As of Thursday, the removal facility has been running for 97 days in 2025. 
The database for Des Moines Water Works does not log river data every day so there are fewer data points for the rivers compared to output from the facilities. 
In 2024, the Raccoon River was above 10 mg/L for 64 days during the March-August time frame. 
Levels rose above 10 mg/L on March 29, 2024, and remained above 10 mg/L, with periodic dips no lower than 7 mg/L until July 15, 2024. The average concentration in the river during this time period was 12.98 mg/L and the highest recorded concentration was 18.2 mg/L. 
The Des Moines River did not have concentrations above 10 mg/l until April 29, 2024, though levels fluctuated from about 5 mg/L to 9 mg/L for the early part of April. In total, the Des Moines River had 41 days with concentrations above 10 mg/L. 
During this time of elevated levels, the average concentration was 12.79, and the highest concentration measured 15.56 mg/L.
 


In 2025, levels in the Raccoon River first rose above 10 mg/L March 25 and remained above the federal limit through July 18, with 16 days during the period where levels dipped between 6 and 9 mg/L following significant rain events. 
During the 91 day period of elevation, the average level was 12.82 mg/L with a maximum of 19.39 mg/L. 
Nitrate levels in the Des Moines River didn’t jump above 10 mg/L until April 10 this year. Levels remained elevated above 10 mg/L until July 18, aside from periodic drops to around 8 mg/L following significant rain events. 
The maximum recorded concentration in the Des Moines River was 16.6 mg/L this year and the average concentration during the 80-day period was 11.9 mg/L. There were 12 days during the period of elevation where levels dipped below 10 mg/L. 
CIWW started the phased-in end to the lawn watering ban on Tuesday, following sustained downward trends in the source water nitrate concentrations. Under the phased-in approach, even numbered houses can water their lawns Sundays, Wednesdays and Fridays and odd numbered houses can water on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)Union County’s manager said officials will not permit the county jail to be used for immigrant detention, ending months of speculation and community concern that the largely shuttered property would be sold to a for-profit prison company for immigration enforcement.
County Manager Edward Oatman said officials never intended such a use when in March they authorized a request for proposals to repurpose the old jail. They merely aimed to evaluate potential uses for the property, he added.
“While one inquiry did reference the possibility of detention-related use, we quickly recognized that such a direction would not align with Union County’s values,” Oatman said in a Thursday statement. “Given the troubling reports we’ve seen nationwide about ICE detaining not only individuals with criminal charges, but also everyday people simply trying to build better lives, we cannot support any outcome that risks putting people in jeopardy. This process was never about immigration detention, and we remain firmly opposed to any such use.”
County officials closed most operations at the 1,000-bed jail in 2021, and it is now primarily used as a temporary holding facility for arrestees who are quickly transferred to other jails. In March, Oatman said demolishing it would cost tens of millions of dollars, and repurposing it could cost millions per floor, so officials opted to sell and hoped a request for proposals would draw a diverse group of bidders from a variety of industries.
Since it became clear the jail would be sold, the county has received several informal inquiries “with a wide range of ideas coming in from various sectors,” including one inquiry for “detention-related use,” Oatman said. But the request for proposals hasn’t been finalized or issued, so the county hasn’t received any formal proposals, he added.
Oatman vowed to prioritize transparency, public input, and residents’ long-term needs in deciding the jail’s fate.
“As County Manager, I have a duty to pursue opportunities that serve the best interests of Union County — financially, socially, and morally,” he said. “We are continuing with the RFP process, but we want to be absolutely clear: the RFP will include language that prohibits any use of the site as a private detention facility, such as an ICE facility, immigration detention center, or similar operation. Those uses are off the table.”
The announcement comes as the Trump administration’s budget for immigration enforcement has ballooned and immigration raids have ramped up across New Jersey and the nation. The budget bill President Donald Trump recently signed included $45 billion to build new immigration jails and hire 10,000 new immigration enforcement agents. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have historically targeted New Jersey for enforcement, with more than 32,000 arrests out of ICE’s Newark field office between October 2020 and December 2024, according to ICE statistics.
Oatman’s announcement also came two days after a federal appeals court ruled that New Jersey cannot ban private companies from contracting with the federal government to detain immigrants — a major blow to the state’s efforts to limit immigration detention here.
Immigration advocates celebrated Oatman’s announcement, cheering the community pressure that he saluted in his statement. Advocates and county residents have held multiple rallies, packed the commissioners’ meetings, and testified against using the jail for immigrant detention, instead urging officials to invest in housing, mental health services, and community infrastructure.
Make the Road New Jersey applauded Union County and other public officials around New Jersey for standing up to federal efforts to expand immigration enforcement.
“It is important to note that what remains unchanged is the state of New Jersey’s ability to prevent its subdivisions from allowing their facilities to be used for immigration detention,” the group said in a statement.

When Kumar Bhavanasi purchased the historic Deposit Guaranty Building and adjacent Pinnacle Building in downtown Jackson recently, it affirmed a message of optimism that many of us have been communicating for a while.
In the two high-rise structures, Bhavanasi, a developer from New Jersey, saw the vast potential of Mississippi’s central business district and burgeoning residential neighborhood. It mirrored  the vision of Jackson residents and many others across the state who see the potential lying in wait. In so many ways, our downtown is an artist’s canvas, just beginning to be painted.
“There is something beautiful about a blank canvas,” an author wrote. “It’s the paint that changes its meaning and the hand that creates the story. Every piece begins the same, but in the end they are uniquely different.”

Downtown is, indeed, different from any other place — in Jackson, in Mississippi and in the nation.  Two hundred years of history have helped make it so.  We are a center of government, a business hub, a political seat, a residential quarter, an arts and  entertainment venue and a gathering place. Downtown Jackson is the capital of Mississippi, a title that is not likely to ever change.
Given all that, the question of whether to put every effort into making downtown better than it’s ever been over two centuries has already been answered. The wheels to make that happen — to transform downtown into a paragon — already are moving. And now it’s augmented by fresh, imaginative leadership at City Hall.
Consider: 

Safety, once an issue here, has been dramatically improved with the expansion of Capitol police in downtown. With a new headquarters near the state Capitol, more patrols and greater communication with businesses and residents, these officers have sent a message that downtown will be secure. With our new mayor now in office, we expect that to improve even more with the help of Jackson police. Citizen confidence is our goal, and we will bolster that further with additional security measures to be announced soon.


Residential space, which has transformed many downtowns in neighboring states, is being expanded in Jackson to accommodate the increasing numbers of people who see our downtown as a unique and safe place to live and work. That includes developer Bhavanasi’s planned apartments for the 18-story Deposit Guaranty Building with its beautiful early 20th century architecture. Currently, about 700 people call downtown home. With more residents will come more ancillary businesses such as a grocery store, new restaurants and entertainment sites. We are a growing neighborhood in the center of Jackson. 


New quality-of-life projects to enhance our capital district and truly make it “Mississippi’s Downtown” are moving quickly. Construction of a new state park just north of the historic Old Capitol Building and overlooking our renowned Two Mississippi Museums is underway. Meanwhile, major improvements are being planned for Smith Park, one of the oldest city parks in America and a jewel in the heart of downtown. A few blocks away, construction is wrapping up on Jackson’s all-new, state-of-the-art planetarium, which is expected to attract residents from across the state and beyond. And Thalia Mara Hall, home to the International Ballet Competition, will soon re-open its doors with more improvements as the district’s arts anchor. 

These are just a few of the efforts and projects underway to make downtown Jackson a reflection of  who we are as Mississippians.
For me, it’s been a 35-year commitment to this city that led to Downtown Jackson Partners as its new president. The sense of pride and ownership in Jackson that I feel is something I want to encourage and cultivate in others. Our future rides on an expectation that we will thrive.
A vibrant capital city is tantamount to a dynamic state. Downtown is at the heart of it all. Downtown belongs to each of us. Downtown is our canvas to paint.

Amid recent political rhetoric about rising crime and violence in American cities, a new analysis shows that violent crime has continued to decline this year.
Homicides and several other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, dropped during the first half of 2025 across 42 U.S. cities, continuing a downward trend that began in 2022, according to a new crime trends report released Thursday by the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
Homicides fell 17% in the first half of 2025, compared with the same period in 2024, among the 30 cities that reported homicide data, according to the report.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
During that same period, five cities saw increases in homicide — ranging from 6% in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to 39% in Little Rock, Arkansas.
While the report’s authors say the continued drop in violent crime — especially homicides — is encouraging, they note that much of the decline stems from a few major cities with historically high rates, such as Baltimore and St. Louis.
More than half of the cities studied have higher homicide rates than before the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, though, the analysis found that there were 14% fewer homicides during the first half of 2025 compared to the same period in 2019.
The authors say more research is needed before crediting any specific policy or practice for the continued drop in violent crime.
The group’s findings come as President Donald Trump continues to amplify concerns about crime, at times citing misleading statistics and narratives.

In a Truth Social post earlier this week, Trump claimed that cashless bail — a practice that allows people charged with a crime to be released pretrial without paying money, unless a judge deems them a threat to public safety — were fueling a national crime surge and endangering law enforcement.
He wrote: “Crime in American Cities started to significantly rise when they went to CASHLESS BAIL. The WORST criminals are flooding our streets and endangering even our great law enforcement officers. It is a complete disaster, and must be ended, IMMEDIATELY!”
Some research suggests that setting money bail isn’t effective in ensuring court appearances or improving public safety. Opponents of ending cash bail often raise concerns that released suspects might commit new, potentially more serious crimes. While that is possible in individual cases, studies show that eliminating cash bail does not lead to a widespread increase in crime.
The Truth Social post also marked a sharp shift from Trump’s remarks during a June roundtable with the Fraternal Order of Police, where he claimed the national murder rate had “plummeted by 28%” since he took office — a figure that overstates the decline and overlooks the fact that murder rates began falling well before he returned to office.
According to data consulting firm AH Datalytics, which manages the Real-Time Crime Index — a free tool that collects crime data from more than 400 law enforcement agencies nationwide — the number of homicides between January and May 2025 was 20.3% lower than the same period in 2024.
Similarly, data released in May by the Major Cities Chiefs Association showed that homicides fell roughly 20% in the first quarter of 2025 compared with the first three months of the prior year. The group’s data is based on a survey of 68 major metropolitan police departments nationwide.
Researchers at the Council on Criminal Justice note in their report that it’s difficult to pinpoint a single reason for the drop in homicides, but they note that fewer people appear to be exposed to high-risk situations, such as robberies.
Most major crimes fell in the first half of 2025 compared with the same period last year, according to the council’s report.
Motor vehicle thefts dropped by 25%, while reported gun assaults fell 21%. Robberies, residential and non-residential burglaries, shoplifting, and aggravated and sexual assaults also saw double-digit declines
Drug offenses held steady, while domestic violence reports rose slightly — by about 3%. Carjackings declined 24% and larcenies were down 5%.
Compared with the first half of 2019, before the pandemic and nationwide reckoning over racial justice and policing, overall homicides are down 14%, robberies by 30%, and sexual assaults by 28%.
Still, more than 60% of the cities in the council’s study sample report homicide rates that remain above 2019 levels.
Motor vehicle theft remains the only crime tracked in the report that is still elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels — up 25% since 2019 — although it has declined sharply since 2023.
The council also released another analysis on the lethality of violent crime, showing that while violent incidents have decreased, the share of violence that ends in death has increased significantly. In 1994, there were 2 homicides per 1,000 assaults and about 16 per 1,000 robberies. By 2020, those figures rose to 7.2 and 55.8, respectively.

(Photo by Ken Castro/Rhode Island Current)The Mount Hope Bridge has secured a $17 million federal grant to upgrade its aging cables, the Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority (RITBA) confirmed this week.
The funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation allows RITBA to move forward with a dehumidification project aimed at reducing corrosion on the supports of the 96-year-old bridge connecting Bristol and Portsmouth over Mount Hope Bay.
They’re upgrades RITBA Executive’s Director Lori Caron Silveira called “essential.”
“Dehumidifying the Mount Hope Bridge cables and anchorages is essential to arresting the corrosion of the individual wires in the cables and we are excited to bring this technology to our nearly 100-year-old bridge,” Silveira said in a statement. “We are confident that it will help to extend the life of this landmark by 50 to 75 years.”
The money for the project comes as RITBA prepares to temporarily close the bridge for four days next month for a $1 million repaving operation.
The Mount Hope Bridge funding was announced by Rhode Island’s U.S. Senate delegation in April 2024, but whether the state would actually receive that money was in doubt after President Donald Trump froze the grant not long after taking office to make sure all federal spending aligned with his new administration’s priorities.
“It is about time that the Trump Administration released its unnecessary hold on these already awarded funds,” U.S. Sen. Jack Reed said in a statement.
The multi-year dehumidification project will also draw from a $10 million Congressional Directed Spending allocation.
When dehumidification is slated to begin it is still up in the air. RITBA spokesperson Cara Cromwell said officials are in the midst of reviewing the three bids the agency received after closing its request for proposals on June 6.
Last year, RIBTA conducted cable air flow testing on the bridge, which Cromwell said was done by Kiewit Infrastructure Company at a cost of more than $1.26 million.

Ned Lamont said Friday he has scheduled a vote next week by the State Bond Commission on $155 million in borrowing to deliver the modest and temporary electric-rate relief authorized last month by the General Assembly.
Based on early estimates from the industry and governor’s office, most consumers could see savings between $4 and $10 based on usage and other factors in the monthly bills beginning in September.
The borrowing is an element of the omnibus Senate Bill 4 energy legislation passed with overwhelming support last month. It would offset a portion of the public benefits charge in monthly bills.
The public benefits charge is a levy on ratepayers for programs that, among other things, provide financial assistance for low-income customers and encourage energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives.
It also contributes to the cost of providing a stable rate for the carbon-free power generated by the Millstone nuclear plant. The cost of generating power is largely set by a competitive market dominated by natural gas-fired plants, which currently is cheaper than nuclear.
“Using state bond funding as a means of reducing public benefits charges is one action we can take to provide some savings on consumers’ electric bills, but I must stress that this is only one step in the effort to make energy rates more affordable and we need to do more to address the actual costs of generating and delivering electricity,” Lamont said in a statement.
Connecticut and other northeastern states, which sit at the end of natural gas pipelines, have the highest electric rates in the continental U.S. Since the deregulation of power generation, state regulators and the two major utilities have limited control over rates.
Regulators set the portion of the bill covering the distribution of electricity to homes and businesses, which includes the costs of maintaining and modernizing the infrastructure owned by Eversource and United Illuminating.
The high cost of electricity, the reliability of its generation and delivery, the adequacy of supply and the oversight by state regulators all have been elements of legislative and administration efforts toward reforms since 2020.
Subsidizing the public benefits charges comes as other factors are driving down costs, notably reductions in supply rates of 13% for Eversource and 14% for United Illumination, effective July 1. Rate adjustments approved in May by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority also cut the public benefits charge.
Of the $155 million in bonding to be approved by the Bond Commission on Aug. 1, $125 million will reduce costs associated with hardship programs for low-income customers and $30 million will be used to reduce the costs associated with the electric vehicle charging program.
Another round of state borrowing expected in 2026 would enable the savings to continue into at least the first several months of 2027, the governor’s office said.
Republicans initially had sought a much more expansive and energy package that would have cost roughly $1 billion a year to eliminate the public benefits charge entirely. But the votes for SB 4 were nearly unanimous: 144-3 in the House, and 34-1 in the Senate.
In a statement issued quickly after Lamont’s announcement Friday, Senate Republicans said gutting the public benefits charge remans their goal: “Merely reducing the hidden public benefits tax is not nearly enough. Republicans will continue pushing to totally eliminate those public benefits charges from electric bills.”
Lamont noted the bipartisan support for SB 4 and promised efforts to lower prices will continue: “I am encouraged that we can continue this cooperative effort and develop policies that will produce additional savings for consumers.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Utility_Lines-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-25 12:56:51.441736
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-25 16:29:16+00:00,CT Mirror,Document gives glimpse into CT negotiations on H.B. 5002 changes,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/25/ct-hb-5002-changes-negotiations/,A draft document shows early negotiations on a new version of CT House Bill 5002 go beyond talk of fair share and parking regulation changes.,"Early negotiations on a new version of an omnibus housing bill have touched on more than many advocates expected and far beyond the controversial zoning and parking measures noted by Gov. Ned Lamont as concerns when he vetoed last session’s version earlier this summer, a legislative document obtained by The Connecticut Mirror shows.
After initially saying he’d sign House Bill 5002, Democratic lawmakers’ key housing bill, Lamont vetoed it under pressure from Republicans and town leaders who feared the bill weakened local control and imposed one-size-fits-all solutions on municipalities. After the veto, lawmakers and the governor’s office began negotiating a new bill for a special session in the fall.
In negotiations on major bills, there are often several drafts of legislation. The CT Mirror obtained a June 30 analysis from the Office of Legislative Research of one of those drafts. The document offers a rare look at conversations occurring in these closed-door negotiations.
Publicly, Lamont has cited as concerns a portion of the bill known as “fair share” that would have required towns to plan and zone for a set number of units and a measure to eliminate off-street parking requirements for smaller residential developments. 
But the document shows ideas for changes have ranged beyond those pieces to include changes to sections to encourage more housing development around train and bus stations, conversion of commercial buildings to residential and one of the state’s foremost housing laws, 8-30g.
Lawmakers said the conversation has evolved far past the June document, and that it doesn’t reflect more current drafts. House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said he didn’t want to get into specifics of the current negotiations.
“It was part of conversations that were going on and ideas that were being thrown out there,” Rojas said of the document. “Some of it still might be kind of part of our conversation, some of it not.”
“This was a point-in-time document, and I don’t feel like it’s reflective of where we are,” Rojas said. “This is far more complicated than where we are right now in terms of the major items that we’re focused on, that we continue to exchange language on.”
Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, said he and Rojas are “on the same page,” on policy.
“We’re at a high level right now, and we’re working through some issues, but I don’t want to go too far into what we’re talking about right now,” Duff said.
Lamont met earlier this week with policy leaders from the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities to discuss solutions to the state’s housing crisis, and his staff has seen the document.
The original bill aimed to address rising housing costs that have become unaffordable for much of the state’s population. Connecticut has not built enough housing over the past several years, which has resulted in a lack of supply amid high demand.
Housing experts have tied much of this lack of supply to restrictive local zoning that makes it hard to build multifamily housing on much of Connecticut’s land.
Where fair share and a policy to encourage transit-oriented development known as “Work, Live, Ride,” were once fairly separate, the June 30 document discusses tying them together through a new system of awarding municipalities points if they take steps to build more housing.
There would be one point each for five criteria, including transit-oriented development and adopting “priority housing development” zones. The idea, like others in the document, has been proposed in the past, Rojas said.
“People are taking ideas that have been considered in the past and seeing if they might work in this situation,” he said.
In H.B. 5002, Work, Live, Ride prioritized certain infrastructure funding for towns that prioritized transit-oriented development.
Rojas said the idea was to respond to criticism that there were too many options for towns in the bill.
“Is there a way to ensure that all the products, all the parts, can work together better than perhaps some other people otherwise think they will?” he said.
The proposal also includes changes to the fair share portion. Towns would be responsible to plan and zone for a quarter of their allotted number of units of housing in the first 10 years of planning. Previously, it had been every five years.
Towns could appeal their assignments, and the document says the draft would “substantially change” that process, although the details aren’t clear.
H.B. 5002 would have removed minimum parking requirements for residential developments of less than 24 units. Negotiations have included an idea to allow towns to impose parking requirements on a case-by-case basis in village districts, historic districts or rural conservation areas.
The bill that was vetoed also would have allowed the conversion of commercial properties into middle housing, or apartments with two to nine units, without a special hearing before the local zoning commission.
The June document suggests continuing that, but making the developments subject to a “summary review process” done by the town that can consider whether the property conforms with regulations around lot size, how much of the building’s side faces the public street and how far the building is set back from the road.
For each of these middle housing developments, and mixed-use developments, meaning buildings that incorporate both housing and places of business, towns would also have easier pathways to moratoriums under 8-30g.
That law offers developers court remedies if towns deny their affordable housing proposals and means the towns must prove in court that they turned down the housing because of a reason of health or safety. Towns are exempt if at least 10% of their housing is designated affordable, and can get moratoriums on the law if they show they are making progress toward that 10%.
The early draft also would allow the summary review process for turning nursing homes into housing, marking a change to an existing law. Democrats passed a bill in 2024 that required towns to allow developers to turn nursing homes into housing without needing a change to zoning law.
“We want to get something done and move housing policy forward,” Duff said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lamont-Veto-0623-DE-014-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-25 12:56:51.441736

The Connecticut Capitol served as a backdrop, framed by tents, picnic tables, and rows of folding chairs. Some people nodded along quietly, holding their fresh squeezed lemonade. Others danced from side to side, making Sunday’s event feel like a neighborhood party featuring world class musicians.

“There’s people from different economic backgrounds, from different racial backgrounds, different religious backgrounds, all sitting together, enjoying the music, and that’s one of the beauties of something in a public space like Bushnell Park, where everybody’s just equals there,” said Chuck Obuchowski, WWUH jazz radio announcer and broadcaster of the festival for more than 30 years.
Last weekend, Bushnell Park welcomed almost 70,000 spectators to enjoy live music performed by local, national and international artists. 
For more than three decades, the Greater Hartford Festival of Jazz has offered not just a concert series to the city, but also an open egalitarian space: free, outdoors and welcoming to all. 
The first festival, held in July 1991, was dedicated to the 25th anniversary of Paul Brown’s Monday night jazz series, the longest running free jazz concert series in the United States. The series, which is still held each summer, runs until Aug. 11 this year.

A festival that feels like home
The festival has grown to be the largest free jazz event in New England, and a world-class event that Hartford residents can enjoy right in the green heart of the city.
Hartford resident Brendan Alexander, who lives in the city’s North End, has attended the festival since he was a child. Now at 18 years old, he sees it as a reflection of Hartford’s culture.
“To me, people and the culture in Hartford, is like the best thing that we have, because everybody connects and supports each other,” Alexander said.
Internationally recognized jazz vocalist and composer, Michelle Coltrane, 65, the stepdaughter of the famous jazz saxophonist John Coltrane, performed at the festival for the first time this year. Michelle Coltrane, accustomed to large venues like the Hollywood Bowl, loved Bushnell Park’s neighborly vibe and multigenerational audience.

“It’s important to have these outdoor venues that have a very broad mix of [music]… having the kids come and the older people like, ‘Yeah, I know that song from 50 years ago,’” Coltrane said. 
Steven Thomas has been volunteering for three years at the festival. A blues artist, poet, bass guitar player and North End native, Thomas sees the festival as an equitable space for locals.
“Man, it’s really important. I mean, the rich guys, they got country clubs they could go to…with stuff like this we all get together,” said Thomas. “Hartford needs this.”

The people who make it happen
Thomas is one of many Hartford-based volunteer staff members that make the festival happen. Some, like Thomas, perform in local bands. For others, like security staff member Valerie Taylor, the event is a vehicle for belonging and memories.
Taylor’s mother, who used to be a jazz singer, took her for the first time to the festival when she was a middle school student living in Southwest Hartford. Now, at 69 years old, she enjoys the backstage chaos and the community that make this event happen. 
“To see all the people and the families from when I grew up, a lot of them were out in the audience, and my high school buddies were here, it’s amazing.”
Alvin Carter, stage and festival production manager, Hartford native and band leader, believes jazz is still a force shaping the city’s social and cultural heartbeat.
“People have been saying jazz is dying for decades. It’s not dying. It’s just not as well funded as it used to be,” Carter said.

Music as a binder in hard times
The festival is powered by the steady commitment of local residents who see music as more than entertainment.
Maurice Robertson, Hartford Jazz Society board member, jazz photographer, and 49-year volunteer radio announcer at WWUH, looks at the jazz scene in Hartford as a continuum and events like the festival as the social glue for people.
“These are opportunities for people to have joy, to break bread with each other, and to be neighborly, the music inspires and unifies, rallies us,” Robertson said. “These are very difficult times, so these free concert opportunities help folks to transcend some of the negativity that is constant.”

Even as crowds filled the park, staff members walked across the audience with donation buckets. The festival is free to the public but not free to run, something Charles Christie, president of the Greater Hartford Festival of Jazz, knows well.
Christie looks forward to getting a paid executive director position so next generations get motivated to keep the festival going.
Having organized events like the jazz festival and the Keney Park family day for almost 30 years, Christie has a passion for the city of Hartford, for music and bringing people together.

(Margaret Mellott/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Emporia State University President Ken Hush announced his retirement Thursday, nodding at past and future challenges in higher education.
Hush, an Emporia State graduate, wrote in an email to alumni, staff and students that his last day will be Dec. 17. He plans to stay involved, he said.
“For more than a decade, higher education has faced significant challenges and pressure to change – this will not only continue but will increase in the future,” he wrote. “There will be winners and losers. Those who are able to adjust will survive; those who don’t won’t… without additional funding.”
Hush’s tenure lasted around four years, beginning in late 2021. He served those early months as interim president. Not long after the Kansas Board of Regents officially named Hush as Emporia State’s 18th president in June 2022, the university fired 30 tenured or tenure-track professors to cut costs. Hush signed the professors’ termination letters while offering bonuses to others.
Eleven of the fired professors sued Hush and others in 2023 in federal court.
Before he worked as a university president, Hush was a business executive who worked in top-level positions at Koch Minerals and Carbon. He has two daughters, both of whom live in Michigan. He graduated from Emporia State in 1982, majoring in business administration and marketing and playing on the nationally-ranked men’s tennis team.
During Hush’s tenure, Emporia State faced declining enrollment and increasing demand for online courses, which he said “created outdated organizations, inefficiencies and waste which caused deficits and financial instability for institutions across the nation.”
However, the university has turned a corner, Hush said. He called the past few years “the most transformative era” in the university’s history.
Enrollment increased 16% at Emporia State last year, and the university was the only one in the state that has not raised tuition in the past two years.
“We established a unique mentality and have completely changed our culture from the top down and from the bottom up,” he said. “Our leadership team has been re-educated and now operates from a lens of data, analysis, financial responsibility and accountability.”
Hush touted bringing in $30 million to correct a $19 million budget deficit, creating an organization that is “fiscally clean, operationally efficient and organizationally sound.” On two occasions, the Kansas Legislature earmarked millions for Emporia State: $9 million in 2023 and another $9 million in 2024.

(Getty Images)Only about one in four New Mexico students are proficient in math, according to a Legislative Education Study Committee brief presented to members Thursday.
Members of the LESC met in Las Vegas this week on the New Mexico Highlands University campus. Thursday’s agenda included the topic of math proficiency in the state, which has remained steadily low. LESC Deputy Director Jessica Hathaway pointed out to lawmakers that this trend of low math proficiency in New Mexico is also evident across the country.
According to the brief, U.S. students’ math performance declined “significantly” between 2018 and 2022, while reading and science scores remained steady. The brief cites the Program for International Student Assessment, an assessment conducted internationally every three years that measures reading, math and science literacy of 15-year-olds. 
The U.S. placed 26th out of 81 in the 2022 assessment, the most recently conducted, while the country placed sixth in reading and 10th in science. 
“Math proficiency peaks in fifth grade in New Mexico, where we see a 32% proficiency rate. But you also see this line drop right after that point,” Hathaway said during the meeting. “By the end of middle school, in eighth grade, we see a 19% proficiency rate across all student groups. And by 11th grade, we see a 12% proficiency rate across all student groups.”
Hathaway detailed how other states in the country have started to address their own math systems through legislation and practice. Common threads include universal math screening at early ages to catch dyscalculia and other possible learning difficulties; intervention plans for at-risk students; high-quality learning materials; professional development and teacher preparation programs; and improving parent engagement.
She also pointed out that several of these components were included in Senate Bill 235, introduced by Sen. Bill Soules (D-Las Cruces) during the recent session; however, the bill died in committee. At the time, the bill was described as a similar approach to math as structured literacy is to reading. 
Sen. Gabriel Ramos (R-Silver City) asked whether there is a program or method of education for math that would mimic structured literacy. The LESC brief noted that there is not a universal “science of math” program.
“What we’re seeing is that states are actually having to create those training programs, so that’s what we mean whenever we say there’s not a clean science of math,” Hathaway said. “That being said, one part I do want to pull out is that there is a very, very substantial body of research about effective math instruction that can inform policy.”
The brief provided a list of recommendations for the state Legislature, the New Mexico Public Education Department, teacher preparation programs and school districts, which include the state codifying expectations for math instruction, screening and intervention; the PED revising teacher licensure requirements; preparation programs requiring math methods coursework for all licensure pathways; and districts investing in math coaches or interventionists and engaging parents as partners in students’ learning. 
Soules, a former math teacher and chair of the LESC, said he was encouraged by the end of the discussion Thursday, “because it’s not something we dig into as we’re very, very focused on the reading side of things.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/kidmathGettyImages-80357061-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-07-25 12:56:51.441736

As many as 27% of US Forest Service jobs remain vacant as of July 17, according to a Pro Publica analysis.
Despite the Trump administration’s public pronouncements that it has hired enough wildland firefighters, documents obtained by ProPublica show a high vacancy rate, as well as internal concern among top officials as more than 1 million acres burn across 10 states.


This story was originally published by ProPublica.

	
Less than a month ago, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced that the Trump administration had done a historically good job preparing the nation for the summer fire season. “We are on track to meet and potentially exceed our firefighting hiring goals,” said Rollins, during an address to Western governors. Rollins oversees the wildland firefighting workforce at the U.S. Forest Service, a subagency of the Department of Agriculture. Rollins had noted in her remarks that the administration had exempted firefighters from a federal hiring freeze, and she claimed that the administration was outdoing its predecessor: “We have reached 96% of our hiring goal, far outpacing the rate of hiring and onboarding over the past three years and in the previous administration.”
Since then, the Forest Service’s assertions have gotten even more optimistic: The agency now claims it has reached 99% of its firefighting hiring goal.
But according to internal data obtained by ProPublica, Rollins’ characterization is dangerously misleading. She omitted a wave of resignations from the agency this spring and that many senior management positions remain vacant. Layoffs by the Department of Government Efficiency, voluntary deferred resignations and early retirements have severely hampered the wildland firefighting force. According to the internal national data, which has not been previously reported, more than 4,500 Forest Service firefighting jobs — as many as 27% — remained vacant as of July 17. A Forest Service employee who is familiar with the data said it comes from administrators who input staffing information into a computer tool used to create organization charts. The employee said that while the data could contain inaccuracies in certain forests, it broadly reflects the agency’s desired staffing levels. The employee said the data showing “active” unfilled positions was “current and up-to-date for last week.”
The Department of Agriculture disputes that assessment, but the figures are supported by anecdotal accounts from wildland firefighters in New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, California and Wyoming. According to a recent survey by Forest Service fire managers in California, 26% of engine captain positions and 42% of engineer positions were vacant. A veteran Forest Service firefighter in California characterized the Trump administration’s current estimate of the size of its firefighting workforce as “grossly inaccurate.”
Last week, Tom Schultz, the chief of the Forest Service, circulated a letter to high-ranking officials in the agency that underscored the dire moment. “As expected, the 2025 Fire Year is proving to be extremely challenging,” wrote Schultz in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by ProPublica. “We know the demand for resources outpaces their availability.” Schultz at once directed staff to employ full suppression — stomping out fires as quickly as possible, instead of letting them burn for the sake of landscape management — and acknowledged that the resources necessary to pursue such an aggressive strategy were lacking. All options were on the table, he wrote, including directing human-resources employees to fight fires and asking recently departed employees with firefighting qualifications to return to work.
When asked about the discrepancy between Schultz’s memo and Rollins’ public statements on firefighting staffing at the Forest Service, an agency spokesperson said that Schultz was referring to employees who can be called on to bolster the agency’s response “as fire activity increases,” while Rollins was pointing only to full-time firefighters. “The Forest Service remains fully equipped and operationally ready to protect people and communities from wildfire,” the spokesperson said, noting that “many individuals that have separated from the Agency either through retirements or voluntary resignations still possess active wildland fire qualifications and are making themselves available to support fire response operations.”
The federal government employs thousands of wildland firefighters, but the precise number is opaque. Throughout the Department of the Interior, which is overseen by Secretary Doug Burgum, there are about 5,800 wildland firefighters in four agencies that have been impacted by cuts. An employee at a national park in Colorado that is threatened by wildfire said that they were “severely understaffed during the Biden administration on most fronts, and now it’s so much worse than it’s ever been.”
But the Forest Service is by far the largest employer of wildland firefighters, and it has long used gymnastic arithmetic to paint an optimistic picture of its staffing. Last summer, ProPublica reported that the Forest Service under President Joe Biden had overstated its capacity. Robert Kuhn, a former Forest Service official who between 2009 and 2011 co-authored an assessment of the agency’s personnel needs, recently said that the practice of selectively counting firefighters dates back years. “What the public needs to understand is, that is just a very small number of what is needed every summer,” he said. Riva Duncan, a retired Forest Service fire chief and the vice president of Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, a labor advocacy organization, said staffing is a constant frustration for managers on the ground. “We have engines that are completely unstaffed,” said Duncan, who remains active in wildland firefighting, having worked in temporary roles this summer. “We have vacant positions in management.”
That said, there is a difference this fire season from years past. Officials in the previous administration publicly acknowledged the danger presented by an exodus of experienced wildland firefighters. The Trump administration has taken a different approach — claiming to have solved the problem while simultaneously exacerbating it. When asked about the staffing cuts, Anna Kelly, a White House deputy press secretary, wrote, “President Trump is proud of all Secretary Rollins has accomplished to improve forest management, including by ending the 2001 Roadless Rule for stronger fire prevention, and Secretary Burgum’s great work protecting our nation’s treasured public lands.”
In March, Congress finally codified a permanent raise for federal wildland firefighters via the appropriations process, a change that advocates have sought for years. In her remarks in June, Rollins credited the president: “Out of gratitude for the selfless service of our Forest Service firefighters, President Trump permanently increased the pay for our federal wildland firefighters.”
But in February, the Trump administration laid off about 700 employees who support wildland fire operations, from human-resource managers to ecologists and trail-crew workers. Those employees possess what are known as red cards — certifications that allow them to work on fire crews. Many were subsequently rehired, but the administration then pushed Forest Service employees to accept deferred resignations and early retirements.
Last month, President Donald Trump issued an executive order directing the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior to combine their firefighting forces. For the moment, it’s unknown what form that restructuring will take, but many Forest Service firefighters are anticipating further staffing cuts. A spokesperson for the Department of the Interior wrote, “We are taking steps to unify federal wildfire programs to streamline bureaucracy.”
Administration officials have maintained that employees primarily assigned to wildland fire were exempted from the resignation offers this spring. But according to another internal data set obtained by ProPublica, of the more than 4,000 Forest Service employees who accepted deferred resignations and early retirements, approximately 1,600 had red cards. (A spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture wrote that the actual number was 1,400, adding that 85 of them “have decided to return for the season.”)
Even those figures don’t account for all the lost institutional knowledge. The departures included meteorologists who provided long-range forecasts, allowing fire managers to decide where to deploy crews. One of the meteorologists who left was Charles Maxwell, who had for more than 20 years interpreted weather models predicting summer monsoons at the Southwest Coordination Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, an interagency office. The thunderstorms can fuel wildfire, with lightning and wind, and extinguish them, with great rains. Lately, according to Maxwell, the monsoons have become less and less reliable, and understanding their nuances can be challenging. Maxwell said that he’d already been planning to retire next year. But he also said he “was concerned with the degree of chaos, the potential degradation of services and what would happen to my job.”
Maxwell noted that his work had been covered by knowledgeable fill-ins from out of state. But another firefighter who worked on blazes in New Mexico said that Maxwell’s understanding of the monsoon had been missed. A spokesperson for the Department of the Interior, which oversees the interagency office where Maxwell worked, wrote, “We do not comment on personnel matters.”
The monsoon season is now here and has brought deadly flash flooding along old burn scars in Ruidoso, New Mexico, while distributing sporadic rain in the state’s Gila National Forest.
It is shaping up to be a severe fire season. On Monday, federal firefighters reported 86 new fires across the West; by Tuesday, there were 105 more. And there’s already been some criticism of the federal response. Arizona’s governor and members of Congress have called for an investigation into the Park Service’s handling of a blaze this month that leveled a historic lodge on the Grand Canyon’s North Rim. Last month, Rollins acknowledged, “Fires don’t know Republican or Democrat, or which side of the aisle you are on.” This much, at least, is true.

Homicides and several other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, dropped during the first half of 2025 across 42 U.S. cities, continuing a downward trend that began in 2022, according to a new crime trends report released Thursday by the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
Homicides fell 17% in the first half of 2025, compared with the same period in 2024, among the 30 cities that reported homicide data, according to the report.
During that same period, five cities saw increases in homicide — ranging from 6% in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to 39% in Little Rock, Arkansas.
While the report’s authors say the continued drop in violent crime — especially homicides — is encouraging, they note that much of the decline stems from a few major cities with historically high rates, such as Baltimore and St. Louis.
More than half of the cities studied have higher homicide rates than before the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, though, the analysis found that there were 14% fewer homicides during the first half of 2025 compared to the same period in 2019.
The authors say more research is needed before crediting any specific policy or practice for the continued drop in violent crime.
The group’s findings come as President Donald Trump continues to amplify concerns about crime, at times citing misleading statistics and narratives.
In a Truth Social post earlier this week, Trump claimed that cashless bail — a practice that allows people charged with a crime to be released pretrial without paying money, unless a judge deems them a threat to public safety — were fueling a national crime surge and endangering law enforcement.
He wrote: “Crime in American Cities started to significantly rise when they went to CASHLESS BAIL. The WORST criminals are flooding our streets and endangering even our great law enforcement officers. It is a complete disaster, and must be ended, IMMEDIATELY!”
Some research suggests that setting money bail isn’t effective in ensuring court appearances or improving public safety. Opponents of ending cash bail often raise concerns that released suspects might commit new, potentially more serious crimes. While that is possible in individual cases, studies show that eliminating cash bail does not lead to a widespread increase in crime.
The Truth Social post also marked a sharp shift from Trump’s remarks during a June roundtable with the Fraternal Order of Police, where he claimed the national murder rate had “plummeted by 28%” since he took office — a figure that overstates the decline and overlooks the fact that murder rates began falling well before he returned to office.
According to data consulting firm AH Datalytics, which manages the Real-Time Crime Index — a free tool that collects crime data from more than 400 law enforcement agencies nationwide — the number of homicides between January and May 2025 was 20.3% lower than the same period in 2024.
Similarly, data released in May by the Major Cities Chiefs Association showed that homicides fell roughly 20% in the first quarter of 2025 compared with the first three months of the prior year. The group’s data is based on a survey of 68 major metropolitan police departments nationwide.
Researchers at the Council on Criminal Justice note in their report that it’s difficult to pinpoint a single reason for the drop in homicides, but they note that fewer people appear to be exposed to high-risk situations, such as robberies.
Most major crimes fell in the first half of 2025 compared with the same period last year, according to the council’s report.
Motor vehicle thefts dropped by 25%, while reported gun assaults fell 21%. Robberies, residential and non-residential burglaries, shoplifting, and aggravated and sexual assaults also saw double-digit declines
Drug offenses held steady, while domestic violence reports rose slightly — by about 3%. Carjackings declined 24% and larcenies were down 5%.
Compared with the first half of 2019, before the pandemic and nationwide reckoning over racial justice and policing, overall homicides are down 14%, robberies by 30%, and sexual assaults by 28%.
Still, more than 60% of the cities in the council’s study sample report homicide rates that remain above 2019 levels.
Motor vehicle theft remains the only crime tracked in the report that is still elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels — up 25% since 2019 — although it has declined sharply since 2023.
The council also released another analysis on the lethality of violent crime, showing that while violent incidents have decreased, the share of violence that ends in death has increased significantly. In 1994, there were 2 homicides per 1,000 assaults and about 16 per 1,000 robberies. By 2020, those figures rose to 7.2 and 55.8, respectively.

UU., y los médicos de CT esperan un aumento de casos en las próximas semanas.","Traducción por Jorge Alatrista, Identidad Latina Multimedia.

Read this story in English.
Dos nuevas variantes de COVID-19 se están propagando por EE. UU., y los médicos de Connecticut esperan un aumento de casos en las próximas semanas.
La NB.1.8.1, también conocida como Nimbus, se ha convertido en la variante dominante en todo el país y las autoridades sanitarias afirman que, si bien los esfuerzos de secuenciación han disminuido, parece ser un factor determinante de los nuevos casos en Connecticut.
Otra variante, la XFG o Stratus, fue catalogada recientemente como “variante bajo vigilancia” por la Organización Mundial de la Salud y se citó como la tercera más común en EE. UU. a finales de junio, según las estimaciones Nowcast (Pronósticos inmediatos) de los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades. La variante LP.8.1, prevalente durante el invierno, se mantuvo como la segunda más común.
Algunos médicos de hospitales de Connecticut han informado haber atendido a más pacientes con COVID en las últimas semanas.
“Hemos observado un aumento en el número de pacientes con COVID. Están siendo tratados con los medicamentos adecuados”, afirmó el Dr. Husnain Kermalli, director médico del Hospital Saint Mary’s de Waterbury. “Afortunadamente, sus hospitalizaciones no han sido muy complicadas. Los hemos manejado eficazmente y los hemos reintegrado a la comunidad”.
Los casos de COVID han ido en aumento en zonas del sur y de la costa oeste, así como en algunos estados del medio oeste y noreste. Connecticut aún no ha experimentado un repunte estival de infecciones, pero las autoridades sanitarias advierten que los casos podrían aumentar en las próximas semanas.
“Hemos visto olas de verano casi todos los años, así que no creo que sea inesperado que los casos de COVID comiencen a aumentar”, declaró la Dra. Lynn Sosa, directora de enfermedades infecciosas del Departamento de Salud Pública del Estado.
Esto es lo que debe saber sobre las nuevas variantes:
Las variantes más recientes parecen ser más transmisibles.
La variante Nimbus se detectó por primera vez en EE. UU. a principios de la primavera, y la variante Stratus comenzó a cobrar impulso poco después.
Ambas parecen ser más transmisibles que las variantes anteriores, pero no hay evidencia que sugiera que sean más graves, según las autoridades sanitarias.
“A medida que el virus evoluciona, lo principal es que la última versión se transmite con mayor facilidad”, explicó Sosa. “Lo que le permitirá sobrevivir y mantenerse es su mayor facilidad de propagación. De lo contrario, no podrá competir con otras cepas”.
“Si alguna variante se propaga con mayor facilidad que la anterior, es probable que Stratus se imponga con el tiempo”.
El Dr. Ulysses Wu, epidemiólogo jefe y director del sistema de enfermedades infecciosas de Hartford HealthCare, afirmó que las variantes más recientes no son más graves que las anteriores.
“Es prácticamente igual”, afirmó, y añadió: “El riesgo de padecer COVID persistente seguirá siendo el mismo”.
El dolor de garganta y la ronquera se reportan como síntomas claves.
La variante Nimbus se ha ganado el apodo de “garganta de cuchilla de afeitar” en los medios nacionales, después de que varias personas señalaran el dolor de garganta intenso como un síntoma clave de la variante.
Algunos profesionales médicos afirman que la ronquera parece ser un síntoma pronunciado en el caso de Stratus.
“Los síntomas son, según se ha descrito en redes sociales, una sensación de cuchilla de afeitar, un dolor de garganta bastante intenso, junto con algunos síntomas gastrointestinales como náuseas y quizás vómitos. Probablemente sean signos reveladores de la presencia de este tipo de variante en el organismo”, dijo Kermalli sobre Nimbus.
Sin embargo, la mayoría de los síntomas de las dos variantes más recientes son generalmente consistentes con cepas anteriores, según las autoridades sanitarias.
“No son muy diferentes”, dijo Wu. “En el caso de Nimbus, se le llama ‘garganta de cuchilla de afeitar’, pero el dolor de garganta siempre ha ocurrido con el COVID. En el caso de Stratus, el síntoma es una voz áspera, o lo que me gusta llamar… ‘voz de fumador’, que probablemente sea un síntoma nuevo, pero en realidad no significa nada diferente”.
Tos, fiebre, dificultad para respirar, fatiga, dolor de cabeza y dolor corporal siguen siendo síntomas comunes del COVID.
Los médicos instan a las personas a quedarse en casa si están enfermas.
Los profesionales médicos recomiendan quedarse en casa si se siente enfermo. Hay kits de prueba disponibles para el hogar.
Según la Organización Mundial de la Salud, se espera que las vacunas contra la COVID-19 sigan siendo eficaces contra la enfermedad sintomática y grave como Stratus y Nimbus. Las autoridades sanitarias sugirieron mantenerse al día con la vacunación.
“Para el público, les diría que tomen las mismas precauciones”, dijo Wu. “Su protección sigue siendo la misma. Deben seguir vacunándose. Deben seguir usando mascarilla,… Si tienen una alta sospecha [de enfermedad], deben hacerse varias pruebas y, como mínimo, usar mascarilla para prevenir la transmisión”.
“Si están enfermos, deben quedarse en casa, porque estas variantes son muy transmisibles. Esa es la mejor manera de proteger la salud de los demás”, agregó Sosa. “Queremos que las personas se cubran la boca al toser si tienen que salir. Queremos que se laven las manos. Todas las medidas que normalmente tomaríamos son las mismas que debemos seguir haciendo con estas variantes”.
El tiempo de recuperación y el tratamiento son los mismos.
La recuperación del COVID varía de persona a persona, pero los tiempos de recuperación con las variantes más recientes son generalmente los mismos que con las versiones anteriores, según las autoridades sanitarias.
“Digamos que el día cero es el inicio de los síntomas. Probablemente, entre el séptimo y el décimo día, empezarán a sentirse mejor”, dijo Kermalli. “Para algunas personas, será entre el cuarto y el quinto día; para otras, podría durar hasta el día 15. Si los síntomas han durado más tiempo, probablemente les llevará un poco más de tiempo recuperarse por completo”.
Los tratamientos también son similares.
“Las personas que se enferman, especialmente si son mayores o tienen afecciones médicas subyacentes, deben consultar con su médico sobre el tratamiento”, dijo Sosa. “Todavía hay tratamientos disponibles para el COVID, específicamente Paxlovid”.

[Photo/Courtesy]Nine environmental advocacy groups on Thursday redoubled their opposition to federal efforts extending the life of a West Michigan coal plant originally slated to close earlier this year.
Although the J.H. Campbell coal plant, owned by Consumers Energy, was set to go dark on May 31, the U.S. Department of Energy issued an order on May 23 forcing the plant to remain open past its expiration date.
Despite agreements between Consumers, state energy regulators, the Department of Attorney General and multiple parties representing customer and environmental interests to close the plant down, the Department of Energy justified the move by arguing it was under the authority of the Federal Power Act, and fell in line with President Donald Trump’s executive order declaring a national energy emergency. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
On June 18, the environmental law group Earthjustice filed a challenge on behalf of 10 public interest groups requesting a rehearing on the department’s order. 
In their request, the groups highlighted the negative environmental impacts of the plant while rejecting the Trump administration’s argument that the plant is needed to prevent disruptions to the state’s energy grid. State energy regulators have also ensured that the plant’s retirement would not impact grid reliability.
However, the order went unanswered, prompting nine of those groups to file a petition for review with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, with Earthjustice and the Sierra Club leading the charge. 
Derrell Slaughter, Michigan policy director of climate and energy for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said people in Michigan and the Midwest should not be stuck paying the cost of a nonexistent emergency with their health and electric bills.
“The Campbell coal plant is out of date, costs more to operate than other electricity generation options, and is one of the worst polluters in the state,” Slaughter said. “This petition is very much in line with the State of Michigan’s commitment to pursue a clean, affordable, and reliable grid that protects both ratepayers and public health.”
In an interview with CNN, Dan Scripps, chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission, which oversees the state’s energy utilities, estimated that the cost for keeping the plant open could cost tens of millions of dollars on the low end.
The Natural Resources Defense Council also noted that the plant releases several millions of pounds of health-harming pollution and more than 10 billion pounds of climate-harming carbon dioxide into the air each year. That’s in addition to releasing roughly 100,000 pounds of water pollution into Lake Michigan every year, including 10,000 pounds of toxic metals.
Shannon Fisk, an attorney and director of state electric sector advocacy for Earthjustice, emphasized that the utility, alongside state regulators and stakeholders, all agreed the plant should be retired. 
“While the administration might not like that fact, a fabricated energy emergency does not give them the authority to saddle Michiganders with the costs and pollution of a coal plant that the utility has already replaced with other resources,” Fisk said. “The only energy emergency is the one being created by this unprecedented power grab by federal authorities.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-24-065259.png,,,2025-07-25 12:56:51.441736

Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images. U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer, a Republican who represents Minnesota’s 6th District, singled out Somali Minnesotans in a Fox News segment, prompting a response from Somali advocates. 
“These Somali gangs are incredibly dangerous,” Emmer said. “And yet no one in the Minnesota media is reporting that that’s what’s going on. We’ve got Somali gangs that are causing these problems. Good news is I visited with our FBI last week and they’re taking action. But it’s been a long time coming.” 
Emmer, who is the current House majority whip, was being interviewed about the Minneapolis mayoral race on the Fox News show “The Bottom Line.” Somali-American state Sen. Omar Fateh, who was born in the United States, was endorsed for mayor by city DFL delegates Saturday. 
Fartun Weli, the CEO of Isuroon, a Somali-American women’s organization, released a statement Thursday in response to Emmer’s comments. 
“Somali-American families are working hard to prevent and intervene in youth violence, and we won’t let baseless accusations undermine our efforts. Emmer’s race-based language only serves to deepen the racial divide,” Weli said. “By calling Somali-Americans — even those born here — just ‘Somalis,’ Emmer pushes a racially charged narrative that erases their American identity.” 
Data show that insofar as Emmer is concerned about crime in Minnesota, he should focus at least as much on American-born citizens as immigrants: A 2023 paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research indicates that “as a group, immigrants have had lower incarceration rates than the US-born for 150 years. Moreover, relative to the US-born, immigrants’ incarceration rates have declined since 1960: immigrants today are 60% less likely to be incarcerated.”
Last year, Emmer called for Rep. Ilhan Omar to resign over an incorrect translation of Omar’s comments about the strife between Somalia and a breakaway region called Somaliland. “Ilhan Omar’s appalling, Somalia-first comments are a slap in the face to the Minnesotans she was elected to serve and a direct violation of her oath of office,” Emmer wrote on X. When the Reformer published a story correcting the faulty translation, Emmer didn’t respond to inquiries. 
Although Emmer’s Fox News comments are not out of character with his more recent statements, there was a time when he defended Somali-Americans from attacks by local anti-Somali activists. 
A decade ago, Emmer created a Congressional Somalia Caucus with then-U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison. When people in St. Cloud called for a moratorium on Somali immigrants, he pushed back, calling the proposed ban “un-American.”
“If you’re asking me how I feel about immigrant populations who are in this country legally, and who are actually trying to find a better way for themselves and their families, I support it wholeheartedly,” he said at a town hall in 2015.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)States must begin verifying millions of Medicaid enrollees’ monthly work status by the end of next year — a task some critics say states will have a hard time carrying out.
A provision in the tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law July 4 will require the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are volunteering or working at least 80 hours a month or attending school at least half time.
The new law provides states $200 million for fiscal year 2026 to get their systems up and running. But some experts say states will have difficulty meeting the deadline with that funding and worry enrollees might lose their health benefits as a result.
A year and a half to comply is likely not going to be enough time for most states, especially since the federal government must craft guidance on how they should implement their programs, said Dr. Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He predicted it will be difficult to create technology simple enough — such as a phone app — to streamline the process for all enrollees.
“Two hundred million [dollars] is not going to cover the 40 expansion states that we have,” he told Stateline. “There is not a silver bullet here, and there isn’t a single app out there that’s going to keep people who should be in Medicaid from losing coverage. That’s just not realistic.”
Fedorchak emphasizes need for new Medicaid requirements

A spokesperson for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Hannah Jones, told Stateline that “it will take a significant amount of time and investment in order to implement work requirements.”
Jones said an estimated 255,000 people in North Carolina could lose coverage because of these requirements and their “administrative burden.”
“More automation reduces manual work on beneficiaries and eligibility case workers, but it requires more time, funding, and staff resources to implement,” Jones wrote in an email.
Emma Herrock, a spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Health, wrote in an email that the vast majority of the state’s Medicaid enrollees already work, and the agency expects few people to be disenrolled. Herrock said the department will establish work verification systems by the end of 2026.
“The department is taking a thoughtful approach to implementation,” Herrock wrote. “We are already working with several Louisiana agencies … in order to receive data on recipients who are working.”
She added that the department views work requirements “as a means to grow our economy, while reinforcing the value of work and self-sufficiency.”
In New York, it could cost the state $500 million to administer the new requirements, New York Department of Health spokesperson Danielle De Souza wrote in an email.
Between 600,000 and 1.1 million individuals who are eligible for and enrolled in Medicaid could potentially lose coverage because of work reporting requirements, she wrote, based on what happened when states were required to resume checking eligibility after the COVID-19 health emergency ended.
“The department will remain steadfast in its commitment to protecting the health of all New Yorkers and will work to mitigate the impacts of this law,” De Souza wrote.
Hoeven backs big bill as benefiting North Dakotans

The new rules apply to states that expanded Medicaid to adults between the ages of 19 and 64 with incomes below 138% of the federal poverty line (about $22,000 for an individual), an option that was made available under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. More than 20 million people were enrolled through Medicaid expansion as of June 2024 — those are the patients who will face work requirements.
Reapplying for Medicaid, which typically has been required once a year, already is burdensome for some patients, said Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, president of the American Medical Association.
“On top of that, now we’re going to be challenging so many people who were at least able to deal with it financially with things like … proving that they got a job,” Mukkamala said in an interview.
Previous attempts at implementing work requirements have ended up costing states millions in administrative and consulting fees. And in some cases, people who were eligible for Medicaid lost their coverage due to paperwork issues.
Arkansas’ example
Several states wanted to implement work requirements during the first Trump administration. But only Arkansas fully did so, in 2018, before a federal judge halted the requirements. More than 18,000 Arkansas residents lost Medicaid coverage during the 10 months the requirements were in effect.
Sommers, of Harvard, noted that most people were disenrolled because they didn’t know about the policy or made paperwork errors, not because they weren’t working.
“Red tape led to people losing their coverage,” he said. “They had more trouble affording their medications. They were putting off needed care.”
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that advises congressional Republicans, said he thinks concerns about the new requirements are overblown because there’s more advanced technology now.
“Lots of government programs have initial implementation challenges,” Blase told Stateline. “Arkansas was seven years ago, and if you just think about the change in the technological advancements over the past seven years … we didn’t have artificial intelligence and just the ability of modern tech.”
Federal funding cuts to North Dakota agencies total $100M so far, analysis shows

As it stands, each state has varying technological capabilities, and will have a different timeline and budget, said Michael Heifetz, a managing director at consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal and a former Medicaid director in Wisconsin. His team contracts with states to implement Medicaid, including work requirements, and other programs.
He also noted that the Trump administration can give states a deadline extension on implementing work requirements to Dec. 31, 2028, if they show they are making a “good faith effort.” States will need to share data across agencies in new ways, he said.
“It will require some form of data sharing and communications with educational agencies, workforce training agencies and some other agencies that typically aren’t in the Medicaid ecosystem,” Heifetz said.
State governments may resist hiring full-time positions for those tasks, he said, but “artificial intelligence and other tools can help work through these processes in a smoother fashion.”
Other state efforts
Efforts in other states to implement work requirements have had mixed results.
In Georgia, for example, an experimental work requirement program cost taxpayers more than $86 million in its first 18 months but enrolled just 6,500 people during that time, according to an investigation by ProPublica and The Current published in February. That’s 75% fewer participants than the state had estimated for the program’s first year.
The nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office in 2019 looked at five states that tested systems to track Medicaid work requirements under the first Trump administration. Those demonstration projects were rescinded during the Biden administration.
The states estimated their projected administrative costs for implementing work requirements for one to three years, and the total far surpassed the $200 million Congress has provided in the new law. Kentucky alone estimated $270 million, Wisconsin $70 million, Indiana $35 million, Arkansas $26 million and New Hampshire $6 million.
Susan Barnidge, an assistant director on the GAO health care team and an author of the report, said the agency found that across states there wasn’t much federal oversight of administrative costs on test programs. Oversight will be key as states roll out their work requirement systems, she said.
“We found some weaknesses in [federal] Centers for Medicare & Medicaid oversight of certain federal funding for certain administrative activities. So we found examples of things that states sought federal funding for that didn’t appear to be allowable,” Barnidge said in an interview. “I think that will remain relevant.”
Mukkamala, of the American Medical Association, said the burden will in some ways fall to doctors’ offices to help keep patients enrolled, as they work with patients to check eligibility and possibly help get them on Medicaid.

“As if it’s easy to take care of their health care issue, given things like prior authorization,” Mukkamala told Stateline. “Now to add to the challenge, we have to figure out how to get them covered.”

(Courtesy of Mesilla Valley Search and Rescue)The Doña Ana Board of County Commissioners voted unanimously Thursday evening to request state disaster assistance after recent heavy rains caused flash flooding in Vado and Del Cerro.
The resolution requests Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham declare a state of emergency and establishes a Disaster Housing Program to fund grant requests for people impacted by flooding. The county created the program with $500,000 from its hospital lease fund.
“No other county or municipality has ever done this,” Chair Christopher Schaljo-Hernandez said. “This is the first time anyone has ever offered emergency funding for homeowners to find emergency housing.”
According to the resolution, the fund will support indigent renters and homeowners who lost their primary residents due to flooding proved by a damage assessment and photo documentation. Homeowners with a total loss of home can receive $9,000 grants for the purpose of obtaining safe housing, while renters will be eligible for a$3,000 grant for obtaining a new place to rent. If the loss is only temporary, homeowners and renters will receive emergency housing grants of $1,500.
Lt. Governor Howie Morales appeared at the meeting in person and commended the commissioners for their quick action. He said he supported the disaster declaration.
Morales said the state has already requested an assessment team from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to deploy to Doña Ana, to see if the damage meets the threshold for federal assistance.
“Right now we have floods that are taking place in Ruidoso again, we have flood warnings around San Miguel,” Morales said. “By adding Doña Ana County to that national disaster declaration, frees up flexibility as well…for some assistance we’re not able to do at the local or state level.”
Damage from severe and repeated flooding in the burn scars around Ruidoso in the Sacramento mountains to the east continued Thursday, as the river rose above 12 feet and swept away a home. Floods on July 9 killed three people, destroyed hundreds of homes and necessitated the rescue of dozens.
President Donald Trump recently approved additional federal funds for Lincoln County, but state officials said they’re pushing for the federal government to grant outstanding requests for flooding damages in Chaves, Otero and Valencia counties.

Flood Commissioner John Gwynne presented a drone survey of Vado, showing much of the water remains in the days since Tuesday night’s flooding as many of the channels for draining the water remain plugged with debris and sediment.
“At the earliest, it’ll be next week before we can actually start moving sediment, and that’s if it’s dry enough,” Gwynne said.
Stephen Lopez, the assistant county manager, said local wastewater pumps have removed about 3.3 million gallons of water but are under strain from moving that much water. Without further repair of canals and roads, the county cannot add more pumps, since there’d be nowhere for the water to go.
Commissioner Susana Chaparro asked if there’s continuing threats from sewage backing up into the standing floodwaters.
“The water is absolutely contaminated,” Lopez said. “Not just with human excrement, but also with a lot of runoff from animals.”

(Photo by Alon Skuy/Getty Images)Deportation flights have started at the state-run immigrant detention center in the Everglades more than three weeks after the first detainees arrived, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Friday.
The federal government has deported 100 people held at the notorious site in an old airstrip and flown out hundreds more to other hubs, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s staging facility in Louisiana, DeSantis said during the on-site press conference.
“You’re going to see the cadence on these flights start to pick up, obviously,” he said. “Honestly, to get to where we were the beginning of this month, and now have flights leaving already with a facility that’s been built out, that’s incredible.”
Two dozen people chose to self-deport from the detention center at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, the governor said.
An ICE spokesperson refused to answer questions about the deportation flights, directing Florida Phoenix to the Florida Division of Emergency Management. That state agency is in charge of the state-run detention center, but the federal government operates deportations.
ICE arrests of immigrants without criminal convictions or charges surge in Florida

The governor also continued defending the state’s operation of the detention center, dismissing detainee accounts about rotting food, denial of medical care, scarce access to showers, and malfunctioning toilets. Immigrants at the detention center in the Everglades are also demanding access to their attorneys in a class action lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, ICE, DeSantis, and the head of DEM.
DEM director Kevin Guthrie grew increasingly agitated while defending the conditions at the detention center.
“So again, simple answer: Absolute crap,” he said. “We have on this facility, the ability of a full-fledged medical center with X-ray capability, sonogram capability, prescription med capability.”
The emergency head also scoffed at questions about the bidding process for the hundreds of millions in contracts for the detention center the state removed from a public database. Guthrie said the line item details of the contracts were removed so other competitors couldn’t see the rate the state paid.
“You got me riled back up again. Sorry about that,” he said.
Orlando Democratic Rep. Anna Eskamani has been one of the most ardent critics of the $245 million AP has reported the state has spent on the detention center. She has pointed out the deletion of the contracts from the state’s database on X.
“This entire press conference at the Everglades Immigrant Detention Camp is all about damage control,” she wrote on X. “We have an administration that is actively hiding contracts, information, and detainees from the public. Hundreds who are NOT criminals. And doing it all on the public’s dime.”
Eskamani is one of five Democrats in the state Legislature suing the DeSantis administration to gain oversight access to the detention center.
Although the press conference was at the detention center, press were not allowed inside. DeSantis sustained the decision, saying journalists had toured when President Donald Trump visited on July 1.
“Here’s the thing. This is not a spectacle. Okay?” DeSantis said. “You don’t get to go into other facilities willy nilly either.”

According to a recent analysis by FWD.us, a bipartisan immigration advocacy group, the rollback of humanitarian parole programs and other immigration policies could sharply reduce the workforce in several U.S. industries that rely on immigrant labor.
Under the Biden administration, immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela — four countries grappling with ongoing humanitarian crises — were allowed to enter the U.S. temporarily under a humanitarian parole system that required a background check and financial sponsor.
But earlier this year, the Trump administration ended these programs. The Supreme Court upheld the move. As a result, hundreds of thousands of immigrants lost their legal right to work and are now considered undocumented.
FWD.us estimates that around 740,000 workers from those countries and others had been employed under humanitarian parole. Of those, at least 30,000 worked on farms, and another 90,000 held jobs in manufacturing — including meatpacking and food processing plants.
The potential labor shortfall in these essential industries could ripple through the economy.
Using a model developed by Francesc Ortega, a professor of economics at the City University of New York, FWD.us projects that the current administration’s recent and proposed immigration policies could drive a 14.5% increase in prices for food, beverages and tobacco products between 2024 and 2028 — on top of existing inflation.
“We used economic modeling to estimate the impact that some of President Trump’s immigration policies would have on prices for the average American household,” said Phillip Connor, senior demographer at FWD.us. “When large parts of the workforce are removed, the demand for goods and services stays the same, but there are fewer workers to produce them. That imbalance is what drives prices up.”
Some employers have already begun layoffs. In recent months, companies like Walmart and JBS began terminating workers who lost their work authorizations following the Supreme Court decision.
The ruling comes amid a contradictory and evolving set of signals from the Trump administration regarding immigrant labor in the agricultural sector.
This month, Trump floated the idea of granting temporary permits for undocumented workers on farms and in meatpacking plants. Yet, in recent months, there have been multiple reports of ICE raids on farms, and a meatpacking plant in Omaha was also targeted.

“It really has been a true lifeline for the entire family,” Young said in a press call Thursday. “We have tried to provide care for my sister, and her needs are so demanding, so extreme, that a family by itself can’t manage to make this work. We need help, we need support, we’ve thrown ourselves into this to the extent that we can, but many, many other families are in similar situations.”
Young said that when Medicaid cuts hit Colorado in the past, the state could no longer provide residential care for his sister. She went through 20 different residential facilities in a span of 18 months, all of which were “inadequate” because they did not have proper funding, he said.
“Often, she was ejected from a placement because she overwhelmed the providers, sometimes without even a phone call,” Young said.



Young and financial officials from four other Democratic-led states participated in a call hosted by Americans for Responsible Growth, a national advocacy group that works with state financial leaders. They warned about how Republicans’ recent policy law, called by President Donald Trump the “big, beautiful bill,” will negatively affect Medicaid and Medicare recipients ahead of the 60th anniversary of the programs.
The law cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, a state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes.
Dave Wallack, executive director of Americans for Responsible Growth, said that since the Trump administration took office, Republicans have “systematically gutted health care programs, fired thousands of federal workers, and slashed more than a trillion dollars for Medicaid, the largest cut in the program’s history.”
Wallack said the cuts will lead to 17 million Americans losing health care coverage and more than 50,000 preventable deaths annually. Young said in Colorado, more than 375,000 recipients could lose Medicaid coverage. Democratic officials from New Mexico, Illinois, Minnesota and Maryland all said that rural communities in their states will be hit hardest by the cuts, and they will feel the effects first.
Rural hospitals at risk
Laura Montoya, the New Mexico state treasurer, said her state is the No. 1 recipient state for Medicaid in the nation, and 80% of the babies born in New Mexico are born into Medicaid. She said the federal law’s changes to Medicaid will “force hospitals and clinics to either raise premiums or copays or shut down entirely,” and 15 hospitals in rural communities are already at risk of closing their doors.
“Our state’s entire provider network depends on the state’s current Medicaid coverage landscape,” Montoya said. “These cuts will increase health care costs for all New Mexicans regardless of Medicaid enrollment, not to mention more uninsured individuals could end up skipping preventative care leading to worsened health outcomes, higher cost for emergency care, and more crowded emergency rooms and urgent care facilities, placing even more strain on an already overwhelmed system.”
The shift of responsibility for states to fund Medicaid could also destabilize New Mexico’s entire support network, including housing assistance, early childhood education, public safety and economic development, Montoya said. The New Mexico Legislature passed a measure creating a Medicaid trust fund to safeguard services amid federal cuts, she added.
Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs said 44% of the Medicaid recipients in his state are children, 9% are seniors, and 7% are adults with disabilities. Nine rural hospitals in Illinois, all in Republican districts, are at risk of closing because of funding cuts, he said.
“When hospitals close and health care providers cut back, people lose their jobs. They lose their income, and their health insurance,” Frerichs said. “Illinois’ economy will be destabilized. The cruel, inhumane Trump big bad budget bill will wreak havoc across Illinois for years to come.”
Julie Blaha, Minnesota’s state auditor, said about 25% of Minnesotans are enrolled in the state’s Medicaid program, which also supports 30% of births. For Black and Indigenous communities, those numbers are even higher: The state’s medical assistance program covers 80% of Black babies born in the state and 90% of Indigenous babies.
Blaha said it is more cost-efficient to keep people on these health care programs in a stable place, as it’s more expensive “to pull somebody up who’s fallen through.”
“It is time to stand up and tell Congress and tell Trump to roll back these terrible cuts and try to stop the avalanche before it crushes us all,” Blaha said.
Brooke Lierman, the Maryland state comptroller, said 42% of her state’s population is supported by Medicaid or Medicare. She said the two programs were designed to take care of “vulnerable Americans” who would be “sicker and worse off” without the coverage they provide.
“These programs are economic powerhouses that drive prosperity in our communities and strengthen our state’s fiscal foundation,” Lierman said. “Cutting Medicaid is both fiscally reckless and morally bankrupt, abandoning our most vulnerable residents, including our seniors and people with disabilities, while destroying the economic foundation that so many of our communities depend on.”
‘Among the greatest policy achievements’
Health care is a “major economic driver” in Colorado, Young said, as hospitals employ about 1 in 5 Colorado residents and generate $1 billion in tax revenue yearly. Reduced federal investment in health care will lead to clinic closures and reduced tax revenue that will affect quality of life for “Coloradans of every age and income bracket,” he said.
“Colorado cannot afford to downsize our health care sector,” Young said. “We’re already facing dire workforce and health care shortages, especially in rural and frontier communities. The state can’t make up for these losses either.”
Medicaid and Medicare are “among the greatest policy achievements in American history,” Young said, as the programs strengthen health care systems and lift people out of poverty. He said the programs can be strengthened while saving money, but “this slash and burn technique” will be “devastating.”
“When people get the care they need, they hold down jobs, they provide for their families and avoid catastrophic medical debt,” Young said.
