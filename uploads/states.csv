(Photo via Rhode Island Department of Transportation Traffic Camera)The state’s lawsuit against the 13 firms accused of doing negligent work on the westbound Washington Bridge can proceed to a 2027 trial date, a Rhode Island Superior Court judge has ruled.
Judge Brian Stern on Monday denied motions from four subcontractors to dismiss the case, ruling that allegations by the state could make the defendants liable for structural deficiencies that led to the westbound highway’s abrupt closure in December 2023.
Stern’s decision comes nearly three weeks after a hearing in his Providence courtroom when  lawyers for the four engineering and construction vendors argued they had no contractual obligation to prevent or detect the infrastructure problems that put the bridge over the Seekonk River at risk of collapse.
Whose fault is it anyway? Washington Bridge lawsuit has another day in court

The motions asking the judge to throw out the claims against them were filed by Steere Engineering, Inc.; Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.; Aries Support Services, Inc.; and Commonwealth Engineers & Consultants, Inc.
Attorneys for the four firms did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Their arguments hinged on the “economic loss doctrine,” the legal theory that contractors can’t be found responsible for damages or negligence outside the terms of a contract. A similar case was made in February by seven of 13 bridge vendors who pushed to have the case tossed. Stern ultimately rejected their arguments due to insufficient evidence to meet the high legal standard needed for a dismissal. 
However, he said the state’s initial August 2024 complaint failed to identify specific physical damages beyond the bridge itself. Stern gave state officials 30 days to amend its lawsuit, which they did in April, when they claimed the eastbound Washington Bridge has sustained added wear and tear since absorbing westbound traffic in December 2023. That seemed to contradict transportation officials’ assurances that the eastbound bridge is still safe for two-way travel.
The state’s updated 53-page complaint doesn’t specify what damage has been caused to the eastbound highway, only that maintenance and repairs are now required on a much more frequent basis and that transportation officials had to install sensors to monitor the structural health of the bridge.
But the state’s response was enough for Stern to let the case proceed.
“Viewing the allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the damage to the eastbound Washington Bridge is an extraordinary example of physical wear and tear, and the State has sufficiently alleged harm to other property beyond mere loss of use,” Stern wrote in Monday’s ruling.
With the motions denied, the case now heads toward a trial estimated to last approximately six to eight weeks.
Both sides have until May 16, 2027, to complete discovery — the exchange of documents and expert testimony — under the court’s tentative schedule for the lawsuit. The trial itself is slated to start in November 2027— one year before the expected completion date of the new, westbound Washington Bridge.
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said he’s ready for the long road ahead.
“Rhode Islanders deserve accountability in the Washington Bridge case, and we look forward to continuing our work on behalf of them,” he said in a statement Tuesday.

Milam is believed to have used to pistol-whip and shoot Emmett Till will go on display at the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum.,"The gun believed to have been used to kill Emmett Till is now in the hands of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History.
A news conference will take place at 10 a.m. Thursday, the 70th anniversary of Till’s murder, at the Two Mississippi Museums to announce the donation of the .45-caliber pistol that J.W. Milam is believed to have used to pistol-whip and shoot the Black Chicago youth, who had just turned 14.
It’s the second murder weapon in the department’s possession. The first is the .30-06 rifle used in 1963 to kill Mississippi NAACP leader Medgar Evers, which can be seen at the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum.
Unlike many stories plucked from history, fascination with the Till case has grown over time, said Dave Tell, author of “Remembering Emmett Till.”
He called the Till story “the ‘Ur-Story’ of American racism,” alluding to author Joseph Campbell’s reference to the archetypal plot in all major stories.
A year after Tell and other scholars launched the Emmett Till Memory Project in 2019, George Floyd died at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. Overnight, downloads quadrupled.
“In a moment when our country is on edge regarding race, the Till story is the story we keep going back to,” Tell said. “He’s the lens through which we understand race and what it means to be Black in America.”
In World War II, Milam served as a lieutenant in the Army Air Force and brought back the Ithaca Model M1911-A1 .45-caliber pistol, which has the serial number 2102279.
In Look magazine, Milam was quoted as saying, “Best weapon the Army’s got, either for shootin’ or sluggin’.”
A witness to Milam’s shooting prowess told the FBI, “I can tell ya how good he was with that old pistol. I seen him shoot bumble bees out of the air with it.”
Milam and his half-brother, Roy Bryant, abducted Till from his home in the wee hours of Aug. 28, 1955. The white men had heard that Till reportedly wolf-whistled at Bryant’s wife, Carolyn.

They took Till to a barn, where he was brutally beaten by Roy Bryant, Milam and others. Witnesses heard Till’s screams.
Till was beaten so badly there was talk of dropping him off at a hospital, but Milam reportedly killed him with a single bullet.
During the FBI’s 2005 investigation of the Till murder, authorities exhumed his body. X-rays revealed extensive skull fractures and metallic fragments in the skull. There were also fractures to the left femur and the left and right wrist bones. The Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office in Illinois concluded that Till died of a gunshot wound to the head.
During the autopsy, doctors found four lead fragments that experts determined were consistent with lead shot pellets. The size of those pellets matched the size of the lead shot manufactured for the Army Air Force.
An all-white jury acquitted Milam and Bryant of Till’s murder. Months later, they admitted their involvement to Look magazine.
The owner of the alleged murder weapon kept it in a safety deposit box in a Greenwood bank, according to Wright Thompson’s book, “The Barn: The Secret History of a Murder in Mississippi.”
While working on his 2005 documentary, “The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till,” filmmaker Keith Beauchamp discovered the existence of the .45 pistol. “I received the email of where the gun could possibly be,” he said.
He shared the email with FBI agent Dale Killinger, who investigated the Till case.
“Keith got a lead and let me know who to go see, and I rolled out, and I was able to connect with the people who got it,” said Killinger, who wouldn’t divulge how the gun came into their possession.
Killinger said he turned in the gun, which was examined for fingerprints. 
He wouldn’t discuss who the owner is or what motivated that owner to donate the gun.
Beauchamp said he does have concerns about the gun being displayed in the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum. He doesn’t think Till’s mother, Mamie Till Mobley, would have approved, he said, “but I don’t hold the keys of history to Emmett.”

The Emmett Till exhibit in the museum does have a pistol on display. That pistol belonged to a deputy at the trial.
The archives department’s announcement comes days after the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Review Board’s release of more than 6,000 FBI files regarding the Till case. Most are from 1955, when then-FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover said the agency lacked jurisdiction to pursue the case.

Till’s cousin, Priscilla Williams Till, said she is anxious for the rest of the more than 30,000 pages to become public. “There’s a lot of unfinished documentation left out,” she said.
Devery Anderson, author of “Emmett Till: The Murder That Shocked the World and Propelled the Civil Rights Movement,” said he would like to see the release of all the documentation related to the FBI’s investigations on the case.
Beauchamp, too, is anxious to see all of the files released, he said. “That way people can see how the federal government, including the local authorities, dropped the ball in 2007 and 2017.”
In 2007, a Mississippi grand jury declined to indict Bryant’s then-wife, Carolyn, who testified that Till had mauled her in the grocery store. Weeks earlier, she had told a defense lawyer that all Till did was ask for a date and whistle.
The FBI made the case active again after author Tim Tyson claimed in his 2017 book, “The Blood of Emmett Till,” that Carolyn Bryant Donham admitted to him that she lied when she said Till all but raped her, grabbing her around the waist and propositioning her.
In its renewed investigation, the FBI found no such reference in recordings of his conversations with her, in transcripts of those recordings, or in Bryant Donham’s memoir, which maintains she told the truth when she testified.
READ ALSO: The Emmett Till lynching has seen more than its share of liars. Is Tim Tyson one of them?
The lack of independent corroboration, the FBI found, “would prevent the government from proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Bryant-Donham recanted her testimony when she spoke with Tyson over a decade ago and, consequently, that she lied to FBI agents when she denied having done so.”
The 2021 report concluded that no one could be prosecuted.

(Photo by Aristide Economopoulos/New Jersey Monitor)New Mexico will ask a federal appeals court to reconsider its pause on the state’s seven-day waiting period to purchase a firearm.
A three-judge panel of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver on Aug. 19 enjoined New Mexico’s seven-day waiting period, which became law in May 2024.
New Mexico intends to file a petition asking for all 19 of the court’s judges to decide the case, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s Communications Director Michael Coleman told Source NM on Monday. Lujan Grisham’s Deputy General Counsel Kyle Duffy told the interim legislative Courts, Corrections and Justice Committee on Monday morning about the state’s intentions to file the petition but due to audio problems with the Legislature’s webcast, Source was unable to hear the presentation.
New Mexico Department of Justice Spokesperson Lauren Rodriguez confirmed to Source on Tuesday that Attorney General Raúl Torrez intends to ask the full court to reconsider the case.
“We are actively working with the Governor’s office on the petition for rehearing,” Rodriguez said in an emailed statement.
Duffy told the committee in the meantime, the waiting-period law remains in effect, Coleman said.
These kinds of requests for an entire federal appeals court to reconsider a smaller panel’s decisions are generally reserved for exceptionally important cases, in which decisions conflict with one another or when the circuit court tries to keep its decisions consistent, according to a presentation to the committee by Brandon Cummings, the district legislative aide to Chair Sen. Joseph Cervantes (D-Las Cruces).
Coleman told Source that Duffy said the panel’s split decision goes against a prior Tenth Circuit ruling that upheld Colorado’s law barring gun purchases by anyone under the age of 21, or “a law that requires 18-year-olds to wait three years to purchase a weapon.” Judge Scott M. Matheson’s dissenting opinion also points to this inconsistency.
As of Tuesday morning, New Mexico had not yet filed the petition for rehearing, according to court records.

Ned Lamont has said that Connecticut’s future depends on a strong, well-educated workforce. That future is now in jeopardy.","Recently, in Hartford, I sat with workers, parents, students, and community leaders as part of the AFL-CIO’s national It’s Better in a Union: Fighting for Freedom, Fairness, and Security bus tour. We heard firsthand how Connecticut’s working families are grappling with the Trump Administration’s cruel and devastating federal cuts – paired with years of insufficient state funding.
The voices in that room weren’t painting a hypothetical scenario. They were recounting raw and authentic stories from the front lines of the attack on public K-12 and higher education systems. They were teachers, university faculty, paraeducators, custodians, administrators, and cafeteria workers who are working with even less while being expected to bridge unprecedented gaps in funding and protections.

They were parents fearing their children fall further behind while staffing, programs and supports scale back, all while struggling to afford after-school care. They were also community members who are pinned under the weight of unaffordability, watching local economies shutter from federal attacks and state complicity.
Their stories followed a similar theme though: the system is breaking under the current policies and the burden is falling disproportionately on working families.
Gov. Ned Lamont has said that Connecticut’s future depends on a strong, well-educated workforce. That future is now in jeopardy. The federal government is handing out $4 trillion in tax cuts to ultra-wealthy individuals and the largest corporations – the same groups that have been profiting at an unprecedented rate since the pandemic.
States now have the opportunity – and an obligation – to capture those backwards federal tax cuts by increasing taxes on those same individuals and corporations – turning federal greed into state investment. Connecticut is surrounded by states doing just that. Massachusetts raised $2.2 billion in one year alone with a modest 4% surcharge on millionaires—and the number of millionaires in the state actually increased.
And what about the potential impact on real families like those we heard from today? Every parent could watch their children thrive, every small business could rely on a robust workforce development pipeline, every community could access stable public services they need to move Connecticut in the right direction.
Governor Lamont has enjoyed strong labor support throughout his tenure, but recently has become unrecognizable to our members. We applauded his historic tax cut for working families in his first term, the overdue increase in the minimum wage and the establishment of paid family and medical leave. But inaction now would not only erase that legacy, it would replace it with a new one: complicity in the largest effective tax hike on working families.
On behalf of the 12.5 million working people of the AFL-CIO – and the more than 250,000 here in Connecticut – I urge the governor to take immediate action, without delay, in a special legislative session.
We look forward to hearing positive reports from our affiliates.

(Photo by Lauren McCauley/Maine Morning Star)Rather than asking voters, the Portland City Council adopted an ordinance to help eliminate coal dust in the city to stem public health and environmental concerns. 
The topic came before the council during its meeting Monday night as a citizens’ initiative, but instead of putting it on the November ballot, the council unanimously opted to pass the ordinance. The new rule will require the 45,000-ton coal pile stored on the city’s waterfront to be put under permanent covering by 2027. From there, it will phase out the storage of more than one ton of coal in the city by 2030. 
“This isn’t something that we need in our city,” said Councilor Regina Phillips. She added that she toured the area near the coal pile in Portland’s West End and saw how the dust covers windowsills and even comes inside the nearby buildings.
Whenever a citizens’ initiative comes before the council, it can move forward in one of three ways, explained the city’s attorney Michael Goldman: The council can choose to put the initiative on the ballot for voters to decide, adopt the ordinance outright or come up with a competing measure to put on the ballot alongside the citizens’ proposal. 
Though those options are available any time a citizens’ initiative comes forward, Goldman and City Manager Danielle West couldn’t recall a time when the council chose to adopt the policy rather than send it to voters. 
During the council meeting, multiple members of the public spoke in favor of the proposal, specifically highlighting the health risks associated with coal dust, especially since three schools and three health centers sit within a mile of the pile.
Coal dust, also referred to as fugitive coal dust when it comes from such a storage pile, is linked to various respiratory issues including worsening asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema and more, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
In addition to parents whose children attend those schools, nonprofits including the Bicycle Coalition of Maine and Defend Our Health, a Portland-based public health nonprofit, asked the city council to take action on coal dust to protect their neighbors. 
“You cannot ask people to walk, bike or roll if the very air that they breathe along those routes is polluted with coal dust,” said Andrew Zarro, executive director of the Bicycle Coalition of Maine. “Clean, breathable air is as essential for safe transportation as would be bike lanes, sidewalks or crosswalks.”

The Iowa Board of Physician Assistants recently alleged that licensee Chad Walker violated several state regulations at some undisclosed time in the past.
According to the board, Walker was working at the Burgess Family Clinic in Mapleton when he allegedly engaged in the inappropriate prescribing of narcotics, benzodiazepines and amphetamines. He also is alleged to have overprescribed controlled substances, including opioids, to a patient.

In addition, the board alleges Walker failed to follow guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention when prescribing controlled substances; failed to perform annual drug screens on patients in accordance with polices on controlled substances; failed to have checked the Prescription Monitoring Program on a regular basis for the names of his patients; and failed to prescribe nalozone — a drug commonly used to reverse the effect of an opioid overdose — for patients who had received high doses of opioids with concurrent use of benzodiazepines.
The board also alleges Walker “created documents and signed (them) on behalf of his supervising physician without her permission or knowledge.”
The publicly available board documents give no indication as to whether any patients were harmed by Walker’s alleged conduct.
As a result of the allegations, the board charged Walker with professional incompetence, prescribing opioids in dosages that exceeded what would be prescribed by a “reasonably prudent licensee,” and unethical conduct.
Although the board has not disclosed when any of the alleged violations took place, board documents indicate the case against Walker was initiated in 2023. The Burgess Health Center’s website indicates Walker joined the Burgess Family Clinic in Mapleton in late 2016.
In order to settle the matter, Walker and the board recently agreed to a settlement that calls for Walker’s license to placed on probation for two years, during which time he can continue to practice subject to restrictions imposed by the board.
Those restrictions call for Walker to complete eight hours of educational training in “Drug Enforcement Administration narcotics,” and to complete a course of unspecified duration in ethics and prescribing. Walker will also be required to meet with a worksite monitor for at least one hour each week. The monitor will review 20% of Walker’s patient charts each month.
In addition, the board has issued a formal warning to Walker, informing him that any future violations may result in additional sanctions.
Walker is currently affiliated with Sioux City’s Thrive Wellness Center as a direct care provider. The Iowa Capitol Dispatch was unable to reach Walker for comment.

Sen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, and Sen. Keturah Herron, D-Louisville, told Tuesday’s Interim Joint Committee Local Government that their legislation would exclude people convicted of treason, election-related crimes, sexual offenses and crimes against children.

A spokesman for Senate Democrats said the legislation has “not yet been drafted, as the details are still being worked out.” Higdon said the language will be “pretty much identical” to previous versions of the bill. 
His 2020 version also excluded people “with intellectual or developmental disabilities or serious mental illnesses who have been adjudicated as disabled and who have not retained their voting rights or had those rights restored.” That language replaced the outdated label of “idiots and insane persons.” 
In 2019, Gov. Andy Beshear restored the voting rights of some 140,000 Kentuckians through an executive order. Beshear also excluded those convicted of violent crimes and other serious offenses. Higdon and Herron expressed concern Tuesday that a future governor could undo Beshear’s order and undo those restored rights. 
“Those folks that have served their time — they need that to get that privilege of voting back, as long as it wasn’t a crime against a child, bribery, or any of those listed in the constitutional amendment,” Higdon said. 
  Rep. Keturah Herron, D-Louisville. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd).
Voting rights restoration varies across the United States, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In 23 states, people convicted of felonies lose their right to vote while behind bars and then get that right restored automatically when released. Kentucky is one of 10 states that require additional actions for a person’s voting right to be restored, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
“It has been my belief that once someone has been convicted of a crime, they do their time and they come out, that a part of them coming out and being a citizen and being whole is that they should be able to vote again,” Herron said. 
Herron and Higdon’s amendment would relate only to voting rights, not other civil rights lost, such as the ability to run for office.

The council also passed a companion ordinance to create a rapid response process for civil and criminal ordinance violations to be processed through a restorative justice system.

BURLINGTON — The City Council overwhelmingly passed a resolution Monday night intended to create a safer and more welcoming City Hall Park after hearing extensive testimony.
The 9-2 vote — Melo Grant, P-Central, and Marek Broderick, P-Ward 8, voted no — comes six days after a man died after he was allegedly assaulted by a group of teens in the park.
Burlington residents and leaders have hotly debated the challenges of addressing increasing homelessness and public drug use downtown in recent months. At Monday’s meeting, some business owners claimed they are losing business and staff. Meanwhile, some residents said they find downtown unsafe and unwelcome, while others opposed further criminalizing the unhoused and called for greater compassion and creative solutions.
The resolution is meant to reach that middle ground and is “one step forward in starting to do what we can as a city,” said Progressive Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak who has recently sparred with Gov. Phil Scott on  how to improve conditions in the city.
Sponsored by City Council President Ben Traverse, D-Ward 5, the 3-page resolution aims to “revive City Hall Park as a more accessible, family-friendly gathering space” by enforcing existing laws “to address criminality and other unwelcoming behaviors.”
This includes keeping the park closed to the public from midnight to 6 a.m. as posted, maintaining a “more consistent presence” of police and public safety personnel, and developing a standardized response to low-level drug issues in the park.
“I oppose this because it’s inadequate to meet the moment that we find ourselves in and it’s harmful to the most vulnerable members of our community in a way that will not solve anything,” Broderick said, citing continued gaps that exist in housing, mental health care treatment and an overburdened criminal justice system.
The council unanimously passed a companion City Circle ordinance to create a rapid response process for civil and criminal ordinance violations to be processed through a restorative justice system in partnership with the Burlington Community Justice Center.
“People who receive tickets will be referred to the City Circle,” Burlington City Attorney Jessica Brown said at the meeting. “And the hope is that they will engage with the City Circle and address any harm that may have been caused, any accountability and repair farm to the extent possible.” 
“I see these efforts as happening in partnership with continued investments in substance use recovery and treatment services, of expanding our available mental health resources, of growing our affordable housing stock,” said Mulvaney-Stanak, who supported the resolution.
The mayor said she plans to review national best practices for resolving the issues of “non-violent illegal and anti-social behavior in public spaces, including new community health based strategies to reduce open illegal drug use,” according to the resolution passed, which calls for a report from the mayor and police by Sept. 29.

He was 57.
Harris served as president of Tennessee Right to Life for 23 years after leaving behind the aspiring musician career that first brought him from Indiana to Tennessee and taking over a dormant Nashville chapter of the organization in 1992. Harris went on to transform Tennessee Right to Life into a powerful statewide political force whose candidate endorsements and criticisms could spell electoral victory or defeat. 
Harris’ lobbying efforts on Capitol Hill ushered in a series of increasingly restrictive abortion laws beginning about a decade ago, at a time when Tennessee had far fewer limits on abortion access than neighboring Southern states.

That shifted under Harris’ leadership and as Republicans came to dominate the state legislature. Tennessee Right to Life is credited with turning out the vote for a successful constitutional amendment that stripped the right to an abortion from the Tennessee Constitution in 2014. Until then, Tennessee lawmakers were limited in the restrictions on abortion they could enact.
The legislature soon adopted more stringent abortion regulations, at times modeled on sample language submitted by Harris’ organization, which worked in tandem with a national network of conservative anti-abortion attorneys. 
Lobbying from Tennessee Right to Life resulted a 48-hour waiting period for abortions, ban on the use of telemedicine for abortion-inducing medications, the creation of a “choose life” license plate, and a requirement that doctors performing abortions obtain admitting privileges at local hospitals, which led to the closure of abortion facilities in Knoxville and Memphis.
Harris’ work with Tennessee Right to Life culminated in the state’s so-called “trigger law” in 2019 that conditionally banned abortions if the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision establishing a federal right to abortion. The Supreme Court subsequently did overturn Roe in 2022, and Tennessee’s trigger law took effect weeks later. A legal challenge to portions of the law remains ongoing.
Harris left Tennessee Right to Life in 2021, emailing a reporter at the time that he had moved to a small town outside Charleston, South Carolina. “There’s been a big turnover at TRL,” he wrote without detailing the reasons for his departure.
Harris is survived by two sisters, his grandfather, stepfather and nephews and nieces.

(Photo: Getty Images)A poll released Tuesday shows a dead heat between the top four Republican candidates vying to succeed former U.S. Rep. Mark Green in Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District. 
The poll, conducted by Spry Strategies for Americans for Prosperity Tennessee — a conservative political advocacy group — polled 500 registered voters in the district who said they plan to vote in the Oct. 7 primary. 
Williamson County state Reps. Gino Bulso of Brentwood and Lee Reeves of Franklin tied with 19.9% each when respondents were asked to select their preference during the Aug, 19 to Aug. 23 polling period. Dickson Rep. Jody Barrett followed with 18.6% and Matt Van Epps, former commissioner of the Tennessee Department of General Services, came in fourth with 15.9%. 
There was significant dropoff after Van Epps, with Montgomery County Commissioner Jason Knight coming in next with 7.9%. 
The poll has a 4.4% margin of error. 
Eleven Republicans, four Democrats and four independent candidates are competing for the chance to replace Green in Congress. The winners of the primary elections — and all the independents, who aren’t on the primary ballot — will face off in the Dec. 2 general election. 
The 7th District is made up of portions of Davidson, Williamson and Montgomery counties as well as 11 other counties in Middle and West Tennessee. It’s considered heavily favorable to Republicans even after 2021 redistricting drew in portions of traditionally Democratic Davidson County: President Donald Trump won the district in 2024 by 22.3%.
Typically, special elections draw lighter turnout than regularly-scheduled ones and wins are often predicated on how well a candidate turns their supporters out. Across the nation, Democrats have been faring well in special elections and Tennessee Democrats hope to pick up CD7. 
When asked what issue they most want the next congressman to focus on, respondents ranked “government corruption and the deep state” highest, with 22.7% of respondents citing it. 
The AFP poll was released in conjunction with Supertalk 99.7 WTN, which features nationally syndicated conservative talk shows. The two will host a debate among the Republican candidates on Sept. 5 in Nashville.

Cook highlighted the challenges the graduating class of 2023 have faced, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the Feb. 13 mass shooting on campus, but encouraged the graduates to savor moments of joy. (Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Less than a week after a Housing Finance Agency official came out against Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, accusing her of mortgage fraud, President Donald Trump has moved to fire Cook from her position, creating questions on whether the President had proper authority to do so. 
The president’s unprecedented move to terminate Cook is the latest maneuver in Trump’s campaign to pressure the Federal Reserve board to lower interest rates, while Board Chair Jerome Powell refuses to cave in to those demands.  
Under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, governors can only be removed “for cause” which is usually interpreted as some form of misconduct or negligence. In a letter posted to Truth Social Monday night, Trump cited the criminal referral submitted to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, writing that he “determined there is sufficient cause” to remove Cook from her position. 
Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, who made the referral, has made similar referrals against other Trump opponents, including Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who served as the lead prosecutor in Trump’s first impeachment and New York Attorney General Letitia James, who successfully pursued a civil fraud case against Trump for misrepresenting his assets in financial statements.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Cook however, remains defiant. In a statement to Politico she said, “President Trump purported to fire me ‘for cause’ when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so. I will not resign. I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022.”
Cook’s attorney, Abbe Lowell, who is also representing James as she faces her own mortgage fraud probe, said the president’s move is flawed, and lacks proper process, basis or legal authority. 
Cook was initially appointed by former President Joe Biden to fill an empty seat on the board, but was confirmed for an additional, full term in 2023.
Prior to serving on the board, Cook was a professor of economics and international relations at Michigan State University and a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research.
She also served as a senior economist on the Council of Economic Advisers under Democratic former President Barack Obama from 2011 to 2012 and as a senior adviser on finance and development in the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of International Affairs from 2000 to 2001.
In a statement, U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) slammed the president’s move to fire Cook, noting her status as the first Black woman to serve on the board. 
“To the extent anyone is unfit to serve in a position of responsibility because of deceitful and potentially criminal conduct it is the current occupant of the White House the American people are not buying your phony projection and slander of a distinguished public servant,” Jeffries said. 
Prior to Trump’s announcement Monday, U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Twp.) slammed the President’s push to oust Cook from the board. 
“What he’s trying to do is take control of the Federal Reserve Board so it is no longer an independent entity. The Federal Reserve has to be independent from politics,” Peters said, noting he would be angry if a president of any party was doing the same. 
“Donald Trump is taking every step he can to take control of an economy in a way that ultimately will bring it down and hurt all Americans,” Peters said. 
With Trump already working to fast track his pick to fill a vacant seat on the board of governors, Cook’s absence would give the president a chance to install a loyalist in her place.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AMR0336-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-26 10:57:32.775491

Rural residents will be hardest hit by looming health insurance premium increases, according to a new report. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)A combination of Trump administration policies will make health care coverage more expensive for people who purchase plans from health insurance marketplaces — and rural residents will be hit the hardest, according to a new analysis.
Researchers from the Century Foundation say Trump administration policies — especially its refusal to ask Congress to extend Biden-era tax credits that are set to expire at the end of this year — will boost out-of-pocket premiums by 93% in the 32 states that allow the federal government to operate their Affordable Care Act insurance marketplaces. New rules and tariffs will have a smaller impact.
Rural county residents in those states will see an increase of 107%, while residents of urban counties will pay 89% more, according to the analysis by the Century Foundation, a left-leaning research nonprofit.
Insurers participating in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces are proposing a median premium increase of 18% for 2026 — the biggest jump since 2018 and 11 points more than the growth from 2024 to this year. That bump would come on top of the increase resulting from the expiration of the tax credits and the other policy changes.
About 2.8 million people who are enrolled in marketplace plans in the 32 states live in rural counties, including 776,000 adults between the ages of 55 to 64 and more than 223,000 children, according to the Century Foundation.
In Oklahoma, 116,800 rural marketplace enrollees face price spikes, the analysis found.
“Rural residents tend to be older. They may be more likely to have chronic illness at the same time,” said Jeanne Lambrew, director of health care reform at the foundation. “It costs more, both because they have somewhat greater needs and less access to health care.”
The researchers calculated that average annual premiums for rural residents will increase by $760 — 28% more than the expected average increase for urban residents. States where rural enrollees are expected to see the highest cost increases are Wyoming ($1,943), Alaska ($1,835), and Illinois ($1,700).
Many of the states with a large number of rural residents have chosen not to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, meaning many people who earn between 100% and 138% of the federal poverty level, between $15,650 and $21,597 for an individual, get their coverage from an insurance marketplace, Lambrew said.
Of the seven states where 10% or more of rural residents are enrolled in marketplace plans (Alabama, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Wyoming), only two — Nebraska and North Carolina — have expanded Medicaid.
State officials in Pennsylvania recently advised residents who use the marketplace that they should closely examine the plans that are available.
“This year, even more than previous years, Pennsylvanians should consider shopping around to find the best plans to meet their individual needs, at a price that makes sense for their current financial situation,” Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner Michael Humphreys said in a statement released at the beginning of this month.
Lambrew said the increases will force many people to forgo insurance altogether.
“It’s harmful for those individuals in terms of their own health and life expectancy. It’s harmful for our providers, because they’re now dealing with people who are sicker and in the wrong settings, and it’s kind of expensive for our society,” Lambrew said.
“We know health insurance matters, so having these large potential increases on uninsured Americans is distressing.”

(Photo by Getty Images)A Latino civil rights organization that hopes to stop the Trump administration from denying in-state college tuition rates to immigrants without permanent legal status is intervening in a challenge to a Kentucky policy. 
The U.S. Department of Justice sued Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear and Kentucky education officials earlier this summer to stop the state from granting in-state college tuition rates to immigrants who lack permanent legal status. The department said an administrative regulation that allows those immigrants in-state tuition discriminates against U.S. citizens.
The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) filed a motion in the lawsuit on behalf of Kentucky Students for Affordable Tuition (KSAT). The group is an unincorporated association of college students who are immigrants lacking permanent legal status that qualify for in-state tuition. 
MALDEF’s motion says if the regulation is overturned, the students’ tuition could increase up to 152%. Some of the students’ rates will increase from $446 to $897 per semester credit hour. The students currently attend or plan to attend Kentucky public colleges and universities this fall. 
“The DOJ’s pattern of collusive lawsuits challenging affordable tuition for immigrant students is a nativist abuse of federal authority,” said Thomas A. Saenz, MALDEF president and general counsel, in a statement. “These laws have stood for years without challenge by administrations of both parties.”
When the Justice Department sued Kentucky, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said the lawsuit stems from a similar challenge in Texas. Since then, the department has filed lawsuits in Minnesota and Oklahoma. President Donald Trump previously signed an executive order directing administration offices to stop state and local laws that provide in-state tuition to immigrants but not out-of-state American citizens. 
MALDEF attempted to intervene in the Texas lawsuit on behalf of a group of students that faced higher tuition rates.
Kentucky Republicans have criticized Beshear for not stopping the state regulation. Earlier this year, Republican state Rep. T.J Roberts, of Burlington, filed a bill to undo the Kentucky policy. It didn’t get a committee hearing in the GOP-controlled state legislature.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-73976767-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-26 10:57:32.775491

Speaking about Hurricane Katrina feels almost like speaking at a funeral. There’s grief, memory and the weight of honoring both those who survived and those who did not. The storm was not just another hurricane. It was a turning point in countless lives, mine included.
The day before Katrina made landfall was a Sunday. I told my mother Lorna Rose Daniels to be ready at noon to evacuate our homes only blocks from the beach in Pass Christian. As we prepared to leave, my father Harold Thomas Daniels was busy moving vehicles out to my grandmother’s house in DeLisle.
Around noon, my mother, son and I left together. I told my son not to pack anything in the car because I was certain we would be back the next day. At that point, it felt like just another evacuation as we already had done several times that season. Tired of packing and unpacking the car, we left with only the clothes on our backs and a set of pajamas.
When I arrived at my mother’s house, she wanted to bring more things. I still clearly see her walking through her house with a bottle of holy water, sprinkling it in every room. “Mama, they said we have to go,” I told her.
She resisted, saying my father had not left yet. But I reminded her he was only shuttling cars to DeLisle. Finally, she came with me.
The plan was simple.  We would drive up U.S. Highway 49 to Wiggins, stay with a friend and come back the next day like always. But as the day wore on, plans changed. By 4 that afternoon, while the northbound lanes of Highway 49 were jammed with evacuees, our car was the only one headed south.

My mother had broken down crying. She wanted to go to her elderly mother,  who refused to leave her home. She couldn’t bear the thought of leaving her behind at her home in DeLisle about 10 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, but surrounded by water from the Bay of St. Louis.
That drive south is something I will never forget. Highway 49 north was bumper to bumper, but we were alone heading the other way. We turned onto state Highway 53 and stopped at a gas station. I remember buying milk for my son and a bag of ice, telling myself not to buy too much because we would be home the next day.
We made it to my grandmother’s house, the place we called “on the hill”.  My grandmother was in her 90s, and my aunt lived nearby. Family began to gather, parking cars on the high ground. That night we sat on the back porch, talking in the heat of late August, waiting for my father to arrive. He never did.
The first sign of how dangerous this storm would be came from a phone call. My cousin in Henderson Point, which is located on the Gulf, called his mother, my aunt, as the water rose rapidly around his home. He had stayed behind with his dog while his family evacuated, believing the storm would not be that bad.
By the time my aunt handed me the phone, he was standing on top of his van, with his dog, crying, as the water climbed around him. I still remember my aunt’s voice as she handed me her cellphone, ‘Here, I can’t listen anymore,” she said. I stayed on the line until it went dead. We thought we would never see him again.
The next morning, Katrina revealed her strength. Tin peeled off my grandmother’s roof as we huddled on the porch. At first, we even tried to collect the flying sheets so they wouldn’t damage the cars, but soon we realized the danger was far greater than we understood. As the hours passed, we could hear the wind speaking to us – unimaginable devastation.
Then the word spread. Pass Christian was gone. Just 10 miles away, an entire community had been destroyed. News spread fast that those who stayed behind were gone.
My daddy, who stayed at our home on Davis Avenue, was not heard from… not my daddy! Harold Daniels stayed behind along with my two brothers and a nephew. Within 15 minutes of water rising, it had reached its peak of 34 feet. People were asking all over, You saw this one who stayed? Have you seen that one? Who made it? Who didn’t? Where’s my daddy?
He was on the back of my nephew’s truck. They tied themselves to each other, and then to a tree and then watched the rush of houses floating by, cars floating by, appliances, trees. My daddy said if it had hit at night, they wouldn’t have survived. 
My daddy had 10 kids. His will to live and his faith in God brought him back to us. He passed on last year at 89.
For many people, anniversaries are a celebration of momentous occasions. Hurricane Katrina, however, is not something I celebrate.
What I celebrate is resilience, the strength to survive and rebuild. I celebrate Pass Christian and my father, who lived for almost 20 years after Katrina. I celebrate doing hard things, and the rebuilding of our close-knit community along the Gulf Coast. I celebrate the opportunity to rebuild.
The Coast is a state of mind. We love it here. It’s home.
Life in this community is centered around family. I’m very close to my family, and while disaster relief was not perfect, we were not overlooked. I remember people like Robin Roberts, the ABC personality, coming to the Pass not knowing if her family was safe. I remember the raw emotion of relief as she spoke on air. I still hear the tremble in her voice. 
The storm was catastrophic. Many families were destroyed by it, including my fourth-grade teacher, Ms. Lang, and her husband, who stayed and died. My cousin, who had been stranded on a roof with his dog, was found a day or two later on his brother’s porch.
I still get panic attacks when the weather gets severe or hurricanes are mentioned. I am not the only one with this fear. Plenty of people left the Coast, but I stayed because my parents did.
After Katrina, the community came together. People leaned on each other. Our town, Pass Christian, is small but resilient. I celebrate the strength of our community, and the role of faith in our recovery.
Even now, I keep holy water in my nightstand as a reminder that we can survive and do without many of the things we once thought we needed. Katrina taught us that we can live with less and still thrive.
The Gulf Coast is thriving. Streets like Davis Avenue, North Street and Scenic Drive are full of life. Survivors of Katrina continue to show love and care for their community.
While some people may mourn the anniversary of Katrina, I celebrate the resilience, faith, and unity that allowed us to recover. I celebrate the churches rebuilt, and I celebrate knowing that if something like Katrina comes again, we can survive it. We did once, and by God’s grace, we can do it again.

Tim Taylor, a Boonville Republican, chairs the Missouri House Special Interim Committee on Property Tax Reform. (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent)Property tax rates for this year must be set by Monday in Missouri’s 2,807 local political subdivisions authorized to impose levies.
That starts the annual billing cycle, with each county collector using those rates and the property values determined by the county assessor to generate tax bills mailed in October. 
By Dec. 31, every tax bill must be paid or penalties start accruing. 
That’s the simple part of the process. 
What is far more complex is the way rates are established. The starting point is the highest levy ever approved by voters within each city, county, school district or other agency.
Then mandatory adjustments are applied. They include factors such as real estate values, inflation, new construction, state sales tax revenue, car values, tax rate ceilings, tax rate floors, the Hancock Amendment, statutory limitations and some other things that make the list too long and confusing to continue.
Don’t worry. I’m here to help. 
Welcome to the latest installment of Rudi ’splains it, The Independent’s irregular column where I try to tackle the details of something we will be writing about a lot. I’ve had a lot of experience covering local governments as well as state government, and have attended the meetings where no one shows up for the required public hearing on tax rates.
Missouri governor allows more spending, property tax cap as he pursues stadium deal

But the public has been complaining to the Missouri Legislature as bills increase. Lawmakers have responded by allowing counties to freeze bills for senior citizens, and when they met in June to vote on a $1.5 billion stadium financing bill, the Missouri Senate added 97 clauses to limit increases in individual tax bills for most counties.
And in the Missouri House, a 20-member special committee has held a series of hearings around the state as they study how property taxes could be simplified and made more predictable. The final hearing is set for Wednesday in Macon.
Statewide revenue from property taxes was $7.8 billion in 2024, second only to the income tax as a source of public funding in Missouri. But almost all the money goes to local agencies, so the only place to find the total is at the bottom of State Auditor Scott Fitzpatrick’s annual report listing every taxing entity’s rates after they are checked by his staff for accuracy.
One of my techniques for clearing a room is being a know-it-all on tax policy and bragging that I understand the Hancock Amendment better than just about anybody. This is my attempt to be both informative and at least mildly entertaining enough to keep you reading to the end.
And don’t worry. I am not writing what I think I know. Often, what I think I know isn’t correct.
Everything that follows, like everything above, is factual — and I checked. 
 The Single Tax

At the beginning of the 20th century, Winston Churchill became enamored with the work of American economist Henry George, who was convinced that land, as the source of all wealth, is the only thing that should be taxed.
“With the growth of population, land grows in value, and the men who work it must pay more for the privilege,” George wrote.
In 1908, Churchill was in full agreement with George. He later rejected the philosophy, but at the time, In speech to the House of Commons, he laid out principles for taxation that are generally applicable to all taxes and concerned foremost with the public good.
“The great principle which this House ought to guard and cherish is that, when the tax collector comes to the private citizen and takes from him of his wealth for the service of the public, the whole of that money taken shall go for the purposes for which it is intended, and that no private interests, however powerfully they may be organized and however eloquently advocated, shall thrust their dirty fingers into the pie and take the profit for themselves.”
Taxes should be understandable and changed only after careful study, he said.
The principles “are very simple,” Churchill said. “A child can learn them; only a fool can misunderstand them.”
 Property tax terminology 

I’ll wait until you have a child handy to help you understand what comes next.
Got one? Good.
Every individual property tax rate is stated as a dollar amount with a four-digit decimal, charged for each $100 of assessed value. For example, the Columbia Public Schools rate in 2024 was $4.7476 per $100 of assessed value.
Missouri lawmakers begin dive into property tax problems

What goes into determining that rate are all the factors that control property taxes. We’ll start with the terms that cover the value subject to the levy and then list factors that set the actual rates.
Appraised value is the assessor’s estimate of market value for residential and commercial property, the productive value of farmland or the “blue book” value of motor vehicles and personal property. Assessed value is the percentage of appraised value actually taxed, 12% for agricultural land, 19% for residences, 32% for commercial property and 33.3% for most personal property.
Using that Columbia school rate, a $250,000 property would pay $1,424 if it is a farm, $2,255 for a residence and $3,798 for a commercial property.
Each taxing district has a tax rate ceiling that is the highest levy the governing board can impose. The actual levy can be equal to the ceiling or some lower rate, depending on the action of the governing board and mandatory adjustments. School districts have a tax rate floor and must have a levy of at least $2.75 per $100 to qualify for state aid
The Hancock Amendment (no connection to our editor) is the name for the changes to the Missouri Constitution approved in 1980 to limit growth in tax revenue and require voter approval for local tax and fee increases. When property values rise because of the reassessment process, the Hancock Amendment requires tax rates to change to prevent agencies from reaping a windfall of new revenue.
The Hancock Amendment factors that determine whether rates change are the value of new construction and the inflation rate.
School districts have a second adjustment factor, tied to the 1% statewide sales tax known as Proposition C for the ballot title it carried in 1982. Half of the revenue from the tax is used to lower school property tax rates. Some local sales taxes are also written to have a portion of the revenue offset property tax rates.
Finally, rates must be adjusted under a state statute that limits the new revenue to any taxing district from rising property values to 5% if inflation is higher than that level.
 Setting tax rates

When the Columbia City Council held its annual tax rate public hearing on Aug. 15, the only person who spoke was someone asking for a clarification when a staff member misspoke and said the sales tax rate was up for discussion.
The city staff calculated that the rate for 2025 after reporting that the assessed value of the city, after subtracting new construction, went up 7.3%. The allowed increase in total revenue from that tax base was limited to an inflation rate of 2.9%.
As a result, the rate was lowered from $0.4075 per $100 value to $0.3907 per $100.
The Columbia Board of Education, which held its tax rate hearing on Aug. 21, had the same factors — property values were up 7.3% and inflation was listed at 2.9% — as the tax rate ceiling was lowered from $5.0903 per $100 value to $4.89.12 per $100.
Then the calculation brings in the Proposition C adjustment. The district anticipates $26.2 million and as a result the actual levy will be $4.5643 per $100, down about 18 cents per $100 from 2024. In the 54 school districts with taxes at the $2.75 per $100 tax rate floor, Proposition C revenue does not mean a reduction in the tax rate.
If you are a Columbia taxpayer, you might be thinking you will see the total bill go down this year because of the reduced rates.
But remember: The rates are lowered just enough to allow total revenue to increase by 2.9% and reassessment can mean values — and total tax bills — in a popular area go up faster than locations with less desirable properties.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Tim-Taylor-tax-hearing-20250716-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-26 10:57:32.775491

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn was at Clive Behavioral Health Monday to introduce legislation he said could help more students earn nursing degrees and allow veteran nurses to become mentors for the next generation — all with the intent of making a dent in the national nursing shortage.
The Train More Nurses Act, introduced during the 2023-2024 legislative session, would direct the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Labor to review all grants offered by either division relating to the nurse workforce.
The departments would then develop a report recommending changes to these grant programs to aim them toward any of three goals listed in the legislation — to increase nursing faculty, especially in underserved areas; create routes for nurses with at least 10 years of experience to teach in nursing programs and strengthening the pipeline for licensed practical nurses to become registered nurses.
“For folks, whether it’s mental health or whether it’s critical frontline health, having a nurse on the floor is one of the best ways to not only drive down health care risk for the patient, but also ensure that we have successful communities marching forward,” Nunn said.
Sasha Khosravi, chief medical officer of Clive Behavioral Health, described nurses as “the true heartbeat of any hospital,” as they spend nearly all of their time with patients, communicating and taking care of them. “I rely a lot on the nursing staff here,” Khosravi said. “They truly do a lot of work that’s tremendously important for the healing of our patients here.”
Clive Behavioral Health is a 100-bed facility that offers treatment to children and adults struggling with behavioral health disorders. In the five years since its opening, CEO Kevin Pettit said the clinic has grown familiar with the strain that having a limited nursing staff can cause among employees and the facility itself.

Nunn first announced the legislation in October 2023 and said Monday it has passed through one chamber of Congress — and the fact that the nursing shortage is an issue both sides of the aisle can get behind will hopefully help it see passage in the future.
Nunn said the President Donald Trump has indicated to him that he is “very in favor” of focusing on workforce development this year.
According to data from the American Nurses Association cited by Nunn, there is a 100,000-nurse shortfall in the across the country, and in Iowa around 70% of health care facilities report problems in filling open nursing positions. Most of the frontline nurses working in Iowa are over the age of 50, he added.
The challenges faced by the health care industry with the nursing shortage come from multiple directions, Nunn said, and can be at least partially addressed by expanding access to education.
There is a “chokepoint” present in nursing education, Nunn said, where students interested in pursuing a career in the field can’t get into a program because there aren’t enough faculty to teach them. By pointing grant dollars toward helping nurses advance their careers while assisting others getting into the profession, Nunn said more early-career nurses will be able to fill the gaps in the workforce.
Kendra Richards, who works as a nurse in the behavioral health center’s intake department, said education is key to solving problems in the nursing workforce. Many nurses are “leaving the bedside” of patients due to staffing shortages, she said.
“It puts a lot of hardships on the nurses that are there and willing to provide excellent care, and so I think this act will hopefully encourage other nurses that are going through school and that kind of thing to really get excited about nursing again,” Richards said.

(Photo courtesy of the Administrative Office of the District Attorneys)The top prosecutor in Southern New Mexico’s largest city wants lawmakers to help him eliminate a special rule requiring criminal cases in his jurisdiction to be resolved more quickly.
Third Judicial District Attorney Fernando Macias on Monday presented data to lawmakers at a meeting in Las Cruces showing high rates of judges in his area dismissing cases because his office missed the strict deadlines under a two-year-old special rule imposed by the New Mexico Supreme Court. Macias asked lawmakers to intervene.
According to Macias’ presentation to the Courts, Corrections and Justice Committee, trial court judges in his area have dismissed more than 700 cases due to missed deadlines under the high court’s “case management order” since it went into effect in July 2023.
“Under this order, cases get dismissed more frequently than what they should,” Macias told the committee. He said there should be a “review” of the case management order in his area “to rethink what it is that we’re trying to accomplish.”
Macias said the case management order is strict, has very little flexibility and prosecutors must meet an “exceedingly high bar” to deviate from it.
Macias joins other local prosecutors who told the committee this summer they want the orders either changed or lifted entirely. The most recent case management order, affecting the First Judicial District in Santa Fe, Los Alamos and Rio Arriba counties, will go into effect in January.
A spokesperson for the Administrative Office of the Courts, the state agency that runs the court system, was not available for comment on Monday.
The Law Offices of the Public Defender supports case management orders because without them, cases can languish for as long as a year, Chief Public Defender Bennet Baur told the committee.
“Lawyers are human beings, and human beings tend to put things off,” Baur said. “Case management orders don’t increase the number of cases, it just makes them move more expeditiously.”
He said it can be difficult for both prosecutors and public defenders to transition when a case management order first comes to an area, but once they do, “it’s swifter justice” for defendants and victims.
Committee Chair Sen. Joseph Cervantes (D-Las Cruces) said the Supreme Court imposes case management orders in some areas “because district attorneys are doing a poor job.”
“Sometimes these case management orders have been put in place because of some pretty strong disagreement between the judiciary and the prosecutors in certain districts, including this district in the past, and we should at least acknowledge that,” Cervantes said.
Rep. Dayan Hochman-Vigil (D-Albuquerque) said every judicial district court has the discretion whether to adopt a case management order, and asked Macias what he wants lawmakers to do. He responded by saying that they could pass a memorial or a resolution asking courts to reconsider case management orders.
“Certainly the Legislature has that prerogative to encourage the study or reassessment,” he said.

(Photo courtesy of National Conference of State Legislatures)BOSTON — In some of his first public comments since being shot in an attempted assassination, Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman urged fellow lawmakers to refocus on the true purpose of public service.
“We can’t let the evil of the night win, and we must redouble our efforts and reclaim the reason we are all public servants,” he said.
That means listening to one another, extending understanding even in disagreement, and finding compromise: “not because it’s easy, but because the people we serve deserve better than constant stalemate built on partisan egos. They deserve solutions.”
Hoffman appeared via video message before thousands of lawmakers and staffers gathered at the National Conference of State Legislatures summit earlier this month in Boston. In June, he and his wife were shot in their Minnesota home just before the politically motivated shooter killed state Rep. Melissa Hortman, the former House speaker, her husband, Mark, and their dog, Gilbert.
The June shooting hung over this year’s meeting of the NCSL, a group that labors to maintain a reputation for bipartisan and nonpartisan work. Lawmakers in attendance on the left and the right repeatedly lamented the toxicity of American politics and the growing threat of political violence at local levels of government.
Many lawmakers raised questions about whether public service is still worth it, how state governments can buck the partisanship that defines Washington, D.C., and what measures lawmakers should take to keep members safe. Most lawmakers said they remained committed to serving, but they said conservatives and liberals must find ways to disagree without demonizing their opposition and do better at monitoring the rhetoric of members of their own parties.
Wisconsin House Speaker Robin Vos, a Republican, said the vitriol of social media and cable news has made it more difficult to talk with people of differing beliefs. Technology has reduced the frequency of many human interactions, he said. Even the rise of video doorbells has made it difficult for candidates and officials to talk with everyday constituents in person, as many refuse to answer.
“So instead of knocking on doors and meeting strangers, you have a tendency to go to party events where you are meeting people who want to come and meet you,” he said. “Well, they come from usually one end of the spectrum. They’re people who are probably paying too much attention to politics and not enough to all the other things in the world.”
Author and media personality Michael Smerconish asked Vos whether the current climate pushes good candidates away and incentivizes “zealots” to run.
“That’s a really good point,” Vos responded. “Part of my job is to recruit candidates, and it is very challenging to get people who are willing to put their personal life on the line and convince their family that there is nothing more fun to do on a Sunday morning than to go to a pancake breakfast.”
He said potential candidates are worried about how their kids will be treated in school and what effect running could have on their careers. But he said state governments can model a more civil political tone and show how government works. Even simple moves like holding bipartisan meetings with staff — rather than holding separate caucus meetings — can help to forge more positive relationships.
“We are places where people can disagree, but we don’t have to be hateful,” he said. “And maybe, just maybe, over time we’ll be able to showcase to the rest of the country that that’s the way that legislatures lead.”
 ‘Hold people accountable’

Since the June shooting in Minnesota, liberal and conservative states alike are considering measures to bolster protections for candidates and elected officials.
Legislation proposed in New Jersey would prohibit the publication of home addresses of lawmakers, adding them to a list of protected officials that includes judges and law enforcement. That legislation remains in committee.
ln North Dakota, lawmakers are considering establishing a more formal process for reporting threats, the North Dakota Monitor reported. A North Dakota man was charged in June with sending threatening messages to officials in which he referenced the Minnesota shootings. Legislative staff have already removed the home addresses of lawmakers from the legislative website and are considering providing post office boxes for lawmaker mail and creating new safety training.
Pennsylvania lawmakers will soon introduce a package of bills to boost legislator safety, limit their public exposure and ensure representation if a lawmaker dies while in office, the Pennsylvania Capital-Star reported.
In Oregon, House Speaker Julie Fahey said lawmakers and staff are thinking more about personal safety. State law doesn’t allow candidates to use campaign funds for security purposes, but the Democratic speaker said the legislature may soon change that.
During an NCSL session about the cost of public service, Fahey referenced protesters’ 2020 armed breach of the state Capitol in Salem and noted that she’d had an angry constituent show up at her home.
She said lawmakers and staffers need to talk more about the cost of their work, which can be isolating, especially for those in leadership positions.
“I think it’s really important that we talk about the threats and we talk about the impact,” she said.
Sitting next to her, West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said it’s not just personal safety that weighs on lawmakers.
It’s just as taxing on spouses and families — who he said are “front and center” in any conversation about running for office nowadays.
When he first assumed his leadership position in 2018, Hanshaw said he saw his job as mostly confined to running the chamber and worrying only about the behavior of members in their official capacity. But his thinking has evolved in this political environment, which he said requires modeling and monitoring of personal behavior and online activity of members of his caucus.
“That was the wrong approach,” he told Stateline. “And I would say that to anyone who’s coming into one of these roles: You need to set the example and you need to hold people accountable.”
 ‘What is your why?’

Pennsylvania Democratic House Speaker Joanna McClinton said the current political environment is markedly different because officials at all levels of government can be targets.
“And what we must all collectively do is to condemn the violence, to bring the tone of rhetoric down and out of our capitols, and most importantly let folks know that we can always agree to disagree, but we can never, ever allow there to be violence in discourse,” she said in an interview.
While the climate has not deterred her from serving, McClinton said it does provide an opportunity to underscore the solemnity of public service and helps frame a candidate’s purpose for running and deciding whether it’s worthwhile.
“What is your why?” she said she increasingly asks potential candidates. “What is your purpose? What do you plan to achieve, to accomplish? Why is it that you want to do this?”
Tim Storey, the chief executive officer of NCSL, said state legislatures are more bipartisan than many realize. Even in dogged legislative fights, many bills ultimately pass with support from both sides — or even unanimously.
“There’s a relatively small group who just demonize the other side,” he said in an interview. “I think for the most part, they still see each other as humans who are actually in a really unique job, and so only they can understand each other and the sacrifice and the pressure that gets put on by the public exposure.”
He said that was especially true following Hortman’s assassination.
“They felt it across the aisle of both parties,” he said.
Storey said NCSL’s Boston summit was a record-breaker with more than 1,600 state lawmakers and thousands more staffers and lobbyists in attendance.
The event kicked off with two of Minnesota’s top legislative leaders — a Democrat and a Republican — on stage in front of a packed ballroom talking about the assassination.
Republican House Speaker Lisa Demuth said Hortman had always treated her as a partner rather than an adversary. With mutual trust and respect, they could “disagree without being disagreeable,” she said.
State Sen. Erin Murphy, the Democratic majority leader, said politicians must turn down the vitriol in their rhetoric.
“I think a lot of America would appreciate that. I know Melissa would,” she told the crowd.
But she said lawmakers must also root out dehumanizing narratives and conspiracy theories that have led to the radicalization of so many individuals.
“We can’t lose faith in each other. We can’t lose faith in America,” she said. “As Melissa taught us, failure is not an option.”

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)As Indiana lawmakers head to Washington, D.C., t0day for a White House meeting on multiple issues including redistricting, a new statewide poll shows most Hoosiers don’t want to see the state’s congressional maps redrawn mid-decade.
The survey of 1,662 registered voters, conducted Aug. 18–21 by left-leaning Change Research, found that just 34% of respondents initially supported redrawing maps this year, while 52% opposed the idea — of those, 43% said they were “very opposed.”
After reviewing arguments for and against the move, sometimes called push polling, support among survey respondents dropped further to 29%, with opposition climbing to 60%.
“Hoosiers play fair. When D.C. outsiders change the rules in the middle of the game, it makes it clear the system is rigged and discourages participation,” said Jalyn Radziminski, founder and president of Count US IN, which commissioned the poll. “This poll makes it clear that Hoosiers don’t want outsiders meddling with our maps. They want lawmakers to address the issues that affect us: high cost of living, spiraling energy prices and property taxes.”
Count US IN aims to increase political participation — particularly of minorities and marginalized communities — by encouraging voter turnout, educating citizens on voting rights and protections and combating voter suppression, according to its website.
About 60% of respondents rated inflation among their top three priorities, according to the poll. Only 7% of survey takers said redrawing legislative maps was a top priority.

Indiana Redistricting Survey Memo _ August 2025
Indiana officials face mounting pressure from the White House and national Republican operatives to consider a special session for new, early maps. Supporters maintain the effort could strengthen the GOP’s congressional majority ahead of the 2026 midterms — part of a broader national strategy to lock in more favorable districts in Republican-controlled states.
Critics, however, argue that a mid-decade redraw would disenfranchise other voters — and set a precedent that political parties can redistrict whenever it’s politically convenient. A rally against early redistricting, organized by Common Cause Indiana, is scheduled for Tuesday evening at the Indiana Statehouse.
Of the anti-redistricting arguments presented in the poll, the one that Hoosier survey respondents found “most convincing” contends that legislators “should spend less time on redistricting, and more on making life better for Indiana’s residents.” Overall, 84% of survey takers found that argument convincing.
Three in four respondents were additionally “strongly resistant” to out-of-state politicians “meddling in our state politics or telling us what to do.”
About 45% of respondents said they would be less likely to vote for legislators who supported a mid-decade redraw, compared to just 23% who said they would be more likely.
“Hoosiers see this outsider push as a solution in search of a problem,” Radziminski said. “Our local communities fought tirelessly to ensure their voices were heard when these maps were drawn four years ago. The only people who will benefit from redrawing them now are political puppeteers who live 600 miles away.”

(Photo by Rob Lipkin/University of Alaska Anchorage Natural Heritage Program, provided by Center for Biological Diversity)Officials at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have declined to advance the listing of the Alaskan glacier buttercup flower as threatened or endangered, saying there is little evidence that a planned nearby graphite mine or climate change are threatening the flower.
The service published its determination Monday in the Federal Register alongside seven other petitions for environmental protection. Six of the petitions were deemed worthy of further study; the buttercup and the eastern population of the golden eagle were denied further review.
“We know this administration doesn’t think that climate change is a problem. It’s disappointing but it’s not surprising that they really chose to dismiss the bulk of the climate change problem here,” said Cooper Freeman, who filed the buttercup petition for the Center for Biological Diversity, a national environmental group active in Alaska. 
In most cases, Endangered Species Act protection for an animal or plant will result in development restrictions in areas where that animal or plant lives.
The Alaskan glacier buttercup has been found on only a handful of rocky slopes within the Kigluaik Mountains of the Seward Peninsula.
Those slopes are near the planned site of Graphite One, a planned graphite mine intended to supply raw material for high-tech battery manufacturers outside the state. 
Last year, the Center for Biological Diversity asked the federal government to protect the buttercup, citing both long-term climate change and the prospect that the mine could disrupt the flower’s habitat.
But in its analysis, the Service concluded that there is no evidence so far that construction of the mine or its supporting infrastructure would disturb the slopes where the flower can be found.
While there is some evidence that the flower could be affected by climate change and thus warrant protection, the service concluded that it isn’t clear whether climate change affecting the buttercup’s sister species would also affect the Alaskan subspecies.
“Based on our review of the petition, sources cited in the petition, and other readily available information, we find that the petition does not provide substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that listing the Alaskan glacier buttercup (Ranunculus glacialis subsp. alaskensis) as a threatened species/an endangered species may be warranted,” wrote the staff of the Northern Alaska Fish and Wildlife Field Office in their final analysis.
Freeman, speaking Monday by phone, said the filing was not intended to interfere with construction of the graphite mine, though he doesn’t think the mine is a good idea.
Instead, he said, the petition was one of a number of measures the center is taking in an attempt to protect plants and animals that form the foundation of Arctic ecosystems.
Other animals and plants can simply move north, or to higher elevations when their environment warms, he explained. 
“For species in the Arctic, you’re already at the north end. There’s nowhere to go,” he said.
Freeman said he was alarmed by a 2023 scientific paper that estimated that by 2040, more than 60% of plant species common to the Beringian Arctic — the area around the Bering Strait — could lose some or all of their survivable range due to a warming climate.
“We could be looking at a complete demolition of the base of the Beringian Arctic ecosystem in 15 years. That’s astounding,” he said.
The paper examined 66 species of plants, and while the buttercup wasn’t one of them, he believes it’s similar enough to be threatened by the changing environment.
“We are trying to ring the alarm bells that if we don’t get a handle on this soon, it’s going to be bleak,” he said.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/RSRanunculus-glacialis-ssp-e1756169315749-1024x789.jpg,,,2025-08-26 09:58:28.209492

The Connecticut Department of Transportation (DOT) owns numerous parcels of land, and wants to find new ways to use them, according to Deputy Transportation Commissioner Laoise King.
“We know that housing is something that we are really lacking in Connecticut, and this is a way that the state can use its assets to help alleviate some of that burden,” King said.
The department is currently accepting design applications from private development firms to reconfigure the Stamford Transportation Center.
The 11-acre site serves more than 5 million bus and rail travelers annually, and is in need of infrastructure updates and upgrades to meet growing demand.
DOT is seeking designs that include redevelopment of the station and the surrounding parcels, including sites that were previously large parking lots, King said.
King said the department is open to various models, but the design must incorporate affordable housing.
“We want to make sure that there is a housing component, but we’re also open to office, retail and institutional use, a cultural center, et cetera,” King said.
A portion of the homes will have to be affordable for families earning no more than 30% of the area’s median income, the level set by a state Department of Economic and Community Development affordable housing policy.
As far as the look of the development, King said they’re open to any combination of housing and infrastructure, such as an apartment building above the train station or a mixed-use development adjacent to the facility.
“We can leverage what we are doing to help with housing, to help with the economy, to help create and build neighborhoods, to help reconnect communities, to make sure that what we are doing is resilient and helps the environment,” King said.
DOT is accepting design applications until December and plans to select a developer in February, King said. The project won’t be complete for several years, but King said rail and bus service will not be interrupted.
The redevelopment is a “once-in-a-generation” chance to create a new transportation hub, DOT Commissioner Garrett Eucalitto said. The development will meet the evolving needs of travelers.
“By reimagining this property, we can deliver new housing, enhanced transit amenities, and commercial and retail spaces that will serve residents and visitors for decades to come,” Eucalitto said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG_0213-scaled.jpg,,,2025-08-26 09:58:28.209492

In the midst of political attacks and two lawsuits, Department for Children and Families secretary Laura Howard and Gov. Laura Kelly pushed back against federal demands because they don’t know how Kansans’ personal data will be used. The release of information isn’t about detecting fraud because those procedures are already in place, Howard said. 
The state has denied requests to turn over personal information of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service has requested since May. 
Since then, Kansas House Speaker Dan Hawkins has accused Howard and Kelly of a “massive cover-up of waste, fraud and abuse” because they failed to comply with federal demands.
But Howard said in an interview that the federal government already monitors the Kansas SNAP program for such problems.
“The federal SNAP law today allows data to be shared for the administration of the program, including fraud, waste and abuse,” she said. 
However, the law is also clear the data cannot be shared “except as it relates to the administration of the program,” Howard said. 
The first letter received from Food and Nutrition Service in May did not include information about how the data would be used, which led to DCF’s initial refusal, she said. 
 
Lawsuit outcome
A lawsuit was filed in June by privacy organizations arguing against the data collection, followed by a July lawsuit filed by multiple states asking the courts to stay the data request, Howard said. 
“USDA makes this demand for the stated purpose of detecting ‘overpayments and fraud,’ ” the state lawsuit said. “Instead, the move appears to be part of the federal government’s well-publicized campaign to amass enormous troves of personal and private data, including information on taxpayers and Medicaid recipients, to advance goals that have nothing to do with combating waste, fraud, or abuse in federal benefit programs.”
Howard said she is concerned about what could happen based on the lawsuit outcome. 
“I honestly believe that if I were to release that data, then the courts find in favor of the states, then I’m putting the state at liability for releasing the personal information of more than 700,000 Kansans,” she said. 
In a legislative meeting earlier this month, state Attorney General Kris Kobach said his office is exploring whether it is legal for Kansas to withhold the information requested. 
“Attorneys in the office of the attorney general are investigating the matter. A decision about how to proceed is expected to be made within the next three weeks,” spokeswoman Danedri Herbert said Thursday.  
 
Federal Register
Howard said additional concerns about whether the data should be released occurred in June when the USDA published the request for data, highlighting the intention to create a SNAP information database in the Federal Register. 
“The notice in the Federal Register talks about 10 or 12 uses of the data, and one of those talks about sharing it with other federal entities,” Howard said. “It talks about things to do with anything regulatory or civil or criminal. It doesn’t say for the purpose of administering the SNAP program.”
The list is too broad and underlines DCF’s concerns, Howard said.
Titled “Notice of a new system of records,” the Federal Register notice said: “The primary purposes of this system are to validate the accuracy of eligibility determinations and strengthen SNAP and government program integrity.”
The notice lists 11 categories of “routine” uses of the records. 
 
SNAP error rate
A point raised by Hawkins and Senate president Ty Masterson, who want the data turned over, is that the state has a high error rate in the SNAP program and the sharing of data would help discover fraud or abuse. 
Hawkins has repeatedly referred to an inaccurate current error rate in the SNAP program and insists the sharing the data could help lower the rate.  But that rate isn’t about fraud detection, which Howard said is already occurring in the SNAP program. 
Hawkins did not respond to a request for comment for this story.
Howard said a robust fraud detection system is already in place in partnership with the USDA, and account data is freely shared for that purpose. In fact, of all federal funds processed through DCF, she said SNAP and Medicaid have the most extensive programs looking for any problems. 
Medicaid isn’t as complicated to process as the SNAP benefits are because staff are only determining whether the applicant is eligible, Howard said. With SNAP, they’re also figuring out how much the payment should be. 
“States are responsible for conducting these quality control processes,” she said. “There are samples of cases that are drawn every month. We have quality control staff that look at those cases. They’re essentially redetermining that eligibility from scratch, and that includes verifications.”
Once quality control staff go through the detailed information collected from SNAP applicants, which includes income, shelter, work and household member information, they determine whether mistakes were made. 
“Then the feds look at a sample of our sample, just to verify that our quality control is accurate,” Howard said.
It’s not about finding fraud because the error rate is attributed to mistakes, Howard said.
“None of it’s about fraud,” she said. “If, in the context of the original determination, if a worker believed that someone was being untruthful, then we have a separate process to refer that for a fraud investigation.”
Multiple factors go into determining whether someone is eligible for SNAP and how much they should receive, including all assets, income, shelter costs, whether they must be working, if roommates are contributing to utilities and much more, Howard said. Simple things like a teenager who works at a fast-food restaurant turning 18, which means their income should be added to household income, can cause eligibility errors.   
 
Error rate increases
The Kansas error rate climbed in the last few years, and Howard said she wishes there was a “magic bullet answer” to how to correct it. 
The DCF team is working on retraining staff, rewriting manuals to make sure they’re clear, training staff to interview applicants, among other items. 
“We’ve done a whole root cause analysis based on our error rate,” Howard said. “We have to do that for the feds. States have to submit corrective action plans. We know that the areas where we see the most errors have to do with wages and income and shelter deductions. So then, based on that, you train even more in that area.”
The agency is considering automation that may help reduce errors, she said, as well as encouraging more people to use the online application form. That could help reduce data processing typos and misunderstandings that occur when staff interview someone and then enter the information.  
In its most recent report for 2024, the state reduced its error rate from 12% in 2023 to just under 10%. 
The error rate jumped after the COVID-19 pandemic, when Howard said many experienced workers who had performed eligibility work for years retired. The error rate in 2017 was 3.9%, jumping to 5.9% in 2018 and 7.1% in 2019. The target is to achieve error rates below 5%. 
No data is available on the USDA website for 2020 and 2021. In 2022, the rate jumped to 9%, followed by 12% in 2023, which is the highest rate in more than 15 years.
“We were very short staffed for a couple of years,” Howard said. “That really has started to turn around, particularly in some of our regions, and I would attribute that to a number of things. The state’s had some nice salary increases based on some of the market assessments, and then I think things just kind of stabilized after COVID.”
In 2024, there were 205 eligibility workers on average processing applications and confirming eligibility throughout the state, she said. 
“I wish I could say, ‘Well, we’re doing these three really glitzy things,’ ” Howard said. “We’re doing hard things. There are a lot of things going on.”
In reality, it comes down to worker training, making sure paperwork is filled out correctly, with the right questions being asked, and then verifying all information, she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Laura-Howard-20250820_135927-1024x661.jpg,,,2025-08-26 09:58:28.209492

“We continue to be a place that people want to come and work,” said Bruce Stebbins, acting chair of the Cannabis Control Commission in a Q&A about his reappointment to the board. 
The post Back for another term: Bruce Stebbins on his reappointment to the cannabis commission and his vision for the coming five years appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE ACTING CHAIR of the Cannabis Control Commission, Bruce Stebbins, is looking at another five years on the board of an agency that is currently two members short and has seen many leadership challenges in just the past two years.
On Aug. 13, Stebbins was reappointed to the commission by Governor Maura Healey, Attorney General Andrea Campbell, and Treasurer Deborah B. Goldberg, who all gave him a vote of confidence for his leadership ability. Under the law, commissioners serve five-year terms and are capped at two terms.
The state agency has experienced ongoing dysfunction since Treasurer Deborah Goldberg suspended former Commission Chair Shannon O’Brien in September 2023. In the year following, the commission did not have a designated chair, and the commissioners haggled over who would take the position temporarily in public meetings.
Goldberg eventually fired O’Brien and appointed Stebbins as the acting chair. (O’Brien is fighting Goldberg’s decision in court so in the meantime, the treasurer hasn’t appointed a permanent replacement for O’Brien.) The agency was without an executive director for over a year after Shawn Collins quit in November 2023. The agency hired Travis Ahern to take on the post starting in March of this year.
Both Ahern and Stebbins have said that the Legislature has not provided the Cannabis Control Commission – which has seen regulatory delays, allegations of harassment, uncollected fees – with adequate funding to meet its oversight and operational needs. Inspector General Jeffrey Shapiro, the state’s inspector general, has called the agency a “rudderless ship.”
Nurys Camargo left the commission in May, leaving the board with two vacancies. Ava Callender Concepcion – whose position is appointed by the attorney general – is approaching the end of her term in January 2026. Kimberly Roy still has nearly a year before her term ends in July 2026. Neither Concepcion nor Roy have been reappointed yet.
CommonWealth Beacon spoke with Stebbins about his experience on the commission and what his vision is for the next five years. The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.  
CWB: Why have you decided to take on this role as a commissioner again?
Stebbins: I’ve enjoyed working with this new industry. It’s exciting. It’s dynamic. It’s entrepreneurial. Being an effective regulator in a climate like that is a challenge I’m really interested in tackling. I’ve really enjoyed working with this team of professionals. As you know, we’ve added some new faces since even the beginning of this year, and I’m looking forward to continuing to work with all of them.
CWB: There have been many criticisms leveled at the CCC – that CCC has been slow at passing regulations like the two-driver rule change, which removed the requirement that any cannabis delivery be made with two drivers in the vehicle, or that it’s taken a while for social consumption to get off the ground. Is there something the CCC and potentially you could have done better?
Stebbins: We did hear the criticisms of why it took so long to change the two-agent rule, why we’re still working on social consumption.
I would push back a little bit and say, you know, it’s not just hearing one set of voices or one side of the argument. I think what the commission has really done well and effectively is [try] to engage a really broad range of stakeholders. With the two-agent rule, we heard a lot from delivery licensees, but I think for myself and for my colleagues, it was important to hear from the public safety community and [get] a little bit of experience under our belt and to see how the [regulations] are actually working before we decide to change it.
That kind of thoughtful approach, I think, leads to better decision making. I also think it leads to confidence that folks can have in this agency and how we’re regulating.
CWB: Are there things that the CCC could have done better in the past five years from your perspective?
Stebbins: We are an agency that is maturing. We are far from being a startup agency that we were even four or five years ago. We are keeping up with a bigger marketplace and currently still having our budget flatlined over the last couple years [by the Legislature].
We continue to learn. We continue to strive to be a better agency. Folks may look at us and say, ‘Well, you took too long to do this.’ I’d like to keep thinking that we did it in a thoughtful, diligent way when we’ve made some of these big changes.
CWB: There have been allegations of harassment at the CCC. Now that you are a leader there, what changes are you making to create a better work environment?
Stebbins: I’ve heard those criticisms. I think if all of us continue to bring an approach of being collaborative and respectful in the workplace, and appreciate people’s differing opinions and points of view, we continue to be a place that people want to come and work despite some of those criticisms.
When we post a job, we get hundreds of resumes. So people are still anxious to come and work for us. But I think as long as I take this responsibility myself and extend it to other leaders within the commission, we can continue to work towards a collaborative, respectful workplace. Some of those issues that came up in the past will certainly be behind us.
CWB: What have you learned from being the acting chair for the past year?
Stebbins: I continue to learn a lot. I think even prior to being appointed acting chair there was still a lot to learn about the industry.
The one major difference for me is that as chair, you get to set the agenda. I set the meeting agenda, but I don’t necessarily set the policy agenda. And that’s something I continue to do with my colleagues. I look forward to having that continued collaboration with my colleagues to address new issues and also at the same time to welcome opportunities for our team to put issues forward. Because many of them are out there inspecting and doing regulatory work with our licensees every day, and they’re living and breathing our regulations every day. We want to look to them to be a resource as to what we should consider changing or fixing. That’s a big responsibility as chair.
CWB: If the treasurer were to name you permanent chair, would you accept that role?
Stebbins: If I’m offered the permanent role, I’ll accept it, and at the same time, we’ll just continue to do the good work that we’re doing.
CWB: What’s your vision for the next five years, and what do you hope the CCC can accomplish?
Some of what I’ve shared with you is what I hope we can continue – the collaborative workspace, how do we address challenges before they pop up, and how do we address opportunities that we might see.
I want to make sure that we roll out social consumption safely and with a compliant implementation. I’ve talked with my colleagues, and our team is collaborating to see what in our regulations needs to be kind of modernized and updated.
Knowing that we’re seven to eight years in now, we should be looking at the regulations that the inaugural set of commissioners stood up and seeing if they’re still required, how they’re functioning and operating. We’re looking to modernize our regulations – are things still needed? Where can we also offer some clarity both to the industry and for our inspectors?

(Photo by Seanna Adcox/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A potential new state forest, an expansion to South Carolina’s most popular heritage preserve, and a smaller campground than expected at a state park are among projects under consideration after approval from state legislators.
Altogether, the conservation projects total more than 3,200 new acres. The plans received an initial OK last week by the Joint Bond Review Committee, a legislative panel that reviews state purchases. More state approvals are needed before plans can officially advance.
New state forest
A new state forest could be in the works as the state Forestry Commission examines 2,800 acres spanning Beaufort, Jasper and Hampton counties, according to meeting documents.
The possible forest, which was the largest conservation project on the agenda, was in a prime spot for development. The Buckfield property, as officials called it, is near Interstate 95 and two state highways in a fast-growing part of the state. Conservation in that area has been underway, including the nearby Coosawhatchie Heritage Preserve, a nearly 11,000-acre expanse of preserved land that opened to the public last September.
The state would pay an estimated $8 million for the land, which conservation nonprofit Open Space Institute would buy for $20 million before selling it to the Forestry Commission at that reduced price, according to documents submitted to the committee.
Like in the existing five state forests, the commission would use sustainable methods to continue harvesting trees. The forest would also open for researchers and visitors looking to enjoy some time in nature, according to the meeting documents.
Conservation groups have proposed two other tracts of land as possible state forests this year. The Nature Conservancy bought a property in Jasper County in May with plans to sell it to the Forestry Commission. A week later, Open Space Institute bought 1,644 acres in Dorchester County, also with plans to open them as a state forest, the group said.
The last time a new state forest opened was in 2004, when the Forestry Commission acquired 12,000-acre Wee Tee State Forest in Williamsburg and Georgetown counties.
The deal is far from complete. The Forestry Commission must still survey the land to determine whether it would be a good fit for the state, as well as receive further approvals from state officials to move forward with any sort of purchase.
Campsite plans reduced
Rising construction costs could mean fewer new campsites at Lake Warren State Park, according to the Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism. The department received approval last October to use $1 million for 10 to 15 campsites, but that money won’t go as far as anticipated. The number has shrunk to four, according to the revised plans.
Plans for two camper cabins, which include beds, heating, air-conditioning and lights, were also scrapped, according to an adjusted plan. A bathhouse is still in the works, giving campers access to restrooms and showers.
Camping is already available at Lake Warren State Park for $22 per night, but the department describes it as “VERY primitive.” The only amenity to the camping is drinkable water, according to the park’s website.
A campsite with access to power, water and sewer would be a step up for an estimated 42,000 people who visit the park annually, often to fish, boat on the 440-acre lake or watch birds, department officials wrote in their initial request.
“There is a large amount of potential with this park, but it is presently a day use park that would benefit from a campground that could help to increase visitation within the county,” the request read. “This may also help to alleviate pressure on other parks within the South Carolina State Park System.”
Heritage preserve expansions
Two state-owned preserves could get bigger following approvals from the committee.

Charleston County’s Botany Bay Heritage Preserve, the most popular of more than 70 such preserves statewide, is expected to grow by about 180 acres — to 3,543 acres total — after the committee approved a slight adjustment to the total acreage the Department of Natural Resources expects to receive.
Open Space Institute bought the land on Edisto Island in 2022 before donating it to the Department of Natural Resources following surveys. It includes more than one mile of frontage along Botany Bay Road and Highway 174, a National Scenic Byway.
The donation “secures the entrance to one of the most beloved and heavily visited nature preserves in the state,” Open Space Institute said in a news release at the time.
Protecting the property will help the agency protect one of the streams flowing into the heritage preserve, allowing as little pollution as possible to enter the area, according to the nonprofit. The expansion will also create more opportunities for people to explore the area and watch the songbirds that migrate through the forest, according to the department.
“Private lands available for outdoor activities continue to diminish; therefore, demand for public lands to engage in these activities continue to increase,” the department wrote in its request for approval.
Also slated for expansion is the Aiken Gopher Tortoise Heritage Preserve. The $1 million purchase of about 300 acres will bring the preserve up to a total of 2,000 acres.
As its name suggests, the land is a prime spot for gopher tortoises, which are in danger of going extinct in the state. The spotted turtle, which is threatened in the state, has also been seen in the area, and 11 rare plants found on nearby properties are expected to grow there as well, according to the department.
After receiving the go-ahead to consider the land in November, officials will be able to move forward with the $1 million purchase following last week’s approval.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/botany-bay-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-26 09:58:28.209492

(Photo via Canva; seal courtesy of the Iowa Supreme Court) A former attorney who admitted neglecting a client’s case and then inadvertently overbilling her is now seeking reinstatement of his Iowa law license.
In January 2025, attorney Matthew Boles of Des Moines consented to the suspension of his law license for up to two years. The Iowa Supreme Court then imposed a six-month suspension.
Court records show the suspension was tied to Boles’ handling of a lawsuit brought by a woman who was severely injured in a 2015 boating collision on the Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri. With Boles as her attorney, the woman pursed legal action against the operator of the other boat and was able to secure a $1,360,000 settlement in the case.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Once the settlement was paid out, Boles was to retain one-third of the amount as his fee, pay any outstanding medical bills or Medicaid liens, and route the remainder to his client. However, there was a mix-up with regard to the medical bills that resulted in one hospital returning a check for payment and in Boles charging his client $47,586 in fees above the agreed amount. At the same time, Boles also neglected to provide his client with an accounting of all the settlement disbursements.
Two years later, in September 2019, the client contacted Boles after she was denied a home equity loan due to money she still owed Medicaid for medical care related to the boating accident. Boles allegedly promised to resolve the issue but didn’t write to Medicaid until July 2021.
In a sworn statement he later provided the court, Boles indicated it was only after the client asked for a full accounting of the settlement proceeds that he reviewed the records and “realized I had received more than the agreed-upon attorney fee.” At that point, he said, he used his own funds to pay his client’s debt to Medicaid.
The Iowa Supreme Court Attorney Disciplinary Board later charged Boles with retaining more funds than permitted by his contingency-fee agreement — money, the board said, that should have instead been used to resolve the client’s debt to Medicaid. The matter was resolved in January with the six-month suspension of his law license.
At the time, the disciplinary board had argued that an 18-month suspension was warranted, noting prior disciplinary action for similar conduct.
Court records show that in 2000, Boles was given a private admonition for neglect of a client matter. In 2004, he received a private admonition for representing a client without a clear fee agreement in place.
In 2012, Boles’ law license was suspended for 30 days for misconduct primarily related to billing and accounting practices. In that case, the disciplinary board alleged Boles neglected one incarcerated client’s post-conviction relief case, charged several other clients unreasonable fees, failed to promptly return unearned fees, and failed to properly handle a client’s property.
Last month, Boles, who had been licensed to practice law in Iowa since 1993, filed an application for reinstatement of his law license. Records from the Iowa Judicial Branch indicate the request has yet to be acted upon by the Iowa Supreme Court and that Boles’ license remains suspended.

As President Donald Trump’s administration continues its crackdown on immigration, concerns about how medical facilities should deal with immigration enforcement agents are growing among attorneys, advocates and health workers, write CalMatters’ Ana B. Ibarra and Kristen Hwang.
Immigration agents and law enforcement officers typically roll up to hospitals because someone they were detaining is suffering from a medical crisis. Protocols exist for these agents or officers when they’re handling a detainee or arrestee. But recent high-profile immigration cases are raising alarms about whether current guidelines are enough to protect hospital workers and the legal and privacy rights of patients.
For 15 days in July, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents occupied Dignity Health’s Glendale Memorial Hospital. They were waiting for one patient, an immigrant from El Salvador, to be discharged for medical care following their detention. Agents stood behind reception desks in the lobby while demonstrators gathered outside the hospital protesting ICE’s presence.
Hospital officials said in a statement they can’t prohibit law enforcement from being in public areas. Though agents can’t roam around the facilities unchecked, the rules are murkier when they bring in someone who is in their custody.
State law and the HIPPA Privacy Rule also require hospitals to protect patients’ personal and health information. Some disclosures are required if law enforcement can prove lawful custody or provide an appropriate warrant — though administrative warrants from ICE do not require immediate access to information.

Kate Mobeen, an intensive care unit nurse at John Muir Medical Center in Concord: “We have a level of privacy that we owe to patients and their families, and that has just been completely demolished with all of the involvement of ICE coming into hospitals. It creates just a huge sense of fear, not only in our patient population, but in our employee population and our nurses.”

In addition to backing a Newsom proposal that would reroute money from California’s cap-and-trade program to help fund the rail, Sen. Dave Cortese touted his bill that would require the state to commission a study on the economic opportunities along the rail corridor.

Cortese, a San Jose Democrat and chairperson of the Senate’s transportation committee: “Already the high-speed rail has created more than 14,600 high-quality union jobs, engaging nearly 900 small businesses and generating over $22 billion in economic impact.”

Cortese’s urging for the Legislature to pass both measures follows a week after Congress said it would launch a probe investigating the project. In July, Trump pulled $4 billion of the project’s federal funding, arguing that the rail authority overrepresented ridership projections, missed important deadlines and more.

CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: Newsom’s redistricting plan would merely offset the gains Republicans seek in Texas, and if gerrymanders decide the 2026 election, it’ll be because other states are considering redistricting too.

Keris Myrick
Keris Myrick is a health executive and advocate who hosts the podcast “Unapologetically Black Unicorns,” focusing on mental health and racial equity.


Progressive values and humane public policies are California virtues. But not for people living with serious mental illness. For people with schizophrenia, our treatment clings to an old, dangerous myth: “To save them we must take their autonomy.”
Some say people with schizophrenia have what is called anosognosia, meaning they lack insight that they have an illness and so require forced treatment.
Whether one believes in anosognosia or not, we must believe in people and their humanity. Rather than describing their objections as noncompliance, we must meet people where they are and hear their “no” as expressed autonomy, a desire to be heard on their own terms.
A French physician, Dr. Philippe Pinel, in the late 1700s famously unchained men and women in his asylums. Today’s chains look different. Reports from Disability Rights California detail widespread warehousing of people in psychiatric facilities after doctors have ordered them discharged and in jails despite them facing no criminal charges.
Lack of prevention and early intervention in outpatient care are major problems. 
Unhoused individuals experiencing mental health challenges require considerable outreach and engagement to build sufficient trust to bring them into the mental health system. Medicaid won’t pay for such concerted efforts, leaving them to fall deeper into the cracks of homelessness, incarceration or worse. 
Many people don’t fall — they’re pushed — into crisis. Pushed by poverty, racism and systems that criminalize illness and treat trauma with handcuffs. That’s not humane care; that’s control dressed up as care.
A person with “voluntary” court-ordered treatment without housing will be told they can live with their family. But families aren’t effective replacements for funded systems of care. They’re already stretched, grieving and navigating a maze of waiting lists and delays. 
Another missing piece in our system is the value of lived experience. 
When those with lived experience in mental illness try to collaborate with policymakers to develop voluntary, community-based services — especially for those who are unhoused or in a mental health crisis —  they are frequently rejected. In recent years, their testimony opposing several California bills that expand involuntary treatment often is ignored or dismissed, rather than being recognized as informed, valuable insight. 
Worse yet, this lived-experience perspective is framed as “letting people die with their rights on.” Nothing could be further from the truth.
I have experienced this. I have navigated coercive treatment approaches, systems that locked me up, traumatized me and caused me immense harm. 
Telling my story causes me further harm, even though my intention is to help others. I can’t escape the stigma. People make assumptions about “limited” abilities and “irrational” beliefs. Parts of my story can jeopardize future employment, housing opportunities and social connection. 
We can have education, professional careers and expertise from lived experience, but it’s all delegitimized through the discriminatory lens of a schizophrenia diagnosis. 
I survived. Many others do not. 
When I did not believe in myself, my providers, family and peers saw me as more than a set of symptoms; they saw a person with strengths and a deep need for connection, purpose and hope. 
I use my experience to heal and advocate for systems promoting dignity. We don’t want people to die. We want them to live with their rights on, free of shame, trauma and the system’s failures.
People with lived experience know the system’s chasms intimately, so we can help repair it. We know that true health care is not time-limited or transactional; it requires approaches that are noncoercive, rooted in dignity — such as peer-led programs, culturally competent supports and housing-first models. 
Media coverage, providers and elected officials assert that safety requires coercion. But coercion begets resistance. Humans reach for freedom. A diagnosis of schizophrenia doesn’t eliminate a person’s yearning for liberty. 
We’ve been here before: institutionalizing women for being “too emotional,” sterilizing those with disabilities “for their own good,” tearing Native children from their homes to “civilize” them, diagnosing enslaved Africans who fled bondage with drapetomania (runaway slave syndrome). 
Now concern for public safety seems to justify involuntary holds and forced treatment. We must learn from history; not repeat it. 
Providers, administrators, family members, elected officials and people with lived experience must work together. If any voice is missing, we miss the opportunity to create real healing.
People living with schizophrenia deserve support, freedom, dignity, and a system based on their potential, not just their pathology.
It’s time we stop mistaking force for humane care and start investing in what works: trust, time, families, housing, collaboration and the belief that recovery is possible on each person’s terms.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082119_Eureka_AW_sized27.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-26 08:56:23.389471

California Republicans are suing again to try and keep Gov. Newsom and Democrats’ redistricting plan off voters’ ballots. President Trump floated the idea of suing, too


Fresh off their failed attempt to kill Gov. Gavin Newsom’s redistricting plan in the Democratic-controlled Legislature, California Republicans and anti-gerrymandering groups this week launched an all-out resistance to defeat what they regard as an unconstitutional ballot question.
Republican legislators in particular, many of whom lambasted Democrats in fiery floor speeches last week, have stressed that independent redistricting should be a nonpartisan affair. A few even ventured to lightly scold President Donald Trump for urging their counterparts in red states  to redraw maps for political gain. And several filed a new lawsuit against the Newsom administration on Monday, their second in a week.
But despite their best efforts, California Republicans can’t completely separate Trump from the battle over redistricting, a fight that the president initiated earlier this summer by calling for gerrymandering in Texas to benefit the GOP. On Monday, the president offhandedly threatened to sue California to halt Newsom’s plan.
“Well, I think I’m going to be filing a lawsuit pretty soon and I think we’re going to be very successful in it,” Trump said in the Oval Office. “We’re going to be filing it through the Department of Justice. That’s going to happen.”
The opposition campaign has already landed in many Californians’ mailboxes and social feeds. Printed pamphlets paid for by Republican operatives and good governance advocates alike started arriving last Thursday, the same day that Newsom declared the Nov. 4 special election on his proposal to temporarily suspend the state’s independent redistricting panel and instead use gerrymandered maps drawn in to favor Democrats. 
“We cannot save democracy by burning it down in California,” declared a four-page mailer funded primarily by Charles T. Munger Jr., the main financial backer of the 2010 initiative that created the redistricting commission. 
A different one-page pamphlet, paid for by an organization headed by former state Republican Party chair Jessica Millan Patterson, warned readers of a “political power grab” and told voters to “SAY NO” to “unconstitutional gerrymandering.”
But even as they slam Newsom and Democrats for a “political power grab,” California Republicans are laboring to keep their criticism narrowly focused on the circumventing of California’s independent redistricting commission, rather than openly criticize Trump’s demand for red states to leverage redistricting in the GOP’s favor. 
“It should not be Gavin Newsom vs. Trump. It should not be California vs. Texas,” said Corrin Rankin, chair of the California Republican Party, at a news conference announcing the latest lawuit filed with the California Supreme Court. “It should be what’s in the best interest of Californians, and what’s in the best interest of Californians is for us to determine who represents us.”
GOP lost once in court
Four Republican legislators, with help from Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon’s private law firm,  sued the state to remove the newly minted Proposition 50 from the ballot. They contend that Prop. 50 violates a state rule that all ballot questions adhere to a single subject – a common tactic for opponents of ballot measures. And once again, they insist that Democratic lawmakers violated numerous procedural steps in their rush to put gerrymandered maps in front of voters for approval. 
The California Supreme Court denied the group’s first legal challenge last week. The group’s lead attorney argues that conditions are different now that the election is officially scheduled and the proposition is slated for the ballot. 
Newsom’s campaign scoffed at Republicans’ latest challenge and declared it would fail.
“Trump’s toadies already got destroyed once in court. Now, they are trying once again — to protect Trump’s power grab and prevent voters from having their say on Prop 50,” Hannah Milgrom, a spokesperson for the campaign, said in a statement. “They will lose.”
Is Trump serious about suing?
It’s unclear how seriously to take Trump’s remarks that he’d sue California. They were prompted by a question from a reporter — who Trump corrected to refer to the governor by his frequent “Gavin Newscum” nickname — and the president offered no further details.
The White House did not respond to emailed questions about the legal basis or timeline for a lawsuit. Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Justice, declined to comment.
The potential lawsuit has also not been coordinated with the California Republican Party, according to Rankin, who would not say whether she welcomed Trump’s intervention.
“I’m not going to get ahead of the president,” she said. “That’s a question for the future.”

But even the possibility of Trump’s involvement could juice the campaign for Prop. 50, which has seen middling support in polls so far. A survey published last week by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies and the Los Angeles Times found the measure leading 48% to 32% among likely voters.
The anti-Trump resistance has been a potent political message in California for a decade. In 2021, Newsom beat back an effort to recall him from office in part by making the election about Californians’ distaste for Trump.
Whether or not the president follows through on his threat of a lawsuit, Newsom now has a tangible opportunity to frame Proposition 50 as California vs. Trump and run back his successful playbook from defeating the recall. He was quick to respond to the president’s comment about a legal challenge with an all-caps post on social media: “BRING IT.”

Ibarra and Kristen Hwang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/08/immigration-hospitals-workers-fear/,"As federal immigration agents appear more frequently at California medical facilities, workers are increasingly concerned about patients’ rights and their own.","In summary
As federal immigration agents appear more frequently at California medical facilities, workers are increasingly concerned about patients’ rights and their own.


Federal immigration agents are more routinely showing up at California medical facilities as the Trump administration ramps up deportations.
They may come to the emergency room, bringing in someone who’s suffering a medical crisis while being detained. They may wait in the lobby, as agents did for two weeks at an L.A.-area hospital waiting for a woman to be discharged. Or they may even chase people inside, as federal agents did at a Southern California surgical center. 
The sight of these agents — often armed and with covered faces — makes many wary and may keep people from seeking care.
Existing hospital policies guide operations when law enforcement brings in a person under arrest, hospital officials say. 
“This is nothing new to hospitals,” said Lois Richardson, vice president and counsel at the California Hospital Association. “We get inmates, detainees, arrestees all the time, whether it’s police, sheriff, highway patrol, ICE, whatever it is.” The job for hospital workers remains to provide care, she added, and not to get involved in disputes over why a person is in custody. 
Yet immigration attorneys, advocates and health workers have expressed concerns over the handling of some of these cases, both by immigration officers and by some administrators at medical facilities. 
Specifically, they’re worried about the application of protocols like visitation rules, about threats to patients’ legal and privacy rights, and about risks to hospital workers themselves.  
“We have a level of privacy that we owe to patients and their families, and that has just been completely demolished with all of the involvement of ICE coming into hospitals,” said Kate Mobeen, an ICU nurse at John Muir Medical Center in Concord. “It creates just a huge sense of fear, not only in our patient population, but in our employee population and our nurses.”
Patients’ rights, policies face new tests
Sometimes when ICE has shown up at medical facilities with a detained patient, the result has been conflicting messaging about the rules.
On July 29, ICE agents took a man to John Muir Medical Center in Concord because he suffered an unspecified medical emergency while being detained outside the Concord immigration court, according to Ali Saidi, an attorney and the director of Stand Together Contra Costa, a local rapid response and legal services organization. 
When Saidi arrived at the hospital as part of the response network, he said hospital staff told him that he was not allowed to see the detained patient, but that the man’s family would be allowed. Then, when the man’s wife arrived, “The rules had somehow changed, and they said no family visit,” Saidi said. 
In a statement shared by the Contra Costa Immigrants Rights Alliance, the detained man’s wife, who asked to be identified only by her middle name, Maria, said that when she later talked to her husband, he told her that he was so terrified that he passed out.
“My family and I went to the emergency room and we asked to see him and talk to him to make sure he was okay,” Maria said, in the statement. “The hospital staff would not let us see him and they would not give us any information about what was happening to him. They wouldn’t even answer my questions.”
John Muir officials would not comment on the incident, citing privacy laws. But in an email, Ben Drew, a spokesperson for the hospital, said general policy is that “If a law enforcement agency indicates that visitation presents a safety or security concern, [the hospital] may limit or deny visitation to protect our patients, staff, and visitors.” 
Saidi said that when the wife insisted on getting information about the man’s condition, hospital security called the police. 
“We understand that emotions are high whenever a family member or friend is in the emergency department or hospital,” said Drew. “The hospital only involves local police in circumstances when a patient or visitor’s behavior becomes abusive, disruptive, or threatening, and cannot be resolved through our own security team.”
Saidi denied that the family was being disruptive, saying that conversations with hospital staff and administration were respectful and no voices were raised.
“The atmosphere in that emergency bay was something like I’ve never seen before in my career,” Saidi said. “There was a chilling effect. Everyone was averting their eyes. You could tell the staff felt bad.”
Multiple emergency department nurses told Mobeen, a local California Nurses Association leader at John Muir, that ICE officers were “very aggressive with staff” and staff were afterwards “emotionally and physically upset” by what happened, she said.
“It’s horrifying to not be able to tell patients’ family members how they are, what their status is,” Mobeen said.
Part of the issue, Mobeen added, is training. Staff were not given adequate training on how to respond to any kind of immigration enforcement action that may occur at the hospital, she said. 
Drew, the spokesman for John Muir, countered that the hospital has given guidance on its longstanding law enforcement policy and answered multiple questions since January about what to do if ICE agents show up at their facilities. 
Limits for ICE access, sometimes murky
Last month, immigration agents occupied the lobby of Dignity Health’s Glendale Memorial Hospital, even standing behind reception desks, as photos that circulated online showed. Protestors gathered outside the hospital hosting rallies and press conferences.
They were all there because agents had previously brought in Milagro Solis-Portillo, an immigrant from El Salvador, for medical care following her detention. They spent 15 days in the hospital waiting for Solis-Portillo’s discharge before transferring her to another hospital and then taking her into custody, according to local news reports.
In a statement, officials from Dignity Memorial Hospital said they could not legally prohibit law enforcement from being in public areas.
That’s true, say legal experts: Waiting rooms and lobbies are considered public spaces in hospitals. But agents cannot move through hospitals without limits. Law enforcement officials are not allowed to search for people in exam rooms or other private spaces without a federal court warrant. 
When agents bring in someone who is in their custody and needs medical care, the application of the law can be more murky. 
According to Richardson at the hospital association, how far an agent can go into treatment areas with a detained patient may be decided on a case by case basis. In cases where a detained patient is struggling or resisting, that patient may need guarding, she explained. 
And if law enforcement officers do go inside exam rooms, they may hear medical information while on guard. But that isn’t necessarily a privacy violation, according to federal rules. The HIPPA Privacy Rule, the law that sets privacy standards for medical information, has a provision that allows for “incidental disclosures” of information as long as “reasonable safeguards” are applied. 
“The hospital will, and the doctor will make reasonable attempts to protect the patient’s privacy.” “What is reasonable is going to depend, again, on what’s wrong with the patient, how the patient is behaving, the nature of the circumstances,” Richardson said.
HIPAA protects the disclosure of medical records, which include names, addresses and social security numbers along with health conditions. State law also requires health facilities to protect this information. According to guidance from the attorney general’s office, health facilities should consider a patient’s immigration status confidential.
At the same time, some disclosures are required if law enforcement can prove lawful custody or show an appropriate warrant. A federal court warrant signed by a judge grants law enforcement immediate access to information or to search a particular area, while an ICE administrative warrant does not require immediate compliance. 
Health workers in ‘precarious’ situations 
Health facilities generally direct frontline workers not to engage with immigration agents, but rather to immediately contact security or management. 
One particular incident at a Southern California surgery center stands out, in conversation with health workers. 
On July 8, federal agents targeted three landscapers who had parked outside of the Ontario Advanced Surgical Center. They chased one of the men inside on foot, according to a felony criminal complaint filed against two health care workers in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.
In videos of the incident posted online, a masked agent wearing a vest labeled “POLICE ICE” on the back holds a weeping man by the shoulder inside the center while several workers in scrubs stand by. At multiple points in the video workers ask the officer for identification; one worker says, “this is a private business.”
Two workers, Danielle Davila and Jose Ortega, tell the officer to leave. Davila moves between the officer and the man, saying “Get your hands off of him. You don’t even have a warrant.”
Ortega puts an arm between Davila and the officer and says “You have no proper identification.”
The officer says to both workers “You touched a federal agent.” Then Davila responds, “I’m not touching you.” 
Davila and Ortega were later charged with two felony counts of assaulting a federal officer and conspiring to prevent a federal officer from performing their duties.
Last week the felony charges were dismissed and both Davila and Ortega pleaded not guilty to a subsequent misdemeanor assault charge. A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office declined to comment on the charges.

Davila’s defense attorney Oliver Cleary said his client believed she was doing the right thing by asking for credentials and a warrant.
“You can’t just come in where people are getting medical care and whisk them away,” Cleary said. “She didn’t know who these people were. They didn’t tell her who they were, and as far as she knew this was a patient of the clinic.”
Carlos Juárez, Ortega’s defense attorney, said arresting and charging health workers with crimes for asking to see a warrant and identification puts them in a “precarious” and “dangerous situation.”
“They did what they needed to do and what they had a right to do,” Juárez said. “What I hope is it doesn’t have a chilling effect on other health care workers.”
Workers say additional training can help
Around the state, health workers say they’d like to see management provide additional guidance on how to respond to such scenarios if they were to play out in their workplace. Some workers are providing training themselves.
Adriana Rugeles-Ortiz, a licensed vocational nurse at Kaiser Permanente Modesto Medical Center, has been leading “Know Your Rights” sessions at her hospital and in her community as part of her union, SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West. She said some of her coworkers have expressed anxiety over some of the situations they’ve seen play out in other hospitals.
“Because of my involvement with all the training that we have done to the workers and to the community, personally, I do feel prepared. I am not that confident that we have been able to reach the entire workforce within Kaiser to get them to the level of confidence to deal with it,” Rugeles-Ortiz said.
Dr. Douglas Yoshida, an emergency room physician at Stanford Health Tri-Valley in Alameda County, said additional guidance and training for workers at medical facilities could be of great value. 
“I think as health care providers, we need to deliver good health care to these patients, just like any other patient, and we need to protect their rights,” Yoshida said. “I mean, personally, if someone comes in in ICE custody, within the limits of the law, I want to do everything I can to help [patients.]” 
The hospital in Pleasanton that Yoshida works in is located near the county’s Santa Rita Jail; staff, he said, have been used to a law enforcement presence. But the recent incident at John Muir Medical Center, about 30 miles north, as well as the criminal charges filed against the southern California surgery center workers have set people on edge, Yoshida said.
“Normally, health care workers have no reason to fear law enforcement,” he added, “but we’re in uncharted territory.”

(Photo by Alex Goodlett for Utah News Dispatch)Utah signed a new memorandum of understanding with TerraPower, a nuclear energy company founded by Bill Gates, to explore a potential site for a reactor and an energy storage plant in the state.
The agreement establishes a non-binding framework for cooperation between the Utah Office of Energy Development, TerraPower and Flagship Companies, a developer, aiming to bring a project to Utah similar to one under construction near Kemmerer, Wyoming — a sodium-cooled fast reactor known as Natrium.

Preliminary site recommendations will come by the end of 2025, according to a news release from the Utah Office of Energy Development. The state and the companies will consider factors like “community support, the physical characteristics of the site, the ability of the site to obtain a license from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and access to existing infrastructure.”      
As Cox advances nuclear agreements, he says the cost to develop technology is nothing so far

Gov. Spencer Cox praised the project’s prospects, saying it aligns with Operation Gigawatt, his plan to double the state’s energy production over the next decade. 
“Operation Gigawatt is about adding capacity from diverse sources — nuclear, natural gas, geothermal and more — so families and businesses have power that is affordable, reliable and clean,” Cox said in a statement. “This agreement with TerraPower will help keep rates low, strengthen our grid and ensure Utah’s future can be as strong as our past.”
The agreement also adds to a list of memorandums of understanding the state has signed with other nuclear energy developers in its quest to lead in the country’s “nuclear renaissance.”
TerraPower CEO Chris Levesque said in an interview with Bloomberg Podcasts that new technologies, like Natrium, will be essential to upscale nuclear energy in the country, since they are cheaper and safer than current plants.

“It’s still a fission reactor. We break uranium atoms to release a lot of heat and boil water to make steam and drive turbines to make electricity the old fashioned way,” Levesque said. “But by cooling the reactor with liquid sodium, it allows us to have a low pressure plant, which is going to be safer.”
The company has already made progress with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for its first plant in Wyoming, Levesque said. After that’s cleared, the timeline for the construction of a Natrium reactor could be about three years, “which is much shorter than today’s technologies that require all of the steel and concrete,” he said.
For Cox, the project represents an important step in the country’s advancement of nuclear technology, which he said has stalled for the last 50 years. Building more energy resources is in the nation’s best interest, he added, especially with the emergence of power-hungry AI and data centers.
Utah Republican Sen. John Curtis, who has championed green energy initiatives in Washington, D.C., is also on board with the project.
“Utah must lead in developing energy solutions that are affordable, reliable and clean,” he said in a statement. “Exploring advanced nuclear technology aligns with our commitment to energy independence and reflects the kind of forward-thinking policy our state, and nation, needs.”

Democratic-led states and select blue-leaning cities fought back in court and saw money for public health efforts restored — while GOP-led states sustained big losses.
The Department of Health and Human Services in late March canceled nearly 700 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants nationwide — together worth about $11 billion. Awarded during the covid-19 pandemic, they supported efforts to vaccinate people, reduce health disparities among demographic groups, upgrade antiquated systems for detecting infectious disease outbreaks, and hire community health workers.
Initially, grant cancellations hit blue and red states roughly evenly. Four of the five jurisdictions with the largest number of terminated grants were led by Democrats: California, the District of Columbia, Illinois, and Massachusetts.
But after attorneys general and governors from about two dozen blue states sued in federal court and won an injunction, the balance flipped. Of the five states with the most canceled grants, four are led by Republicans: Texas, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Ohio.
In blue states, nearly 80% of the CDC grant cuts have been restored, compared with fewer than 5% in red states, according to the KFF Health News analysis. Grant amounts reported in an HHS database known as the Tracking Accountability in Government Grants System, or TAGGS, often don’t match what states confirmed. Instead, this analysis focused on the number of grants.

The divide is an example of the polarization that permeates health care issues, in which access to safety-net health programs, abortion rights, and the ability of public health officials to respond to disease threats diverge significantly depending on the political party in power.
In an emailed statement, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said the agency “is committed to protecting the health of every American, regardless of politics or geography. These funds were provided in response to the COVID pandemic, which is long over. We will continue working with states to strengthen public health infrastructure and ensure communities have the tools they need to respond to outbreaks and keep people safe.”
The money in question wasn’t spent solely on covid-related activities, public health experts say; it was also used to bolster public health infrastructure and help contain many types of viruses and diseases, including the flu, measles, and RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus.
“It really supported infrastructure across the board, particularly in how states respond to public health threats,” said Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
The Trump cutbacks came as the U.S. recorded its largest measles outbreak in over three decades and 266 pediatric deaths during the most recent flu season — the highest reported outside of a pandemic since 2004. Public health departments canceled vaccine clinics, laid off staff, and put contracts on hold, health officials said in interviews.
After its funding cuts were blocked in court, California retained every grant the Trump administration attempted to claw back, while Texas remains the state with the most grants terminated, with at least 30. As the CDC slashed grants in Texas, its measles outbreak spread across the U.S. and Mexico, sickening at least 4,500 people and killing at least 16.
Colorado, which joined the lawsuit, had 11 grant terminations at first, but then 10 were retained. Meanwhile, its neighboring states that didn’t sue — Wyoming, Utah, Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma — collectively lost 55 grants, with none retained.
In Jackson, Ohio, a half-dozen community health workers came to work one day in March to find the Trump administration had canceled their grant five months early, leaving the Jackson County Health Department half a million dollars short — and them without jobs.
“I had to lay off three employees in a single day, and I haven’t had to do that before. We don’t have those people doing outreach in Jackson County anymore,” Health Commissioner Kevin Aston said.
At one point, he said, the funding helped 11 Appalachian Ohio counties. Now it supports one.
Marsha Radabaugh, one employee who was reassigned, has scaled back her community health efforts: She’d been helping serve hot meals to homeless people and realized that many clients couldn’t read or write, so she brought forms for services such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to their encampment in a local park and helped fill them out.
“We would find them rehab places. We’d get out hygiene kits, blankets, tents, zero-degree sleeping bags, things like that,” she said. As a counselor, she’d also remind people “that they’re cared for, that they’re worthy of being a human — because, a lot of the time, they’re not treated that way.”
Sasha Johnson, who led the community health worker program, said people like Radabaugh “were basically a walking human 411,” offering aid to those in need.
Radabaugh also partnered with a food bank to deliver meals to homebound residents.
Ashton said the abrupt way they lost the funds — which meant the county unexpectedly had to pay unemployment for more people — could have ruined the health district financially. Canceling funding midcycle, he said, “was really scary.”
HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist and promoter of vaccine misinformation, has called the CDC a “cesspool of corruption.” At HHS, he has taken steps to undermine vaccination in the U.S. and abroad.
Federal CDC funding accounts for more than half of state and local health department budgets, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. States that President Donald Trump won in the 2024 election received a higher share of the $15 billion the cCDC allocated in fiscal 2023 than those that Democrat Kamala Harris won, according to KFF.
The Trump administration’s nationwide CDC grant terminations reflect this. More than half were in states that Trump won in 2024, totaling at least 370 terminations before the court action, according to KFF Health News’ analysis.
The Columbus, Ohio, health department had received $6.2 million in CDC grants, but roughly half of it — $3 million — disappeared with the Trump cuts. The city laid off 11 people who worked on investigating infectious disease outbreaks in such places as schools and nursing homes, Columbus Health Commissioner Mysheika Roberts said.
She also said the city had planned to buy a new electronic health record system for easier access to patients’ hospital records — which could improve disease detection and provide better treatment for those infected — but that was put on ice.
“We’ve never had a grant midcycle just get pulled from us for no reason,” Roberts said. “This sense of uncertainty is stressful.”
Columbus did not receive its money directly from the CDC. Rather, the state gave the city some funds it received from the federal government. Ohio, led by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine and a Republican attorney general, did not sue to block the funding cuts.
Columbus sued the federal government in April to keep its money, along with other Democratic-led municipalities in Republican-governed states: Harris County, Texas, home to Houston; the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County in Tennessee; and Kansas City, Missouri. A federal judge in June blocked those cuts.
As of mid-August, Columbus was awaiting the funds. Roberts said the city won’t rehire staff because the federal funding was expected to end in December.
Joe Grogan, a senior scholar at the University of Southern California’s Schaeffer Institute and former director of the White House Domestic Policy Council in Trump’s first term, said state and local agencies “are not entitled” to the federal money, which was awarded “to deal with an emergency” that has ended.
“We were throwing money out the door the last five years,” Grogan said of the federal government. “I don’t understand why there would ever be a controversy in unspent covid money coming back.”
Ken Gordon, Ohio Department of Health spokesperson, wrote in an email that the $250 million in grants lost had helped with, among other things, upgrading the disease reporting system and boosting public health laboratory testing.
Some of the canceled HHS funding wasn’t slated to end for years, including four grants to strengthen public health in Indian Country, a grant to a Minnesota nonprofit focused on reducing substance use disorders, and a few to universities about occupational safety, HIV, tuberculosis, and more.
Brent Ewig, chief policy and government relations officer for the Association of Immunization Managers, said the cuts were “the predictable result of ‘boom, bust, panic, neglect’ funding” for public health.
The association represents 64 state, local, and territorial immunization programs, which Ewig said will be less prepared to respond to disease outbreaks, including measles.
“The system is blinking red,” Ewig said.




Methodology
KFF Health News’ analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants sought to answer four questions: 1) How many grants have been terminated in the U.S. under the Trump administration since March? 2) Which states saw the most grants cut? 3) What were the grants for? and 4) Did the grant terminations affect blue, red, and purple states differently? This follows a similar analysis by KFF Health News for an article on nationwide NIH grant terminations.
Our primary data source was a Department of Health and Human Services website showing grant terminations. We compared an initial list of grant terminations from April 3 with one from July 11 to determine how many grants had been restored. The USAspending.gov database helped us track grants by state.
To classify states politically, we followed the same steps from our April coverage of National Institutes of Health grant terminations. States were “blue” if Democrats had complete control of the state government or if the majority of voters favored Democratic presidential candidates in the last three elections (2016, 2020, 2024). “Red” states were classified similarly with respect to the Republican Party. “Purple” states had politically split state governments and/or were generally considered to be presidential election battleground states. The result was 25 red states, 17 blue states, and eight purple states. The District of Columbia was classified as blue using similar methods.
This analysis does not account for potential grant reinstatements in local jurisdictions where the funds were awarded indirectly rather than directly from the CDC; it accounts only for the recipients’ location, and excludes grants terminated from Compacts of Free Association states and other foreign entities that received grants directly from the CDC. At least 40 CDC grants were terminated that were meant for global health efforts or assisting public health activities in other nations following the Trump administration’s order for the CDC to withdraw support for the World Health Organization.

Graphic Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)Voters in Cullman and Blount counties go to the polls Tuesday to choose a representative in a special election for House District 11. 
Voters will choose between Republican Heath Allbright and Democrat Alex Braswell, the first time in nearly 20 years the seat has been contested by a Democrat. Allbright, a small business owner and former member of the Cullman County Board of Education, won a May primary against veteran Don Fallin with 54.3% of votes. Braswell, an American Sign Language Interpreter, is the first woman to campaign for the seat. 
The district covers part of Cullman and Blount counties.
When do polls open?
Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Tuesday. 
Where do I find my polling place?
The Alabama Secretary of State’s website allows you to check voter registration and the location of your polling place. You can find it here. Municipal elections are also Tuesday, but some voters may have to go to two polling locations for each election.
What do I need to vote?
Voters must present a valid photo ID before voting. Valid forms of ID include: 

Alabama driver’s license (not expired or expired less than 60 days)
Alabama Law Enforcement Agency digital driver’s license
Alabama Non-Driver ID (not expired or expired less than 60 days)
Alabama Photo Voter ID card
State-issued ID (Alabama or any other state)
Federal-issued ID
U.S. Passport

Where is the district located?

The district covers part of Cullman and Blount counties, including Snead, Oneota, Hanceville and Blountsville.

How did the seat become vacant?

The seat became vacant after former Rep. Randall Shedd, R-Fairview, resigned on Feb. 17 to be Senate Pro Tem Garland Gudger’s director of constituent affairs.

Does the seat have a partisan lean?

District 11 is solidly Republican. Shedd, who won the seat in a 2013 special election, never faced opposition in any subsequent general election. 

What issues dominate the race?

SB 322, sponsored by Sen. Jabo Waggoner, R-Vestavia Hills, was signed by Gov. Kay Ivey on May 7. The law allows the city of Cullman to annex a resort in Cullman County, a dry county, in order for the resort to serve alcohol.
The law drew criticism from Democratic and Republican candidates in this election and the House District 12 election, scheduled for Oct. 28. Cullman County did not have representation in the House after Shedd resigned in February and Rep. Corey Harbison, R-Good Hope, stepped down in April.
Braswell and Allbright have opposed the legislation. Allbright said in a previous interview that his issue was the timing and lack of Cullman representation in the House.
Gudger, who co-sponsored the legislation, pre-filed a bill on Aug. 1 to repeal the law, which goes into effect on Oct. 1. The Legislature will not be able to take it up until it reconvenes in January, but local officials say they have not gotten any requests that would fall within the scope of the law. 
What happens after today?
The winner will represent the district in the Alabama House of Representatives in the 2026 legislative session. The seat will be contested, like all Alabama House seats, in next year’s state elections.

Will the results alter control of the Legislature?

No. Republicans currently hold 72 of the 105 seats in the Alabama House, after three resignations after the end of the 2025 session in May. Rep. Cynthia Almond, R-Tuscaloosa, was appointed president of the Public Service Commission in June. Rep. Matt Woods, R-Jasper, was elected to the State Senate on June 24. Rep. Debbie Wood, R-Valley, announced her resignation and move to the Florida panhandle last week. Republicans hold 27 of the 35 seats in the Alabama Senate.

Earlier this year, conservatives in the Tennessee House staged an eleventh-hour skirmish over an IVF protection bill introduced by two of their Republican colleagues. The bill eventually passed, becoming one of the first in the nation to explicitly protect access to IVF. But some lawmakers who voted for it have signaled their willingness to revisit the issue.
In Georgia, a Republican-sponsored bill to codify the right to IVF into law sailed through the legislature, even as fellow conservative lawmakers introduced their own anti-abortion bill that opponents warned would undermine the IVF protections in the new law.
In statehouses around the nation, IVF has emerged as a dividing line running through the Republican Party. Particularly in states where abortion is banned, lawmakers who unite under the “pro-life” banner disagree over whether the popular treatment gives life or destroys it.
People who believe embryos are children oppose IVF because it can involve the discarding of some embryos, which they say is akin to abortion.
“The popularity of IVF creates a dilemma for Republican politicians who have had anti-choice organizations as a key part of their constituency for their whole careers,” said Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.
After the Alabama Supreme Court ruled last year that embryos are people, fertility clinics around the state temporarily halted their services, sparking nationwide outrage.
Republicans and Democrats rushed to pledge their support for fertility treatments such as IVF and announce their plans to protect it.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump promised to make insurers cover IVF so that it would be free for patients. After taking office, he signed an executive order giving White House officials 90 days to assemble a list of policy recommendations on protecting IVF access and reducing costs.
In March, he called himself “the fertilization president.”
But a week later, his administration eliminated the team of experts at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention responsible for tracking IVF outcomes across the United States. The team had, among other things, operated a database allowing consumers to look up an individual fertility clinic’s success rates. Earlier this month, The Washington Post reported that the White House doesn’t plan to require insurers to cover IVF services, though administration officials told the newspaper that IVF access remains a priority.
Meanwhile, conservative groups that oppose abortion have begun pushing an obscure alternative treatment for infertility called “restorative reproductive medicine,” or RRM. Advocates have urged the White House and federal and state legislators to back RRM, which is based on the idea that the underlying causes of infertility can be treated through lifestyle changes and improving a person’s overall health.
Arkansas recently became the first to pass a pro-RRM law. Others might follow suit in upcoming legislative sessions.
Cole Muzio, founder and president of the Georgia conservative Christian nonprofit Frontline Policy Council, said he doesn’t expect to see legislators try to ban IVF outright, despite preemptive efforts by legislators in his state and others to protect it.
“Republicans are intrinsically pro-family, and the idea of supporting those who want to have a family is a conservative, noble, positive thing,” he said.
“At the same time, IVF discards an overwhelming number of human lives. We’ve got a lot of work to do to educate people.”
 IVF pushback grows louder

This spring, the Tennessee bill protecting IVF passed unanimously in the state Senate. But by the time it hit the House floor in April, many of its Republican supporters sat silently while a few of their GOP colleagues tried to derail it.
The bill’s sponsor, Republican state Rep. Iris Rudder, told the Tennessee Lookout that she hadn’t expected disagreement over the bill to “mushroom the way it did.”
It eventually passed. But 11 Tennessee House Republicans sent a letter to GOP Gov. Bill Lee urging him to veto it and calling it “a Trojan horse that could potentially undermine Tennessee’s strong and righteous stance on the protection of innocent human life.”
Lee signed it in April.
The following day, Tennessee Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson — who voted for the bill and said he supports IVF and contraceptives — told constituents during a legislative forum that he’d had “lots of conversations” about it and expects the legislature to revisit the issue again in the next session.
“I think we’ll be back next year to take another stab at it,” he said.
In Georgia, the state’s most powerful Republicans made a bill to codify the right to IVF a major priority this year. It was signed into law in May.
“Thanks to a lot of bipartisan support and hard work, Georgians who want to grow their families will never have to worry about whether or not they can access this vital treatment,” the bill’s sponsor, Republican state Rep. Lehman Franklin, posted to X after it passed through the legislature. Franklin and his wife conceived through IVF, a story he has shared publicly as he promoted the measure.
“At the end of the day, being pro-family means being pro-IVF,” he wrote.
Muzio, of the Frontline Policy Council, believes the IVF debate represents not so much a split in the Republican Party as it does a lack of education about what the treatment really means to people who believe human life begins as soon as an egg is fertilized.
“Hopefully you’ll see [legislation] put in place that either backs different fertility treatments that are more pro-life or guardrails put in place to restrict the discarding of human life for the purposes of IVF,” he said.
For conservatives who see IVF as akin to abortion, restorative reproductive medicine has emerged politically as an option for addressing infertility without explicitly supporting IVF, which remains overwhelmingly popular among Americans.
 Out of obscurity

RRM was a relatively obscure idea until anti-abortion groups such as The Heritage Foundation began elevating it over the past year as an alternative to IVF. With RRM, a practitioner might help patients analyze their diet, chart their menstrual cycle to look for conditions that can impact fertility, or treat reproductive disorders like endometriosis or thyroid dysfunction.
Supporters argue that a more holistic approach is a better way to treat infertility, and that RRM methods are much less expensive than IVF, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars.
But RRM has been criticized in mainstream medical circles. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists calls RRM a “nonmedical approach” and an “unproven concept” that can delay time to pregnancy and expose patients to needless and painful surgical interventions, such as procedures to treat polycystic ovarian syndrome. It says the approach overwhelmingly puts the onus on women, ignoring that infertility causes are just as common in men.
Some experts worry that patients spending months or years on RRM treatments will lose precious time when IVF could have helped them get pregnant.
And OB-GYNs warn RRM is closely tied to the anti-abortion “personhood” movement, which attempts to grant fertilized eggs the same legal status as people — potentially leading to a loss of rights for pregnant patients and more severe restrictions on birth control and other reproductive health care.
Tipton, of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, believes RRM is more “ideology” than medical practice.
“[RRM] got legs thanks to the work of really influential right-wing and anti-choice groups,” he said. “They put their considerable resources into asking, ‘How do we blunt the momentum IVF is getting without saying we’re opposed to IVF?’”
But as RRM gains mainstream attention, it’s also found supporters in the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement promoted by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Some consumers remain skeptical of the fertility industry, where some clinics have ties to private equity firms and other large corporations.
In March, Arkansas Republican state Rep. Alyssa Brown told fellow legislators that RRM “prioritizes women’s health over the profits of Big Pharma and Big Fertility.”
 First in the nation

Brown sponsored a first-of-its-kind bill in Arkansas — which passed in April and was signed into law — that requires state insurance companies to cover RRM treatments.
Brown promised during a hearing that it wouldn’t limit access to IVF. Arkansas was one of the earliest states, in 1991, to require insurance companies to cover IVF.
A similar bill with the same title, the RESTORE Act, was introduced in Congress again this year, after failing last year. It includes recommendations from The Heritage Foundation and the conservative, anti-abortion Ethics and Public Policy Center.
Arkansas’ new law also requires programs funded through Title X, which provides birth control and other reproductive care to low-income families, to use fertility awareness-based methods, mirroring a similar effort at the federal level. Under Kennedy, HHS has indicated plans to use Title X funding to open an “infertility training center.” Part of the center’s focus, according to its grant announcement, is to “educate on the root causes of infertility and the broad range of holistic infertility treatments” available to patients.
Meanwhile, state legislators around the country this year attempted to require health insurance to cover IVF, including in Montana, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia.
Nevada’s Democratic-controlled legislature passed a bill in June establishing the right to fertility treatments, including IVF, but it was swiftly vetoed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo.
In May, Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed a bill into law requiring a state insurance commission to consider coverage for procedures like IVF, a move that sets the stage for requiring health insurance companies to cover it. Before signing, Youngkin tried to insert a provision allowing private plans to opt out of coverage for religious or ethical beliefs, but the legislature rejected the change.
Although he signed the measure, Youngkin said his exemption idea needed to be taken up if the state eventually mandates coverage of fertility treatments.

(Photo: Michael Lyle/Nevada Current)As President Donald Trump has intensified policy assaults on the transgender community such as blocking support for gender-affirming care and banning trans service members from the military, some Democrats have declined to push back against attacks.
Democratic U.S. Reps. Steven Horsford and Dina Titus joined the Human Rights Campaign, LGBTQ+ organizations, and trans locals on Sunday to hear about the impact of Trump’s policies, and assure them they aren’t fighting alone.
“One of the things that I think is so important is to be in conversation and to be able to hear directly about the lived experience of how you’re feeling,” Horsford told the roundtable. “If not, we’re leaving that to you to figure out alone, and no one should feel alone at this moment.”
Las Vegas was among the stops of the Human Rights Campaign’s American Dreams tour, a nationwide effort to bring LGBTQ+ people together to share stories and engage with local and federal elected leaders. 
Organizers have hosted roundtables in Columbus and Dallas so far, and have events planned in Atlanta, the District of Colombia, and Nashville in the fall. 
The tour comes as the LGBTQ+ community, in particular trans people, have seen a Trump-fueled wave of anti-trans demonization and policies. 
Trump has issued several anti-trans orders, including one to block federal support for gender-affirming medical care to patients younger than 19, and another to end the national Suicide and Crisis Lifeline 988, which specialized in support for LGBTQ+ youth. Trump has also threatened to withhold federal funding from states that allow transgender children to play school sports. 
Recent reporting also found the Trump administration also sought Social Security numbers and names of children who received gender-affirming care at a hospital in Philadelphia showing efforts aren’t letting up anytime soon.
The policies from the White House have emboldened broader anti-trans rhetoric and behavior in society.  
Titus admonished Republican congressmembers who have harassed U.S. Rep. Sarah McBride of Delaware, the nation’s first elected transgender member of Congress, by continuing to misgender her during committee meetings.
West Juhl, the communications Director of Communications and Campaigns for the ACLU of Nevada, said the constant attacks show there is “an existential crisis for our community.”
“Rhetoric really is taking aim at the foundational principles from the queer liberation movement in such a very specific way,” Juhl said, referring to the movement for LGBTQ+ equality starting in the 60s. “I think the way that they talk about us now, it sounds to me like the way they talked about us back when being queer was a mental illness that would get you institutionalized.”
The administration and its backers want “to make it seem like somehow being a person of color, being an immigrant, being queer, trans, is antithetical to being an American or being part of the American dream,” said Kelley Robinson, the president of the Human Rights Campaign. 
“I, for one, am not willing to cede this country that my community has put our blood, literally, sweat and tears, into,” she said. “I’m certainly not willing to cede our power.”
The roundtable focused on actions by Trump and Republicans, but many prominent Democrats have also parroted anti-trans talking points.
Third Way, a DC-based think tank that is attempting to push Democrats rightward, recently sent a memo listing words Democrats should abandon that included to LGBTQIA+ and cisgender. 
Robinson said fighting for trans rights shouldn’t be partisan and is about affirming basic human rights.  
“These are basic civil rights everyone deserves,” Robinson said. “We have never gotten ahead by sacrificing members of the community under the bus.”
Horsford said that conservative-backed political groups are trying to pit trans people against other groups, including Black voters. The GOP unleashed countless ads targeting trans people during the 2024 election – though Democrats rarely, if ever, campaign on trans protections.
When Horsford was the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, he said he hosted meetings with HRC to have “a conversation with some of the Black leaders in Congress to talk about this issue, because we understood that the trans issue was being directly targeted to Black voters and others to try to divide us.” 
“I do think it’s important for all of us to be more supportive, to declare publicly more support, and to not shy away from difficult conversations,” Horsford said. 
 Hearts and mind, laws and policies

The roundtable featured a mix of trans and queer locals as well as providers and nonprofits that provide services to the LGBTQ+ community, who shared a sense of hope tempered by uncertainty.
Robinson said it was important to highlight, and share, all stories, to give weight to “the humanity of our experiences.”
“From the HIV epidemic to the attacks on marriage, we’ve always seen how our stories can not only shift hearts and minds but shape laws and policies,” she said. 
Torri Shack, the head of programs at the LGBTQ+ Center of Southern Nevada, said with curtailment of resources for LGBTQ+ youth, such as mental health and gender-affirming care services, he is worried about a potential rise in suicide. 
“The bottom line is that hostile rhetoric fuels the crisis and (gender) affirming care and inclusive policies save lives,” Shack said.
Some hoped to see more positive media coverage to really underscore the humanity of trans people. Others spoke of the frustration that “what we’re dealing with is that our government’s completely not ours anymore.”
“I truly believe resilience is the way that we’re going to get through this,” Shack said. “Sitting aside on the sidelines, watching all this stuff happening, feeling sad and blue and staying in our house. That is not an option anymore.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1027-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-26 08:56:23.389471

“We tried to hold hands and talk about the way the world should be,” Newsom said. “We can’t just think differently, we have to act differently.”
The flier, however, featured a statement from Gloria Chun Hoo, president of the California chapter of the League of Women Voters, denouncing Newsom’s effort to set aside — temporarily, he promises — the districts drawn by an independent, bipartisan commission four years ago. The organization later emphasized it was not affiliated with the coalition that sent it.
“California has become a national model for independent redistricting,” Hoo’s statement read in the mailer. “Let’s protect the integrity of our democratic process and reject the dangerous idea of mid-cycle redistricting.”
So in a nutshell, that’s the issue before voters as they ponder the fate of Proposition 50 in a Nov. 4 special election. The flier delivered to voters last Thursday is just the beginning of what will be a tsunami of mail, text messages, emails, video spots and other propaganda for and against the measure, driven by tens of millions of dollars — perhaps hundreds of millions — by the two parties and their ancillary allies.
That assumes, of course, that Trump’s declared intention to block California’s measure with a Department of Justice lawsuit fails.
The stakes are enormous. The most obvious is whether Trump will continue to enjoy GOP control of both congressional houses, but there is also the effect on Newsom’s nascent campaign for the presidency in 2028.
Oddly, however, Newsom is fundamentally playing for a tie. Even if voters approve Prop. 50 and it generates five more Democratic members of Congress, it would merely offset the five-seat gain that Republicans seek in Texas through their own new maps. Whether any gerrymanders ultimately decide the 2026 election won’t be won in California or Texas but in the other states — both red and blue — that are also considering redistricting.
An all-out gerrymander war would appear to favor Republicans, the Wall Street Journal suggested recently.
“Republicans have one-party control or veto-proof majorities in more states and fewer guardrails around redrawing maps,” the reporter declares, adding, “More than a dozen red states and three blue states meet the conditions to potentially redistrict for 2026 without the need for a special election or amending the state constitution.”
Shawn Donahue, a political science professor at the University at Buffalo, told the Journal that Republicans would pick up as many as six House seats nationwide from a fully blown redistricting battle. 
The scenario raises three questions about the Newsom-led redistricting drive in California.
Will voters do his bidding? 
Would rejection of Prop. 50 torpedo his presidential ambitions? And if Democrats do gain California seats in 2026 but don’t recapture the House, would Newsom still benefit?
Victory in November is not a slam dunk. A new poll by UC Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies, found support to be lukewarm: 48% among all voters and 55% among high-propensity voters. Professional campaign advisors who work ballot measures generally assume that proponents need about 60% initial support to have a strong chance of surviving the opposition campaign.
While Prop. 50 will be on the ballot, it will also be a proxy war for the transcontinental feud between Trump and Newsom, and to some extent, the rivalry between Newsom and other Democrats who may fancy themselves as 2028 presidential candidates.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/030524-Election-Primary-MG-CM-10.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-26 08:56:23.389471

(Altayb/iStock / Getty Images Plus)When people use the term “Orwellian,” it’s not a good sign.
It usually characterizes an action, an individual or a society that is suppressing freedom, particularly the freedom of expression. It can also describe something perverted by tyrannical power.
It’s a term used primarily to describe the present, but whose implications inevitably connect to both the future and the past.
In his second term, President Donald Trump has revealed his ambitions to rewrite America’s official history to, in the words of the Organization of American Historians, “reflect a glorified narrative … while suppressing the voices of historically excluded groups.”
This ambition was manifested in efforts by the Department of Education to eradicate a “DEI agenda” from school curricula. It also included a high-profile assault on what detractors saw as “woke” universities, which culminated in Columbia University’s agreement to submit to a review of the faculty and curriculum of its Middle Eastern Studies department, with the aim of eradicating alleged pro-Palestinian bias.
Now, the administration has shifted its sights from formal educational institutions to one of the key sites of public history-making: the Smithsonian, a collection of 21 museums, the National Zoo and associated research centers, principally centered on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.
On Aug. 12, 2025, the Smithsonian’s director, Lonnie Bunch III, received a letter from the White House announcing its intent to carry out a systematic review of the institution’s holdings and exhibitions in the advance of the nation’s 250th anniversary in 2026.
The review’s stated aim is to ensure that museum content adequately reflects “Americanism” through a commitment to “celebrate American exceptionalism, [and] remove divisive or partisan narratives.”
On Aug. 19, 2025, Trump escalated his attack on the Smithsonian. “The Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was…” he wrote in a Truth Social post. “Nothing about Success, nothing about Brightness, nothing about the Future. We are not going to allow this to happen.”
Such ambitions may sound benign, but they are deeply Orwellian. Here’s how.
 Winners write the history

Author George Orwell believed in objective, historical truth. Writing in 1946, he attributed his youthful desire to become an author in part to a “historical impulse,” or “the desire to see things as they are, to find out true facts and store them up for the use of posterity.”
But while Orwell believed in the existence of an objective truth about history, he did not necessarily believe that truth would prevail.
Truth, Orwell recognized, was best served by free speech and dialogue. Yet absolute power, Orwell appreciated, allowed those who possessed it to silence or censor opposing narratives, quashing the possibility of productive dialogue about history that could ultimately allow truth to come out.
As Orwell wrote in “1984,” his final, dystopian novel, “Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.”
Historian Malgorzata Rymsza-Pawlowska has written about America’s bicentennial celebrations that took place in 1976. Then, she says, “Americans across the nation helped contribute to a pluralistic and inclusive commemoration … using it as a moment to question who had been left out of the legacies of the American Revolution, to tell more inclusive stories about the history of the United States.”
This was an example of the kind of productive dialogue encouraged in a free society. “By contrast,” writes Rymsza-Pawlowska, “the 250th is shaping up to be a top-down affair that advances a relatively narrow and celebratory idea of Americanism.” The newly announced Smithsonian review aims to purge counternarratives that challenge that celebratory idea.
 The Ministry of Truth

The desire to eradicate counternarratives drives Winston Smith’s job at the ironically named Ministry of Truth in “1984.”
The novel is set in Oceania, a geographical entity covering North America and the British Isles and which governs much of the Global South.
Oceania is an absolute tyranny governed by Big Brother, the leader of a political party whose only goal is the perpetuation of its own power. In this society, truth is what Big Brother and the party say it is.
The regime imposes near total censorship so that not only dissident speech but subversive private reflection, or “thought crime,” is viciously prosecuted. In this way, it controls the present.
But it also controls the past. As the party’s protean policy evolves, Smith and his colleagues are tasked with systematically destroying any historical records that conflict with the current version of history. Smith literally disposes of artifacts of inexpedient history by throwing them down “memory holes,” where they are “wiped … out of existence and out of memory.”
At a key point in the novel, Smith recalls briefly holding on to a newspaper clipping that proved that an enemy of the regime had not actually committed the crime he had been accused of. Smith recognizes the power over the regime that this clipping gives him, but he simultaneously fears that power will make him a target. In the end, fear of retaliation leads him to drop the slip of newsprint down a memory hole.
The contemporary U.S. is a far cry from Orwell’s Oceania. Yet the Trump administration is doing its best to exert control over the present and the past.
 Down the memory hole

Even before the Trump administration announced its review of the Smithsonian, officials in departments across government had taken unprecedented steps to rewrite the nation’s official history, attempting to purge parts of the historical narrative down Orwellian memory holes.
Comically, those efforts included the temporary removal from government websites of information about the Enola Gay, the plane that dropped the atomic bomb over Hiroshima. The plane was unwittingly caught up in a mass purge of references to “gay” and LGBTQ+ content on government websites.
Other erasures have included the deletion of content on government sites related to the life ofHarriet Tubman, the Maryland woman who escaped slavery and then played a pioneering role as a conductor of the Underground Railroad, helping enslaved people escape to freedom.
Public outcry led to the restoration of most of the deleted content.
Over at the Smithsonian, which earlier in the year had been criticized by Trump for its “divisive, race-centered ideology,” staff removed a temporary placard with references to President Trump’s two impeachment trials from a display case on impeachment that formed part of the National Museum of American History exhibition on the American presidency. The references to Trump’s two impeachments were modified, with some details removed, in a newly installed placard in the updated display.
Responding to questions, the Smithsonian stated that the placard’s removal was not in response to political pressure: “The placard, which was meant to be a temporary addition to a 25-year-old exhibition, did not meet the museum’s standards in appearance, location, timeline, and overall presentation.”
 Repressing thought

Orwell’s “1984” ends with an appendix on the history of “Newspeak,” Oceania’s official language, which, while it had not yet superseded “Oldspeak” or standard English, was rapidly gaining ground as both a written and spoken dialect.
According to the appendix, “The purpose of Newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expression for the worldview and mental habits proper to the devotees of [the Party], but to make all other modes of thought impossible.”
Orwell, as so often in his writing, makes the abstract theory concrete: “The word free still existed in Newspeak, but it could only be used in such statements as ‘This dog is free from lice’ or ‘This field is free from weeds.’ … political and intellectual freedom no longer existed even as concepts.”
The goal of this language streamlining was total control over past, present and future.
If it is illegal to even speak of systemic racism, for example, let alone discuss its causes and possible remedies, it constrains the potential for, even prohibits, social change.
It has become a cliché that those who do not understand history are bound to repeat it.
As George Orwell appreciated, the correlate is that social and historical progress require an awareness of, and receptivity to, both historical fact and competing historical narratives.

Messer, 31, said in an interview Friday that he is running to ensure “true conservative values” are represented in the state house. He said his priorities if elected are to cut government waste and reduce taxes.
“We need to make sure we’re being the most efficient with the taxpayer dollars as we can be,” Messer said. I want to reduce our taxes, and that includes working towards removing property taxes for your primary residence and lowering the state income tax.”
He also wants to sponsor an election audit bill to ensure election integrity in the state. Wood sponsored a similar bill in 2025. It passed the House in March, but was never considered by the Senate. According to the Movement Advance Project, seven states do not have a law requiring an election audit.
There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud or voter fraud reaching levels to overturn an election. According to the Heritage Foundation, a conservative leaning think tank that tracks election fraud, there have been 39 cases of election deceit in Alabama in the past 25 years. Over 2.2 million Alabamians voted in the 2024 presidential election. 
“A certain number of precincts would be randomly selected to be checked to see if the elections were done correctly, and that all the ballots were counted correctly. That would include a hand count of the paper ballots,” he said. “We’re not talking about like 50% of the state’s precincts here, but just something that we can put in place that would regularly check the elections to verify the integrity of the election.”
Messer, who ran in the 2022 GOP primary against Wood, said he had not decided if he would run in the 2026 midterm election for the seat. If he wins the special election, he said he would run for reelection, but would not if he lost. 
“I think whoever wins this race deserves to have the full opportunity of at least having four years,” he said.
The business owner said voters should choose him because he is an outsider to Alabama politics.
“I’m an outsider. I’m not part of the crew. I’m not part of the Montgomery establishment,” Messer said. “I am just an everyday small business owner that believes that we need change in Montgomery.”
Nelson, 41, said in an interview Friday afternoon that she would also prioritize reducing income tax. Alabama’s income tax rates are set by a 1933 constitutional amendment. Nelson said she’d change it the same way it was created.
“We would have to go back in and make that amendment,” she said. “Obviously not having served in the Legislature at this point, I don’t know all the details and formalities of what that looks like, but I do think that it is something that is very needed. Ultimately that’s the Legislature’s role, is to make those amendments when needed.”
She also wants all public and private K-12 schools to have a resource officer and wants the state to continue to invest in K-12 education. She has homeschooled her children since 2015, and supports policies like the CHOOSE Act so that parents can make the best decision for their children’s education.
“It just has that trickle effect of we make our schools safer, we make our community safer, we have less crime, and overall, we make our state safer,” Nelson said. “God gives us children as gifts, and we need to be able to educate them how we see fit and what’s best for them and exactly what they need.”
Nelson previously said she was not sure about running for office in 2026, but in a text message Saturday said she would since learning about the Democratic candidate in the special election Hazel Floyd.
“In the Nelson home we have a philosophy of, ‘If you are not part of the solution, you are part of the problem.’ Every day we strive to be problem solvers, critical thinkers, and great neighbors,” Nelson wrote in a text message. “I want to lead by example, face the problems head on, and be willing to sit at the table to get to a resolution even when we may not all agree.”
Floyd, 21, said in an interview on Thursday that she is running to give her community a young voice in the Legislature. If elected, she said she wants to boost business development beyond Valley city limits, strengthen public education funding and support farmers.
“When you drive around District 38, you really only notice that Valley is booming. Some of our other cities are more rural areas, they’re lacking and losing businesses,” Floyd said.
Floyd graduated from the University of Alabama in May after attending Alabama public schools for her childhood education. She said that, because of her experience in public school, she wants more state funding to go to public schools, rather than private schools. The CHOOSE Act, a voucher-like program that can be used for private school tuition using state funding, was appropriated $180 million from the Education Trust Fund (ETF) for FY 2026. The state budget is intended to fund public education.
“I know a lot of students that I would be representing, since I represent all ages in our district, a lot of students are worried about safety,” she said. “ I would also like to be able to vote on bills that allow students to feel safer in schools, without feeling trapped.”
In a statement on Dixon’s campaign website, the cotton and peanut farmer said he understood the issues that rural Alabamians face.
“With a heart for service and a history of stewardship, Garrett Dixon is ready to stand up and be a voice for the district he’s always called home,” the statement said.
The primary election is on Oct. 21, with a runoff election on Nov. 18, if needed. The general election will be on Feb. 3, 2026. 
The Legislature has seen several departures this year, triggering special elections. Voters in Cullman County will go to the polls Tuesday and again in October to choose Alabama House representatives. In addition to House District 38, special elections will also take place early next year for House districts in Walker and Tuscaloosa counties.
Rep. Matt Woods, R-Jasper, won a special election in June for a Senate seat previously held by former Senate President Pro Tem Greg Reed, R-Jasper, leading to the Walker House special election. The Tuscaloosa seat opened up after Ivey appointed former Rep. Cynthia Almond, R-Tuscaloosa, president of the Alabama Public Service Commission.

Republican support for in vitro fertilization, after surging in the wake of a 2024 Alabama Supreme Court decision that threatened the procedure, may be splintering as President Donald Trump retreats from his IVF promises and more far-right voices gain ground.
Earlier this year, conservatives in the Tennessee House staged an eleventh-hour skirmish over an IVF protection bill introduced by two of their Republican colleagues. The bill eventually passed, becoming one of the first in the nation to explicitly protect access to IVF. But some lawmakers who voted for it have signaled their willingness to revisit the issue.
In Georgia, a Republican-sponsored bill to codify the right to IVF into law sailed through the legislature, even as fellow conservative lawmakers introduced their own anti-abortion bill that opponents warned would undermine the IVF protections in the new law.

In statehouses around the nation, IVF has emerged as a dividing line running through the Republican Party. Particularly in states where abortion is banned, lawmakers who unite under the “pro-life” banner disagree over whether the popular treatment gives life or destroys it.
People who believe embryos are children oppose IVF because it can involve the discarding of some embryos, which they say is akin to abortion.
“The popularity of IVF creates a dilemma for Republican politicians who have had anti-choice organizations as a key part of their constituency for their whole careers,” said Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.
After the Alabama Supreme Court ruled last year that embryos are people, fertility clinics around the state temporarily halted their services, sparking nationwide outrage.
Republicans and Democrats rushed to pledge their support for fertility treatments such as IVF and announce their plans to protect it.

On the campaign trail last year, Trump promised to make insurers cover IVF so that it would be free for patients. After taking office, he signed an executive order giving White House officials 90 days to assemble a list of policy recommendations on protecting IVF access and reducing costs.
In March, he called himself “the fertilization president.”
But a week later, his administration eliminated the team of experts at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention responsible for tracking IVF outcomes across the United States. The team had, among other things, operated a database allowing consumers to look up an individual fertility clinic’s success rates. Earlier this month, The Washington Post reported that the White House doesn’t plan to require insurers to cover IVF services, though administration officials told the newspaper that IVF access remains a priority.
Meanwhile, conservative groups that oppose abortion have begun pushing an obscure alternative treatment for infertility called “restorative reproductive medicine,” or RRM. Advocates have urged the White House and federal and state legislators to back RRM, which is based on the idea that the underlying causes of infertility can be treated through lifestyle changes and improving a person’s overall health.
Arkansas recently became the first to pass a pro-RRM law. Others might follow suit in upcoming legislative sessions.
Cole Muzio, founder and president of the Georgia conservative Christian nonprofit Frontline Policy Council, said he doesn’t expect to see legislators try to ban IVF outright, despite preemptive efforts by legislators in his state and others to protect it.
“Republicans are intrinsically pro-family, and the idea of supporting those who want to have a family is a conservative, noble, positive thing,” he said.
“At the same time, IVF discards an overwhelming number of human lives. We’ve got a lot of work to do to educate people.”

IVF pushback grows louder

This spring, the Tennessee bill protecting IVF passed unanimously in the state Senate. But by the time it hit the House floor in April, many of its Republican supporters sat silently while a few of their GOP colleagues tried to derail it.
The bill’s sponsor, Republican state Rep. Iris Rudder, told the Tennessee Lookout that she hadn’t expected disagreement over the bill to “mushroom the way it did.”
It eventually passed. But 11 Tennessee House Republicans sent a letter to GOP Gov. Bill Lee urging him to veto it and calling it “a Trojan horse that could potentially undermine Tennessee’s strong and righteous stance on the protection of innocent human life.”
Lee signed it in April.
The following day, Tennessee Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson — who voted for the bill and said he supports IVF and contraceptives — told constituents during a legislative forum that he’d had “lots of conversations” about it and expects the legislature to revisit the issue again in the next session.
“I think we’ll be back next year to take another stab at it,” he said.

In Georgia, the state’s most powerful Republicans made a bill to codify the right to IVF a major priority this year. It was signed into law in May.
“Thanks to a lot of bipartisan support and hard work, Georgians who want to grow their families will never have to worry about whether or not they can access this vital treatment,” the bill’s sponsor, Republican state Rep. Lehman Franklin, posted to X after it passed through the legislature. Franklin and his wife conceived through IVF, a story he has shared publicly as he promoted the measure.
“At the end of the day, being pro-family means being pro-IVF,” he wrote.
Muzio, of the Frontline Policy Council, believes the IVF debate represents not so much a split in the Republican Party as it does a lack of education about what the treatment really means to people who believe human life begins as soon as an egg is fertilized.
“Hopefully you’ll see [legislation] put in place that either backs different fertility treatments that are more pro-life or guardrails put in place to restrict the discarding of human life for the purposes of IVF,” he said.
For conservatives who see IVF as akin to abortion, restorative reproductive medicine has emerged politically as an option for addressing infertility without explicitly supporting IVF, which remains overwhelmingly popular among Americans.

Out of obscurity

RRM was a relatively obscure idea until anti-abortion groups such as The Heritage Foundation began elevating it over the past year as an alternative to IVF. With RRM, a practitioner might help patients analyze their diet, chart their menstrual cycle to look for conditions that can impact fertility, or treat reproductive disorders like endometriosis or thyroid dysfunction.
Supporters argue that a more holistic approach is a better way to treat infertility, and that RRM methods are much less expensive than IVF, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars.
But RRM has been criticized in mainstream medical circles. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists calls RRM a “nonmedical approach” and an “unproven concept” that can delay time to pregnancy and expose patients to needless and painful surgical interventions, such as procedures to treat polycystic ovarian syndrome. It says the approach overwhelmingly puts the onus on women, ignoring that infertility causes are just as common in men.
Some experts worry that patients spending months or years on RRM treatments will lose precious time when IVF could have helped them get pregnant.
And OB-GYNs warn RRM is closely tied to the anti-abortion “personhood” movement, which attempts to grant fertilized eggs the same legal status as people — potentially leading to a loss of rights for pregnant patients and more severe restrictions on birth control and other reproductive health care.










They put their considerable resources into asking, ‘How do we blunt the momentum IVF is getting without saying we’re opposed to IVF?


–  – Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine


Tipton, of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, believes RRM is more “ideology” than medical practice.
“[RRM] got legs thanks to the work of really influential right-wing and anti-choice groups,” he said. “They put their considerable resources into asking, ‘How do we blunt the momentum IVF is getting without saying we’re opposed to IVF?’”
But as RRM gains mainstream attention, it’s also found supporters in the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement promoted by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Some consumers remain skeptical of the fertility industry, where some clinics have ties to private equity firms and other large corporations.
In March, Arkansas Republican state Rep. Alyssa Brown told fellow legislators that RRM “prioritizes women’s health over the profits of Big Pharma and Big Fertility.”

First in the nation

Brown sponsored a first-of-its-kind bill in Arkansas — which passed in April and was signed into law — that requires state insurance companies to cover RRM treatments.
Brown promised during a hearing that it wouldn’t limit access to IVF. Arkansas was one of the earliest states, in 1991, to require insurance companies to cover IVF.
A similar bill with the same title, the RESTORE Act, was introduced in Congress again this year, after failing last year. It includes recommendations from The Heritage Foundation and the conservative, anti-abortion Ethics and Public Policy Center.
Arkansas’ new law also requires programs funded through Title X, which provides birth control and other reproductive care to low-income families, to use fertility awareness-based methods, mirroring a similar effort at the federal level. Under Kennedy, HHS has indicated plans to use Title X funding to open an “infertility training center.” Part of the center’s focus, according to its grant announcement, is to “educate on the root causes of infertility and the broad range of holistic infertility treatments” available to patients.
Meanwhile, state legislators around the country this year attempted to require health insurance to cover IVF, including in Montana, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia.
Nevada’s Democratic-controlled legislature passed a bill in June establishing the right to fertility treatments, including IVF, but it was swiftly vetoed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo.
In May, Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed a bill into law requiring a state insurance commission to consider coverage for procedures like IVF, a move that sets the stage for requiring health insurance companies to cover it. Before signing, Youngkin tried to insert a provision allowing private plans to opt out of coverage for religious or ethical beliefs, but the legislature rejected the change.
Although he signed the measure, Youngkin said his exemption idea needed to be taken up if the state eventually mandates coverage of fertility treatments.

Parking policy may sound like a wonky issue, but as Donald Shoup says at the beginning of The High Cost of Free Parking “the cost of parking is hidden in higher prices for everything else,” including housing, businesses, and our built environment. 
Hartford wisely realized this and made history when it became the first American city to fully eliminate parking mandates city-wide in 2016. While Hartford’s parking reforms took time to kick in, they’re helping lead to an infill building boom in the city. 
Parking mandates —government requirements that force homes and businesses to provide a set amount of parking— profoundly impact Connecticut’s built environment. These requirements are arbitrary and based on pseudo-science, and they make infill development especially challenging. 
Prior to these reforms, Hartford had a confusing array of inflexible regulations that mandated a parking space and a half per home in a city where over 70% of households have one or fewer vehicles. It went further, mandating one space per 600 square feet for retail stores and two spaces per 500 square feet for offices, often meaning that you’d often have more parking than building. Years of these parking mandates being on the books hollowed out downtown Hartford and led to 33% of its land area being surface parking (and that doesn’t account for garage spaces). The spatial costs of parking are immense, and with each space taking 325 square feet, excessive amounts of parking are incompatible with the walkable commercial centers that make Connecticut so great. 
In 2014, Hartford realized that their parking mandates were holding the city back and losing them $1,200 in annual tax revenue for every unnecessary parking space. Eliminating parking mandates helped Hartford approve a 35-year high 468 homes in 2024 and welcome new businesses all across the city. Let us highlight a few exciting examples:
Forge City Works, a Hartford based non-profit, opened Grocery on Broad in 2024 to provide fresh affordable groceries to the Frog Hollow neighborhood and continue its mission of providing job training. This store adaptively reused vacant space, provided net-zero new parking, instead sharing existing parking that was lightly used during grocery store hours, flexibility that wasn’t possible a few short years ago.
Two dilapidated buildings across from a school in Hartford’s Clay Arsenal neighborhood are coming back as housing. To put it simply, these investments would not be happening without parking reform

94 Edwards – Abandoned and boarded up for over 10 years. Fully renovated and brought back to livability in 2021 thanks to the flexibility of Hartford’s new code. Provided parking without any city mandate but at a level less than the pre-2016 mandate required.
98 Edwards – Fire damaged in 2016, demolished in 2020 and now proposed for a new 20 home apartment building at a range of income levels and home sizes. Providing one parking space per unit without any city parking mandate.

Parking reform’s key benefit is that it recognizes that the world is complicated and that arbitrary, inflexible numbers passed down from planners may not get it right much of the time. Yet these pseudo-science regulations exist in nearly every town in Connecticut. 
For example, in Naugatuck’s business district —right next to its train station, which is getting a long overdue multi-million dollar upgrade —you need to build three parking spaces per studio apartment – three times more parking than living space! Meanwhile, Trumbull mandates you build four parking spaces before you’re allowed to build an in-law suite for an aging parent, who may not even be capable of driving.
It isn’t just Hartford that’s recognized how pointless these policies are: Thompson, in Connecticut’s Northeast corner, eliminated parking mandates in 2020, and in the four years of 2021-2024 permitted twice as many homes per year (25) as it averaged in the 16 years from 2004-2020 (12.25). This is not just a Connecticut phenomenon, either; a 2024 research study found that absent any other reforms, eliminating costly parking mandates can boost home building by an astonishing 40 to 70 percent.
Dropping parking mandates is a clear way to get housing built, support small businesses, and strengthen our walkable town centers. The Connecticut legislature was right to include it this session in HB 5002 to bring the benefits statewide, and any future housing bill must include similar reforms.
In Part II, we look at the nationwide, bi-partisan movement to pass parking reform.

Nellie Pou's recent trip to Israel has fueled criticism of her from the left as GOP attacks on her intensify in advance of her first reelection bid.,"Rep. Nellie Pou's recent trip to Israel has fueled criticism of her from the left as GOP attacks on her intensify in advance of her first reelection bid. (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)Rep. Nellie Pou, a Democrat who won her first election to Congress in 2024 even as her district swung to the right, is facing increasing attacks from progressives and Republicans as she gears up for her first reelection fight next year.
Republicans believe Pou, who succeeded Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. after Pascrell died last August, is the most vulnerable House Democrat in New Jersey, and have targeted her over her votes against GOP spending bills and for her opposition to President Donald Trump’s immigration policies. Progressive activists, meanwhile, are criticizing her for joining other Congress members on a recent trip to Israel paid for by a pro-Israel lobbying group.
Micah Rasmussen, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics, noted that incumbents are easiest to topple during their first reelection campaigns, and Republicans have a slim majority in the House of Representatives that they want to retain after next year’s midterm elections.
Rasmussen added that Pou’s vulnerability was exposed last November when she won her election by a relatively small margin. Pou defeated Republican Billy Prempeh by five points. The last time Pascrell sought reelection in a presidential election year, he defeated Prempeh by 34 points.
At a time when Rasmussen believes laying low would be the safest way for Pou to keep her seat, he said her trip to Israel made her an even bigger target.
“It’s just the icing on the cake,” he said. “This melting pot of the district, it adds all these layers of opportunity.”
In a statement to the New Jersey Monitor, Pou spokesman Mark Greenbaum defended the junket by saying members of Congress “face a responsibility to be in the room where decisions are made.”
“Congresswoman Pou took the opportunity to meet with decisionmakers face-to-face and there pressed for a surge in aid to address the humanitarian crisis, the freedom for all remaining hostages, the path to a two-state solution, and a clear stated plan for ending the war in Gaza and rebuilding to begin,” Greenbaum said.
Selaedin Maksut, executive director of the New Jersey chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, warned Pou will lose key support if she doesn’t stop accepting support from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee — one of its affiliates paid for the trip to Israel — and vocally support the Palestinian community in Pou’s 9th District, which includes Paterson neighborhoods with significant numbers of Palestinian residents.
“Even in the Republican Party, we are seeing more and more people come out very vocally and boldly against support of Israel. The blind support that our government has cannot be justified,” said Maksut.
The 9th District, which includes parts of Bergen, Hudson, and Passaic counties, has historically been a solidly Democratic one. But Trump won the district by about one point (in 2020, Biden won it by nearly 20 points), a win fueled in part by support from Latino voters. The district is 41% Hispanic, census data says.
Pro-Palestine protestors who gathered near Pou’s office last week demanded she stop taking money from pro-Israel lobbyists and sign on to the Block the Bombs Act. That bill would block the transfer and sale of certain U.S. weapons to Israel unless Israel provides assurance that it will comply with U.S. and international human rights laws.
Pou’s visit to Israel came just after Israel officials approved a military occupation of Gaza City, and as Paterson residents grappled with disrupted water service and citywide boil advisories after a massive water main break. Hafsa Habehh of American Muslims for Palestine’s New Jersey chapter said Pou should have remained home to deal with that crisis.
“Lawmakers are supposed to spend their August recess in their communities to engage with constituents and work in their districts,” Habehh said.
Meanwhile, the attacks on Pou from Republicans are relentless. The National Republican Congressional Committee sent 11 press releases in the first three weeks of August attacking Pou as an “out-of-touch” Democrat, “clueless,” and a supporter of the far-left.
“Pou won’t be squatting in this Trump-won district much longer,” one says.

And up to 80 GOP lawmakers could be heading to the White House today, Aug. 26, for a meeting with officials and cabinet secretaries to discuss the effort, along with other topics. 
On Monday, Rep. Andrew Ireland, a Republican from Indianapolis, posted on X that he, “fully support(s) Congressional redistricting in Indiana.

— Andrew Ireland (@AndrewIrelandIN) August 25, 2025
Democrats haven’t won a statewide office since 2012, though vote counts for statewide races are typically 40-60 in favor of Republicans.
Voting rights advocates, some of whom have already vowed to challenge any new maps, emphasize that any process should be transparent and respect current laws and regulations.
“We shouldn’t discount that these civil rights protections and voting rights protections still exist, still bind state legislatures and map makers to respect the rights of Black voters and voters of color,” warned attorney Ami Gandhi. “And we won’t accept any type of unjust redistricting just because of the current political fight in our state and in our country when these tools do still, in fact, exist for the benefit of voters.” 
Republicans haven’t yet publicly announced whether they would try to redistrict Indiana to net two more GOP seats in Congress, though they’ve considered the subject behind closed doors and outside polls are attempting to measure Hoosier support. Doing so would require Gov. Mike Braun, who hasn’t made his preference public, to call a special session.
Gandhi is the director of the Midwest voting rights program for the Chicago Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights.
She, and other advocates, have expressed concerns that redistricting in 2025 could dilute the voting power of communities of color. Responding to questions from the Indiana Capital Chronicle, Gandhi shared a high-level perspective on what to consider when it came to racial gerrymandering and potential violations of the Voting Rights Act.
Racial gerrymandering is a constitutional violation, with the motivation “to prevent a racial minority group or community of color from electing the candidates of their choice,” Gandhi summarized. 
Another legal tactic to challenge maps would be a claim under section two of the Voting Rights Act, a monumental, 60-year-old law that transformed voting nationwide. This method would partly rely on a mathematical analysis to determine if the voting power of communities of color was diluted under a new map. 
The two broad categories of race-based redistricting considerations can have overlapping criteria, but offer distinct advantages should voting rights advocates feel inclined to pursue such a challenge. 
 The Voting Rights Act

In the decades since the Voting Rights Act became law, some states have been directed to create majority-Black districts to protect the voice of minority voters. But one Louisiana case before the U.S. Supreme Court could upend that precedent.
Black Louisianans make up one-third of the state, which has two majority-Black districts out of six total House seats, as detailed by Politico. A previous map had just one majority-black seat — and is the subject of the case before the nation’s highest court now. The decision to rehear the case after 80 minutes of arguments in the spring has some academics worried about the future of the Voting Rights Act. 
“Over the last several years, undoubtedly, voting rights have been eroded by (U.S.) Supreme Court decisions and the jurisprudence of the federal courts more generally that has been quite discouraging for voters, especially communities of color and civil rights advocates like myself,” Gandhi said. 
  Ami Gandhi, Director of the Midwest Voting Rights ProgramChicago Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights
Future rulings could further limit these voting rights protections, she said, potentially triggering the need for a new law or state-level action. 
The Brennan Center for Justice, an organization focused on voting rights, proposes a “modernized” version of the Voting Rights Act named after civil rights activist John R. Lewis. It would retain federal approval of state actions in areas with a history of voting discrimination — something the Supreme Court ended over a decade ago — but also allow these jurisdictions to “bail out” with a certain filing, rather than a lawsuit. 
The above act is a potential answer for the center’s vision for voting rights protections. Following a 2013 case that struck the federal approval, “the (Supreme) Court has also made it harder to win suits challenging discrimination in voting. The result: new restrictive state voting laws are passing at a record pace and participation by voters of color is declining.”
In response to actions in Texas to redistrict, Brennan Center analysts have pushed for Congress to take action on gerrymandering, saying it “leads to less choice, less representation for voters, and less accountability for politicians.
“It also produces more polarization, as party voters rather than general election voters have the loudest say. And voters of color all too often suffer the most as their communities are cynically sliced and diced to engineer partisan advantage.”
But Gandhi emphasized that voting rights advocates will continue to use the tools at their disposal.
“We definitely haven’t given up. And we still do utilize civil rights and voting rights protections to advocate for our communities,” Gandhi said.
 Public input and data

Should new maps be drafted, Gandhi called on map makers to release any numbers used to inform their lines. A “very hasty attempt” to redistrict outside of the traditional timeline can cause several different issues, she said, especially if it isn’t “data driven” and doesn’t have “robust public participation.”
“The public deserves more information and data about the populations at issue. And if, hypothetically, the state were making an argument that Black voters and voters of color in Indiana are not entitled to protections in redistricting, then they should show their cards and share specific demographic data to justify any such assertion,” Gandhi said. 
Additionally, any information about voting patterns or other pertinent analysis should also be made publicly available, she added. 
As Democrats fight ‘fire with fire,’ gerrymandering opponents seek a path forward

“If they got to the point where they were asserting that there doesn’t need to be a particular type of district … then they shouldn’t be scared in the least of sharing the data on demographics and on voting patterns that would lead them to such a conclusion,” Gandhi said. 
Demographically speaking, the 7th Congressional District is the only district in the state where less than half of the area, or 47%, is white, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Black Hoosiers, the second-largest racial group behind white Hoosiers, made up less than one-third of the district. 
In the 1st district, 63% of residents identified as white in a 2023 survey compared to the 17% who identified as Black. 
The share of minority voters in the other seven districts — which are all held by Republicans — ranges from 23% to 12%. In comparison, Louisiana’s 2nd Congressional District contains portions of New Orleans and Baton Rouge and is nearly 50% Black.
As a whole, the state grew by roughly 2% between 2020 and 2024, or 137,688 people. But following the inauguration of President Donald Trump, over 1 million immigrants have left the country — causing the country’s foreign-born population to decline for the first time since the 1960s, according to Pew Research Center.
Should Republicans opt to pursue redistricting, Gandhi cautioned that data shouldn’t be the only consideration and public input should also be incorporated into any final maps.
“Numbers alone never tell the full story when it comes to voting rights of people of color and voting power,” Gandhi said. “… there’s also no substitute for line drawers hearing from voters who are looking to elect candidates of their choice.”
She added that such public input should come at the “formative stages of map drawing,” with shared drafts and opportunities for review or feedback with changes “meaningfully” incorporated before final passage.

Every change matters, but imagine what we could achieve collectively in the state if we reimagined the outdated and often lethal model of what a yard should look like.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Lucie Lehmann: Vermonters, it’s time to get rid of your lawns.","This commentary is by Lucie Lehmann, of South Burlington. She is the vice president of the Green Mountain Audubon Society. 


Across Vermont, the sounds of late summer compose a natural symphony. Birds sing, albeit less lustily than in spring. Bees and cicadas buzz sonorously, and frogs twang like well-plucked bass strings. 
Other noises, less pleasing, are equally ubiquitous: the roar of gas-powered lawn mowers, string trimmers and leaf blowers.
Americans are obsessed with their lawns. They are the single largest irrigated crop that we grow — more than 40 million acres, or 2% of our land mass. Eighty-one percent of homeowners have a lawn, according to the National Association of Landscape Professionals. 
We do not just mow those confoundingly green deserts. We obsessively water, fertilize and treat them with pesticides. 

READ MORE

Americans collectively apply roughly 70 million pounds of fertilizer and a staggering 80 million pounds of pesticides annually to achieve the perfectly green, but lifeless, quilts that blanket most yards in the United States, according to the Pesticide Action Network. 
That does not include the 9 billion gallons of water a day that Americans use for landscape irrigation; the 3 billion gallons of gas needed to mow and edge the lawns every year; or the ecological toll those actions inflict on the environment, on lawn care workers and on unsuspecting people who walk barefoot on treated lawns or ingest the chemical fumes.
It certainly does not factor in the loss of habitat for wildlife or the deleterious effects of chemical runoff on our drinking water sources, lakes, rivers and other bodies of water.
The planet is growing hotter and drier every year, and extreme flooding is more prevalent. Aquifers are draining at unprecedented rates. The linkages between toxic chemical use and rising rates of cancer and other diseases cannot be dismissed, and we are experiencing a catastrophic crash of bird, insect and amphibian species, among others. Still, most American homeowners continue to subscribe to a deadly, 1950s vision of the endless, perfect lawn. 
We simply cannot afford to do that anymore. 
Three years ago, with the approval of my homeowners’ association, I took out my 20-by-20-foot front lawn. Clustered tightly together, the gardens in my neighborhood — such as they are in newer developments — were devoid of almost any life. 
While I had not expected the abundance that I had enjoyed on the farm where I lived for decades, I also was not prepared for the utter sterility of my new environment, a neighborhood that touts its self-proclaimed eco-friendly footprint. The mowers that roared over our identical green patches barely disturbed anything alive. 
By contrast, as soon as I took up the lawn and replaced it with native perennials, including grasses, honey bees appeared, followed quickly by a wide variety of native bee species. Hummingbirds arrived and found the tubular flowers of the penstemons and other nectar-rich blooms. Butterflies sipped milkweed blossoms. Sphinx moths appeared at dusk to pollinate, and tree frogs sang from my gutters, portending rain. 
Now, during spring and summer, there are regularly 10 species of birds singing in my yard, and bluebirds and chickadees nest in my boxes. When I added a rain garden to mitigate the runoff from the houses behind me, the new vernal pond became an amphibian breeding hotspot. Today, damsel and dragonflies swoop over the shallow water while mixed flocks of songbirds bathe together.
It was not just the wildlife that noticed the changes in my yard. So did my human neighbors. At first the garden attracted curiosity, then admiration. People asked questions about what I had done and what plants I had used. Before long, other people began eliminating part or all of their lawns and planting pollinator-friendly gardens. 
It is an encouraging trend.
Every change matters, but imagine what we could achieve collectively in Vermont if we reimagined the outdated and often lethal model of what a yard should look like. If everyone who owned a lawn replaced even a part of it with a patch of something beneficial. 
You do not have to be an avid gardener to make that possible — but you do have to care more about the environment than you do about a perfect lawn. There are wonderful low-maintenance native shrubs and grasses that provide food and habitat for birds and pollinators. There are lots of local resources to advise people on what might work best for their yard. 
Nature will always try to rebound when given the chance, but we have to act before it is too late. At a time where many of us feel impotent to effect positive change, you would be surprised at how empowering it is to create a living space that welcomes nature in, rather than continuing to extinguish it.

Lipski praised the Red Cross as “an amazing partner,” but added,  “When we see them feeling the strain, we feel like we should step up and help.”

Following the historic Aug. 9-10 floods which overwhelmed the streets and infrastructure across Milwaukee County, the Red Cross opened two emergency shelters for people who could not return to their homes. Those two shelters were closed down and re-located to Marshall High School, with about  50 people reportedly depending on the shelters. 
During the Monday press conference, Mayor Cavalier Johnson said the flood was particularly hard on people who already depend on strained public services, particularly unhoused people in Milwaukee. 
As of Aug. 19, more than 3,400 homes were assessed as either destroyed or sustaining major damage from the flooding, which occurred as some parts of Milwaukee County received over 10 inches of torrential downpour. The estimated price tag exceeded $34 million for public property damage.
“Now, we’ve all seen the shock and the tears in the eyes of folks who’ve been affected by those floods,” said Johnson. 
“The trauma’s enormous, and the sadness is really, really deep,” he added.  “… all these folks, they need a place to go — a safe place to go.”

At least two people drowned during the floods, the mayor said, including 49-year-old Juan Carlos Sierra Campos, whose body was discovered in Lake Michigan the morning after the floods, and 72-year-old Isaias Serna, who was found drowned four days after the floods in Port Milwaukee. “Now, both these men apparently were unhoused individuals, and that circumstance may have been part of the reason why they ended up losing their lives,” Johnson said. Both men were reportedly known to live in the same encampment under the bridge, at the intersection of South Chase Avenue and South 1st St. Two other men from the same encampment are reportedly still missing.
“I want all of our neighbors to be sheltered, and to be sheltered safely,” said Johnson. “I want everyone within the sound of my voice to think, really take in account, about how you might be able to assist.” 
Milwaukee officials are calling on local residents to pitch in however they can. Whether by opening the doors of a church or business to become a shelter, or volunteering at an existing shelter. The Milwaukee Public School district has provided emergency shelter space, Johnson said, but that will be coming to an end in just a few days when the new school year starts. 
Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said it made him feel hopeful to see residents step up to help each other. But he also said the struggle to find shelter for flood victims shows the severity of Milwaukee’s housing shortage. “The bottom line is this,” said Crowley, “we need more safe and accessible shelter locations throughout the community so when emergencies like the floods happen, we’re prepared.”  
 










We want folks to understand that by opening your doors, especially in times of crisis, that you can help to provide more of our residents with not only safety, but some stability, and a hope that they need during the hardest times of their lives.


– David Crowley, Milwaukee County Executive. 


 
Catherine Rabenstine, CEO of American Red Cross of Wisconsin, said that after disasters “one of the most urgent needs is a safe place to stay,” somewhere that “people can catch their breath, gather their thoughts, and begin to recover.” Many people who were  displaced by the floods can only find shelter space far from their own neighborhoods, schools, jobs and support systems, she said. “It makes an already difficult time even harder.”

While the Red Cross has 14 shelter partner facilities across Milwaukee County, only two are located on the North Side “where most apartment fires occur, and where flooding recently hit the hardest,” said Rabenstine. She added,  “we need to grow this network, so that no family has to wait for safety.” 
Crowley, who has worked to create more affordable housing opportunities, said the flood’s impact has rippled out to touch other areas of need in  the community. 
“This has really shown …  that we have a huge need for housing just in general,” he said.  “ …  whether we’re talking about people being displaced due to the natural disaster, or people being displaced due to evictions or not having enough money to actually make their rent,” Crowley told Wisconsin Examiner, “I think this shows that we need greater partnership between municipalities, with the state, as well as the federal government to really focus on housing issues.
Scientists have long warned that more intense rainfall and greater flood risks would be among the ways climate change would affect Wisconsin. Rep. Omokunde, who has worked on climate change legislation, told the Examiner, “We know that when you  have fossil fuels that are burning, and they’re going into the air, it causes heavier rains. And we have to cut down our carbon emission. If it’s not more evident with these kinds of floods, it needs to be more evident now.”
Omokunde said that Wisconsin should focus on ways to capture carbon and support legislation to cut carbon emissions in half by 2030 and achieve net-zero by 2050. “So let’s come to the table, and come up with a plan to say that we need to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions,” he said.

Sen. LaTonya Johnson said that although the Legislature is on break, conversations are happening around the flood aftermath. Officials are also waiting to see how the federal government assesses the damage in Milwaukee, and whether additional federal assistance will be approved. “It’s still a huge concern for us, even with FEMA’s involvement,” Johnson told Wisconsin Examiner. 
While touring damage with Gov. Tony Evers, Johnson said she saw houses that had been completely washed off their foundations. ‘There is no salvaging those properties for some of those homeowners, but they still have mortgages,” said Johnson. “So what happens to those dwellings? And we know that even if FEMA does step up, their job isn’t to make people 100% whole. So what does that look like for some of those homeowners and landlords, and how do they get those properties back on the market?” With affordable housing already scarce in Milwaukee and Wisconsin, Johnson wonders what will happen “with even more houses taken off the market” due to flood damage.

‘America should mine, mill and manufacture more,’ says Forest Service leader, who was appointed by Trump in February.
The post USFS chief Tom Schultz outlines vision for more logging, mining and grazing and less wildfire in America’s national forests appeared first on WyoFile .","WHITEFISH, Mont. — U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Shultz on Tuesday said America’s national forests need less wildfire and more logging, mining, grazing and recreational activity.
Schultz was the keynote speaker at a conference organized by the Congressional Western Caucus and chaired by U.S. Rep. Doug LaMalfa, R-California. The multi-day summit in the Flathead Valley has given U.S. senators and representatives an opportunity to talk policy with state officials, industry groups and prominent think tanks such as Americans for Prosperity.
Schultz said his “back-to-basics” approach to “multiple-use management” will favor expedited review for natural resource development by overhauling agency guidance on federal laws such as the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act. Schultz also said he intends to aggressively suppress all wildfires and make more U.S. Forest Service land accessible for recreational use by motorized users and others.
“America should mine, mill and manufacture more,” he told those assembled at the Lodge at Whitefish Lake, adding that more of the country’s national forests will be available to log in the near- and long- term to comply with Trump’s executive orders and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed into law on July 4. 
Schultz said implementing those directives will give companies more certainty to invest in lumber mills, which cost about $250 million to build.
“Right now I don’t know what Congress is going to do,” he said.
During his Tuesday afternoon address, Schultz indicated that the Department of Government Efficiency-led effort to reduce the Forest Service’s ranks has not led to as many cuts as the Trump administration initially proposed. In February, the agency fired more than 3,000 agency personnel who were considered probationary, meaning they hadn’t been in their current position for more than a year or two. 
“We have not been firing people outside that process,” he said, adding that most of those employees returned “eventually.” 
Schultz told MTFP that some employees had opted into the early retirement offer, but there is no active reduction-in-force effort underway. Under that program, sometimes called RIF, federal agencies can reduce their payrolls in a manner considered more durable by being more thoughtfully considered.
“I can’t say for certain there won’t be any [reductions in force], but that’s not the plan,” Schutlz said. 
Trump announced Schultz’s appointment to lead the Forest Service in February. He is the first chief who hasn’t previously worked for the agency, which he describes as a strength. He worked for the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation between 1997 and 2011 before pursuing public- and private-sector forestry roles in Idaho.

Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark Hortman outside of the Minnesota State Capitol Tuesday, June 17, 2025 in St. Paul. (Photo by Nicole Neri for the Minnesota Reformer)BOSTON — In some of his first public comments since being shot in an attempted assassination, Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman urged fellow lawmakers to refocus on the true purpose of public service.
“We can’t let the evil of the night win, and we must redouble our efforts and reclaim the reason we are all public servants,” he said.
That means listening to one another, extending understanding even in disagreement, and finding compromise: “not because it’s easy, but because the people we serve deserve better than constant stalemate built on partisan egos. They deserve solutions.”
Hoffman appeared via video message before thousands of lawmakers and staffers gathered at the National Conference of State Legislatures summit earlier this month in Boston. In June, he and his wife were shot in their Minnesota home just before the politically motivated shooter killed state Rep. Melissa Hortman, the former House speaker, her husband, Mark, and their dog, Gilbert.
The June shooting hung over this year’s meeting of the NCSL, a group that labors to maintain a reputation for bipartisan and nonpartisan work. Lawmakers in attendance on the left and the right repeatedly lamented the toxicity of American politics and the growing threat of political violence at local levels of government.
Many lawmakers raised questions about whether public service is still worth it, how state governments can buck the partisanship that defines Washington, D.C., and what measures lawmakers should take to keep members safe. Most lawmakers said they remained committed to serving, but they said conservatives and liberals must find ways to disagree without demonizing their opposition and do better at monitoring the rhetoric of members of their own parties.
Wisconsin House Speaker Robin Vos, a Republican, said the vitriol of social media and cable news has made it more difficult to talk with people of differing beliefs. Technology has reduced the frequency of many human interactions, he said. Even the rise of video doorbells has made it difficult for candidates and officials to talk with everyday constituents in person, as many refuse to answer.
“So instead of knocking on doors and meeting strangers, you have a tendency to go to party events where you are meeting people who want to come and meet you,” he said. “Well, they come from usually one end of the spectrum. They’re people who are probably paying too much attention to politics and not enough to all the other things in the world.”
Author and media personality Michael Smerconish asked Vos whether the current climate pushes good candidates away and incentivizes “zealots” to run.
“That’s a really good point,” Vos responded. “Part of my job is to recruit candidates, and it is very challenging to get people who are willing to put their personal life on the line and convince their family that there is nothing more fun to do on a Sunday morning than to go to a pancake breakfast.”
He said potential candidates are worried about how their kids will be treated in school and what effect running could have on their careers. But he said state governments can model a more civil political tone and show how government works. Even simple moves like holding bipartisan meetings with staff — rather than holding separate caucus meetings — can help to forge more positive relationships.
“We are places where people can disagree, but we don’t have to be hateful,” he said. “And maybe, just maybe, over time we’ll be able to showcase to the rest of the country that that’s the way that legislatures lead.”

 ‘Hold people accountable’

Since the June shooting in Minnesota, liberal and conservative states alike are considering measures to bolster protections for candidates and elected officials.
Legislation proposed in New Jersey would prohibit the publication of home addresses of lawmakers, adding them to a list of protected officials that includes judges and law enforcement. That legislation remains in committee.
ln North Dakota, lawmakers are considering establishing a more formal process for reporting threats, the North Dakota Monitor reported. A North Dakota man was charged in June with sending threatening messages to officials in which he referenced the Minnesota shootings. Legislative staff have already removed the home addresses of lawmakers from the legislative website and are considering providing post office boxes for lawmaker mail and creating new safety training.
Pennsylvania lawmakers will soon introduce a package of bills to boost legislator safety, limit their public exposure and ensure representation if a lawmaker dies while in office, the Pennsylvania Capital-Star reported.
In Oregon, House Speaker Julie Fahey said lawmakers and staff are thinking more about personal safety. State law doesn’t allow candidates to use campaign funds for security purposes, but the Democratic speaker said the legislature may soon change that.










I think it’s really important that we talk about the threats and we talk about the impact.


– Oregon House Speaker Julie Fahey, a Democrat


During an NCSL session about the cost of public service, Fahey referenced protesters’ 2020 armed breach of the state Capitol in Salem and noted that she’d had an angry constituent show up at her home.
She said lawmakers and staffers need to talk more about the cost of their work, which can be isolating, especially for those in leadership positions.
“I think it’s really important that we talk about the threats and we talk about the impact,” she said.
Sitting next to her, West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said it’s not just personal safety that weighs on lawmakers.
It’s just as taxing on spouses and families — who he said are “front and center” in any conversation about running for office nowadays.
When he first assumed his leadership position in 2018, Hanshaw said he saw his job as mostly confined to running the chamber and worrying only about the behavior of members in their official capacity. But his thinking has evolved in this political environment, which he said requires modeling and monitoring of personal behavior and online activity of members of his caucus.
“That was the wrong approach,” he told Stateline. “And I would say that to anyone who’s coming into one of these roles: You need to set the example and you need to hold people accountable.”

 ‘What is your why?’

Pennsylvania Democratic House Speaker Joanna McClinton said the current political environment is markedly different because officials at all levels of government can be targets.
“And what we must all collectively do is to condemn the violence, to bring the tone of rhetoric down and out of our capitols, and most importantly let folks know that we can always agree to disagree, but we can never, ever allow there to be violence in discourse,” she said in an interview.
While the climate has not deterred her from serving, McClinton said it does provide an opportunity to underscore the solemnity of public service and helps frame a candidate’s purpose for running and deciding whether it’s worthwhile.
“What is your why?” she said she increasingly asks potential candidates. “What is your purpose? What do you plan to achieve, to accomplish? Why is it that you want to do this?”
Tim Storey, the chief executive officer of NCSL, said state legislatures are more bipartisan than many realize. Even in dogged legislative fights, many bills ultimately pass with support from both sides — or even unanimously.
“There’s a relatively small group who just demonize the other side,” he said in an interview. “I think for the most part, they still see each other as humans who are actually in a really unique job, and so only they can understand each other and the sacrifice and the pressure that gets put on by the public exposure.”
He said that was especially true following Hortman’s assassination.
“They felt it across the aisle of both parties,” he said.
Storey said NCSL’s Boston summit was a record-breaker with more than 1,600 state lawmakers and thousands more staffers and lobbyists in attendance.
The event kicked off with two of Minnesota’s top legislative leaders — a Democrat and a Republican — on stage in front of a packed ballroom talking about the assassination.
Republican House Speaker Lisa Demuth said Hortman had always treated her as a partner rather than an adversary. With mutual trust and respect, they could “disagree without being disagreeable,” she said.
State Sen. Erin Murphy, the Democratic majority leader, said politicians must turn down the vitriol in their rhetoric.
“I think a lot of America would appreciate that. I know Melissa would,” she told the crowd.
But she said lawmakers must also root out dehumanizing narratives and conspiracy theories that have led to the radicalization of so many individuals.
“We can’t lose faith in each other. We can’t lose faith in America,” she said. “As Melissa taught us, failure is not an option.”

Rock Springs lawman accused of murder won the lottery when famed Wyoming attorney took his case. But columnist Kerry Drake asks, was justice served?
The post Spence’s defense of Cantrell was a major case in his storied career appeared first on WyoFile .","If Gerry Spence went looking for a client to advance his reputation as one of the country’s best trial lawyers, he couldn’t have found a better one than Ed Cantrell.

Opinion

The Rock Springs police chief killed Michael Rosa, one of his detectives, by shooting him between the eyes two days before he was scheduled to testify at a state grand jury in Cheyenne in 1978. Few people in Wyoming gave Cantrell any chance of beating what looked like the most open-and-shut murder case imaginable.
When Spence died on Aug. 13 at his home in Montecito, California, he left a remarkable legacy of never losing a criminal jury trial or civil case from 1969 to his 2010 retirement. He took on many deep-pocketed opponents, including McDonald’s and Penthouse magazine, winning millions of dollars for clients. 
The civil case that put Spence in the national spotlight was a $10.5 million judgment he won for the family of Karen Silkwood, a chemical technician and whistleblower who was contaminated at Kerr-McGee’s Oklahoma plutonium plant. She died in a mysterious car accident on her way to see a reporter.
The case was made into the award-winning movie “Silkwood.” Like several of Spence’s cases, the verdict was overturned on appeal. An out-of-court settlement of $1.3 million was reached.
The Silkwood trial was sandwiched between Cantrell’s preliminary hearing and trial. Spence frequently discussed the case with reporters at Cantrell’s hearing.
I still think his defense of Cantrell was Spence’s most significant win. Against all odds, he saved a man from either a long prison sentence or the death penalty, which he was eligible for because he killed a police officer. But his acquittal meant no penalty options were presented at the trial. There were several aborted attempts to make Cantrell’s story into a film, too.
I was a reporter for the Wyoming State Tribune in Cheyenne, and I didn’t expect my assignment to cover Cantrell’s preliminary hearing in Rock Springs to last long.
These proceedings were typically perfunctory because prosecutors just needed to show a judge that a crime occurred and there was enough evidence against the defendant to hold him for trial. But Spence, with his Western drawl, trademark buckskin jacket and cowboy hat, immediately took over the courtroom and treated it like a stage.
Three weeks later, Justice of the Peace Nena Stafford, looking exhausted after enduring this legal marathon, declared that Cantrell was bound over for trial. It is still the longest preliminary hearing in Wyoming’s history.
It coincided with temperatures plunging to 22 below. It was in the days before cell phones and laptops, so I used the only pay phone outside the courthouse, shivered and dictated my stories by my noon deadline.


There was no time for lunch, because if reporters wanted to get a seat in the packed room, we had to stand in line with everyone else who wanted to see history in the making. 
One afternoon, I scored a front-row seat near the county attorney’s table. Before the hearing got underway, Spence walked by. He took one of the prosecution’s documents, then handed it to me.
“Have you ever seen anything like this?” he asked, peering over his glasses, then walked away. I didn’t even have time to read the damned thing before the prosecutor leaned over and read me the riot act. He demanded to know my name and who I worked for. I was terrified, even before he loudly declared that what I did could result in a mistrial.
Spence rushed over, admitted he had taken the document and absolved me of any untoward behavior. It took a minute but the other attorney dropped it, though he gave both of us a weary, disgusted look.
Spence, who had literally thrown me to the wolves and then acted as my rescuer, apologized. But he had a big grin on his face as he went back to work. 
Despite getting consistently good media coverage, Spence wasn’t happy with reporters. In “Gunning for Justice — My Life and Trials,” the first and best of his 20 books, Spence complained that the minds of the state’s entire population were “altered by the poison of the press” that had already declared Cantrell guilty.
Spence labored to poke holes in the state’s theory, which was that Cantrell deliberately shot Rosa to permanently silence him. The Rock Springs police department had been under the microscope for alleged corruption since the previous year, when Dan Rather of “60 Minutes” profiled the boom town for allowing prostitution, drugs and gambling to flourish.
Cantrell had summoned Rosa to the unmarked police car. The other two detectives who were already in the car testified they didn’t see Cantrell pull out his .38 caliber pistol and shoot Rosa. 
Chief Detective Joe Callas said after he heard the deafening shot and saw Rosa’s bloody body, he shouted, “My God, Ed, what have you done?” He said Cantrell returned his question with a “cold stare.”
Callas told investigators he talked to Cantrell the night before the shooting and said his boss was angry at Rosa. “At one point [Cantrell] said words to the effect of, ‘Maybe we ought to just take the son-of-a-bitch out and kill him,’” said Callas, who added he didn’t take the threat seriously.
Spence maintained Cantrell was the real victim, and portrayed the Puerto Rican Rosa as an out-of-control druggie who had a vendetta against Cantrell and made the mistake of trying to outdraw him.
A lot of time at the hearing was devoted to examining crime scene photos of Rosa, who had a wine glass in his lap that was three-quarters full. Rosa had a gun, but it was still in his holster.
The state said the evidence showed Rosa made no effort to reach for his gun. But Spence said Rosa’s glass was in his lap to keep his hands free to shoot Cantrell.
I was pumped up to cover the trial, which was moved to Pinedale because it would be difficult to find impartial jurors in Rock Springs. But I became editor of our Sunday edition and had to give up my plum assignment.
Spence fine-tuned his defense to perfection. On the stand, Cantrell said he thought Rosa was reaching for his gun: “I could see in his eyes he was going to get me. It was him or me.” Was this happening in Pinedale or Hollywood?
My friends who covered the trial said the highlight and turning point was two fast-draw demonstrations Spence used to show Cantrell was so quick with a gun that it’s no surprise that once he feared for his life, he killed Rosa before the detective could even reach for his weapon. 
The jury bought it all, deliberating less than three hours before finding Cantrell not guilty. But throughout his career, Spence liked to describe himself as a “warrior for justice.” Was this in any way justice?
I don’t think so. Neither does Rone Tempest, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist for the Los Angeles Times (and later WyoFile co-founder), who wrote a riveting book in 2020 about Cantrell based on his examination of previously unearthed documents. The title spells out how Tempest sees it: “The Last Western, the Unjustified Killing of Michael Rosa by Ed Cantrell.”
Former Wyoming U.S. Attorney Kip Crofts wrote a long critique of Cantrell’s case and apologized to Rosa’s family for the lack of a fair trial and Rosa’s depiction by the defense as “a villain and a criminal intent on murdering his boss for no good reason.” Wyoming should officially apologize.
In their books about the trial, Spence and Tempest both related a conversation the attorney had with Cantrell shortly after his acquittal.
Spence asked Cantrell if he was worried people would think he was found not guilty because he was represented “by a smart lawyer.”
A defiant Cantrell shot back, “Fuck ‘em, I’m free.”
Spence wrote that years after the trial, people would chastise him for defending a man who was so clearly guilty. Everyone accused of a crime is presumed innocent and entitled to a fair trial under the U.S. Constitution.
Forty-seven years later, I think Cantrell won the lottery when he landed the attorney who declared himself “the best trial lawyer in the nation.” They needed each other: one to stay alive, and the other to put Spence’s career on a path that reached astounding new heights.

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)A new budget report that shows Idaho is projecting an $80 million budget deficit does not factor in the costs of conforming to federal tax changes in Congress’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act, state budget officials said Monday. 
State of Idaho projected to end 2026 fiscal year with $80 million budget deficit, report shows

One outside estimate indicates federal tax conformity could cost the state of Idaho another $167 million that is not calculated into the projected $80 million budget deficit. 
As a result, some state legislators worry the projected budget deficit could be even bigger than it initially appeared in last week’s budget report.
 How does Congress’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act affect Idaho’s budget?

President Donald Trump signed the act into law on July 4.
The act makes several tax changes, which would have an impact on revenue available for state tax systems, the Tax Foundation wrote. 
Those changes include no tax on a worker’s tips, no tax on a borrower’s car loan interest, no tax on a worker’s overtime premium pay and a higher deduction for seniors. 
If Idaho adopts those changes, each of them would reduce revenue. 
“It’s a lot more serious because legislators are going to be asked – I am sure –  to adopt the no tax on tips (provision) and the overtime exemptions (in the act),” Rep. John Gannon, D-Boise, said Monday. “It certainly will have an impact overall on revenue, and that revenue impact will be negative.”

State officials have not yet officially calculated the costs of adopting the act’s tax changes and may not know the full impact of those costs until the Idaho Legislature runs a tax conformity bill during the 2026 legislative session that begins in January, Idaho Division of Financial Management Administrator Lori Wolff said Monday.
 Tax Foundation releases state-by-state report on implications of GOP’s mega law

	 
However, outside cost estimates are circulating.
Last month, the nonprofit Tax Foundation published a report on the state tax implications from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that estimated it would cost $167 million if Idaho were to adopt the tax changes from the bill. 
Keith Bybee, the budget and policy analysis manager for the Idaho Legislative Services Office, and Wolff said Monday Idaho’s budget projections do not include the cost of the act and its new tax changes. 
Any budget deficit would violate the Idaho Constitution, which requires that the state pass a balanced budget where expenses do not exceed available revenues.

Rep. Wendy Horman, an Idaho Falls Republican who serves as co-chair of the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC, said she is not worried about revenue projections issued one month into a fiscal year that began July 1. 
Horman said actual revenue collections last year were higher than the year before, and she isn’t as worried about revenue and budget projections. 
“I’m not going to engage in fearmongering, as some of my colleagues are,” Horman said Monday. “This is about a revenue forecast, not actual revenue. We’ll continue to monitor and assess all available data and make appropriate decisions in January based on actual revenue and revenue trends, regardless of whether they are above or below the forecast. We know it will be one or the other.”
JFAC is a powerful legislative committee that meets daily during the legislative session to set all the budgets for every state agency and department.
News of a projected budget deficit represents a significant change for Idaho, where many of the same state legislators were celebrating a record budget surplus of nearly $2 billion just three years ago. 
Since then, state legislators have taken significant steps to reduce state revenue through tax cuts and credits.
 State agencies have already been asked to cut spending this year

Earlier this month, Gov. Brad Little issued an executive order requiring all state agencies – other than public schools – to cut 3% from their current fiscal year 2026 budget.
Then, a new monthly budget report released by the Idaho Legislative Services Office last week projected Idaho would end the current fiscal year on June 30 with a $79.9 million budget deficit.

The midyear budget holdbacks and projected budget deficit are arriving just months after Little and the Idaho Legislature reduced the revenue available for the state budget by more than $450 million to pay for tax cuts and a new tax credit that reimburses families for education expenses including tuition at private religious schools.
Before the 2025 legislative session, Little proposed $100 million in tax cuts and another $50 million for what became the education tax credit. But legislators pushed the total to $453 million between the tax cuts and new tax credit. 
During a breakfast with the press corps in February, Little expressed concern with the magnitude of revenue reductions put forth by the Idaho Legislature, telling reporters, “So they know, I’m not very happy about it.”
“If I would have thought we could do $450 (million), I would have proposed $450 (million),” Little said then.
State Sen. Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, said sudden cuts to revenue and midyear budget holdbacks are the wrong approach to budgeting in a growing state like Idaho.
“At a time where the population is growing so much, that revenue needs to be reinvested in our state’s infrastructure to make sure we have roads, schools and other services working families benefit from and aren’t starving ourselves out,” Wintrow said. “Now, what roads aren’t going to get finished? What water projects aren’t going to get done?” 
Wintrow said the state already has cut revenue too much, and she worries working families will feel the biggest impact as state agencies begin implementing the 3% cuts Little already ordered.
“My colleagues in the majority party talk so much about being responsible, but this is the most irresponsible handling of the budget I have ever seen,” said Wintrow, who has served in the Idaho Legislature since 2015.

Gavin Newsom unveiled his plan to retaliate if Republican-led Texas redrew its congressional districts to favor the GOP, he affirmed his support for less partisan maps — and then promised to “meet fire with fire.”
“We’re doing it mindful that we want to model better behavior,” Newsom told reporters in Los Angeles earlier this month, nodding to the independent system his state currently uses to draw districts. “ … But we cannot unilaterally disarm. We can’t stand back and watch this democracy disappear.”
President Donald Trump’s call for Republicans to redraw U.S. House districts so the party can win more seats in the 2026 midterm elections — to gerrymander them — has triggered a redistricting frenzy this summer that also threatens to prompt moves by Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and New York, among others. Ohio was already set to redraw its lines, even before the current fracas.
The battle for partisan advantage is placing Democratic politicians, advocates of less partisan maps and others who support curbs on gerrymandering in an uncomfortable position, pitting their desire for change against fears that Trump will take advantage of their scruples to wring more GOP seats out of a handful of key states. Some say they accept that Democratic states need to respond, while others warn retaliation will only yield short-term gains.
The Texas House passed a new map on Wednesday, clearing the way for a final vote in the state Senate and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature. In California, lawmakers passed their own map on Thursday, setting up a statewide vote in November over the new districts.
Other states are now likely to follow, as Republicans and Democrats scramble for a political leg up.










I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard.


– David Daley, senior fellow at FairVote


But gerrymandering opponents say the current moment has the potential to produce new energy for their movement. More people are paying attention to gerrymandering, they say, and new polls show the public opposes the practice. The rush to redraw maps demonstrates the need for Congress to set national limits, they say.
“I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard,” said David Daley, an author of books on gerrymandering and a senior fellow at FairVote, a Maryland-based nonpartisan group that supports ranked choice voting and multimember House districts to end the practice. “We will never have reform if a handful of states can act on their own.”
At the same time, some gerrymandering opponents fear states will unravel hard-fought victories. They wonder whether temporary measures, such as California potentially setting aside the independent commission it uses to redraw maps, could become permanent.
 ‘An unprecedented time’

State legislatures exercise primary control over congressional redistricting in 39 states, according to All About Redistricting, a compendium of information on map-drawing hosted by Loyola Law School in California. While some states use other methods, only nine states rely on independent commissions, which typically limit participation by elected officials and are favored by many gerrymandering opponents.
Most states draw maps once a decade after the census, making the mid-decade maneuvers and counter-maneuvers highly unusual (six states currently have only one representative, eliminating the need to draw district lines). But just a few seats could determine who controls the U.S. House. Republicans currently hold 219 seats to Democrats’ 212, with four vacancies.
“We affirm that gerrymandering, both racial and political, disenfranchises voters,” Virginia Kase Solomón, president and CEO of Common Cause, an organization that has long advocated for changes to the redistricting process, said during a press call the day before Newsom’s announcement.
“But this is an unprecedented time of political upheaval,” she said. People don’t want to see a situation develop where maps are redrawn every two years, she added.
The new Texas map could ease the path for Republicans to win an additional five seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Texas lawmakers rapidly advanced the redraw this week once Democratic state lawmakers returned to the state. They had traveled to other states to deny Texas House leaders the quorum required to approve the map, but returned after Newsom outlined California’s response.
Gerrymandering typically involves “packing” and “cracking.” “Packing” refers to the concentration of opposition party voters in a small number of districts to reduce competition elsewhere. “Cracking” means diluting the voting power of the opposing party’s supporters across many districts.
Texas Republicans have been frank that they are pursuing the redraw for partisan advantage. But they emphasize that no prohibition exists, in Texas or nationally, against mid-decade redistricting and that a 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision cleared the way for states to draw maps for partisan purposes, removing the power of federal courts to police political gerrymandering.
The new maps give Republicans a chance of winning additional districts but doesn’t guarantee victories, they add.
“The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance,” Texas state Rep. Todd Hunter, a Republican who carried the bill in the Texas House, said during floor debate on Wednesday. He added a short time later: “According to the U.S. Supreme Court, you can use political performance, and that is what we’ve done.”
 Tricky terrain

As Texas moves forward and California prepares to respond, Common Cause illustrates the tricky terrain anti-gerrymandering advocates are now navigating.
The group, headquartered in Washington, D.C., fought to enact the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2008. But earlier this month, Common Cause declined to condemn California’s retaliation, saying it will judge the effort by whether the maps are a proportional response to gerrymanders in other states, whether the process includes meaningful public participation, and whether the maps expire and are replaced after the 2030 census through the state’s regular redistricting process, among other criteria.
Newsom’s proposal, the Election Rigging Response Act, will ask California voters in November to temporarily set aside the state’s redistricting commission and approve the new map drawn by the legislature. The commission would resume drawing maps following the census.
Recent polling shows widespread public opposition to gerrymandering. A YouGov poll of 1,116 Americans conducted in early August found 69% believe it should be illegal to draw districts in a way that makes it harder for members of a particular political party to elect their preferred candidates. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The number of Americans who say gerrymandering is a big problem has jumped in recent years. In the YouGov poll, 75% of respondents said it is a major problem when districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party, up from 66% in a 2022 survey.
Some California Republicans have responded to Newsom’s proposal by defending the commission system. A group of Republicans sued in state court to block the plan, but the California Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a request to temporarily halt the effort.
 ‘Is this bad for reform?’

While members of the public might say they favor citizen-led commissions, they may not care deeply about the issue, said David Hopkins, a political science professor at Boston College who has written on polarization in American politics. He called gerrymandering a “classic process subject” that comes off as “inside baseball” to many people.
“The legislators in states that haven’t adopted commissions clearly don’t feel any particular political pressure to do so,” Hopkins said.
Some Republicans in states weighing a mid-decade gerrymander also discount the risk of a public backlash.
In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe may call a special session this fall to redraw the state’s map in hopes of gaining an additional GOP seat in the U.S. House. James Harris, a Missouri Republican consultant with close ties to GOP officials in the state, said he wasn’t concerned redistricting would create momentum to change the process.
Missouri voters in recent years have approved ballot measures favored by Democrats, including one in 2018 that empowered a nonpartisan demographer to draw state legislative districts, though not congressional districts. But Republicans led a successful campaign to convince voters to repeal the changes two years later.
Harris painted any new potential map as part of a national effort to help Trump — who received 58.5% of the vote in Missouri last November.
“I think the lens is wanting to make sure the president has a majority in Congress so he can actually govern for the last two years versus two years of investigations, gridlock,” Harris said.
Advocates of less partisan maps said lawmakers aren’t likely to surrender their own role in mapmaking. While some state courts may limit redistricting excesses, federal courts stopped policing partisan gerrymandering following the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision. And the high court may soon weaken the judiciary’s power to block race-based gerrymandering.
Samuel Wang, director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which supports eliminating partisan gerrymandering, said the “one good thing” about the redistricting battle is that it’s prompted voters to pay attention to an arcane and technical issue. That could be a positive in the long run, he said, “if people can keep a cool head.”
Wang has written online that any response to Texas should remain measured and proportionate. California offers Democrats the only clean option to strike back, Wang wrote. Five Democratic seats could be added by redrawing the state.
“Is this bad for reform? I mean, I’m torn,” Wang told Stateline. “Because on the other hand, Democrats have been, over the last few decades, vocal in their advocacy for voting rights in various forms and now that advocacy is in question because they find a need to fight fire with fire.”
“So I guess the way I would characterize it is if they can hold it in check and not do it in every single state and just engage in whatever they’re doing where it will make a difference,” he said, “then we might not lose all the progress that’s been made.”

The North Idaho event, which will be from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., is part of the Idaho State Parks Foster Family Passport Program — a collaboration between Idaho Department of Parks and Recreation and the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. 
The free event is focused on foster, kinship and adoptive families, according to a press release from the state agencies hosting it, but all families are welcome. Registration is available online here. Participants will meet at the Museum at the Brig at 13350 East Highway 54, Athol, Idaho. 
The event will include access to the Museum at the Brig, which includes artifacts, information and stories about Idaho’s wartime history; guided nature hikes on family-friendly trails; fishing for beginners with guidance from experienced anglers; a native fish trailer from Idaho Fish and Game; and cultural heritage activities with the Coeur d’Alene Tribe, the release said. 
“Foster and kinship families play an important role in the well-being of children across Idaho,” Health and Welfare Family and Community Partnerships Administrator Laura Denner said in the release. “We’re honored to celebrate them through events like this that give families a chance to connect with one another, enjoy Idaho’s incredible outdoor places, and create lasting memories through community.” 
Farragut State Park, located on the southern tip of Lake Pend Oreille in Athol, is a former World War II-era naval training station. 
Light snacks and drinks will be provided until supplies run out. Families may bring a blanket or picnic lunch. 
The event is held as part of Fostering Family Adventures, an effort launched in 2024 with Idaho parks, Health and Welfare, Idaho Business for Outdoors, and Regence BlueShield of Idaho. 
“Farragut State Park is one of Idaho’s treasured places full of natural beauty and unique history, and we’re excited to welcome foster, kinship, and adoptive families for this special day,” Idaho Department of Parks and Recreation Director Susan Buxton said in the release. “This program highlights the strength of Idaho families while encouraging everyone to explore the outdoors, learn together, and experience the history and beauty of our state parks.”

(Photo by Aristide Economopoulos/New Jersey Monitor)A three-judge panel has ruled that Tennessee’s laws against the “intent to go armed” and carrying weapons in state parks are unconstitutional.
In Gibson County Chancery Court, the panel ruled in favor of plaintiffs Stephen L. Hughes, Duncan O’Mara, Elaine Kehel, Gun Owners of America and Gun Owners Foundation in finding the statutes violate Second Amendment and state Constitution rights to bear arms. Despite the ruling, the panel stopped short of ordering the state to quit enforcing the laws.  
The group filed suit against Gov. Bill Lee in February 2023, claiming their rights to carry weapons were violated by both the state’s provision against carrying a firearm “with the intent to go armed” and rules blocking weapons in state parks.
Tennessee maintains a gun permit system and the “intent to go armed” law even though the state’s permitless carry law allows eligible people to carry openly in unrestricted places, as long as they don’t have felony or domestic violence convictions or outstanding domestic violence protective orders. The legislature passed Lee’s permitless carry bill in 2021.










This ruling puts Tennesseans at greater risk by tying the hands of law enforcement officers who encounter people who are armed and potentially dangerous.


– Sen. London Lamar, D-Tennessee


The Gun Owners Association, though, argued that one of its members who holds an enhanced carry permit is unable to “lawfully” carry a gun to defend his family while visiting Tennessee parks. Another of the plaintiffs who holds no carry permit said she fears prosecution if she takes a weapon to a playground, civic center or other area owned by local or state government.
Because state law says carrying a firearm “with the intent to go armed” is a criminal offense, the court said Gun Owners Association and Foundation members can be stopped and arrested “anywhere in the state.”
“This statute makes the entire state a ‘gun-free’ zone” for those members and supporters, the ruling says.
Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti’s office argued, in part, that the state can place limits on the “intent to go armed” because the Second Amendment doesn’t protect the right of people to carry a hand grenade.
Yet the judicial panel found the state’s arguments “unpersuasive” because they don’t defend or address “the constitutional infirmity at the heart of the statute – the criminalization of the constitutional right to bear arms.”
As a result, the panel found Tennessee’s law violates the Second Amendment and Article I of the Tennessee Constitution.
It took the same view on the state’s prohibition on guns in parks.
While courts have found that the government can prohibit carrying guns in “sensitive” places such as schools where children are required to attend class, the panel determined that parks don’t fall into that category because parents aren’t forced to take their children there.
  Rep. Chris Todd, right, a Jackson Republican, says he’s “excited” about the ruling that will allow gun carry in parks. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Republican state Rep. Chris Todd of Madison County said he is “excited” about the ruling on the Second Amendment, which he believes is affirmed by numerous Supreme Court cases. Todd noted that the ruling says those statutes are “void” and “unenforceable” but that the panel acknowledged it doesn’t have the authority to place an injunction on them.
In light of that, Todd said he asked the attorney general to appeal the ruling, potentially to ask for clarity. Such a move could put Skrmetti’s office in the precarious position of arguing against its previous stance.
“It should be a higher court that agrees with this ruling, and I believe they will,” Todd said. 
Democratic Sen. London Lamar of Memphis criticized the court’s ruling by saying it will make Tennessee’s “public safety crisis” worse.
Memphis and Nashville have seen gun thefts from vehicles escalate since the permitless gun carry law took effect.
“This ruling puts Tennesseans at greater risk by tying the hands of law enforcement officers who encounter people who are armed and potentially dangerous. If police can no longer investigate someone for the intent to go armed, officers are left waiting until a crime has already been committed — a failed public safety policy that puts lives on the line,” said Lamar, chairman of the Senate Democratic Caucus.
The ruling was made by Chancellor Michael Mansfield of Trenton, Judge Wyatt Burk of Shelbyville and Judge Lisa Rice of Elizabethton.

Patrick Morrisey. (Photo by Kristian Thacker/West Virginia Watch)Four state-owned hospitals in West Virginia often house and take care of elderly patients — some with complex medical problems and disabilities — who have nowhere else to go. Many patients rely on Medicaid and can’t afford private care.
Gov. Patrick Morrisey is selling the facilities for $60 million, saying New York-based Marx Development Group is buying the properties in Beckley, Fairmont, Terra Alta and West Columbia, and will retain the elderly patients and improve their care. 
Community members and state leaders are hoping Morrisey’s promises are true but worry what it could mean for elderly patients now and in the future. The hospitals, which need millions of dollars in repairs, could be torn down and rebuilt in other locations, removing patients from their communities and eliminating local jobs. 
Cathie Metheny’s mother has lived for seven years as a Medicaid-reliant patient at John Manchin Sr. Health Care Center in Fairmont. She had a list of compliments for the center’s staff.
“She is completely dependent on them for everything. She is unable to speak, unable to walk. She has dementia,” said Metheny, who visits the center nearly every day to feed her mother and spend time with patients she has come to know over the years.
“I just keep waiting for assurance that these people are going to be OK,” Metheny said. “There’s no transparency going on. It makes me wonder what they’re going to do.”
The state’s contract with Marx Development Group hasn’t yet been released to lawmakers interviewed for this story or to the media. West Virginia Watch submitted a Freedom of Information Act Request to the governor’s office for the document.
  Del. Michael DeVault, R-Marion
“The devil is going to be in the details,” said Del. Mike DeVault, R-Marion, whose district includes the John Manchin hospital.
“The ones that are in the system are going to be taken care of, but the needs of the future is the big one I want to know about,” he said.
  Senate President Randy Smith, R-Preston
Senate President Randy Smith’s district includes Hopemont Hospital, one of the facilities being sold. He found out about the sale about 10 minutes before Morrisey’s public announcement. 
“I’ve fought against the closing of them for several years, because I always felt that the patients we had in these facilities were more wards of the state than anything,” Smith said. 
“Some of them just don’t have family [and] no place to go, and that has always been my biggest concern.”
The elderly patient population in these hospitals have significant mental or physical disabilities, according to Mike Folio, legal director for Disability Rights West Virginia. 
“The reality of it all is if these individuals were attractive to private nursing homes, they would already be in private nursing homes,” Folio said. The state’s geriatric and Medicaid-reliant population will continue to grow, he said. 
“There’s going to be an increasing need for a safety net that the current long-term care facilities provide. The problem is that the state doesn’t have the resources to provide the care necessary in a safe and humane manner,” Folio added. 
Smith said taking care of people is imperative as the sale is expected to close next month. 
“We just have to make sure that we just don’t become a state where we have no compassion for people,” he said.

Locations of new long-term care hospitals unknown 
State lawmakers for years have considered off-loading state-owned hospitals, citing their growing price tag and staffing issues. The state’s four long-term care facilities, which have 511 licensed beds, operate at a combined $6 million annual loss, according to Morrisey. A legislative audit published last year found the state spent $284 million on contract nursing staff since 2015 — contract positions pay more than the state’s own full-time nursing jobs.
There were patient care concerns, and, early last year, a non-verbal elderly man died after being left too long in a whirlpool of scalding water at Hopemont Hospital. A state investigation found the water had been too hot for days before his death.
  Sen. Eric Tarr, R-Putnam
“There’s always been the question of the quality of service that we can provide [at the hospitals],” said Sen. Eric Tarr, R-Putnam, who supported Morrisey’s decision to sell. “Now we have a provider that has that expertise, and it’s their business model to do it, and they’re looking for opportunities to provide more of those services … Instead of where the state was, it was just a last resort, and they had to start their own.”
The facilities need an estimated $100 million in renovations, Morrisey said.  
While the governor said the group will build three to five new hospitals with West Virginia labor and materials, Smith emphasized that there was no requirement that the new hospitals be located in the same location.
“That’s a concern,” Smith said, adding Hopemont is the local water and sewer system’s biggest customer. It’s also a major employer in the rural area.  
  Del. Jonathan Pinson, R-Mason
In Mason County, Lakin Hospital is one of the long-term care hospitals being sold by Morrisey. Del. Jonathan Pinson, R-Mason, worried that a potential new hospital would go elsewhere, despite the area’s projected population growth due to the new Nucor steel mill and other high-profile business investments. 
“If we’re going to build brand new facilities, then I want those facilities to be built right here in Mason County,” Pinson said. “The staff that we have here and the patients we have here can just stay right at home.”
Devault said that he feels confident in the governor’s plan so far, but expressed concerns about the future location of the hospitals. 
“You can’t guarantee that we’re going to build here … The market dictates that,” he said. “The last thing I want someone to say is, ‘Well, I had to put my parent in a nursing home, and the closest one that would take her because of her condition — I’m being just hypothetical — is four hours away.”
Chelsey Gheyara is vice president of growth and experience for Majestic Care, a subsidiary of  Marx Development Group that will operate the hospitals in West Virginia. In an email, she said their priority right now was ensuring continuity of care for residents in the current facilities and supporting the staff.
“Over time, as we evaluate opportunities to invest in newer infrastructure, we’ll work closely with local leaders, families and staff to determine the best locations. No decisions have been made, and any future plans will be discussed openly with the communities we serve,” she said.
Company’s subsidiaries accused of discrimination  
Marx Development Group’s subsidiaries have been accused of allegedly prohibiting elderly people who use wheelchairs from living in two of its New York assisted living facilities and allegedly discouraged applications from individuals with incontinence. 
Drew Galang, spokesperson for Morrisey, said the allegation is not against the company which will be operating West Virginia’s health facilities and a separate subsidiary of MDG. The company was thoroughly vetted, he said in an email. 
“The contract between the state of West Virginia and MDG stipulates all federal and state laws must be followed and we have no reason to believe there will be any regulatory concerns,” Galang wrote. 
  Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion
Morrisey said he didn’t need lawmakers’ approval for the sale due to a 2023 bill that split up the former massive state Department of Health and Human Resources and gave authority to the newly formed Department of Health Facilities. 
Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, is opposed to the sale — for multiple reasons, including fearing Medicaid patients would be left without options — and questioned the legality of Morrisey’s decision. He referenced a state code that mandates West Virginia maintain and run seven facilities by name. 
“’I’m investigating and in communication with constituents about whether the governor’s actions have authorization or are legitimate,” Garcia said. 
He continued, “There’s so many questions that the governor’s office has spoken platitudes about but has not given us a written agreement. He has not alleviated the concerns that we would have.”

(Photo by Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)Requiring people who register to vote to reveal their full Social Security numbers, as North Carolina legislators have proposed, would violate a 50-year-old federal law, election and privacy experts told NC Newsline. 
The requirement that voter applicants supply all nine digits of Social Security numbers to register is in the latest version of House bill 958, a sweeping bill on election changes moving through the House. 
The federal Privacy Act of 1974 “makes it unlawful for any local or state government or the federal government to deny a right, privilege, or benefit because a person refuses to provide his or her Social Security number,” according to a 2023 report on Congress prepared by the Congressional Research Service. Under this federal law, North Carolina cannot deny voting rights to people who do not supply the full number. 
North Carolina “can’t carve out a new exception for itself in 2025,” John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, or EPIC, said in an email. He continued: “That’s for good reason: States have other ways to verify a voter’s identity that are far less hazardous to privacy, including driver’s license numbers and the last four digits of a registrant’s Social Security number.”
Existing law requires applicants supply one of those identifiers. 
At a July committee meeting on the bill, Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford) warned that the Social Security provision violated federal privacy law. 
In response, Rep. Hugh Blackwell (R-Burke) and Rep. Sarah Stevens (R-Surry), the bill’s sponsors, mentioned that the applicants for social welfare programs supply full Social Security numbers and the DMV requires them. 
A federal law from 1976 allows state and local tax agencies, social welfare offices, and DMVs to require Social Security numbers. 
In an interview last week, Blackwell would not offer a reason why full Social Security should be required of people registering to vote. 
Blackwell called the bill “a work in progress” and said the best time for him to offer a justification is when legislators have a “finished product.”
More research is going into determining “if there are federal, constitutional, or other issues we need to factor into the decision,” he said. 
The bill has moved through two House committees and is next slated for a hearing in the House Rules Committee. No date has been set for that meeting. 
Five states are allowed to ask for full Social Security numbers because they were grandfathered in before 1974, Lata Nott, director of Voting Rights Policy at the Campaign Legal Center said in an interview. 
However, only two of those five — Virginia and Tennessee — make supplying the full number a registration requirement. 
South Carolina makes it optional. New Mexico is permitted to ask for the full number, but doesn’t.
Kentucky requires it, but that state’s registration instructions say, “No person shall be denied the right to register because of failure to include social security number.”
Two Georgia voters won a federal lawsuit against Georgia filed in 2000 over the requirement that they provide their Social Security numbers as part of their voter registration. Georgia makes providing the full number optional. 
If North Carolina legislators push forward with seeking full Social Security numbers, the state would need to have the Election Assistance Commission, which develops the national voter registration form, change the state-specific instructions for North Carolina, said Sean Morales-Doyle,  director of the voting rights program at the Brennan Center for Justice. 
Legal hurdles to requesting Social Security numbers are in place to make sure states don’t collect the numbers unless they need them and to ensure “they have the infrastructure to make sure it’s done right,” he said. 
Republican legislators’ interest in securing full Social Security numbers on voter forms comes as the Trump administration has dialed back its support for election security. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency ended support for election security and a partnership states had relied on, Votebeat has reported. 
Last week, Arizona’s two U.S. Senators sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem asking what security help the agency would provide in light of the hacking attack into that state’s election website that changed candidate profile pictures to one of Iranian Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Votebeat reported. 
At the last North Carolina House committee meeting on the bill, voters protested  the Social Security number requirement, saying it would create another potential source for leaks of private data. 
“While the clean voter rolls is a policy interest, so is keeping this very personal information secure, Nott said. 
The executive director of You Can Vote, a nonprofit organization that sponsors voter registration drives, told the committee that potential voters would be reluctant to put their full Social Security numbers on forms they would then hand to people they don’t know. 
Common Cause of North Carolina opposes the provision requiring full Social Security numbers, said Bob Phillips, the organization’s executive director. 
“It is a huge identity theft risk,” he said in an interview.  “There seems to be no valid reason to do it other than to put up another barrier” to voter registration. 
“North Carolina has a sad legacy of making voting and registration harder,” he said. 
Phillips said he was encouraged that Blackwell indicated that committee members were willing to listen to concerns about the bill. 
“I hope this is not set in stone, that they actually will listen to reason,” Phillips said. “I don’t think it provides any additional security.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4227-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-26 06:56:47.708371

The Duck River Electric Membership Corporation, a Shelbyville-based electric cooperative serving nearly 83,000 customers across 17 counties, will receive the lion’s share of the investment through a $64.7 million loan. The loan will help the utility build and improve 239 miles of line to connect an additional 7,230 customers, according to the USDA. The electric cooperative previously partnered with the USDA’s Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program to administer pass-through funding for projects supporting job growth.
USDA’s Rural Development programs aim to support prosperity in rural communities by bolstering infrastructure, utilities, business, healthcare, education, and housing, according to the department.
The remaining $24.3 million in loans and grants will help Tennessee communities improve water lines and pump stations, repave streets, and bolster wastewater treatment systems.
Life Christian Academy in Sumner County will receive $3.4 million in loans to expand its daycare program through fifth grade. In Hamilton County, Ivy Academy will use a $5.1 million loan to build a high school career technology center to support student careers in mechanical, electrical, plumbing and automotive fields. 
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins announced the batch of investments while visiting Tennessee on Aug. 18 for the Future Farmers of America breakfast in Lebanon. Rollins also announced an initiative to stop solar panel subsidies and defended more than $31 million in federal funding cuts to agricultural research at the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture. 
Rollins said the grant clawbacks were made to programs “that did not align with the president’s vision of putting farmers first.” One of the grants affected was a $30 million project that aimed to expand markets for climate-smart beef, dairy and small grazing animals.
Other USDA investments in rural Tennessee communities include:

A $2.3 million loan for Cunningham Utility District in Montgomery County to extend water lines to serve 70 more households
A $2 million loan for Celina in Clay County to repave city streets
A $2.75 million loan for the Marshall County Emergency Communications District to build a new 911 dispatch and call center
A $5.4 million loan for the Hallsdale Powell Utility District in Knox County for wastewater line replacement and system improvements
A $729,000 grant and $530,000 loan for the Cooper Basin Utility District in Polk County to build 4,000 feet of water line and build a booster pump station
A $316,000 grant and $397,000 loan for the Webb Creek Utility District in Sevier County to replace concrete wastewater lines with larger iron lines
A $600,000 grant and $1 million loan to Selmer in McNairy County to repair the pump station at McNairy County Jail
$30,000 each in Special Evaluation Assistance for Rural Communities and Households (SEARCH) grants for Erin (Houston County, wastewater improvement engineering), Vanleer (Dickson County, planning to upgrade the town’s water system), and Gallaway (Fayette County, evaluating wastewater treatment improvement options).

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)An American flag has been strategically placed on one of the massive beams supporting the Lake Borgne Surge Barrier, part of the New Orleans region hurricane and storm damage risk reduction system. 
Completed in 2009 to close off the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, the barrier is designed to decrease damage to the metropolitan area when a major hurricane pushes water from the Gulf of Mexico into the lakes that surround the city and neighboring parishes.  
The flag on the wall symbolizes pride and mourning, a reminder of the people it protects and a memorial for those who died 20 years ago when Hurricane Katrina hit. The failure of the federal levee system Aug. 29, 2005, claimed more than a thousand lives, displaced nearly a million people in the region and left permanent scars on New Orleans. 
A go-to term emerged to praise New Orleanians and their neighbors who persevered through the catastrophe and took part in the unprecedented rebuilding: resilient. But as various recovery programs faltered and efforts to ensure disaster history would not repeat itself stalled, “resilient” or “resiliency” now elicit  bitter feelings among locals. 
“I think people have gotten tired of the word. Not just because it’s become cliché, but because people have begun to understand it as an excuse for lack of preparation or execution, lack of planning or execution,” said Michael Hecht, CEO and president of Greater New Orleans Inc., a regional economic development group.   
Hecht came to Louisiana in 2006 from New York, where he led a 9/11 small business recovery program for New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. After directing the state’s post-Katrina business recovery efforts, he was chosen to lead GNO Inc. in 2008. 
“We had been knocked down by an unprecedented event,” Hecht said. “It was either be resilient or die, so we were resilient.”
The world has watched as New Orleans fundamentally changed, having lost a significant portion of its Black working class and attracting an upsurge in mostly white transplants from out of state. With more than 484,000 residents before Katrina, the city’s population plummeted below 344,000 in the 2010 census. The number climbed above 391,000 in 2020 and has since fallen about 4% as of 2024, according to various estimates.  
Most who have stayed are ardent defenders of the city’s culture, of which resiliency fatigue is quickly becoming a feature. It’s reflected in Louisiana’s slow progress to rebuild coastal land and  improve the adaptability of cities to match what post-Katrina boosters envisioned.

Restoration resistance
After Katrina, more emphasis was placed on rebuilding Louisiana’s vanishing coastal wetlands to protect residents from the increasing threat of hurricanes. A state Coastal Master Plan has taken shape over the past two decades, gaining official approval in 2023, to tie together restoration efforts and shield wetlands from sea level rise, subsidence and worsening hurricanes. 
“We learned from Hurricane Katrina that levees alone aren’t enough,” said Alisha Renfro, a coastal scientist with National Wildlife Foundation. “We also need a healthy natural ecosystem sitting out in front of those levees to protect the structures that protect our communities.”
But the master plan encountered a huge setback in July with the end of what had been its keystone project, the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project. Gov. Jeff Landry led pushback against the project for its feared impact on fisheries and nearly $3 billion price tag.
So far, the state’s Coastal Restoration and Protection Authority has spent $600 million to harness the power of the Mississippi River to bring fresh water and sediment to wetlands in the Barataria Basin – only to shelve the diversion. 
“It was probably one of the most innovative, forward-thinking things in terms of being a resilience hub for the world,” said Amanda Moore, senior director for the National Wildlife Federation’s Gulf program.
A lifetime Gulf Coast resident, Moore moved to New Orleans from the Tampa, Florida, area in 2009 to take a job as a community organizer with the National Wildlife Federation. She joined the wave of thinkers, scientists and planners who came to the city after Katrina with the hope of bringing relief from the constant threat of flood. 
“For people who live on the Gulf Coast – and especially South Louisiana – it’s exhausting,” she said. 
The federation was among the voices that influenced upgrades to the region’s storm risk reduction system in the years after Katrina. Moore led efforts such as the MRGO Must Go Coalition, advocating for reversal of wetlands damage attributed to saltwater intrusion from the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet. 
“You’re helping to alleviate maybe some of that exhaustion that people are personally feeling when you do the coastal restoration,” Moore said. “You’re adding this layer of protection, you’re helping it create a healthier environment that’s safer, so that does help people really be more resilient and not burnt out.”
Funding momentum peters out
As Katrina and its aftermath garnered worldwide attention, the recovery money streamed in from Washington and charitable foundations. The federal government directed $76 billion to Louisiana projects.
But keeping up the pace of investment after post-disaster attention spans waned became a problem for state and local leaders. Even with billions of dollars put into infrastructure, billions more would be needed for upkeep and replacing outdated systems. Stormwater drainage and drinking water in New Orleans, for example, rely on a power supply and mains that, in many spots, are more than a century old. 
Charles Allen, Gulf Coast community engagement director for the National Audubon Society, recalls the vast amounts of federal and philanthropic dollars directed to the region in the years immediately after Katrina – and the dropoff that followed. It revealed the inability of state and local governments to sustain the level of rebuilding needed.  
“It’s like anything in life, you know?” Allen said. “We gotta maintain our bodies, and we have to invest in whatever it takes to do that.”
The 2010 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon just off the Southeast Louisiana coast reopened wounds in the region that had yet to heal from Katrina’s trauma. Like the levee failures after the hurricane, It was considered another manmade, preventable disaster. Eleven crew members were killed, and the catastrophic oil spill tainted wildlife and habitat in all five Gulf Coast states. Livelihoods that depended on the Gulf were sidetracked for months, if not ended entirely. 
Petroleum giant BP, which contracted the drillship, reached a $20 billion settlement with the federal government and impacted states. In Louisiana, it provided the long-sought financial foundation for its coastal master plan.
But with the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion shelved – and seemingly no other major restoration projects in the queue – Allen and others with vested interest in coastal flood protection fear Louisiana has become dependent on disaster recovery funding to pay for critical infrastructure that should already be in place.  
“Let’s not wait for another storm because then it’s always too late when that happens,” Allen said  “You gotta invest in it, you gotta support it, you’ve got to fund it.”
“It’s a lot of reactive disaster-related funding that’s allowing Louisiana to do this work,” Moore said. “We’ve got to figure out how to get out of that cycle.”

‘People can just be people’
Katrina recovery funds paid for upgrades to the massive pumping stations at the end of New Orleans’ outfall drainage canals that pump stormwater into Lake Pontchartrain. Beyond that, however, the city hasn’t engineered a way to handle street flooding from routine heavy rainstorms.
One project was held up as a way for New Orleans to adapt to the regular influx of rainwater, rather than fruitlessly attempt to pump it away. The Gentilly Resilience District called for turning neutral grounds in the neighborhood into retention areas. Residents would be encouraged to add features such as rain cisterns and permeable driveways, with grants to cover their cost.
The centerpiece of the district was the Mirabeau Water Garden, planned for 25 acres of land that were once home to a Catholic convent. The Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph donated the land to the city in 2015 on the condition it be used to enhance and protect the neighborhood. It was designed to divert and hold up to 10 million gallons of stormwater in ponds and constructed wetlands, with a pedestrian path and other amenities to invite the public into the space.  
The architecture firm Waggonner and Ball designed the water garden using best practices for how to integrate water into a coastal urban setting. The idea came out of a trans-Atlantic collaboration after Katrina called the Dutch Dialogues, in which New Orleans experts tapped into the Netherlands’ experience living with water. 
The federal government provided $141 million to the city in 2017 to bring the Gentilly Resilience District to life, with a completion date set for September 2022. But as of 2023, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development noted that only 15% of the money had been spent. The water garden remains largely unfinished.
HUD’s inspector general designated the city a “slow spender” in a project audit, noting that its elements “did not always improve the program participants’ ability to withstand future extreme events.”

In addition to his role with GNO Inc., Hecht was named chairman of the governor’s committee to prepare New Orleans for the 2025 Super Bowl, played in February at the Superdome. Part of Hecht’s charge was to track progress on city infrastructure projects. And while the Gentilly Resilience District is well outside the city’s tourist zone, its lack of progress was noticeable.   
“It’s happening. It’s been accepted as a concept, but it’s been extremely slow,” Hecht said. “And that’s just been execution failure, oftentimes on the part of the city.”
The communications team for the city of New Orleans did not respond to a request for comment on the timeline of finishing the Mirabeau Water Gardens. 
The Mirabeau Water Garden’s status is considered by residents to be symbolic of New Orleans falling well short of the post-Katrina vision that boasted resilience as a key component of its new economy. Much like the Netherlands, it was thought that the Crescent City could become a beacon of expertise for how to adapt to climate change.
“We thought we were going to be able to really build a sector around selling our experience post Katrina with water management and environmental management around the world,” Hecht said. “If we’re being honest, it has not materialized much as part of our economy.”
It has happened in a small way, he said, citing the Water Institute in Baton Rouge. The independent research center focuses on the Mississippi River Delta and Gulf Coast, and it has applied its expertise to several projects in the region.
“But I think there’s still a lot more,” Hecht said. 
Allen believes the opportunity to make Louisiana that hub of water management and resilience still exists, but he acknowledged it is still far from materializing 20 years after Katrina. 
“This story of restoration, it’ll never end, which is a good thing,” Allen said. “This kind of work fuels jobs, environmental research and teaching.” 
Until or unless that sector develops, the vulnerability of southeast Louisiana to future disasters will continue to place a strain on its residents, observers say, and climate change only heightens that risk. 
“That is the goal … building structures, either literally or metaphorically, strong enough so that in a world with climate change and weather volatility, when things happen, either natural or man made, we don’t have to be resilient,” Hecht said.
Renfro, the coastal scientist with the National Wildlife Federation, said it’s wrong to keep placing the same burden of recovery on a population forced to accept conditions beyond their control.    
“Asking the same people again and again to be resilient … it feels unfair,” she said. “People can just be people, and infrastructure can be resilient.”

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)This opinion column was first published by the Lewiston Tribune on Aug. 20, 2025.
Bulletin: On or about March 21, U.S. Sen. James Elroy Risch, R-Idaho, announced his candidacy for reelection in an undated news release.
I may be the first to share this news with you. His declaration did not occur in the usual fashion of news conferences, a statewide tour or venues with supporters, balloons, swag and family.
It was not orchestrated for an in-depth, Idaho-wide delivery. Rather it was a binary strategy with President Donald Trump, who provided a generic endorsement. Risch’s perfunctory news release without the customary hoopla was narrowly cast to target Idaho GOP insiders and right-wing faithful (redundant?).
Risch avoided any direct outreach with the general public and the media in his benign campaign launch.
What’s going on here?
Let’s look at the numbers.
Risch is 82. He is Idaho’s oldest serving U.S. senator — ever.
Presently, only U.S. Senate colleagues Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who is 91, Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who is 83, and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who is also 83, are older than Risch.
If reelected next year, Risch will be 89 at the end of his next six-year term.
Closest to Risch in age are his colleagues Sen. Mike Crapo and Congressman Mike Simpson, both R-Idaho and both 74, as well as Sen. William E. Borah, R-Idaho, who was 74 when he died in office in 1940.
The oldest serving Idaho politician was former Idaho Secretary of State Pete Cenarrusa. He left office at 85.
Risch has been in office since 1970. There were a couple of gap years, but he has essentially been an elected official since the height of the Vietnam War (Risch had ulcers and avoided the draft).
Risch creates a whole new category of “career politician” in Idaho.
He is the seventh richest U.S. senator, serving today with an estimated net worth of $54.5 million.
As of June 30, Risch had a whopping $2.85 million cash on hand in his campaign account. You can be certain any Republican with a heartbeat contemplating a run for the U.S. Senate would consult the Federal Elections Commission website and be dissuaded from running because of this war chest, as well as Trump’s endorsement.
Even with these numbers and factors in mind, I can only conclude that Risch is gaslighting us. Risch’s age, wealth, shallow record and campaign war chest are key factors that point to a retirement at age 83.
His reelection announcement is a ruse, a feint, a smokescreen. But he is reluctant to share that news with us — at this time.
Let’s drill down on other key factors.
The Idaho GOP is at war with itself. There have been numerous censures of sitting Idaho GOP legislators, ugly primary elections and overwhelming influence of outside-of-Idaho groups feeding legislation to right-wing lawmakers eager to curry favor with national funders.
The Kootenai County Republican Central Committee unanimously endorsed the John Birch Society, and county central committees are fighting with local legislators over strict adherence to platforms drafted by ultra-right groups.
In that context, Risch’s reelection announcement points to an avoidance of a political explosion comparable to the release of the Yellowstone Caldera.
The lid to this erupting political volcano is the combination of Risch having $2.8 million in campaign cash on hand and Trump’s endorsement. All is quiet — for now.
The Idaho glitterati at the highest levels of political influence are buying time with Risch’s perfunctory announcement.
Think for one minute about what a retirement announcement from Risch would mean.
It would unleash the Idaho GOP civil war in its ugliest forms. There would be multiple candidates appearing out of the woodwork to run for a coveted six-year seat. In the process, elected officials would abandon their seats to run for higher office and create another tranche of 2026 right-wing ugliness.
It would make the 1978, six-way GOP primary contest for governor look tame.
As a cherry on top of this political sundae, consider if Congressman Simpson and Risch both announce retirements. Whoa! At that point, the political caldera really explodes.
The only way to minimize this mess is for delayed announcements, now underway, followed by a controlled process to avoid multiple candidate primaries.
I see a path forward based on Risch’s so-called 2026 candidacy. He can “suddenly” accept a nomination from Trump to fill one of 104 ambassadorial vacancies based on his 100% sycophancy. His confirmation would be guaranteed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he now chairs.
Risch’s penchant for foreign affairs took him to many overseas venues. His $2.8 million campaign account could be dedicated to establishing an institute in his name at a university or a think tank to memorialize his lifetime political career.
Gov. Brad Little could, in turn, appoint himself to Risch’s Senate seat and Lt. Gov. Scott Bedke would ascend to governor, thereby blocking Attorney General Raúl Labrador.
We’ve seen a version of this movie before.
In 1990, U.S. Sen. Jim McClure delayed his retirement announcement to pave the way for Congressman Larry Craig to move seamlessly into the nomination. Simultaneously, popular GOP State Sen. Skip Smyser became the unopposed primary candidate for Craig’s congressional seat.
You may think I’m smoking something with this conjecture. We’ll know I’m wrong when Risch comes home to Idaho and holds in-person town hall meetings and news conferences.
However, he cannot nuance his age, wealth, record or authoritarian demeanor. And I’ve seen polls with his approval numbers in the tank.
Until then, the independent-minded Idaho voter will have something to think about when it comes to the 2026 U.S. Senate race.
It may all be up for grabs.

(Photo by Kristian Thacker/West Virginia Watch)The company set to purchase the state’s four long-term care hospitals says they’ll continue a long-standing partnership with senior feeding programs, including Meals on Wheels, in Marion County.
The kitchen at the John Manchin Sr. Health Care Center in Fairmont is used to prepare food for around 200 seniors in Marion County who rely on the senior center and the local Meals on Wheels program for free meals. 
“We deliver all through Marion County,” said Leisha Elliott, director of the Marion County Senior Center.
Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced Aug. 16 that the state would sell its long-term care hospitals for $60 million to New York-based Marx Development group. The hospitals had been operating at a combined $6 million annual loss, according to Morrisey, and the buildings needed millions of dollars in renovations.

The news caught Elliott by surprise and she was unsure about the future of the senior feeding partnership.
Chelsey Gheyara is vice president of growth and experience for Majestic Care, a subsidiary of  a subsidiary of Marx Development Group that will operate the hospitals in the state. She told West Virginia Watch in an email they did not anticipate any disruptions to Meals on Wheels and other food services. 
“We know how important the Meals on Wheels program and senior center services are to the Fairmont community …,” Gheyara wrote. “As we move forward, Majestic Care will work with local leaders and program partners to ensure continuity and collaborate on any future enhancements that benefit residents and the community.”
In response, Leisha said, “We still haven’t heard from the John Manchin Health Center or the new owners.”
She continued, “In the meantime, we are exploring every avenue to ensure our nutrition program is the best it can be, because our top priority is serving the seniors of Marion County.”
Morrisey has said that following the sale, the hospitals will retain the current population and improve the quality of care. As part of the deal, the company has agreed to build three to five new facilities to replace aging facilities and source the materials and labor from West Virginia, Morrisey said. There is no requirement that the hospitals are in the same location, though Majetistic has said that the ultimate goal is to keep new buildings close to the current facilities.
The sale is expected to close Sept. 30 with a possible 30-day extension. 
West Virginia Watch has filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the governor’s office to review the contract. It has not yet been released to the public.

Sign up for their newsletter here.
As experts gathered in Geneva this month to negotiate an enforceable global plastic pollution treaty, scientists studying the Great Lakes continued their research that could pinpoint how microplastics impact human health and ultimately inform decisions made across the world.
The effects of microplastics in wildlife have been documented for over a decade. These effects include declines in fertility in aquatic wildlife; negative behavioral changes; decline in reproduction and metabolic disorders.
However, because microplastics come from so many different sources—such as the air, drinking water and foods—that data can’t be used to determine exact impacts on humans. Other scientists have found microplastics in human brains, placentas and other organs.
Microplastics and other contaminants threaten the ecology of the Great Lakes, which contain almost 90 percent of the freshwater in the United States. Experts are warning their colleagues and those who rely on the Great Lakes about the documented and potential effects of these materials on the environment and human health. The Great Lakes basin, which spans the U.S. and Canada, provides millions of people with freshwater for drinking, agriculture and industry.
Chelsea Rochman, a microplastics researcher and associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Toronto, is currently studying how microplastics act in the environment of the Great Lakes. She is currently a research fellow at the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) Experimental Lakes Area, a remote area of 58 freshwater lakes in Ontario, where scientists can manipulate bodies of water for research purposes to understand how human activity impacts freshwater.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Rochman said that when she began researching microplastics in the Great Lakes, she partnered with Canada’s Ministry of the Environment to test fish that humans eat, specifically in the fillet parts of fish from Lakes Ontario and Superior. While there is no direct research or data showing impacts of microplastics on human health yet, Rochman said that based on the documented impacts on animals and ecological systems, the findings alarmed her.
“When we look at those fish, we find microplastics in every single fish,” Rochman said. “Near the city of Toronto, we find hundreds of particles in an individual fish, sometimes as many as 1,000 in the gut, and dozens of particles in the filet. So it’s a contamination like I’ve never seen before.”
She said that “relevant to other fish,” the fish in the Great Lakes have the highest concentration of plastic in the world in their gut, among areas that have been measured and reported.
“People who eat fish from the Great Lakes could be at risk of being more exposed [to microplastics] from fish than anywhere else in the world,” she said, but emphasized that because microplastics come from so many different sources, fish aren’t a main concern in terms of sources of exposure.
Rochman’s research has helped her develop policy recommendations for both the United States and Canada, which she hopes governments will use in the near future. Those recommendations include protocols for setting up a monitoring framework for microplastics, creating a risk assessment framework and implementing a monitoring program across the basin.
One of the main challenges of microplastics research is determining how the particles act in nature. In the Great Lakes, since there are so many other sources of microplastics—such as stormwater runoff and pollution—documenting their impacts in the natural environment isn’t as easy. The Experimental Lakes Area enables more accurate research that can inform policy and potentially provide clearer answers about impacts on human health in the future..
Other researchers are applying their work to the basin directly. Junhong Chen, a professor at the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering at the University of Chicago, is co-leading the Great Lakes ReNEW Water Innovation Engine program, which aims to recycle water from the Great Lakes into a clean energy resource and recover heavy metal contaminants to build batteries. The project also focuses on removing contaminants—including heavy metals, bacteria, nutrients and microplastics—from the water. The 10-year effort is funded by a $160 million grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) Recovery of any Nutrients, Energy, Water (ReNEW) program.
The project is currently calling for proposals, with a focus on separation and detection of contaminants, namely microplastics and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), from wastewater. Chen said separating useful resources and contaminants from wastewater helps create a circular water economy, in which water is circulated sustainably so that it isn’t wasted and contaminants are turned into feedstock for new products.
“We don’t have any new data on the plastics yet, but it’s in the pipeline for us to focus on,” he said. “We need to design approaches that can selectively attract or bind with PFAS and microplastics so that they can be preferentially taken out [of water].”
By selecting and removing contaminants, Chen said that water can continue to serve “practical uses,” such as for drinking. The goal is to develop technology to effectively remove contaminants from water while preserving beneficial minerals. The technology could have the potential to improve the health of the Great Lakes and other bodies of water around the world.
Chen said he hopes the program will impact the Great Lakes region “for many decades beyond the 10-year period.”
Developing policy recommendations is a primary goal of microplastics research, experts believe. Susanne Brander, an ecotoxicologist and associate professor at Oregon State University who is also working on the global plastics treaty as a scientist coalition steering committee member, said that her work encourages policy development to reduce plastic inputs from upstream sources, such as plastic production from single-use plastics, food and beverage waste and industrial practices that is carried into large bodies of water by rivers and stormwater runoff.
Brander said that methods like recycling and cleanup efforts aren’t enough to address the problem on a global scale, and producing less plastic is necessary to mitigate plastic pollution.
“All those things are good, but they are a drop in the bucket compared to having legislation,” Brander said. She encourages developing quantitative reduction targets for plastic production, banning the use of highly toxic plastic polymers that are most likely to fragment into microplastics and then get into the environment and mandating recycling rates.
“Those upstream measures are what we need for the Great Lakes and also for the planet in general,” she said.
Rochman echoed this, saying that she hopes to see progress made at the treaty negotiations regardless of U.S. involvement: “Maybe even if they’re going to sign a treaty and agree on anything in general, they probably should be open to the fact that the U.S. might not sign.”
The Geneva talks ended Aug. 14 without agreement on a treaty.
Beyond the treaty, Chen and others expressed confidence in the research currently being done in the Great Lakes region to inform that.
For example, Rochman co-chaired a joint commission workgroup on microplastics for the Great Lakes region of the International Joint Commission (IJC), a bi-national organization created by the governments of the U.S. and Canada that brings in experts who can advise governments on what to do about an issue.
While the IJC only makes policy recommendations, not decisions, Rochman, as co-chair, applied for microplastics to be listed as a chemical of mutual concern under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (GLWQA), which would require governments to quantify microplastics and use the framework every three years to measure the health of the Great Lakes. The workgroup released its final report in November 2024.
In addition to having microplastics be listed as a chemical of mutual concern, the group also recommended that they be listed as a toxic chemicals sub-indicator under the GLWQA. It also called for the implementation of a basin-wide monitoring program for microplastics to quantify sources and emissions and the establishment of measures to prevent the emissions of plastic pollution.
The next step would be to develop a workgroup of experts to determine the impact of microplastics on human health.
“It’s prime time for another work group to come in on human health and see if there’s now enough data to do a risk assessment,” Rochman said. She said the goal of her research is to “create the tools that we need to better monitor and quantify plastic pollution and risk to inform” frameworks that governments use to understand risk, urgency and action, as well as how microplastics “transform in the environment.”
One way microplastics transform is by breaking down into even smaller pieces, known as nanoplastics. According to Tasha Stoiber, a senior scientist at the Environmental Working Group (EWG), there is no standardized method to measure plastics below a specific size that often fall into the nanometer range. Having one would make it easier to inform policymaking decisions and to have certainty of where these plastics exist.
It would also make it easier to measure plastic in samples in laboratory settings.
“The much smaller particles might make up the bulk of the plastic that’s in your sample, so that has been the limiting factor,” Stoiber said. “What we’re going to need to move forward with this, to have that certainty, to pass policy, [is] reliable, reproducible methods to be able to look at plastics in that smaller range.”
On a policy level, even without a treaty, both Chen and Rochman are confident that state legislation can inspire action on a patchwork basis.
Specifically, Rochman cited California’s protocol for microplastics in drinking water. In 2018, the state passed a bill requiring the State Water Board to adopt a definition of microplastics in drinking water on or before July 1, 2020, and on or before July 1, 2021, to adopt a standard methodology to be used in the testing of drinking water for microplastics. In 2022, the water board approved the implementation of a four-year water testing plan.
And last year, Michigan lawmakers introduced legislation to create a statewide microplastics research and monitoring plan.
State legislation could involve, they said, methods like treating stormwater to prevent plastics from entering the environment, using trash traps and storm drains; or establishing total maximum daily loads for the amount of plastic that enters the Great Lakes.
“I think states can be leaders, and I think the way they should take leadership, especially in the Great Lakes region, is to start monitoring programs, to adopt the risk assessment framework,” Rochman said, “and you use that framework to inform policies that they can do so they can reduce their use of certain single use plastic items.”

(Photo by Mint Images/Getty Images)Three pharmaceutical groups have sued North Dakota in federal court over a new law that aims to stop pharmaceutical companies from limiting hospitals’ access to discount drugs.
The law, House Bill 1473, makes it a class B misdemeanor for manufacturers to adopt policies that “deny, restrict, prohibit, or otherwise interfere” with pharmacies’ ability to obtain and dispense medication on behalf of hospitals participating in a federal program for low-income Americans known as 340B.
The 340B program was created by Congress in 1992 to bring down health care costs for poor  communities. Under the program, drug companies offer discounted products to qualifying hospitals and other medical facilities. Drug manufacturers that are part of Medicaid must participate in 340B.
Some supporters of the 340B program feel federal law doesn’t go far enough to protect patients and hospitals’ access to discount drugs.
Lawmakers introduced House Bill 1473 earlier this year to address these perceived shortcomings. 
According to testimony on the bill, some drug manufacturers have adopted policies to limit how many pharmacies can participate in the program. Representatives of North Dakota hospitals say this has harmed their ability to get discounted drugs to their patients.
Drug manufacturers have sued the state over the law, arguing that it violates the U.S. Constitution and will harm their profits.
The first of the three lawsuits challenging House Bill 1473 was filed in April by drug manufacturer AbbVie — less than a week after Gov. Kelly Armstrong signed it into law. Another manufacturer, AstraZeneca, and an industry association, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, filed additional suits earlier this month.
Drug maker sues over new North Dakota pharmaceutical law

According to North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley, states that have passed similar laws are also facing lawsuits from drug companies.
“This was anticipated when the legislation passed,” said Wrigley, whose office is in charge of defending the law in court.
Many of the claims in the three lawsuits overlap.
All of the cases allege that the state law violates the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution by encroaching on federal regulations.
The pharmaceutical groups say that when Congress designed the 340B program, it intended for drug companies to be able to adopt the kinds of policies that House Bill 1473 outlaws. While 340B requires participating manufacturers to sell their medication at a discount, the companies can still require hospitals to abide by additional conditions to access those products, the plaintiffs claim.
The groups also argue that pharmacies and hospitals are the ones enriching themselves off the 340B program, not drug manufacturers. They say that many hospitals and pharmacies use 340B to purchase medication at a discount, only to turn around and sell it to patients at full price. 
AbbVie and Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America also allege that the law violates the constitution by attempting to regulate business in other states. Some North Dakota hospitals get drugs from out-of-state pharmacies, which in turn get their supply from out-of-state pharmaceutical companies. 
Additionally, the suits brought by AbbVie and AstraZeneca claim that House Bill 1473  violates the companies’ Fifth Amendment rights by forcing them to sell their property to a private party.
All three court cases are still in their early stages. 
The state has only filed an answer in the AbbVie lawsuit. In the filing, attorneys for North Dakota denied all of AbbVie’s claims that the law is unconstitutional.
The penalty for a class B misdemeanor is 30 days in jail, a maximum fine of $1,500, or both. The North Dakota Board of Pharmacy can also impose civil penalties on violators, according to testimony on the bill.
In legislative hearings, proponents of the bill said 340B is an essential program for many North Dakota communities. The program reduces costs for low-income patients and allows hospitals to provide a wider range of services, they said.
Rep. Jon Nelson, a Rugby Republican and the bill sponsor, in testimony on House Bill 1473 called 340B “a lifeblood” to rural hospitals.

The words “urgency” and “immediate action” were used by Trump administration officials on Aug. 15 in releasing the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation 24-month study for the Colorado River Basin.
The study sees a high probability of water levels of Lake Powell falling to within 48 feet of the minimum power pool by January. That elevation, 3,490 feet above sea level, is the reservoir’s lowest level at which hydroelectricity can be produced. That has not happened since soon after Powell began filling after completion of Glen Canyon Dam in 1966.
“This underscores the importance of immediate action to secure the future of the Colorado River,” said David Palumbo, acting commissioner for the agency.

Scott Cameron, the acting assistant secretary for water and science in the Department of Interior, had similar words of warning to the seven states that share use of the river.
“As the basin prepares for the transition to post-2026 operating guidelines, the urgency for the seven Colorado River Basin states to reach a consensus agreement has never been clearer,” said Cameron. “We cannot afford to delay.”
The announcement cited “unprecedented drought” but made no mention of climate change. This seems to be a theme.
Cameron, at the Getches-Wilkinson Center’s annual water seminar in Boulder during June, talked for 24 minutes without once mentioning climate change. He even answered a question about climate change without using the phrase. He did seem to acknowledge it, saying that in the “real world” there is less water than before, “and that is probably not going to change a whole bunch.”
Might the situation be even worse than what Bureau of Reclamation has projected will be most likely?
 A bias of optimism

On Aug. 14, a day before the bureau’s release of the 24-month study, John Fleck and others posted an analysis on Fleck’s Inkstain that warned the study would likely be overly optimistic.
The problem, explained Fleck and his co-authors, is that the “assumptions underlying the study do not fully capture the climate-change driven aridification of the Colorado River Basin.”
The bureau uses a 30-year average in predicting what lies ahead. However, using the hydrology of the Colorado River Basin since the 1990s no longer provides the same usefulness in predicting what lies ahead during the next 24 months. The climate is changing too fast.
Paul Milley, then of the U.S. Geologic Survey, and others from that and other institutions, noted this problem in a 2008 paper, “Stationarity is Dead: Whither Water Management?”
In that paper, Milley and his co-authors argued that human-induced climate changes were altering the means and extremes of precipitation, evapotranspiration, and the rates of runoff in rivers. As such, they contended, using the old models to guide water management no longer worked as well.
In their posting at Inkstain, Fleck and his coauthors noted that the Bureau of Reclamation’s 24-month study a year ago found that the “most probable” level for Powell would be 3,593 at the end of July 2025.
It was 38 feet lower than the projection. It had been another so-so or worse winter and then an early, warm spring.

This, they said, illustrated the bias toward optimism in the models used by the agency. That bias had been detailed in a 2022 study of past projections by a team led by Jian Wang of the Utah State Center for Colorado River Studies.
“Most probable” in the Bureau of Reclamation projections occupied a band of 80% likelihood. The bureau also issues maximum and minimum probable scenarios.
Fleck and his team contend that the bureau’s “minimum probable scenario has become the most valuable in providing a reliable indicator of the future” for Colorado River flows.
This past winter was mediocre, near average snowfall in some basins but among the worst in the San Juans. Spring was warm or more in many places, and rains in July were almost entirely absent.
The preliminary estimated inflow into Powell for April through July was 41% of the average from 1991 through 2020, according to the bureau’s most-probable study. During July, runoff slipped to 12% of that 30-year average.
Might fortunes soon be reversed? Not likely in months ahead, said Fleck and his team. They noted this summer’s weak monsoon for most of the upper basin coupled with the seasonal outlook by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Together, they point to a warmer and drier than average fall.
“It’s a good bet that this trend will continue at least through winter,” they wrote.
As it stands, levels in Lake Mead, downstream from Powell, will necessitate cuts in the lower-basin as required by several agreements reached between 2007 and 2019. Arizona is to see an 18% cut and Nevada a 7% cut in their annual apportionments. Mexico is to get 5% less than its annual allotment. In acre-feet, that’s 412,000 for Arizona, 21,000 for Nevada, and 80,000 for Mexico.
 A new agreement

The big story continues to be what agreements the seven basin states can achieve in recognition of the inadequacy of past agreements given reduced flows.
Drought as conventionally understood is part of the story, but only a part. A 2017 study by Jonathan Overpeck and Brad Udall concluded that between a third and a half of reduced flows in the Colorado from 2000 to 2014 could be attributed to the rising greenhouse gas emissions. They spoke about “megadrought,” a word now common in Colorado River discussions, as is “aridification.”
Human emissions driving Colorado River ‘megadrought,’ CU Boulder research finds

This year has brought more studies that strengthen the evidence. Included is a study published just last week in Nature, that identifies new ways that the warming climate has altered the hydrology of Colorado and other southwestern states.
In 2018, an agreement among the states was reached regarding how to deal with drought. It was universally recognized as an interim agreement, with a final agreement to be reached in advance of a 2026 deadline. That deadline is now close at hand.
That impending deadline was alluded to in the comments of the federal officials.
“Health of the Colorado River system and the livelihoods that depend on it are relying on our ability to collaborate effectively and craft forward-thinking solutions that prioritize conservation, efficiency, and resilience,” said Cameron, Interior’s undersecretary, in the Aug. 15 announcement.
In June, Cameron had called on the Colorado River Basin states to submit details of a preliminary operations agreement by mid-November and share a final seven-state proposal by mid-February 2026. The plan would be to reach a final decision in the summer of 2026 with implementation beginning in October 2026.
Non-governmental organizations issued statements also calling for the states to figure out a way forward.
“This is not just a crisis. It’s also a call to action to use remaining time wisely to replace our current, reactive, emergency-based management framework with new, long-term solutions,” said John Berggren, the regional policy manager for Western Resource Advocates. “We can’t litigate our way out — we must collaborate forward.”
For many months, all reports suggested that the four-upper basin states — who speak with one voice in these negotiations — and the three lower-basin states remained far apart. A story on June 27 in the Las Vegas Review Journal described the meetings as “tense” and “deadlocked.”










We can’t litigate our way out — we must collaborate forward.


– John Berggren of Western Resource Advocates


Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico along with Colorado constitute the upper basin. Arizona, Nevada and California make up the lower basin.
Becky Mitchell, Colorado’s representative in the negotiations, told a forum in Silverthorne covered by Big Pivots in May that hydrologic risk must be shared between the upper basin and the lower-basin states.
This sore spot has long festered. The Colorado River Compact of 1922 specified that the upper basin states “will not cause the flow of the river at Lee Ferry to be depleted” below an aggregate of 75 million acre-feet for any 10 consecutive years. The location is between Glen Canyon and the Grand Canyon.
But what if the river fails to deliver that much water? Upper basin states have delivered that volume so far, but that’s mostly because Wyoming, in particular, has not developed what was expected 100 yeas ago.
Those who had originally gathered in Santa Fe in 1922 to negotiate the compact had understood drought, but only as a temporary thing. They had no extensive long-term perspective — and chose to ignore what evidence was at hand, according to a 2019 book by Fleck and Kuhn, “Science be Dammed: How Ignoring Inconvenient Science Drained the Colorado River.”
Colorado’s beef, and that of other upper-basin states, has been that the two big dams on the river provided certainty for the lower-basin states to get water. However, the headwaters states have no certainty. They must live with what Mother Nature provides. They have balked at cutting water use to provide certainty for downstream states. They want the risk shared.

 Natural flow proposal

In June came the first public word of what may have been a breakthrough. It is called the “natural flow proposal.” As explained by Tom Buschatzke, the director of Arizona Water Resources, to the Arizona Republic in a story on June 18, the idea is to focus less on who gets what and more on what the river can realistically provide.
“We do have to recognize what the hydrologic risks are to us,” he said after presenting the idea to a committee,” and we have to kind of find an equitable way to share those risks.”
That idea being discussed would employ a rolling three-year average of the natural flow of the river. Natural would be defined as the volume if there were no diversions and impoundments.
Buschatzke — a frequent visitor at the Colorado River forum sponsored by the University of Colorado’s Getches-Wilkinson Center each June — pointed out that the goal would be to spread the pain equitably, not equally. The lower basin would need more water than the upper basin, which has still to develop all the water allocated it in the 1922 compact.
“It is not 50-50,” he told represents at the June 17 meeting. “I won’t try to speculate on what the number might be.”
A few weeks later, John Entsminger, Nevada’s representative in interstate talks, similarly was vague about details. “It’s not something where I can tell you what the score is in the third inning: the baseball game is still being played,” he told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Details remain sparse, he added.
“Everybody’s pretty much accepted that we’ve got to come up with a new formula for dividing the river,” Mark Squillace, an environmental law professor at the University of Colorado Boulder, told the Las Vegas newspaper. “The devil’s in the details about getting the numbers right.”
According to the best information that Big Pivots was able to obtain, there is still no agreement about what the percentage should be, although it is not 50-50.
Mitchell, Colorado’s representative on the Upper Colorado River Commission, and its acting chair, told the Review-Journal that the 2007 guidelines that provide the management map of the river’s operations “are not sustainable, because the water is just not there. It’s not in storage, and it’s not in the river.”
For a late-June story in Politico’s E&E, Mitchell  described the natural flows idea as a math problem. “The concept under discussion is that Powell would release a certain percentage of volume of the average of the last few years of natural flows, as measured at Lee Ferry,” she said.
E&E described a more complex challenge: “The theory — the premise of sharing the river based on how much water would travel downstream without dams or diversions or other human interventions — is actually a complex mathematical problem, rife with potential pitfalls and technical issues.”
This idea of basing releases from Lake Powell likely would take several years to implement. As such, it would not immediately impact levels in the reservoir.
As for the minimum power pool at Powell, that’s the level at which hydroelectricity can no longer be generated. Some 16 municipal and cooperative electrical utilities in Colorado get power from the dam. Those amounts tend to be smaller, about 5% or less, although important if the utilities are stretching to achieve decarbonization goals.
The greatest value of Glen Canyon is that if the Western grid has a blackout, the grid can be restarted with hydropower from the dam.
 The role of Congress

As administrator of the two big dams in the basin and several smaller ones, the federal government must figure out how to manage them consistently with the agreements among the states. It is also the formal administrator among the lower-basin states.
At the conference in Boulder, Cameron clearly said the federal government wants the states to figure out the solution. However, he also said that if the states cannot come to agreement, the federal government, as the administrator of the infrastructure, has authority to set policy, too.
And finally, he mentioned that the whole package may need to go to Congress, as was the case with the Colorado River Compact. It was approved in 1929.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)There’s no shortage of symptoms pointing to the declining health of American democracy these days, but the Texas-California (and beyond) congressional redistricting rhubarb has to rank as one of the most acute. Using a legislative majority to redraw maps off-schedule for the sole purpose of inflating and locking in partisan advantage that actual voter demographics and preferences would never support feels like precisely the opposite of functional representative government.
Nashvillians, of course, know this sort of thing intimately: we’ve been living nakedly partisan line-drawing first-hand ever since the state’s GOP majority in 2022 cracked Music City’s reliably blue 5th Congressional District into three solidly red seats. The result: essentially no voice in Congress for a top-25 (population) city that votes almost two to one for Democrats yet found itself represented by outer county chawbacons for whom Nashville is basically just an airport with nonstops to DC. And so as this chart shows Tennessee became the third most gerrymandered red state and sixth most overall. 
This makes for a sad and dispiriting political environment for Nashville’s Democrats — which is to say most of Nashville. But some semicomical schadenfreude does bubble up with California conservatives’ reactions to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s plan to do unto them as Tennessee Republicans have done unto us. 
The Los Angeles Times reports that residents in one of the red California districts to be redrawn “are angry” because the remapping “disregards the needs and wants of rural people.” One voter says of the plan to blend more urban parts of California into her rural district: “Their needs and their wants are completely different than what we need here.” Said another: “All the things we stand for are going down the drain.”
  The resignation of former U.S. Rep. Mark Green less than halfway through his term has opened a potential opportunity for Democrats in a gerrymandered district. (Photo: Nick Fantasia for Tennessee Lookout)
For Nashville Democrats that has a familiar ring! Now perhaps this is where I’m supposed to say two wrongs don’t make a right, and charitably adopt these soon-to-be-disenfranchised California Republicans as sympathetic comrades in gerrymandering victimhood. But you know what? No. Cry me a river. 
Sure, both parties are guilty of gerrymandering to excess — it’s a systemic defect in our system, one the Supreme Court not long ago had an excellent opportunity to remedy but declined. Yet even if gerrymandering is a bipartisan disease, right now there’s only one party in the role of superspreader, unabashedly doing out-of-cycle map-finagling with the express aim of curdling next year’s midterm election. 
 And that party would be your party, California GOP voters, so suck it up. You may lose your representation because Democrats are responding in kind, but the key word here is “responding.” I know it’s childish to point fingers and wail “you started it” but let’s face facts: you started it.
We can find some consolation in the fact that voters do generally frown on this sort of thing. New polling as the Texas-California ruckus unfolded this month found an overall majority of 55% agreeing that drawing districts to win seats “is bad for democracy,” 27% not sure, and only 18% saying all good no problemo (and only 27% of Republicans). The point being: we know this is bad business, and that “we” is bipartisan.
There is also solace in knowing that partisan redistricting sometimes backfires. Occasionally a gerrymander turns into what political scientists call a “dummymander” — the unintended consequence when partisan line drawing spreads a party’s voters so thinly that the district later becomes vulnerable to a subsequent flip. It can happen, though not often. Can it happen here?
In Middle Tennessee right now we have the unfolding spectacle of a special election to fill one of our gerrymandered seats, the mighty 7th, in the wake of Mark Green’s crass decision to skedaddle in pursuit of vague but no doubt lucrative opportunities to cash in on his “public service.” With a rare open congressional seat in play, the CD7 special election has drawn a bevy of hopefuls.
Field set for Tennessee 7th Congressional District special election

The four Democrats in the race are all vocal in their messaging that this is an unusual opportunity to turn a red seat blue. Realistically, their prospects for an upset that flips the seat are rooted more in the history of turnout math in special elections — typically lighter and bluer than usual — than in the fulfillment of a dummymander fantasy. The four are also trying to gin up discontent with the Big Beautiful Bill Congress passed at Trump’s behest, which could be a reach since although the bill is widely scorned nationally, it polls positively in Tennessee, including among independents. 
Meanwhile, the eleven count ‘em eleven Republicans vying in the special all likely assume that the gerrymander in CD7 is alive and well, and that most CD7 voters are okey dokey with what Republicans are up to in DC, so taking the GOP primary will stamp a ticket to Washington. They may harbor some crazy political beliefs but they are not crazy to make these electoral assumptions. 
Painful as it is for Democrats, the gerrymander has to be seen as an odds-on favorite to continue to prevail in CD7. But even in defeat substantial blue overperformance in the special will have wider implications in the runup to next year’s midterms. That will make CD7 fun to watch this fall if Democrats can successfully nationalize the race by drawing outside money and attention. 
As Green rides off into his financially embellished political sunset it’s worth recalling that when the Tennessee legislature in 2022 gerrymandered Nashville, Green called the map redraw “inherently unfair” because as he put it “I believe in representative democracy.” Yes, he actually said that. While it might be nice to imagine he harbored some genuine affection for democratic process, it’s not clear what Green believed in two years prior when he shamelessly voted to overturn the 2020 election.

John James (R-Shelby Twp.) speaks at an Oct. 2 campaign event with Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance in Auburn Hills. | Kyle DavidsonU.S. Rep. John James is facing mounting criticism for allegedly using government resources to promote a campaign event.
An ethics complaint filed against the Shelby Township Republican, who is running for governor, cites a MIRS report that James’ office sent an advisory from a U.S. House email address, with the Congressional seal displayed at the top, for a backpack giveaway being hosted at Jimmy John’s Field.
Photos from the event, however, show the backpacks surrounded by signs for his campaign for governor.
A social media post from Jimmy John’s Field is watermarked with James’ office logo while showing the James campaign signs hanging on the wall behind the backpacks.

MIRS reports they were told by Hannah Osantowske, who serves as both James’ office and campaign spokesperson, that it was an official event and they would “not legally be able to cover any political issues.”
The complaint was filed by Joel Rutherford, former chair of the Michigan Democratic Party’s 10th Congressional District. It says the event “violates the trust of Michigan taxpayers by using their hard-earned money not for the public good – but for the private benefit of the already-wealthy Congressman John James.”
John Truscott, a former aide to Republican Gov. John Engler, told MIRS that it was “just beyond stupidity.”
“They not only did it with the signs being there, but then his spokesperson is working for the official office and the campaign,” Truscott said. “You can’t do that either.”
“The one thing you don’t want to do in a campaign is have self-inflicted wounds,” Truscott continued. “I mean, they’ve basically taken a gun and pointed at their own head with this kind of thing.”
A request for comment was made by Michigan Advance to Osantowske, but has yet to be returned.
Michigan election attorney Mark Brewer, former chair of the Michigan Democratic Party, told the Democratic Governors Association that the violation was not complicated to understand.
“[James] was illegally and unethically using federal government resources for campaign purposes in support of his run for governor of Michigan. It’s as simple as that,” Brewer said.

[…]","Members of the National Guard patrol near Union Station on Aug. 14, 2025 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)Gov. Patrick Morrisey has deployed 300-400 members of West Virginia’s National Guard to Washington, D.C. to “to support the President’s initiative to restore cleanliness and safety” to the district.
Violent crime in the district is at a 30-year low. 
If the concern is really safety, then the National Guard should have stayed in West Virginia. Both Charleston and Huntington have higher violent crime rates than Washington, D.C. 
West Virginia’s two largest cities both have a crime rate of 1.5K per 100,000 people, compared to D.C.’s rate of 931.6, according to 2024 data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Or maybe the guardsmen could have just stayed at home, doing their jobs and being with their families. Because as someone who has lived in Charleston for 12 years, and visits Huntington often — I feel safe in both places. When visiting Washington, D.C., I’ve never felt in danger either.
The American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia filed a complaint last week over the deployment on behalf of the West Virginia Citizen Action Group, listing Morrisey and Maj. General James Seward, the Adjutant General for the West Virginia National Guard, as defendants. 
“This action challenges an unprecedented and unlawful deployment of West Virginia National Guard forces beyond our state’s borders — not to defend against invasion, not to respond to natural disaster, not to assist a sister state’s emergency request — but to serve as political props in a manufactured crisis,” the group says in the complaint. “West Virginia law is clear: The governor may deploy the National Guard outside our borders only for specific, enumerated purposes — none of which exist here.”
Morrisey’s office said that the National Guard was “mobilized at the request of the President under the authority in United States Code, Title 32 502(f).” 
Along with West Virginia, five other states — Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, Tennessee and South Carolina — have sent troops to the nation’s capital, with about 2,060 patrolling within the 68 square miles of the district. Jackson, Mississippi has the highest murder rate in the nation. 
West Virginia — the state with the smallest population of those six — has sent the most troops. The other states sent 150-200 compared to the 300-400 Morrisey said he would send.
Remember in 2023 when former Gov. Jim Justice sent our National Guard to Texas to help Gov. Greg Abbott’s Operation Lone Star initiative?
For one month, 53 members of the West Virginia National Guard were deployed to Texas, costing the state more than $900,000. The governor’s office was sparse in details about what troops actually did during that time.
Reporting from other states shows that troops often didn’t have much to do, and were assigned busy work, like shoveling horse manure and filing paperwork.
So far, according to the Associated Press, the troops in D.C. don’t really seem to be busy — they’ve been doing some crowd control at national monuments and protecting landmarks like the National Mall and Union Station. 
And, well, they’re just being helpful and nice.
“Some troops have fed squirrels,” reported the AP. “One Guard member helped a woman carry her belongings down the stairs in a train station. Others have been seen taking photos with passers-by, standing around chatting and drinking coffee. There have been no overt indications that they have faced threats that would require weapons.”
On Friday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered National Guard troops to start carrying firearms while patrolling.
Most National Guard members don’t have the right training for this sort of deployment and are being put in a “no-win situation,” Alex Wagner, a former chief of staff to the Army secretary, told the AP. He said asking them to be armed is a “recipe for disaster.”
Troops don’t get the same “extensive training and the nuances that, for example, the police get,” for domestic disturbances and don’t know how to respond to it on a wide scale, Mark Cancian, a retired Marine Corps colonel and a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told NPR.
Trump has suggested that after this, he may send troops to other cities, like Chicago and New York City and San Francisco — all Democratic-led cities.
“After we do this, we’ll go to another location, and we’ll make it safe also,” Trump has said.
There’s no end date to this current deployment. And with Morrisey’s history, he’ll likely send West Virginia’s National Guard to wherever Trump wants them to go next. 
Every time Trump says jump, Morrisey asks how high, and tries to go the highest. It’s time for him to start jumping for West Virginians instead.

It is a joint venture between Ford Motor Co. and South Korea-based company SK On. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)A nine-month campaign to unionize a massive electric vehicle battery plant in Hardin County will culminate in a vote by more than 1,400 hourly workers this week. 
The United Auto Workers (UAW) launched its campaign last November to unionize the BlueOval SK battery manufacturing complex, a joint venture between Ford Motor Co. and South Korea-based company SK On. The $5 billion complex in Glendale has been described by state officials as the “single-largest economic development investment in state history” that would employ 5,000 people when a second planned plant becomes operational. The company began production at the plant last week.
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) will oversee the union election starting Tuesday and begin counting the vote Wednesday evening. The lead-up to the election has been contentious between the UAW and BlueOval SK. 
The union, representing 391,000 active members including workers at Ford’s auto manufacturing plants in Louisville, last month called on the NLRB to investigate what it argued were  violations of federal labor law by BlueOval SK for allegedly employing a “scorched-earth anti-union campaign designed to scare workers and chill support.” The UAW referenced a Louisville Courier-Journal report that found workers have raised concerns about mold exposure, injuries including broken bones and run-ins with bats. 
A BlueOval SK spokesperson has denied assertions from workers of unsafe conditions. A BlueOval SK spokesperson also told the News-Enterprise in Hardin County the UAW’s call for an investigation last month was a “dishonest tactic” to stall “a timely and fair election.”
Tyler Connor, a production operator at BlueOval SK, wrote in a commentary provided to the Lantern through a UAW spokesperson, that he quickly decided to support a union because of negative experiences he had ranging from a lack of training for his job, constant policy changes that made personal life planning difficult and other concerns about workplace safety. 
He wrote that a fire alarm went off one day, but he failed to hear it because of noise from a nearby air hose leak. A coworker walked by and let Connor know people were evacuating.
“If that had been a real emergency, I could have been trapped. That’s not just poor communication — it’s dangerous,” Connor wrote. “I want my voice heard, promises kept and a safer work environment. I want the peace of mind that comes with a union contract and a seat at the table to negotiate over our working conditions.” 
If battery workers at the BlueOval SK plant choose to unionize, it would mark another victory for the UAW after unionizing other electric vehicle battery plants including most recently in Indiana. The UAW’s efforts are a part of its larger push to unionize electric vehicle battery plants across the country, but the union has had challenges with organizing in the South.
Mallory Cooke, a spokesperson for BlueOval SK, in an emailed statement to the Lantern said the company “has not, and will not, violate any labor laws.” The company has launched its own website making the case to workers against unionization, arguing a union could take away workers’ pay and autonomy. 
“Mutual respect is a critical part of our culture,” Cooke said. “BlueOval SK looks forward to our team having their voices heard. Our team members have endured months of union sales tactics and slanders against their exciting jobs and proud accomplishments. They are ready for their voices to be heard.”

Cottages of Idlewild will feature 14 ownership units and four rental apartments, for individuals and families earning 30% to 80% of area median income. The purchase price of the homes will be around $145,000. The median price of a home in the Triangle was $434,000 in July, according to The News & Observer. The project has 16-month construction schedule.

Moton, the men’s basketball coach at N.C. Central University, grew up on the street which was once a high crime, high poverty area. It is now giving way to gentrification, which has driven up housing costs.
Moton’s late grandmother lived on the Cottages of Idlewild site, raising him, he said, with love, wisdom and a firm hand. The park and basketball court just across the street is named in Moton’s honor.
Cottages of Idlewild is Moton’s way of repaying his grandmother and the community that helped raise him. The project’s name honors Idlewild, one of Raleigh’s earliest African American neighborhoods that became a “middle-class enclave of Black homeownership.”
“This is personal for me, this ain’t business,” Moton said in an interview. “I grew up right here. This is the [basketball] court that raised me. To come back for a community, take care of kids so kids can come back and take care of the community, that’s what it’s all about.”
Speaking to dozens of community members, business partners, members of faith communities and others that contributed in ways big and small, Moton said the folks in Idlewild had things money couldn’t buy such as morals, values, principles and a code of ethics.
“It was an incredible place to live and then in the mid-80s, something changed,” Moton said. “I was a kid and I literally was on this court watching how crack [cocaine] decimated our communities. It seemed like everyone began selling that drug to take care of their families or using it to deal with the fact they couldn’t.”
Moton and friends got the idea for Raleigh Raised Development after hearing that it cost nearly $400,000 to buy a modest home in Raleigh.
“I immediately thought about the people still in this community, even though I made it out,” Moton said. “There were people here that supported me, and they bought me fish plates and fed me when I was hungry and kept me when my mother wasn’t present. And so, just because I made it out, I couldn’t forget about their challenges and struggle.”
He noted that six people from his community went to college over a span of 45 years. Five were athletes and the one who was not became an attorney, he said.
“I hope they [children who currently live in the community] can look and see that they don’t have to dribble a basketball to get out of here, they don’t have to run a football or they don’t have to rap,” Moton said. “They can become developers.”
He leaned in on the growing workforce housing crisis that is bedeviling communities across the country.
“What good is the community, if the policemen, the firemen, the EMS workers, the cafeteria workers, the bus drivers — what good is the community if the can’t afford to live there?” Moton asked. “Through this project, we’ve created a unique public and private partnership that could hopefully become a blueprint to all of those in Raleigh.”

Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell said the city welcomes more affordable units. Nearly 30% of Wake County households spend 30% or more of their income on housing, according to the N.C. Housing Coalition.
Cowell said there must be more efficiency in creating affordable units, noting that it took dozens of partners coming together over a long stretch to get Cottages of Idlewild off the ground.
“I respect this is a blueprint and maybe now we can roll faster now that we’ve done one, but for me it’s the challenge of saying how do we do this more efficiently for more units,” Cowell told NC Newsline.
Cottages of Idlewild is being developed based on the Community Land Trust Model. Under that model, buyers purchase the home only and lease the land at a nominal rate for a minimum of 99 years. That ensures the property remains affordable. Meanwhile, property taxes are only assessed on the value of the home, which means that tax bills are lower than market-rate homes. Resale prices of homes are restricted to ensure they remain affordable to future generations, which creates opportunities for individuals and families to develop equity and generational wealth.
Kevin Campbell, executive director of the Raleigh Area Land Trust, said Raleigh is short about about 50,000 affordable housing units.
“Eighteen [units] is a big project but nothing compared to the need,” Campbell said. “That’s why this permanent affordability is so important because now we don’t just need the units because people are moving here, we need them because we’re losing them [people] also.”

Scott Farmer, executive director of the NC Housing Finance Agency, noted that a recent study commissioned by the, NC Chamber Foundation in partnership with the North Carolina Home Builders Association and NC REALTORS® found that the state has a significant housing crisis and needs 760,000 new housing units over the next five years to meet demand across its 100 counties.
“So, getting 18 today is a great step in that direction, but we have to do this on the scale and we need the resources and we need the commitments of other cities and counties like Raleigh and Wake County have done here to help further that goal.” Farmer said.
Several speakers noted that building affordable housing is difficult work. Farmer said that’s due to the difficulty of finding land on which to build such projects and rising construction and material costs.
“There’s no industry like housing where time literally is money,” Farmer said. “The longer it takes things to happen, the more expensive it gets over time.”

As part of the groundbreaking, Moton announced that sections of Cottages of Idlewild will be named in honor of people who contributed to his success and the well being of the community. It includes his grandmother and other community leaders.
One of them being honored is community activist Johnny Blaylock who lives next to LeVelle Moton Park.
Blaylock said he is proud of Moton and Raleigh Raised Development for creating an opportunity for current Idlewild residents to be a part of the growth the community is experiencing. The Cottages of Idlewild will provide that opportunity, Blaylock said.
“Although gentrification is going to happen, you can’t get in front of that train that’s coming — you know, that big money train,” Blaylock said. “What you can do, is get on board and be a part of that. So, I’m glad these young men saw that opportunity.”

Several laws came out of the 2025 legislative session aimed at improving child wellbeing, from teaching children about sexual extortion to banning cell phones during instructional time. 
Child advocates feel hopeful over the changes, though some pointed out room for improvement in one new law limiting electronic communications between teachers and students in public schools to traceable forms such as school emails or school-approved apps. The law does not apply to private schools. Parents can sign a consent allowing a specific school employee to communicate with their child.
The intent was to combat the sexual grooming of students by adults, Sen. Lindsey Tichenor, R-Smithfield, who sponsored the law, said in a recent release by the Kentucky Senate.

Tichenor said the state Educational Professional Standards Board, which certifies and disciplines educators in Kentucky, asked her to sponsor the measure. It received unanimous approval from the legislature.
“Anytime we can get another law on the books that helps us combat all the situations that are presenting themselves out there, kids are going to be better off,” said Jill Seyfred, the executive director of Prevent Child Abuse Kentucky.  
Here are some key educational policy changes in effect this year.  
No cell phones during class 
The Kentucky General Assembly passed House Bill 208 this year, which directs local school boards to create policies banning students’ use of cell phones during class time, with some exceptions. 
Terry Brooks, the executive director of Kentucky Youth Advocates and a former educator, said this law has the potential to help students in several ways, from improving mental health to getting kids more engaged in learning. 
In 2024, 67% of Kentucky’s fourth graders weren’t proficient in reading. That’s up from 65% in 2019. That same year, most — 76% — of eighth graders in the state weren’t proficient in math, up from 71% in 2019, the Lantern previously reported. 
This law’s implementation varies by school — some have banned cell phones all day, others have allowed them during lunch, for example. 
“While we knew that there was a lot of inappropriate communication going on during school, we may not have realized the level or depth of toxicity,” Brooks said.  
In 2023, the United States surgeon general said social media use among youth can have both positive and negative effects. For example, youth may be able to find community and connection through social media that they otherwise lacked. But their mental health can decline with that use, and they can have increased anxiety and depression. 
  Terry Brooks, the executive director of Kentucky Youth Advocates.
“You know that every adolescent thought that the world would end as we knew it, and they survived, and maybe they’re even thriving,” Brooks said of HB 208’s cell phone limits. “They may not be able to admit it, because that’s probably not cool, but I think it’s almost given them a sense of freedom and protection during the school day.” 
Jim Flynn, the executive director of the Kentucky Association of School Superintendents, said that schools are already seeing students opt out of using phones during down time when they’re permitted, choosing instead to talk to one another. 
“The results will be more clear as we do this longer,” he said. Some schools have already seen “fewer fights and fewer conflicts and disruptions that oftentimes are fueled by their phones and social media apps and that sort of thing.”  
In some cases, kids turn in “burner” phones and keep their cell phones. 
“But, if they’re keeping it out of sight and not using it, then that’s really the desired outcome, right?” Flynn said. “They can focus and not be distracted by the phone.”  
Teacher and student communication 
Senate Bill 181 mandates that all electronic communication by employees and volunteers at public schools with students be limited to traceable systems. Its aim is to combat sexual grooming and cut out inappropriate communication between adults and children. 
Brooks with Kentucky Youth Advocates called this law the “make a lot of noise bill.” More than 13,000 have signed a petition asking for enforcement of the law to be paused. 
In August, Gov. Andy Beshear, who signed SB 181 into law, said he is “taking their concerns seriously, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported.
The petition says that SB 181 “infringes upon fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed to all Kentuckians,” including “the right to communicate digitally with friends, family and social networks outside of work,” “the ability to seek and maintain secondary employment or supplemental income beyond school hours,” and “the freedom to engage with civic, cultural, religious or political groups not affiliated with their roles as educators or school staff.” 
The petition’s creator did not respond to an email from the Lantern about the concerns. 
“I’m very bifurcated in the sense that I do not want to hear that ‘this is a hassle, and therefore we shouldn’t do it,’” Brooks said. “I don’t want pragmatics to override the principle involved.” 
Still, there are some “common sense concerns” out there, Brooks said, and he fully expects to see a 2.0 version of the law in 2026 “that adjusts at the margins of this legislation without diluting or abrogating the important intent at play.” 
“Adult convenience should never take precedence over the well-being of kids,” Brooks said. “And there is more than a little of that notion driving much of the discussion. Yes, this bill does disrupt the pattern and habits of many. Yes, new processes always carry hassles and hiccups. But let’s not lose sight of the seminal issue here — the safety of young people.” 
Flynn’s organization, the Kentucky Association of School Superintendents, supports the intent of SB 181 but has raised some concerns about unintended consequences of the law as it’s written. For example, the organization is worried that in restricting communication between students and school employees, the state is hindering the ability of children to have mentorships with trusted adults. 
“That’s one of our chief concerns — is that, unintentionally, we’re going to make it harder for those kinds of relationships that are so critical and so important, while in essence, bad actors might just find other avenues,” Flynn said. While “we want to make it harder for the bad actors” to harm children, he said, it’s important not to “stifle” positive relationships and mentorships. 
The Kentucky Association of School Superintendents is also concerned that the law doesn’t take into account jobs or volunteer work outside the school system that might lead students and teachers to interact — babysitting, youth groups and more. Additionally, the cost of purchasing safe communication technology can detract from other needs in schools. 
The organization is asking Tichenor to make reforms in the 2026 session.

Additionally, Flynn said, the General Assembly should find a way to pay for the cost of safe communication technology, so it doesn’t remain an “unfunded mandate.” 
Tichenor said in a statement shared with the Lantern that “I have a working draft and have been in conversation with stakeholders taking their suggestions and input into needed changes. I am hopeful time will allow for a presentation of the changes in one of the upcoming ed interim committees.”
In an opinion piece shared online by Senate Republicans, Tichenor said that she is “committed to refining the language while ensuring the law protects students and upholds the integrity of Kentucky’s education system.” 
“Clarification may be needed in several areas, including which family members are exempt (such as stepparents, in-laws, and cousins), the definition of ‘school volunteer,’ and guidance on using platforms in group settings, such as texting or social media,” Tichenor’s op-ed says. “Questions have also been raised about how districts should honor parent-written consent for outside communication.” 
The Kentucky Education Association issued guidance for its members that included recommendations to never download school-designated apps on personal cell phones and “do not worry about hypothetical situations but do contact KEA if you have a real-life conflict with the new law before you act.”  
Meanwhile, several colleges and university spokespeople said they don’t believe this new law applies to dual credit instructors employed by higher education institutions. Dual credit allows high school students to earn a college credit alongside their secondary education.

Blair Hess, the vice president of marketing and communications for the Kentucky Community & Technical College System, told the Lantern that “since SB 181 is a secondary education bill, not a post-secondary education bill, it does not affect KCTCS employees teaching dual credit classes, only secondary education employees teaching dual credit.” 
KCTCS has worked with school districts “to make sure platforms we need for dual credit are approved in accordance with SB 181 if a secondary teacher is the instructor for the course administered by KCTCS,” Hess said. 
The University of Louisville, too, said the law “only applies to school district employees.”

“High school teachers who teach a UofL dual credit course must use the district’s communication system,” spokesman John Karman said. “However, a UofL instructor who teaches a dual credit course does not need to use the communication system, and students can communicate with the instructor using standard UofL methods. Since the requirement attaches to the personnel teaching a course, and not the location of instruction, it doesn’t matter if a UofL instructor teaches a course at a high school; that instructor is exempt from the bill’s requirements.”  
Kristi Willett, a University of Kentucky spokesperson, said employees who “also are employed or volunteering by providing programs and education in K-12 schools are required to cooperate with a school district’s specific requirements under SB 181.” 
“The University of Kentucky is committed to complying with the new law and to the protection and safeguarding of all students,” Willett said. 
Sextortion education

Report sexual extortion to the FBI at 1-800-335-5324 or call the Human Trafficking help hotline at 1-888-373-7888.

During the 2025 legislative session, Kentucky made sextortion a felony and required schools to teach children in an age-appropriate way about the practice. Sexual extortion is when a perpetrator obtains a sexually explicit photo and threatens to release it if the victim doesn’t meet their demands, which could be monetary, sexual or other kinds of blackmail. 
Brooks said “it is clearly too early to give a ‘grade’ to the sextortion awareness initiative” since this school year is just beginning “but it is not too early to affirm its importance.”
 “I know that schools feel as if they have a lot of mandates on their plate,” Brooks said. “I do not disagree. But I also would respectfully assert that this is the kind of support for kids that schools are uniquely positioned to deliver — and deliver they must.” 
Prevent Child Abuse Kentucky created materials for use in educating students about sextortion, including a poster, videos made in partnership with the Kentucky State Police,  materials for parents and a coloring book for young children using state police K-9 officers as storytellers to appeal to young children. Schools can either print that coloring book or order it for free.

Emmaline Hoskins, the media relations and digital assets coordinator for Prevent Child Abuse Kentucky, said the materials can help schools not have to “reinvent the wheel.” 
“Teachers already have enough on their plate as is, so I wanted to make something that was quick, ready to use and accessible, but at the same time, I did want the resources to really connect with students, whether they’re in kindergarten or high school,” Hoskins said. “I want prevention to feel approachable and relevant to the students and the teachers.” 
It’s unclear how many schools are using Prevent Child Abuse Kentucky’s education materials, which are online and were designed to abide by the law’s requirements.
“We want to make sure that teachers know that they are not carrying that burden alone,” Seyfred said. “We hope that teachers are aware of (our resources).” 
Coaches get ‘game ready’ to combat child abuse
Senate Bill 120 offers a “quiet but important step of progress” for kids, Brooks said. This law requires that coaches and administrators be informed during training sessions that they have a duty to report instances of child neglect or abuse. 
“It recognizes the importance of coaches specifically in combating child abuse,” Brooks said. “And while coaches who are full time teachers no doubt receive critical training already, the formalized training required in this bill is especially important as schools increasingly turn to volunteers, paraprofessionals and part time employees to staff athletic programs. Every coach regardless of their employment status needs to be ‘game ready’ to spot abuse around their student athletes.”

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)At least a dozen offshore millwrights assigned to Wind Scylla were stranded at sea Monday, three days after the Trump administration ordered an immediate stop on Rhode Island’s first large-scale offshore wind project.
They are just some of an estimated 1,000 unionized workers whose jobs remained in limbo as Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee, congressional delegates, labor leaders and union workers gathered at Revolution Wind’s regional logistics hub at Quonset Point in North Kingstown, Rhode Island, to demand the federal government reverse the abrupt stop work order. Under development for over seven years, the multibillion-dollar offshore wind farm is 80% complete, with 506 of the total 704 megawatt system installed.
“Stopping now — that’s like running a marathon and sitting down the moment you see the finish line ahead of you,” McKee told the crowd of reporters and advocates. “It makes no sense.”
“Our jobs, our energy, and our families will all be negatively impacted if this stoppage does not end — and it should end now,” McKee added.
Wind Scylla, an offshore wind farm installation vessel that can accommodate 130 people on board, is one of a number of vessels involved in the plan to install 65 turbines off Block Island’s coastline. Forty of the turbines have already been installed.
Roughly 12 millwrights are on board Wind Scylla on a four-week rotation to finish building one of the wind turbines, the union’s president told Rhode Island Current
Andy Benedetto, president of Millwrights Local 1121 said in a phone interview that one of his union stewards alerted him of the stoppage at 6 a.m. Saturday frantically asking what the next steps were.
“Nobody really knows what to do,” Benedetto said. “This is kind of a historic decision.”
More than jobs are at stake. Revolution Wind was on track to be operational in the second half of 2026, powering more than 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut, according to a statement Friday by Ørsted, the project’s Danish co-development company.
Delays could increase risks to the region’s grid reliability, according to a statement issued Monday by energy grid operator ISO New England.
“As demand for electricity grows, New England must maintain and add to its energy infrastructure,” the nonprofit organization responsible for overseeing New England’s energy grid wrote.
ISO New England said recent heat waves have pushed electricity demand in New England to high levels, showing that the region needs all available power sources to meet demand and maintain reserves.
Another goal of Revolution Wind is to stabilize electricity prices. A recently released report commissioned by RENEW Northeast found that if Revolution Wind had been operational this past winter, New England consumers could have saved a combined $400 million in energy costs.

‘The president’s insecurity’
In issuing the work stoppage, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) said it was “seeking to address concerns related to the protection of national security interests.”
But U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, doesn’t buy the administration’s argument. The Rhode Island Democrat told reporters that the U.S. Department of Defense had already approved the project last year, under former President Joe Biden.
“It’s not about national security, it’s about the president’s insecurity,” Reed said. “Do you know what is a threat to our national security? Oil that is controlled by OPEC and foreign countries that have animosity toward us.”
McKee, who wore a turbine pin on his lapel, called the work stoppage an “attack on Rhode Islanders” that could undercut the state’s plans to bring down energy costs through cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels.










Nobody really knows what to do. This is kind of a historic decision.


– Andy Benedetto, president of Millwright Local 1121


“Rhode Island doesn’t have oil wells, it doesn’t have easy access to natural gas,” he said. “We’re the Ocean State and we want to make sure we use the full benefit that the ocean brings us.”
Rhode Island AFL-CIO President Patrick Crowley said the Trump administration’s decision threatens not only the state’s energy needs but also an industry that was born in the Ocean State.
“These are six-figure jobs with overtime,” he told reporters. “These are highly-skilled tradespeople.”
Tony Vaz, a union carpenter who has already done two stints to install cables for Revolution Wind in 2024, was gearing up for another six-week offshore shift as a rope access technician starting Thursday. Vaz, an East Providence resident, underwent training to work on offshore wind farms as a rope access technician in 2009.
“My bags were ready to go, now it’s uncertain,” he told reporters Monday.
In April, the Trump administration stopped work on Empire Wind, New York’s offshore wind project. But officials reversed course in May after Gov. Kathy Hochul struck a deal with the administration to allow a new natural gas pipeline to be built in her state.
Asked if the state could strike a similar deal for Revolution Wind, McKee was noncommittal, saying he’s still unsure what exactly the Trump administration is seeking.
“We have no sense of what the ask is, and that’s what is troubling, right?” McKee said.
McKee told reporters he intends to connect with U.S. Secretary of Interior Doug Burgum within the next 24 hours to get a better understanding of the work stoppage. Alyse Sharpe, an Interior spokesperson, declined to confirm when the meeting will be held.
“Out of respect for the significance and oftentimes confidentiality of these discussions, the Department does not have a statement to offer on private meetings,” Sharpe wrote in an email to Rhode Island Current.
U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-RI, called the move a “deliberate blow” to Rhode Island to help Big Oil maintain its hold over the region’s energy grid.
“We’re just in the way of this president wanting to serve his fossil fuel donors,” Whitehouse said. “This is not on the merits, this is not legitimate.”
But not everyone is upset by the stop work order issued by the Trump administration.
A press conference is scheduled for 10 a.m Tuesday in Galilee, where the Newport law firm of Desautel Browning Law and Rhode Island fisheries advocates plan to support The decision to halt Revolution Wind, saying they believe the wind farm “poses unacceptable risks to coastal communities.”
Later in the day, Climate Action Rhode Island’s Yes to Wind campaign holds a 5:30 p.m. protest at Queen Anne Square in Newport to oppose the Trump administration’s stop work order for the offshore wind project.
Vaz said he’s hopeful a solution will be reached soon in order to get back to work.
“That’s how we are going to build America,” he said.

Building a new natural gas pipeline from Pennsylvania to New York would not make electricity in New England more affordable or reliable, experts say, despite the Trump administration’s push to revive a project that stalled out years ago.


Environmental advocates object to the construction of more gas infrastructure at a time when much of New England is trying to wean itself off fossil fuels, but there are economic concerns as well. Industry insiders say the proposed Constitution pipeline would do little to get more gas to New England power plants and could raise costs for both generators and consumers.


“There certainly is an increasing demand for energy, particularly electricity,” said Jeremy McDiarmid, managing director and general counsel for national industry group Advanced Energy United. ​“But the narrative that natural gas is going to somehow create a big downward pressure on electricity and energy bills is just not proven out in the data.”


U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin breathed new life into that narrative in a Boston Globe op-ed published this month. The piece advocates for the approval of the Constitution pipeline, a proposed 125-mile project that would transport gas from the fracking fields of Pennsylvania into New York, on the grounds that it would save New Englanders money.


It’s the latest in the EPA’s shift away from its historical mission of safeguarding environmental and public health and toward slashing regulations with the goal of ​“unleashing American energy” and lowering costs for residents. Since President Donald Trump took office, the agency has announced plans to end the $7 billion Solar for All program that funds solar projects for low-income households, eliminate the Energy Star label for energy-efficient appliances, and strip itself of authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.


The Constitution pipeline is not a new project. Federal regulators initially approved it in 2014, but New York rejected the project’s water-quality certification in 2016. Legal battles ensued, and in 2020, energy development company Williams dropped the proposal.


Then, in May, the Trump administration lifted its stop-work order on a major offshore wind project under construction off Long Island’s coast, claiming the move was part of a deal in which New York’s Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul agreed to reverse the state’s long-standing opposition to natural gas pipelines. Days later, Williams declared it would resurrect plans for two pipelines: Constitution and the Northeast Supply Enhancement project, a shorter line that would mostly run underwater off New Jersey and New York.


In his Boston Globe piece, Zeldin traces New England’s soaring electricity prices — the highest of any region in the continental U.S. — back to an inadequate supply of natural gas to the area’s power plants. The Constitution pipeline would transport more gas into New York, where it could be exported to its neighbors to the East. More gas would mean more reliable power generation and lower electricity prices, Zeldin contends.


It has the ring of a plausible argument. New England’s power producers are heavily dependent on natural gas — 55% of the region’s electricity came from gas-fired plants in 2024 — and leadership at regional grid operator ISO New England has pointed to lack of gas supply as a concern for reliability as demand on the system grows. At the same time, the Trump administration’s hostility to offshore wind has slowed or sidelined several developments that states like Connecticut, Maine, and Massachusetts were counting on to boost power supplies in coming years.


“While there are a tremendous amount of ambitions around large-scale renewable energy, we have really struggled to make that operable,” said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association, a trade group that represents the region’s electricity producers.
Piping more gas up from Pennsylvania’s ample supplies could seem like an economically sensible way to bolster the grid in light of these facts. The reality is far more complicated, however, say advocates and experts.












The major problem is that the pipeline wouldn’t actually bring much, if any, new gas into New England, Dolan said. The Constitution pipeline would terminate in Schoharie County, New York, where it would connect to pipes that already carry gas into New England. That existing infrastructure is the true bottleneck, he said.


The pipes into and around New England are ​“narrow and limited,” so bringing a higher volume of gas into New York doesn’t mean more can flow throughout the neighboring region. There are no plans in the works to alleviate those constraints, and the models for funding such projects make it highly unlikely there will be any proposals for pipelines into or within New England in the near future, Dolan said.


“I am not aware of any large-scale gas supply projects into New England today,” he said. ​“Until there is a way to increase that, I struggle to see how Constitution changes anything meaningful for us.”


Furthermore, multiple New England states are enacting plans to transition away from natural gas for home heating and appliances. In late 2023, Massachusetts regulators laid out plans for transitioning gas utilities toward clean energy, with the explicit goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. In May 2025, Maine opened an investigation into the future of its gas utilities. These efforts could reduce demand for natural gas for heating, freeing up some supply for power plants, Dolan said.


Even if new pipelines increased New England’s gas supply, that influx of fuel would be unlikely to consistently lower prices in the long term, experts said. Despite the appealing logic that more supply leads to lower costs, natural gas prices are inherently volatile and susceptible to influence by global events. In 2022, for example, the wholesale price more than tripled from its 2020 level, hitting $6.45 per million British thermal units, after Russia invaded Ukraine. Last year, the average price was $2.20; next year it is forecast to hit $4.30, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.


“The region is already over-reliant on natural gas,” said Sarah Krame, staff attorney with the Sierra Club’s environmental law program. ​“That is why we have seen volatile and skyrocketing gas and electricity bills in recent years.”


A better solution to both price and reliability worries, said advocates, would be to build a system that simply requires less gas.


That would mean relying on a diverse portfolio of options that includes solar, offshore wind, battery storage, energy efficiency, and demand-response programs. Such resources could be coordinated to create virtual power plants — a collection of geographically distributed resources that can work together to supply power to the grid and reduce demand. Not only do these networks emit less greenhouse gases than fossil-fueled plants, but their components can be built more quickly and cheaply, McDiarmid said.


This approach already had a chance to prove itself this summer, when solar and storage worked together to lower peak demand during a heat wave that saw temperatures hit 100 degrees Fahrenheit around the region, noted Amy Boyd Rabin, vice president of policy and regulatory affairs at the Environmental League of Massachusetts.


“To me that’s a sign that we need more renewables, not that we need to double down on fossil fuels,” she said.

An older adult playing games with their grandchild. A young woman diving into the surf with friends. A family enjoying a happy holiday meal together.
And then come the swiftly spoken warnings. “This medication may cause serious side effects, including internal bleeding; diarrhea; kidney problems; shortness of breath; fever; rash; dizziness; confusion; numbness of the arms or legs; double vision; sensitivity to light; changes in eyesight; persistent or severe muscle pain or weakness; muscle cramps; low red blood cells; bruising, memory loss and suicidal thoughts. Call your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms.”
For those of us lucky enough not to be plagued by a debilitating or life-threatening illness, the warnings that accompany these ads for newly developed pharmaceuticals can seem absurd — especially when they’re followed immediately by a cheerful announcer urging viewers to ask their doctor if the medication is right for them.
And yet, the hard truth is that many of these drugs are quite miraculous. Yes, the side effects can sometimes be dreadful, but as millions of cancer patients who have endured the havoc inflicted on their bodies by various forms of chemotherapy can attest, they are very often worth it when the choice is between life (and maybe a cure) and early death.
This simple fact of modern medicine must come to mind in the summer of 2025 as the United States finds itself staring face-to-face with an illness of a different kind — a political illness that poses the most obvious and serious threat to American representative government since the Civil War – the rise of authoritarianism.
In the early days of the first Trump administration, talk of the demise of democratic government and the rise of authoritarian dictatorship often seemed unduly alarmist. Today, however, as the Trump team deploys more and more police state tools and tactics and hundreds of once honorable politicians fall in lock/goose-step with what increasingly resembles a slow-motion putsch, the situation has reached a crisis level.
Nowhere is this situation more obvious than in the battle over another chronic malady that has long plagued the republic and that now — thanks to Trump and his minions — threatens to send it into a death spiral.
That plague, of course, is gerrymandering — the drawing of electoral maps to rig elections.
Gerrymandering is nothing new. The term was coined nearly two centuries ago. But with the advent of modern digital technology and the U.S. Supreme Court’s scandalous pronouncement a few years’ back that it is perfectly constitutional, gerrymandering has been transformed from an irritating illness into a metastasizing cancer that threatens to consume our democracy.
Right now, Trump loyalists control the U.S. House of Representatives by a tiny margin for one obvious reason: the partisan gerrymandering enacted by the North Carolina General Assembly that transformed the state’s U.S. House delegation from a 7-7 partisan split to 10-4 in favor of Republicans. Had the state merely continued to operate under the fair maps that led to that 7-7 split in the 2022 election, it’s likely that Democrat Hakeem Jeffries rather than Republican Mike Johnson would be the current Speaker of the U.S. House.
Even with this situation, however, most public opinion polls indicate that a significant surge toward Democrats is likely in the 2026 election — a surge that will give them control of the U.S. House and maybe even the Senate and thereby deal a huge blow to Trump’s dictatorial aspirations.
And this brings us to the current effort by Trump and company to cling to their anti-democratic control by unleashing a new and even more aggressive wave of gerrymandering — most notably in Texas — and the effort by Democratic Party leaders like California Gov. Gavin Newsom to fight fire with fire.
Good government advocates are right to find the situation maddening and deeply worrisome. The ultimate solution to the cancer of gerrymandering, after all, is to excise it from the body politic by enacting a national system of independent redistricting, and it’s understandable that many would view Newsom’s effort to replace California’s generally fair system with one that somewhat mimic’s Texas and North Carolina’s as a retreat in this critically important fight.
But as millions of people who have survived physical cancers and scores of other life-threatening illnesses via the use of modern drugs that produce difficult side effects can attest, there is often no other way to stop a disease’s march.
As Common Cause of North Carolina executive director Bob Phillips, a heroic longtime champion of fair maps, told Raleigh’s News & Observer, “we are in extraordinary times where you have a president who is overtly trying to take more congressional seats through blatant partisan gerrymandering.”
In other words, as regrettable and side-effect producing as it may be, the political chemotherapy being advanced by Newsom and other Democrats look, at this point, to be one of the best hopes for halting the nation’s slide toward an authoritarian police state and ultimately, enacting a national political health regime that would cure the cancer of gerrymandering once and for all.

(Photo by Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images)Republican support for in vitro fertilization, after surging in the wake of a 2024 Alabama Supreme Court decision that threatened the procedure, may be splintering as President Donald Trump retreats from his IVF promises and more far-right voices gain ground.
Earlier this year, conservatives in the Tennessee House staged an eleventh-hour skirmish over an IVF protection bill introduced by two of their Republican colleagues. The bill eventually passed, becoming one of the first in the nation to explicitly protect access to IVF. But some lawmakers who voted for it have signaled their willingness to revisit the issue.
In Georgia, a Republican-sponsored bill to codify the right to IVF into law sailed through the legislature, even as fellow conservative lawmakers introduced their own anti-abortion bill that opponents warned would undermine the IVF protections in the new law.
In statehouses around the nation, IVF has emerged as a dividing line running through the Republican Party. Particularly in states where abortion is banned, lawmakers who unite under the “pro-life” banner disagree over whether the popular treatment gives life or destroys it.
People who believe embryos are children oppose IVF because it can involve the discarding of some embryos, which they say is akin to abortion.
“The popularity of IVF creates a dilemma for Republican politicians who have had anti-choice organizations as a key part of their constituency for their whole careers,” said Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.
After the Alabama Supreme Court ruled last year that embryos are people, fertility clinics around the state temporarily halted their services, sparking nationwide outrage.
Republicans and Democrats rushed to pledge their support for fertility treatments such as IVF and announce their plans to protect it.
Conservatives push to declare fetuses as people, with far-reaching consequences

On the campaign trail last year, Trump promised to make insurers cover IVF so that it would be free for patients. After taking office, he signed an executive order giving White House officials 90 days to assemble a list of policy recommendations on protecting IVF access and reducing costs.
In March, he called himself “the fertilization president.”
But a week later, his administration eliminated the team of experts at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention responsible for tracking IVF outcomes across the United States. The team had, among other things, operated a database allowing consumers to look up an individual fertility clinic’s success rates. Earlier this month, The Washington Post reported that the White House doesn’t plan to require insurers to cover IVF services, though administration officials told the newspaper that IVF access remains a priority.
Meanwhile, conservative groups that oppose abortion have begun pushing an obscure alternative treatment for infertility called “restorative reproductive medicine,” or RRM. Advocates have urged the White House and federal and state legislators to back RRM, which is based on the idea that the underlying causes of infertility can be treated through lifestyle changes and improving a person’s overall health.
Arkansas recently became the first to pass a pro-RRM law. Others might follow suit in upcoming legislative sessions.
Cole Muzio, founder and president of the Georgia conservative Christian nonprofit Frontline Policy Council, said he doesn’t expect to see legislators try to ban IVF outright, despite preemptive efforts by legislators in his state and others to protect it.
“Republicans are intrinsically pro-family, and the idea of supporting those who want to have a family is a conservative, noble, positive thing,” he said.
“At the same time, IVF discards an overwhelming number of human lives. We’ve got a lot of work to do to educate people.”
 IVF pushback grows louder

This spring, the Tennessee bill protecting IVF passed unanimously in the state Senate. But by the time it hit the House floor in April, many of its Republican supporters sat silently while a few of their GOP colleagues tried to derail it.
The bill’s sponsor, Republican state Rep. Iris Rudder, told the Tennessee Lookout that she hadn’t expected disagreement over the bill to “mushroom the way it did.”
It eventually passed. But 11 Tennessee House Republicans sent a letter to GOP Gov. Bill Lee urging him to veto it and calling it “a Trojan horse that could potentially undermine Tennessee’s strong and righteous stance on the protection of innocent human life.”
Lee signed it in April.
The following day, Tennessee Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson — who voted for the bill and said he supports IVF and contraceptives — told constituents during a legislative forum that he’d had “lots of conversations” about it and expects the legislature to revisit the issue again in the next session.
“I think we’ll be back next year to take another stab at it,” he said.
Potential threats to IVF push political novices into election-year advocacy

In Georgia, the state’s most powerful Republicans made a bill to codify the right to IVF a major priority this year. It was signed into law in May.
“Thanks to a lot of bipartisan support and hard work, Georgians who want to grow their families will never have to worry about whether or not they can access this vital treatment,” the bill’s sponsor, Republican state Rep. Lehman Franklin, posted to X after it passed through the legislature. Franklin and his wife conceived through IVF, a story he has shared publicly as he promoted the measure.
“At the end of the day, being pro-family means being pro-IVF,” he wrote.
Muzio, of the Frontline Policy Council, believes the IVF debate represents not so much a split in the Republican Party as it does a lack of education about what the treatment really means to people who believe human life begins as soon as an egg is fertilized.
“Hopefully you’ll see [legislation] put in place that either backs different fertility treatments that are more pro-life or guardrails put in place to restrict the discarding of human life for the purposes of IVF,” he said.
For conservatives who see IVF as akin to abortion, restorative reproductive medicine has emerged politically as an option for addressing infertility without explicitly supporting IVF, which remains overwhelmingly popular among Americans.
 Out of obscurity

RRM was a relatively obscure idea until anti-abortion groups such as The Heritage Foundation began elevating it over the past year as an alternative to IVF. With RRM, a practitioner might help patients analyze their diet, chart their menstrual cycle to look for conditions that can impact fertility, or treat reproductive disorders like endometriosis or thyroid dysfunction.
Supporters argue that a more holistic approach is a better way to treat infertility, and that RRM methods are much less expensive than IVF, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars.
But RRM has been criticized in mainstream medical circles. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists calls RRM a “nonmedical approach” and an “unproven concept” that can delay time to pregnancy and expose patients to needless and painful surgical interventions, such as procedures to treat polycystic ovarian syndrome. It says the approach overwhelmingly puts the onus on women, ignoring that infertility causes are just as common in men.
Some experts worry that patients spending months or years on RRM treatments will lose precious time when IVF could have helped them get pregnant.
And OB-GYNs warn RRM is closely tied to the anti-abortion “personhood” movement, which attempts to grant fertilized eggs the same legal status as people — potentially leading to a loss of rights for pregnant patients and more severe restrictions on birth control and other reproductive health care.










They put their considerable resources into asking, ‘How do we blunt the momentum IVF is getting without saying we’re opposed to IVF?’


– Sean Tiptoon, chief advocacy and policy officer, American Society for Reproductive Medicine


Tipton, of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, believes RRM is more “ideology” than medical practice.
“[RRM] got legs thanks to the work of really influential right-wing and anti-choice groups,” he said. “They put their considerable resources into asking, ‘How do we blunt the momentum IVF is getting without saying we’re opposed to IVF?’”
But as RRM gains mainstream attention, it’s also found supporters in the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement promoted by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Some consumers remain skeptical of the fertility industry, where some clinics have ties to private equity firms and other large corporations.
In March, Arkansas Republican state Rep. Alyssa Brown told fellow legislators that RRM “prioritizes women’s health over the profits of Big Pharma and Big Fertility.”
 First in the nation

Brown sponsored a first-of-its-kind bill in Arkansas — which passed in April and was signed into law — that requires state insurance companies to cover RRM treatments.
Brown promised during a hearing that it wouldn’t limit access to IVF. Arkansas was one of the earliest states, in 1991, to require insurance companies to cover IVF.
Infertility experts warn against ‘restorative reproductive medicine,’ promoted by new Arkansas law

A similar bill with the same title, the RESTORE Act, was introduced in Congress again this year, after failing last year. It includes recommendations from The Heritage Foundation and the conservative, anti-abortion Ethics and Public Policy Center.
Arkansas’ new law also requires programs funded through Title X, which provides birth control and other reproductive care to low-income families, to use fertility awareness-based methods, mirroring a similar effort at the federal level. Under Kennedy, HHS has indicated plans to use Title X funding to open an “infertility training center.” Part of the center’s focus, according to its grant announcement, is to “educate on the root causes of infertility and the broad range of holistic infertility treatments” available to patients.
Meanwhile, state legislators around the country this year attempted to require health insurance to cover IVF, including in Montana, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia.
Nevada’s Democratic-controlled legislature passed a bill in June establishing the right to fertility treatments, including IVF, but it was swiftly vetoed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo.
In May, Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed a bill into law requiring a state insurance commission to consider coverage for procedures like IVF, a move that sets the stage for requiring health insurance companies to cover it. Before signing, Youngkin tried to insert a provision allowing private plans to opt out of coverage for religious or ethical beliefs, but the legislature rejected the change.
Although he signed the measure, Youngkin said his exemption idea needed to be taken up if the state eventually mandates coverage of fertility treatments.

Republican support for in vitro fertilization, after surging in the wake of a 2024 Alabama Supreme Court decision that threatened the procedure, may be splintering as President Donald Trump retreats from his IVF promises and more far-right voices gain ground.
Earlier this year, conservatives in the Tennessee House staged an eleventh-hour skirmish over an IVF protection bill introduced by two of their Republican colleagues. The bill eventually passed, becoming one of the first in the nation to explicitly protect access to IVF. But some lawmakers who voted for it have signaled their willingness to revisit the issue.
In Georgia, a Republican-sponsored bill to codify the right to IVF into law sailed through the legislature, even as fellow conservative lawmakers introduced their own anti-abortion bill that opponents warned would undermine the IVF protections in the new law.
In statehouses around the nation, IVF has emerged as a dividing line running through the Republican Party. Particularly in states where abortion is banned, lawmakers who unite under the “pro-life” banner disagree over whether the popular treatment gives life or destroys it.

People who believe embryos are children oppose IVF because it can involve the discarding of some embryos, which they say is akin to abortion.
“The popularity of IVF creates a dilemma for Republican politicians who have had anti-choice organizations as a key part of their constituency for their whole careers,” said Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.
After the Alabama Supreme Court ruled last year that embryos are people, fertility clinics around the state temporarily halted their services, sparking nationwide outrage.
Republicans and Democrats rushed to pledge their support for fertility treatments such as IVF and announce their plans to protect it.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump promised to make insurers cover IVF so that it would be free for patients. After taking office, he signed an executive order giving White House officials 90 days to assemble a list of policy recommendations on protecting IVF access and reducing costs.
In March, he called himself “the fertilization president.”
But a week later, his administration eliminated the team of experts at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention responsible for tracking IVF outcomes across the United States. The team had, among other things, operated a database allowing consumers to look up an individual fertility clinic’s success rates. Earlier this month, The Washington Post reported that the White House doesn’t plan to require insurers to cover IVF services, though administration officials told the newspaper that IVF access remains a priority.
Meanwhile, conservative groups that oppose abortion have begun pushing an obscure alternative treatment for infertility called “restorative reproductive medicine,” or RRM. Advocates have urged the White House and federal and state legislators to back RRM, which is based on the idea that the underlying causes of infertility can be treated through lifestyle changes and improving a person’s overall health.
Arkansas recently became the first to pass a pro-RRM law. Others might follow suit in upcoming legislative sessions.
Cole Muzio, founder and president of the Georgia conservative Christian nonprofit Frontline Policy Council, said he doesn’t expect to see legislators try to ban IVF outright, despite preemptive efforts by legislators in his state and others to protect it.
“Republicans are intrinsically pro-family, and the idea of supporting those who want to have a family is a conservative, noble, positive thing,” he said.
“At the same time, IVF discards an overwhelming number of human lives. We’ve got a lot of work to do to educate people.”
 IVF pushback grows louder

This spring, the Tennessee bill protecting IVF passed unanimously in the state Senate. But by the time it hit the House floor in April, many of its Republican supporters sat silently while a few of their GOP colleagues tried to derail it.
The bill’s sponsor, Republican state Rep. Iris Rudder, told the Tennessee Lookout that she hadn’t expected disagreement over the bill to “mushroom the way it did.”
It eventually passed. But 11 Tennessee House Republicans sent a letter to GOP Gov. Bill Lee urging him to veto it and calling it “a Trojan horse that could potentially undermine Tennessee’s strong and righteous stance on the protection of innocent human life.”
Lee signed it in April.
The following day, Tennessee Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson — who voted for the bill and said he supports IVF and contraceptives — told constituents during a legislative forum that he’d had “lots of conversations” about it and expects the legislature to revisit the issue again in the next session.
“I think we’ll be back next year to take another stab at it,” he said.
In Georgia, the state’s most powerful Republicans made a bill to codify the right to IVF a major priority this year. It was signed into law in May.
“Thanks to a lot of bipartisan support and hard work, Georgians who want to grow their families will never have to worry about whether or not they can access this vital treatment,” the bill’s sponsor, Republican state Rep. Lehman Franklin, posted to X after it passed through the legislature. Franklin and his wife conceived through IVF, a story he has shared publicly as he promoted the measure.
“At the end of the day, being pro-family means being pro-IVF,” he wrote.
Muzio, of the Frontline Policy Council, believes the IVF debate represents not so much a split in the Republican Party as it does a lack of education about what the treatment really means to people who believe human life begins as soon as an egg is fertilized.
“Hopefully you’ll see [legislation] put in place that either backs different fertility treatments that are more pro-life or guardrails put in place to restrict the discarding of human life for the purposes of IVF,” he said.
For conservatives who see IVF as akin to abortion, restorative reproductive medicine has emerged politically as an option for addressing infertility without explicitly supporting IVF, which remains overwhelmingly popular among Americans.
 Out of obscurity

RRM was a relatively obscure idea until anti-abortion groups such as The Heritage Foundation began elevating it over the past year as an alternative to IVF. With RRM, a practitioner might help patients analyze their diet, chart their menstrual cycle to look for conditions that can impact fertility, or treat reproductive disorders like endometriosis or thyroid dysfunction.
Supporters argue that a more holistic approach is a better way to treat infertility, and that RRM methods are much less expensive than IVF, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars.
But RRM has been criticized in mainstream medical circles. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists calls RRM a “nonmedical approach” and an “unproven concept” that can delay time to pregnancy and expose patients to needless and painful surgical interventions, such as procedures to treat polycystic ovarian syndrome. It says the approach overwhelmingly puts the onus on women, ignoring that infertility causes are just as common in men.
Some experts worry that patients spending months or years on RRM treatments will lose precious time when IVF could have helped them get pregnant.
And OB-GYNs warn RRM is closely tied to the anti-abortion “personhood” movement, which attempts to grant fertilized eggs the same legal status as people — potentially leading to a loss of rights for pregnant patients and more severe restrictions on birth control and other reproductive health care.
Tipton, of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, believes RRM is more “ideology” than medical practice.
“[RRM] got legs thanks to the work of really influential right-wing and anti-choice groups,” he said. “They put their considerable resources into asking, ‘How do we blunt the momentum IVF is getting without saying we’re opposed to IVF?’”
But as RRM gains mainstream attention, it’s also found supporters in the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement promoted by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Some consumers remain skeptical of the fertility industry, where some clinics have ties to private equity firms and other large corporations.
In March, Arkansas Republican state Rep. Alyssa Brown told fellow legislators that RRM “prioritizes women’s health over the profits of Big Pharma and Big Fertility.”
 First in the nation

Brown sponsored a first-of-its-kind bill in Arkansas — which passed in April and was signed into law — that requires state insurance companies to cover RRM treatments.
Brown promised during a hearing that it wouldn’t limit access to IVF. Arkansas was one of the earliest states, in 1991, to require insurance companies to cover IVF.
A similar bill with the same title, the RESTORE Act, was introduced in Congress again this year, after failing last year. It includes recommendations from The Heritage Foundation and the conservative, anti-abortion Ethics and Public Policy Center.
Arkansas’ new law also requires programs funded through Title X, which provides birth control and other reproductive care to low-income families, to use fertility awareness-based methods, mirroring a similar effort at the federal level. Under Kennedy, HHS has indicated plans to use Title X funding to open an “infertility training center.” Part of the center’s focus, according to its grant announcement, is to “educate on the root causes of infertility and the broad range of holistic infertility treatments” available to patients.
Meanwhile, state legislators around the country this year attempted to require health insurance to cover IVF, including in Montana, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia.
Nevada’s Democratic-controlled legislature passed a bill in June establishing the right to fertility treatments, including IVF, but it was swiftly vetoed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo.
In May, Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed a bill into law requiring a state insurance commission to consider coverage for procedures like IVF, a move that sets the stage for requiring health insurance companies to cover it.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Richmond resident Asia Brody is juggling being a single parent, a restaurant worker and a nursing assistant student whose apartment rent absorbs much of her income. On Monday in Capitol Square, alongside U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, and state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, Brody said the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is essential for keeping food on her family’s plates. 
Brody shared her insights as the lawmakers vowed to shoulder forthcoming federal changes to SNAP  — which critics say could result in people getting less food assistance or dropping off the program entirely —as best they can.
After a Republican majority in Congress passed a major reconciliation bill this summer, states are expected to potentially absorb additional costs for SNAP, and will likely impose additional verification requirements for recipients. 
A recent analysis from Voices for Virginia’s Children estimates nearly 447,000 families are at risk of losing at least some of their SNAP benefits.  
“They frame us as lazy people, mooching off the government,” Brody said of Republicans in Congress and others who support the SNAP rollback. “But I work full time plus I go to school.”
Ensuring her children are well-fed helps them focus better in school, Brody added. She would like for them to be on track to pursue their dream careers someday. As for her own future, she hopes she can someday buy a house that she can pass down to them. 
Another speaker at Monday’s event, The Market at 25th CEO Derek Houston, emphasized how SNAP doesn’t just enable income-challenged families’ access to healthy foods, but also boosts the grocery stores that serve them. 
Church Hill, eastern and southern parts of Richmond had been identified as “food deserts.” The term describes an area where there are no grocery stores nearby and residents have to travel further to shop or rely on less nutritious and highly processed foods most often found in bodegas or gas stations. The lack of a local grocery store often correlates with some combination of either low density, low-income residents or the lingering effects of racial redlining — a historic practice that excluded or prevented Black families from living in certain areas. 
So, The Market at 25th opened a few years ago in Church Hill, aware that many of its patrons would be SNAP recipients, with the mission of bringing more food to the area. 
“Big chains weren’t willing to invest in putting a store in a largely lower-income neighborhood,” Houston said. 
He and McClellan noted that SNAP also benefits grocers by helping their clients be able to buy better food. The state  has a program called Virginia Fresh Match that helps SNAP recipients stretch their value with purchases of fruits and vegetables. 
It gives Brody peace of mind and helps create healthy habits for her children, she said. Houston suggested state lawmakers work to protect the program and strengthen it. 
As chair of the Education and Health Committee, and a current lieutenant governor candidate, Hashmi is keeping a watchful eye of how federal impacts can shift state actions. 
“Cutting food assistance funds will not make hunger go away,” Hashmi said. 
As a former state lawmaker and now a federal one, McClellan said her former colleagues like Hashmi and whoever becomes the next governor will need to deal with the effects of the reconciliation bill Congress passed this summer, which she and Democrats at the state and congressional levels opposed.
She said that the state legislature is going to have to “fill this hole that could be going to our public schools” or to “lowering the cost of childcare.”
Meanwhile, Gov. Glenn Youngkin has directed the state to find ways to avoid taking on extra costs. An executive order he issued this month aims to help reduce error rates — a measure of overpayments and underpayments of SNAP benefits. This is because the reconciliation bill will require states with higher error rates to pay a portion of SNAP benefits to recipients, a check that the federal government has historically written. 
Virginia’s 12% error rate, outlined by Youngkin in the directive, must drop to 6% by 2027 to avoid paying $270 million annually. 
The work is expected to be complicated for local governments, which administer food assistance and which will now need to use their staffs to more tightly scrutinize recipients’ expenses and household compositions. The extra work to catch errors could be costly or burdensome in itself, but Youngkin’s directive also suggests exploring public-private partnerships “to free up capacity at local social service agencies so that more efforts can be directed toward reducing Virginia’s SNAP error rate.”
Virginia lawmakers, health officials brace for Medicaid changes

He added in a presentation to the state legislature’s finance committees this month that he will address the recent changes to Medicaid and SNAP in his December submission to the biennium budget. As the outgoing governor, he can present a budget that the next one can use as a starting point in 2026. 
In the meantime, McClellan stressed that Democrats in Congress are gearing up efforts to walk back public health and nutrition components of the reconciliation bill, which she said could be devastating. 
Missouri Republican U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley recently introduced a bill to prevent further Medicaid cuts, McClellan noted. He’d cautioned his party about the reconciliation bill before ultimately siding with them to pass it. 
“The more pressure you put on my colleagues, the more likely they are to reverse these damaging cuts before they do too much damage for us to fix,” McClellan said. “Your advocacy is working, keep it up.”
Brody, the Richmond resident, made a call to action for lawmakers to act with empathy.
“No one knows where life is going to take them or whether they might one day need SNAP,” she said. “Someone could have been in an accident and can’t work. Someone could have fallen on tough times — we’re all just trying to do the best we can.”

The escalating television ads, the direct mail, the social media bombardments are just starting. Campaign signs sprout on lawns like toadstools.
But it’s the races at the bottom of November’s ballot — for all 100 seats in the House of Delegates — that could portend heartbreaking consequences: potentially the forced dissolution of many thousands of same-sex marriages and the families built on them across the commonwealth.
Amid passionate debate, civil rights resolutions clear Virginia legislature

How, you ask? The Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriages 10 years ago in Obergefell v. Hodges. It’s settled law.
Roe v. Wade stood for 49 years, guaranteeing a federal legal right to abortions, until a conservative court supermajority, cemented during President Donald Trump’s first term, overturned it in 2022 and made reproductive rights a state-by-state determination.
Now, the justices are considering a request to reconsider and reverse Obergefell from a former Kentucky court clerk once jailed for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The court’s most fringe-right justice, Clarence Thomas, is blunt about his dream of reversing rulings that legalized not only gay marriage but also contraception and even sexual intimacy between consenting adults of the same gender.
Should the court hear the case and, sometime next year, grant Thomas’s sadistic fantasy, the legality of identical-gender marriages would likely devolve to the state legislatures, just as it did with abortion.
Virginia is the only state in the former Confederacy that has resisted severe limits or outright bans on abortion, but it’s not without close calls or for a lack of Virginia Republicans trying. Just a few thousand votes — in key legislative races — preserved abortion rights in Virginia for the past two years.
In 2023, Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s gubernatorial PAC raised and spent record sums in his bid to win a Senate majority from the Democrats and retain or expand a thin GOP House majority. But Youngkin also proposed banning abortions after 15 weeks of gestation to the lasting dismay of vulnerable Republicans in decisive races. Democrats kept the Senate and won the narrowest possible House majority: 51 of the 100 seats. Five House races were decided by margins of 2 percentage points or fewer.
In case you’re wondering what this has to do with 2025 House races, let’s review Virginia’s governmental processes.
If Obergefell is overturned, then Article 1, Section 15-A of the Virginia Constitution would control the issue of gay marriage, superseding statutory law. The provision, ratified by voters in 2006, dictates that “only a union between one man and one woman may be a marriage valid in or recognized by this Commonwealth and its political subdivisions.” It prevails unless it’s nullified by a subsequent constitutional amendment that specifically permits marriages between individuals of the same sex — like the one working its way through Virginia’s legislative process now.
The process for amending Virginia’s Constitution requires that a resolution establishing the amendment be passed without alteration twice by the state Senate and House with an intervening legislative election between each enactment.
House Joint Resolution 1 passed the House 51-48 and the Senate 21-18 in January on party line votes. The next step is to enact the resolution anew, word-for-word, in the 2026 session, after this fall’s House election. Should the identical measure pass both chambers again, it would be subject to voter ratification in a statewide referendum in the November 2026 election.
Should it fail and should the Supreme Court eliminate protections for same-sex marriage, it could end or hopelessly cloud the marital status for more than 16,000 couples in Virginia, perhaps more. Those numbers are the most recent estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2023 American Community Survey. Because the survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 1,923, the figure could be as high as just over 18,000 couples or just over 14,000. There are 1,500 more married same-sex couples in Virginia than there are unmarried, cohabiting same-gender couples, the data show.










We are contributing members of society. We’re married and are raising a child. My wife is a public servant. I don’t understand how anyone is threatened by our marriage.


– Sheila Kunz, a Richmond-area resident, speaking on her decade-old same-sex marriage.


The numbers, however, feel sterile unless you know some of the couples whose households could be crushed. For Virginia same-sex spouses like Alex and Sheila, or like Rick and Jay, the prospect of the government stripping away the legal foundation for their union with the most beloved person in their lives is terrifying, flagrantly unjust and cruel beyond reason.

“We are contributing members of society. We’re married and are raising a child. My wife is a public servant. I don’t understand how anyone is threatened by our marriage,” said Sheila, who married Alex 10 years ago, shortly after Obergefell. They live in the Richmond area where Sheila is a human resources professional and Alex is a longtime law-enforcement officer. We spoke for this column last week.
My wife and I befriended Alex and Sheila Kunz 13 years ago and have adored their daughter all of her 12 years. They’re rock-solid, thoughtful neighbors. We rejoiced when Obergefell allowed them to marry. They have instilled character, kindness and a sense of duty and personal responsibility within their child, now a middle-schooler.
“We’re just like you. We have jobs like you. We go to barbecues like you. We’re not … weird, you know?” Alex said. “Now, this (discrimination) coming back is not surprising because, unfortunately … it’s people picking up on the bandwagon of hatred. It’s giving the most extreme reason to hate another group of people.”
I’ve known and respected Jay Timmons for more than 30 years, when he was chief of staff to fellow Reagan Republican George Allen when he was Virginia’s 67th governor in the mid-1990s and, beginning in 2001, its U.S. senator. Now the president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers, Jay’s focus is policy, not politics, yet he and Rick Olson feel cornered by the stifling intolerance of today’s GOP.
He and Olson married in California 17 years ago and reside in Fairfax County with their two daughters and a son. After the Obergefell ruling, they dared believe that threats to their marriage were over. But the specter has returned, and they again live dreading events outside their control that opposite-sex couples never feel.
“The question is when is it settled,” Timmons said in an interview last week.
“It’s not even ‘separate-but-equal,’ it’s discrimination based on sex,” Olson said, referring to the rationale for racially segregated public schools that the Supreme Court rejected in its 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision.
“Families come in all shapes and sizes. There are single-parent households, there are two-parent households — some same-gender, some opposite-gender. There are households of mixed races (and) mixed religions,” Timmons said.
“I think one of the things that really … makes us unique as humans is that we have the ability to learn and see other perspectives,” he said. “I really don’t judge those people who have a different perspective culturally. I just ask that they let us live our lives.”

(Photo courtesy of National Conference of State Legislatures)BOSTON — In some of his first public comments since being shot in an attempted assassination, Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman urged fellow lawmakers to refocus on the true purpose of public service.
“We can’t let the evil of the night win, and we must redouble our efforts and reclaim the reason we are all public servants,” he said.
That means listening to one another, extending understanding even in disagreement, and finding compromise: “not because it’s easy, but because the people we serve deserve better than constant stalemate built on partisan egos. They deserve solutions.”
Hoffman appeared via video message before thousands of lawmakers and staffers gathered at the National Conference of State Legislatures summit earlier this month in Boston. In June, he and his wife were shot in their Minnesota home just before the politically motivated shooter killed state Rep. Melissa Hortman, the former House speaker, her husband, Mark, and their dog, Gilbert.
The June shooting hung over this year’s meeting of the NCSL, a group that labors to maintain a reputation for bipartisan and nonpartisan work. Lawmakers in attendance on the left and the right repeatedly lamented the toxicity of American politics and the growing threat of political violence at local levels of government.
Many lawmakers raised questions about whether public service is still worth it, how state governments can buck the partisanship that defines Washington, D.C., and what measures lawmakers should take to keep members safe. Most lawmakers said they remained committed to serving, but they said conservatives and liberals must find ways to disagree without demonizing their opposition and do better at monitoring the rhetoric of members of their own parties.
Minnesota assassination prompts many lawmakers to wonder: Is service worth the danger?

Wisconsin House Speaker Robin Vos, a Republican, said the vitriol of social media and cable news has made it more difficult to talk with people of differing beliefs. Technology has reduced the frequency of many human interactions, he said. Even the rise of video doorbells has made it difficult for candidates and officials to talk with everyday constituents in person, as many refuse to answer.
“So instead of knocking on doors and meeting strangers, you have a tendency to go to party events where you are meeting people who want to come and meet you,” he said. “Well, they come from usually one end of the spectrum. They’re people who are probably paying too much attention to politics and not enough to all the other things in the world.”
Author and media personality Michael Smerconish asked Vos whether the current climate pushes good candidates away and incentivizes “zealots” to run.
“That’s a really good point,” Vos responded. “Part of my job is to recruit candidates, and it is very challenging to get people who are willing to put their personal life on the line and convince their family that there is nothing more fun to do on a Sunday morning than to go to a pancake breakfast.”
He said potential candidates are worried about how their kids will be treated in school and what effect running could have on their careers. But he said state governments can model a more civil political tone and show how government works. Even simple moves like holding bipartisan meetings with staff — rather than holding separate caucus meetings — can help to forge more positive relationships.
“We are places where people can disagree, but we don’t have to be hateful,” he said. “And maybe, just maybe, over time we’ll be able to showcase to the rest of the country that that’s the way that legislatures lead.”

‘Hold people accountable’
Since the June shooting in Minnesota, liberal and conservative states alike are considering measures to bolster protections for candidates and elected officials.
Legislation proposed in New Jersey would prohibit the publication of home addresses of lawmakers, adding them to a list of protected officials that includes judges and law enforcement. That legislation remains in committee.
ln North Dakota, lawmakers are considering establishing a more formal process for reporting threats, the North Dakota Monitor reported. A North Dakota man was charged in June with sending threatening messages to officials in which he referenced the Minnesota shootings. Legislative staff have already removed the home addresses of lawmakers from the legislative website and are considering providing post office boxes for lawmaker mail and creating new safety training.
Pennsylvania lawmakers will soon introduce a package of bills to boost legislator safety, limit their public exposure and ensure representation if a lawmaker dies while in office, the Pennsylvania Capital-Star reported.
In Oregon, House Speaker Julie Fahey said lawmakers and staff are thinking more about personal safety. State law doesn’t allow candidates to use campaign funds for security purposes, but the Democratic speaker said the legislature may soon change that.











I think it’s really important that we talk about the threats and we talk about the impact.

During an NCSL session about the cost of public service, Fahey referenced protesters’ 2020 armed breach of the state Capitol in Salem and noted that she’d had an angry constituent show up at her home.
She said lawmakers and staffers need to talk more about the cost of their work, which can be isolating, especially for those in leadership positions.
“I think it’s really important that we talk about the threats and we talk about the impact,” she said.
Sitting next to her, West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said it’s not just personal safety that weighs on lawmakers.
It’s just as taxing on spouses and families — who he said are “front and center” in any conversation about running for office nowadays.
When he first assumed his leadership position in 2018, Hanshaw said he saw his job as mostly confined to running the chamber and worrying only about the behavior of members in their official capacity. But his thinking has evolved in this political environment, which he said requires modeling and monitoring of personal behavior and online activity of members of his caucus.
“That was the wrong approach,” he told Stateline. “And I would say that to anyone who’s coming into one of these roles: You need to set the example and you need to hold people accountable.”
‘What is your why?’
Pennsylvania Democratic House Speaker Joanna McClinton said the current political environment is markedly different because officials at all levels of government can be targets.
“And what we must all collectively do is to condemn the violence, to bring the tone of rhetoric down and out of our capitols, and most importantly let folks know that we can always agree to disagree, but we can never, ever allow there to be violence in discourse,” she said in an interview.

While the climate has not deterred her from serving, McClinton said it does provide an opportunity to underscore the solemnity of public service and helps frame a candidate’s purpose for running and deciding whether it’s worthwhile.
“What is your why?” she said she increasingly asks potential candidates. “What is your purpose? What do you plan to achieve, to accomplish? Why is it that you want to do this?”
Tim Storey, the chief executive officer of NCSL, said state legislatures are more bipartisan than many realize. Even in dogged legislative fights, many bills ultimately pass with support from both sides — or even unanimously.
“There’s a relatively small group who just demonize the other side,” he said in an interview. “I think for the most part, they still see each other as humans who are actually in a really unique job, and so only they can understand each other and the sacrifice and the pressure that gets put on by the public exposure.”
State leaders brace for ‘heavy lift’ from Medicaid, food stamp changes

He said that was especially true following Hortman’s assassination.
“They felt it across the aisle of both parties,” he said.
Storey said NCSL’s Boston summit was a record-breaker with more than 1,600 state lawmakers and thousands more staffers and lobbyists in attendance.
The event kicked off with two of Minnesota’s top legislative leaders — a Democrat and a Republican — on stage in front of a packed ballroom talking about the assassination.
Republican House Speaker Lisa Demuth said Hortman had always treated her as a partner rather than an adversary. With mutual trust and respect, they could “disagree without being disagreeable,” she said.
State Sen. Erin Murphy, the Democratic majority leader, said politicians must turn down the vitriol in their rhetoric.
“I think a lot of America would appreciate that. I know Melissa would,” she told the crowd.
But she said lawmakers must also root out dehumanizing narratives and conspiracy theories that have led to the radicalization of so many individuals.
“We can’t lose faith in each other. We can’t lose faith in America,” she said. “As Melissa taught us, failure is not an option.”

(Photo by Amanda Mills/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)As a new school year begins in Ohio, an old problem persists: child hunger. Hunger relief programs continue to strain under the demand, while receiving less support from state and federal sources.
According to Feeding America, 1 in 5 children in the state face hunger, amounting to more than 517,000 kids.
“You have a lot of people bending heaven and earth to get food into kids mouths, but the problem is, we can’t do it alone,” said Deacon Nick Bates, director of Hunger Network in Ohio, which partners with religious congregations and local agencies to address hunger.
Bates has seen firsthand the compromises that have to be made at church food pantries and other hunger-relief efforts across the state because of state and federal budget cuts. Fresh foods are in limited supply, and resources are being spread thin.
“Instead of being able to give out five days worth of food, it means giving two to three days worth of food,” Bates said.
He said the long-term effects of hungry kids will hit the state in different ways, from health outcomes to education struggles, even with the waning of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“We should recognize that the pandemic may have ended, but the scars still remain,” Bates said. “One of those scars is hunger, and when kids are hungry, they’re more likely to get sick; when kids are hungry, they have trouble learning.”
Hunger and school funding
School districts are finding their own ways to support their students, even as they navigate a new educational funding model, on the state and federal level.
The Pickerington Local School District receives federal funding to allow the district’s 12,000 students to receive free breakfast and lunch.
Education support professional Joie Moore is nervous that the funding might not exist next year because of the back-and-forth over education (and other) funding happening in Washington, D.C., potentially leaving some students in the lurch when it comes to meals.
“I have worked in the school system for 15 years, so I know what’s it’s like to not have (the funding),” said Moore. “I remember when it was a cheese sandwich (if a student couldn’t pay for lunch), and that’s not enough to sustain a child throughout the day.”

Moore’s two children went through Pickerington schools, and she has served in many roles at the district, including helping at lunchtime. She engaged with students who didn’t have enough to eat at home, despite families working two and three jobs just to keep a roof over their heads.
“We had kids that would come into school hungry, and I would keep granola bars, protein bars, Goldfish, those kinds of things, in my drawer so they have at least something to snack on,” Moore said.
The district, like many others in the state, may have to find a way to do more with less, something Moore said the district has dealt with in the past.
But with the new state operating budget cutting public school funding through changes to the Fair School Funding Plan model that’s been in effect for the last four years, the district is looking at “dire” numbers, according to Moore, who is also president of the Pickerington Support Staff Association.
The most recent attempt to put a levy on the November ballot didn’t make it past the school board. If a levy isn’t brought forth and supported by district voters, Moore is concerned staff reductions are the next step to make ends meet.
“We have to have funding to give our kids textbooks, to give them food, all the things they need,” Moore said. “If we’re able to keep that (federal funding for school meals), but we don’t have the money to support the staff, that’s going to affect how we do that.”
Further cuts
In the state operating budget approved by the General Assembly in June, the Ohio-based Children’s Hunger Alliance received a total of $5.5 million over the next two years, down from Gov. Mike DeWine’s proposal that the alliance receive $7.5 million over the biennium.
The alliance supports programs in child care centers, after-school programs, summer meals, and weekend meals, and it provided about 11 million meals to more than 160,000 children in 2024, according to the organization.
The $2 million budget cut means direct impacts for Ohio children in need of food, according to the hunger alliance, including 1.2 million fewer meals for children returning to school this month.
“Despite the state budget cut, we do NOT plan to cut any children from our programs,” a statement from the alliance said. “To make the numbers work, we will have to provide less food over fewer weeks during the year.”
The alliance projected they would serve more than 400,000 meals by the end of the summer, including “rural grab-and-go” summer meals.

The Ohio Association of Foodbanks is also providing summer meal delivery for rural and underserved areas, despite also doing more with less funds.
The association’s earmark in the state budget included up to $24.5 million per year, to be used not only to address the increasing demand for food distribution, but also for summer meal programs, federal outreach for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and other roles like free tax filing services and “capacity building.”
The state budget came as Congress debated their own budget bill, one that sought hundreds of billions in cuts, particularly from programs including SNAP, which the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities called the “deepest SNAP cut in history.”
More than 40% of households in Ohio receiving SNAP benefits have children, according to Feeding America.
The final budget was passed 51-50, with the tie-breaking vote coming from Vice President and former Ohio U.S. Sen. JD Vance.
The funding reductions were a cut to the knees for food assistance programs already facing growing demand and Ohio counties already facing benefits shortfalls.
Joree Novotny, executive director of the Ohio Association of Foodbanks, said while Congress did reauthorize legislation to establish permanent summer food benefits and the expanded summer meal delivery for rural and underserved areas, food insecurity continues to be a problem because of the various economic impacts that surround it.
This includes grocery store food prices, housing and utility costs, along with child care and other household needs.
“Tradeoffs in the quality of food and the quantity of food are often made first as family budgets are squeezed,” Novotny told the Capital Journal. “Unfortunately, Ohio’s statewide hunger relief network has less food on our shelves to help fill those growing gaps.”
The association leader cited a 23% reduction in state funding for “food sourcing,” along with increased food costs for the organizations trying to help hungry Ohioans as reasons the funding gaps are becoming untenable.
Between April and June of this year, the statewide food bank network provided less than four days worth of groceries per pantry visitor on average. In the same period in 2019, the network was able to provide seven days of groceries.
While food supply costs were only up 2% between April and June of 2025 compared to the 2019 period, the association said food pantry visits went up by 89%.
The School Nutrition Association’s analysis of the federal budget bill found that fewer children will be automatically eligible for free school meals as eligibility for SNAP gets stricter.
It also predicted that less schools will enroll in the Community Eligibility Provision, a federal program that allows school districts with a high percentage of low-income families to receive free meals for all students.
The number of Ohio school districts taking up that provision has already gone down over the last two years.
According to the Food Research & Action Center, 77.6% of Ohio school districts who were eligible for the provision took the assistance in the 2023-2024 school year. But in the 2024-2025 school year, participation in the state went down to 61.3%.
The superintendent of Edison Local Schools in Jefferson County recently announced the district would not be continuing with the provision in the 2025-2026 school year, going back to a paid model for anyone not eligible for free or reduced-cost meals.
“While CEP has allowed the district to offer meals at no cost to families, the current model is no longer financially sustainable,” Superintendent Bill Beattie wrote in a letter to families. “This was not an easy decision, but it’s one we must make to ensure the long-term stability of our food service program.”
Beattie said the district “can no longer sustain (the program) without compromising other essential services.”
Compromise seems to be the standard for many schools in Ohio as they figure out how to manage with the state budget funding changes on top of less federal funding.
Ohio Education Association President Jeff Wensing said the problems lie solely at the feet of legislative leaders, who don’t have students at the heart of their priorities.
“We’re in a position now where the legislators have determined there are going to be winners and losers in school meals,” Wensing said. “These are problems that we have, and every real problem that we currently have, you have to pin at the door of the Republican Party, because that’s the party that’s been in control (in Ohio) for over three decades.”

Ned Lamont isn't invited after his veto of an omnibus housing bill.","The country’s premier conference for the pro-homes movement will be in Connecticut next month with hundreds of attendees from a wide array of political beliefs, but Gov. Ned Lamont isn’t invited following his veto of a sweeping housing bill earlier this summer.
This year’s YIMBYtown conference, organized by Desegregate Connecticut, is scheduled to be held in New Haven in mid-September. The name stands for the acronym “Yes In My Back Yard,” a counter to the “Not in My Back Yard” argument against development of more apartments largely in single-family home neighborhoods.
This marks the first time the national conference will be held in Connecticut.
Lamont in June vetoed House Bill 5002, which included a provision known as Work, Live, Ride — a policy backed by Desegregate CT — that would have prioritized certain state infrastructure funds for towns that agreed to allow more apartments near public transit hubs.
“We made it very clear to Gov. Lamont that he is not invited unless he has signed,” a housing bill before the conference, said Pete Harrison, Connecticut director of the Regional Plan Association. Desegregate CT is a program of the association.
When he vetoed the bill, Lamont said he wanted to see more buy-in from towns before he signed. He’s asked lawmakers to come back and work on a new housing bill in a special session this fall.
“The Governor understands the RPA’s decision to not invite him to their conference, YIMBYTOWN,” said Rob Blanchard, the governor’s spokesperson, in a statement. “He still appreciates their work and looks forward to future collaboration on a new bill to address our housing crisis.”
The YIMBYtown conference began in 2016 in Colorado and, particularly over the past few years, has attracted people with a wide array of political beliefs. At this year’s conference, keynote speakers include well-known climate activist Bill McKibben, liberal activist Tamika L. Butler and Republican Gov. Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota.
“The strength politically is that there really are different ways to speak about this issue to different political audiences, but the through thread is: We are simply not building enough homes, and at least the problem that we can absolutely switch tomorrow is land use decisions,” Harrison said.
Conservative and liberal states alike have taken action on land use.
In Republican-controlled Montana, state legislation has legalized accessory dwelling units in all cities, required towns to allow duplexes in any single-family zoned neighborhood, cut down on the public hearing process for development and allowed more development without special hearings before zoning boards.
This is known as the “Montana Miracle,” and housing experts say several other Republican states including Utah, Idaho and North Carolina have also passed progressive changes to allow more housing. Some of these states have been driven by a desire for economic growth, to build more densely and preserve open land and by the idea that land owners should have the right to do what they want with their property.
More Democratic states including Massachusetts, California and New Jersey also have laws that make it easier to bypass red tape and build housing, experts say. In Connecticut, the conversation about zoning change has been mostly dominated by more left-leaning groups.
Harrison said many other states have seen more bipartisan work on zoning policy than Connecticut has.
“It’s safe to say that even in a deep red state, it has crossed over more so than it has in Connecticut,” he said.
In Connecticut, those in favor of zoning change have said it would help improve the state’s climate resiliency and cut down on housing costs, among other benefits. State Republicans have objected to proposals to reform zoning on a state level saying it encroaches on local control and imposes one-size-fits-all solutions on towns with unique needs.
Harrison said climate change is one of the major themes of this year’s YIMBYtown conference. He said Connecticut is one of the states that can expect to see its population rise as people from southern states find their homes unlivable or uninsurable because of the impacts of a warming world.
“As bad as the housing crisis is in Connecticut, we don’t think it has started yet. It’s the next generation that will not be able to live in places with high growth and lower costs because of climate change and because of insurance rates and construction costs, it will just be too expensive,” Harrison said.
More than 600 people are expected to attend the conference, which will take place from Sept. 14 to 16. There are more than 60 panels on topics ranging from transportation, homelessness, insurance and states’ zoning changes.
“We’re really aiming to align around the goals that Desegregate has been pushing around housing, inequity, transit, energy and sustainability, and bringing those four topics together,” said Nick Kantor, director of Desegregate CT.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lamont-Veto-0623-DE-020-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-26 06:56:47.708371

(Otto Kitsinger for States Newsroom.)A new poll conducted by Emerson College indicates Ohio’s Republican candidates have an advantage over their Democratic counterparts. There’s still a long way to go before next year’s primaries — much less the general election in November 2026. But the survey offers a baseline for voters’ preferences and engagement.
Emerson pollsters contacted 1,000 active registered voters over two days last week Aug. 18-19. They contacted respondents on cell phones, via text messages, and online. The poll’s margin of error is +/- 3%.
The 2026 race
In the gubernatorial contest, Republican Vivek Ramaswamy holds a 10-point lead in a hypothetical matchup with former state health director, Dr. Amy Acton. Almost 12% of respondents were undecided.

Former Ohio Democratic U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan has not formally entered the race, but he’s been flirting with the idea. If Ramaswamy were to face off against Ryan, his lead would shrink to about eight points, the poll shows. A little more than 10% of were undecided in that contest.
For the first time in almost 20 years, Sherrod Brown is running for U.S. Senate as a challenger. The three-term Democratic U.S. Senator lost to Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno last year. He’s challenging Republican U.S. Sen. Jon Husted who Gov. Mike DeWine tapped to fill the seat left vacant when Vance became Vice President.
Poll respondents favor Husted in a matchup against Brown.
“In the first public poll following Sherrod Brown’s 2026 campaign kick-off, the former Senator trails the incumbent Jon Husted by six points, though he has a higher name recognition than the first-term Senator,” Emerson College Polling Executive Director Spencer Kimball said.
Digging a bit deeper, Kimball explained, “Husted has a 16-point lead among male voters and voters without a college degree, and a 14-point lead among voters over 40. Brown has a 13-point lead among voters under 40, a three-point lead among women voters, and an eight-point lead among independent voters.”
Brown, however, still needs to win the Democratic primary. With a long track-record, millions of dollars already raised, and near-universal name ID (his last contest was the most expensive in U.S. Senate history), Brown has enormous structural advantages.
But according to FEC filings, Lynnea Lau of Toledo, Chris Volpe of Columbus, and Ronald Kincaid of Upper Arlington have all officially declared their candidacy. Another political newcomer, Fred Ode, has announced his candidacy, but has yet to file with the FEC.
Broader, longer view
The Trump backlash some Democrats are banking on for the midterms hasn’t materialized in Ohio — at least not yet.
Emerson found almost half of Ohio voters (49%) approve of the job Trump is doing as president; 42% disapprove of his performance. About 80% of respondents described themselves as ‘extremely’ or ‘very’ motivated to vote in the midterm elections.
When it comes to one of the president’s signature issues, Trump’s policy fares even better. Nearly 57% of respondents said mass deportations in Ohio are a good thing. Respondents were a bit mixed, however, on sending Ohio national guard troops to Washington, D.C. Roughly 44% support the idea compared to 42% who oppose it. About 14% are still up in the air.
With Trump’s push to gerrymander Texas in favor of Republicans, redistricting is getting a lot of national attention just as Ohio lawmakers prepare to draft new congressional lines of their own. Unlike any other state, Ohio is constitutionally mandated to redraw its map because the existing one was approved along partisan lines.
Emerson found a plurality of respondents acknowledge Ohio’s existing boundaries are drawn to benefit Republican politicians, but about a third said they were unsure.
Another potential consequence of Trump’s gerrymandering push shows up in 2028 Democratic presidential primary field. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has pushed to redraw his state’s congressional map in hopes of neutralizing any Republican gains in Texas. Newsom has positioned himself as Trump’s foil — up to and including a caps-lock heavy social media account satirizing the president’s Truth Social presence.
At least among Democrats, Newsom’s trolling appears to be making an impression. He leads a crowded field of 2028 Democratic presidential hopefuls.

“Most of that money comes from everyday Ohioans who simply support him in a huge way,” Ohio Democratic strategist David Pepper said.
Pepper points out that what Brown raised overnight is similar to what U.S. Sen. Jon Husted has raised in eight months. Husted’s campaign reports he has raised about $4 million since January.
“When we’re looking at margins that are as narrow as they are in both the House and the Senate in D.C., the parties are going to target the races where they have the greatest likelihood of winning,” Ohio Republican Party leader and strategist Tony Schroeder said.
And this is just the beginning, he said.
“We understand what this race is going to take,” Schroeder said. “So does Sen. Husted.”
What every candidate needs is cash and publicity.
Political ad tracking firm AdImpact gave us data showing that 2024’s Ohio Senate race is the most expensive non-presidential race they have ever analyzed.
Across the board, about $550 million was spent on ads.
The biggest donor for Moreno was the Republican political action committee (PAC) Senate Leadership Fund, which spent around $90 million on ads. This money was spent in the two months leading up to election day.
The next top spenders were conservative groups One Nation and Defend American Jobs, which each spent about $40 million.
For Brown, Democratic PAC WinSenate spent $100 million, which also saved the money for the remaining few months before the general election. Brown for Ohio Senate spent $66 million, and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spent nearly $50 million.
In total, Republicans outspent the Democrats by about $20 million.
But while President Donald Trump won Ohio last year by 11%, Brown fared better than Democrats nationally, still bested by Bernie Moreno by only four points.
Republicans say they will make sure this race isn’t as close.
“It’s going to be blanketing the airwaves, and you’re going to see, I think, some very intense campaigning,” Schroeder said.
Already, the National Republican Senatorial Committee released an ad calling Brown a “sellout.”
Asked about whether it will be the highest-spending U.S. Senate race in the country, Pepper said he thinks so.
“Absolutely, absolutely,” Pepper said. “This could very well be the tipping point of the U.S. Senate.”
So if you’re tired of the ads already — brace yourself. We still have a primary to get through, and it’s 14 months to Election Day 2026.

(Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/ Maine Morning Star)Portland voters will be asked on the November ballot if they’d like to raise the city’s minimum wage to $19 an hour over the next three years.
On Monday evening, Portland City Council members and Mayor Mark Dion voted 5-4 to place the question, which would increase the minimum wage to $19 an hour by 2028, on the Nov. 4 ballot. The city’s minimum wage currently sits at $15.50 an hour. Under this proposal, it would jump to $16.75 per hour in 2026, $17.75 in 2027 and then $19 an hour in 2028. After that, the wage would keep pace with cost of living increases.
Dion voted against the proposal, arguing that minimum wage is a statewide issue that should be handled by the Legislature to ensure fair competition. The state minimum wage is currently $14.65 an hour.
If approved by voters, the text also includes language that would allow the city council to amend or repeal the ordinance at any time, as explained by the city’s attorney l present at the meeting Monday night.
Originally, the proposal sought to increase the minimum wage to $20 an hour by 2029, but that was amended to balance the concerns raised by the business community with the difficulty many people face trying to afford housing in the city. 
“Lage national chains can absorb this cost, but the small businesses and nonprofits that are truly the backbone of our economy, that make Portland vibrant and that provide jobs and economic stability so many depend on they can not absorb this cost,” said Quincy Hentzel, chief executive officer of the Portland Regional Chamber of Commerce, referring to the original $20 an hour proposal.  
The owner of a Portland-based child care center said families could expect a $50 per week increase if the initial proposal were to go into effect. 
“While our current ordinance is tied to inflation, the base wage is simply not liveable,” said Buddy Moore, a Portland resident who said he supported the 2020 referendum to raise the minimum wage but believes that inflation and the rapid increase in cost of living makes the update necessary.
“The referendum in front of you today is not superfluous. It is, in fact, a course correction,” Moore added.
In 2020, Portland voters approved a referendum question that raised the city’s minimum wage to $15 by 2024. That ordinance, which had an effective date in 2021, can’t be amended for five years except with another referendum. 
November’s ballot will also include two statewide referendum questions. One will ask voters about a multitude of election law changes including the requirement to show photo identification at the polls. 
The second question will ask voters if they would like to implement a red flag law, officially called an Extreme Risk Protection Order, which would make it easier to temporarily confiscate one’s guns if they are deemed to be a threat by law enforcement or their family members.
There will also be a handful of municipal positions on Portland’s ballot including two at-large school board seats, an at-large city council seat, city council district three, the Portland Water District and three Peaks Island Council seats for island residents.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)The fruitless investigation into Lenexa City Council member Melanie Arroyo’s qualifications to serve as an elected official has mercifully ended after Lenexa police, acting on a tip from the Kansas Bureau of Investigation (which operates under the jurisdiction of the Attorney General), secured a copy of Arroyo’s naturalization certificate.
Arroyo, who was naturalized in 2018, was cleared of any alleged wrongdoing regarding her immigration status.
But to justify the investigation, the city claimed that Lenexa police “had no choice but to investigate the matter because it is the City’s obligation to ensure” that Arroyo was “legally qualified to hold the position.”
No harm, no foul? Not exactly. The public awaits satisfactory answers to at least two burning questions.
 
[subhead]Why did the KBI forward the tip to Lenexa police?[/subhead]
On July 8, 2025, a 74-year-old private citizen living in Lenexa left a voicemail for the KBI that mischaracterized legislative testimony Arroyo gave months earlier. As the KBI put it to Lenexa police, the tipster was concerned because Arroyo’s testimony advocated for “giv(ing) illegals more benefits” and allegedly “never acknowledged” whether she had become a naturalized citizen.
Opinion editor Clay Wirestone neatly unpacked the tip’s factual inaccuracies earlier this  month. But he wasn’t the first to do so. Lenexa police knew by July 23 that the tip was bogus, noting that after reading the testimony, “one would assume her immigration status was satisfied.”
It’s unclear whether anyone at the KBI read the testimony. Had the KBI spent the perfunctory amount of time it would have taken to verify Arroyo’s academic accomplishments, such as reading the testimony and calling the institutions at which Arroyo had studied, the agency would have learned that the tipster’s concerns did not amount to even reasonable suspicion that a crime had been committed.
Instead, on the grounds that the KBI does not typically investigate immigration-related matters, the agency forwarded the tip to local police to respond “however you deem appropriate.”
Immigration issues may well be out of the KBI’s wheelhouse. But on its website, the agency claims its mission includes “providing timely and accurate information to the criminal justice community.” Here, the agency either exercised discretion to forward an easily discredited tip or did so as a matter of course, letting the chips fall where they may.
Neither approach advances the agency’s stated mission to provide accurate information to its law enforcement partners.
 
[subhead]Why did Lenexa police investigate the tip?[/subhead]
Apparently, it made no difference to Lenexa police that the tip failed to clear any evidentiary threshold. To them, receipt of the tip meant a police investigation was required.
According to a police spokesperson, whenever police discover “any complaint brought to our attention about matters pertaining to Lenexa City Code,” the department must “carr(y) out (its) duty to investigate.”
And as Lenexa city attorney Sean McLaughlin told Kansas Reflector, “just because evidence doesn’t exist doesn’t mean we don’t investigate.”
To the surprise of probably no one, the department’s internal policies do not support the notion that police were mandatorily obligated to investigate the tip.
According to public records obtained by Kansas Reflector and others, police described the tip internally as a “complaint regarding the citizenship or naturalization status of a City of Lenexa council member” in violation of a city ordinance requiring office holders to be “qualified electors.”
But department policy is silent about how police are to handle a tip from the KBI about an alleged violation of city code. Further, that ordinance contains no criminal penalties, raising the question of whether a police investigation into allegations that did not amount to commission of a crime was ever necessary.
Even so, the department’s “Investigations Division” created an “Investigative Report” about an “offense” Arroyo was accused of committing, strongly suggesting that police were operating under the assumption that they were conducting a criminal investigation.
If so, they fell short of their own standards.
Under Policy Directive 600, which covers how Lenexa police handle an “initial investigation” into allegations of criminal activity, officers are to advance the case only if “information indicates a crime has occurred.”  Moreover, officers are not permitted to proceed until they have conducted at least a “cursory examination” of the allegations.
But department records lay out a timeline that shows an order of operations that does not square with city policy governing the “initial investigation.”
The police department received the tip from the KBI on July 16. Instead of conducting a “cursory examination,” Lenexa Police Chief Dawn Layman called Arroyo on July 18 to tell her an investigation was about to commence, and on July 21, police provided Arroyo’s identifying information to a federal Homeland Security Investigations agent.
It took two more days, until July 23, for police to review Arroyo’s testimony, even though doing so would seem to be an essential component of completing the “cursory investigation.” At that point, rather than discovering evidence that a “crime has occurred,” police “assumed” Arroyo had “satisfied” her obligations to hold office.
Still, despite no evidence showing even reasonable suspicion that Arroyo had committed a crime, the investigation continued through July 28, ending only once she turned over a copy of her naturalization certificate to police and officers verified that the name on her driver’s license matched the name on the naturalization certificate.
Through it all, Arroyo has held her head high, telling the Reflector that she understood why the investigation happened but also was disappointed that police were not “sensitive with how to handle immigration issues.”
It should go without saying that expecting law enforcement to conduct investigations fairly and without bias is a sentiment shared by the public at large. The public also expects police to follow their own rules.
Officials should keep these considerations in mind the next time they think about marshaling a police investigation in response to an uncorroborated tip rife with falsehoods.

The Make America Healthy Again movement has generated a lot of discussion about public health. But the language MAHA proponents use to describe health and disease has also raised concerns among the disability and chronic illness communities.
I’m a researcher studying the rhetoric of health and medicine – and, specifically, the rhetoric of risk. This means I analyze the language used by public officials, institutions, health care providers and other groups in discussing health risks to decode the underlying beliefs and assumptions that can affect both policy and public sentiment about health issues.
As a scholar of rhetoric and the mother of an autistic child, in the language of MAHA I hear a disregard for the humanity of people with disabilities and a shift from supporting them to blaming them for their needs.
Such language goes all the way up to the MAHA movement’s highest-level leader, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It is clearly evident in the report on children’s health published in May 2025 by the MAHA Commission, which was established by President Donald Trump and is led by Kennedy, as well as in the MAHA Commission’s follow-up draft recommendations, leaked on Aug. 15, 2025.
Like many people, I worry that the MAHA Commission’s rhetoric may signal a coming shift in how the federal government views the needs of people with disabilities – and its responsibilities for meeting them.
 Personal choice in health

One key concept for understanding the MAHA movement’s rhetoric, introduced by a prominent sociologist named Ulrich Beck, is what sociologists now call individualization of risk. Beck argued that modern societies and governments frame almost all health risks as being about personal choice and responsibility. That approach obscures how policies made by large institutions – such as governments, for example – constrain the choices that people are able to make.
In other words, governments and other institutions tend to focus on the choices that individuals make to intentionally deflect from their own responsibility for the other risk factors. The consequence, in many cases, is that the institution is off the hook for any responsibility for negative outcomes.
Beck, writing in 1986, pointed to nuclear plants in the Soviet Union as an example. People who lived near them reported health issues that they suspected were caused by radiation. But the government denied the existence of any evidence linking their woes to radiation exposure, implying that lifestyle choices were to blame. Some scholars have identified a similar dynamic in the U.S. today, where the government emphasizes personal responsibility while downplaying the effects of public policy on health outcomes.
 A shift in responsibility

Such a shift in responsibility is evident in how MAHA proponents, including Kennedy, discuss chronic illness and disabilities – in particular, autism.
In its May 2025 report on children’s health, the MAHA Commission describes the administration’s views on chronic diseases in children. The report notes that the increased prevalence in “obesity, diabetes, neurodevelopmental disorders, cancer, mental health, autoimmune disorders and allergies” are “preventable trends.” It also frames the “major drivers” of these trends as “the food children are eating, the chemicals they are exposed to, the medications they are taking, and various changes to their lifestyle and behavior, particularly those related to physical activity, sleep and the use of technology.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Notably, it makes no mention of systemic problems, such as limited access to nutritious food, poor air quality and lack of access to health care, despite strong evidence for the enormous contributions these factors make to children’s health. And regarding neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, it makes no mention of genetics, even though decades of research has found that genetics accounts for most of the risk of developing autism.
There’s nothing inherently wrong with studying the environmental factors that might contribute to autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders. In fact, many researchers believe that autism is caused by complex interactions between genes and environmental factors. But here’s where Beck’s concept of individualization becomes revealing: While the government is clearly not responsible for the genetic causes of chronic diseases, this narrow focus on lifestyle and environmental factors implies that autism can be prevented if these factors are altered or eliminated.
While this may sound like great news, there are a couple of problems. First, it’s simply not true. Second, the Trump administration and Kennedy have canceled tens of millions of dollars in research funding for autism – including on environmental causes – replacing it with an initiative with an unclear review process. This is an unusual move if the goal is to identify and mitigate environmental risk factors And finally, the government could use this claim to justify removing federally funded support systems that are essential for the well-being of autistic people and their families – and instead focus all its efforts on eliminating processed foods, toxins and vaccines.
People with autism and their families are already carrying a tremendous financial burden, even with the current sources of available support. Cuts to Medicaid and other funding could transfer the responsibility for therapies and other needs to individual families, leaving many of them to struggle with paying their medical bills. But it could also threaten the existence of an entire network of health care providers that people with disabilities rely on.
Even more worrisome is the implication that autism is a kind of damage caused by the environment rather than one of many normal variations in human neurological diversity – framing people with autism as a problem that society must solve.
 How language encodes value judgments

Such logic sets off alarm bells for anyone familiar with the history of eugenics, a movement that began with the idea of improving America by making its people healthier and quickly evolved to make judgments about who is and is not fit to participate in society.
Kennedy has espoused this view of autism throughout his career, even recently claiming that people with autism “will never pay taxes. They’ll never hold a job. They’ll never play baseball. They’ll never write a poem.”
Even if organic foods and a toxin-free household were the answer to reducing the prevalence of autism, the leaked MAHA Commission strategy report steers clear of recommending government regulation in industries such as food and agriculture, which would be needed to make these options affordable and widely available.
Instead, MAHA’s supposed interventions would remain lifestyle choices – and expensive ones, at that – left for individual families to make for themselves.
 Just asking questions

Kennedy and other MAHA proponents also employ another powerful rhetorical tactic: raising questions about topics that have already reached a scientific consensus. This tactic frames such questions as pursuits of truth, but their purpose is actually to create doubt. This tactic, too, is evident in the MAHA Commission’s reports.
This practice of “just asking questions” while ignoring already established answers is widely referred to as “sealioning.” The tactic, named for a notorious sea lion in an online comic called Wondermark, is considered a form of harassment. Like much of the rhetoric of the anti-vaccine movement, it
serves to undermine public trust in science and medicine. This is partly due to a widespread misunderstanding of scientific research  – for example, understanding that scientific disagreement does not necessarily indicate that science as a process is flawed.
MAHA rhetoric thus continues a troubling trend in the anti-vaccine movement of calling all of science and Western medicine into question in order to further a specific agenda, regardless of the risks to public health.
The MAHA Commission’s goals are almost universally appealing – healthier food, healthier kids and a healthier environment for all Americans. But analyzing what is implied, minimized or left out entirely can illuminate a much more complex political and social agenda.

A combination of Trump administration policies will make health care coverage more expensive for people who purchase plans from health insurance marketplaces — and rural residents will be hit the hardest, according to a new analysis.
Researchers from the Century Foundation say Trump administration policies — especially its refusal to ask Congress to extend Biden-era tax credits that are set to expire at the end of this year — will boost out-of-pocket premiums by 93% in the 32 states that allow the federal government to operate their Affordable Care Act insurance marketplaces. New rules and tariffs will have a smaller impact.
Rural county residents in those states will see an increase of 107%, while residents of urban counties will pay 89% more, according to the analysis by the Century Foundation, a left-leaning research nonprofit.
Insurers participating in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces are proposing a median premium increase of 18% for 2026 — the biggest jump since 2018 and 11 points more than the growth from 2024 to this year. That bump would come on top of the increase resulting from the expiration of the tax credits and the other policy changes.
About 2.8 million people who are enrolled in marketplace plans in the 32 states live in rural counties, including 776,000 adults between the ages of 55 to 64 and more than 223,000 children, according to the Century Foundation.
“Rural residents tend to be older. They may be more likely to have chronic illness at the same time,” said Jeanne Lambrew, director of health care reform at the foundation. “It costs more, both because they have somewhat greater needs and less access to health care.”

The researchers calculated that average annual premiums for rural residents will increase by $760 — 28% more than the expected average increase for urban residents. States where rural enrollees are expected to see the highest cost increases are Wyoming ($1,943), Alaska ($1,835), and Illinois ($1,700).
Many of the states with a large number of rural residents have chosen not to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, meaning many people who earn between 100% and 138% of the federal poverty level, between $15,650 and $21,597 for an individual, get their coverage from an insurance marketplace, Lambrew said.
Of the seven states where 10% or more of rural residents are enrolled in marketplace plans (Alabama, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Wyoming), only two — Nebraska and North Carolina — have expanded Medicaid.
State officials in Pennsylvania recently advised residents who use the marketplace that they should closely examine the plans that are available.
“This year, even more than previous years, Pennsylvanians should consider shopping around to find the best plans to meet their individual needs, at a price that makes sense for their current financial situation,” Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner Michael Humphreys said in a statement released at the beginning of this month.
Lambrew said the increases will force many people to forgo insurance altogether.
“It’s harmful for those individuals in terms of their own health and life expectancy. It’s harmful for our providers, because they’re now dealing with people who are sicker and in the wrong settings, and it’s kind of expensive for our society,” Lambrew said.
“We know health insurance matters, so having these large potential increases on uninsured Americans is distressing.”

Republican support for in vitro fertilization, after surging in the wake of a 2024 Alabama Supreme Court decision that threatened the procedure, may be splintering as President Donald Trump retreats from his IVF promises and more far-right voices gain ground.
Earlier this year, conservatives in the Tennessee House staged an eleventh-hour skirmish over an IVF protection bill introduced by two of their Republican colleagues. The bill eventually passed, becoming one of the first in the nation to explicitly protect access to IVF. But some lawmakers who voted for it have signaled their willingness to revisit the issue.
In Georgia, a Republican-sponsored bill to codify the right to IVF into law sailed through the legislature, even as fellow conservative lawmakers introduced their own anti-abortion bill that opponents warned would undermine the IVF protections in the new law.
In statehouses around the nation, IVF has emerged as a dividing line running through the Republican Party. Particularly in states where abortion is banned, lawmakers who unite under the “pro-life” banner disagree over whether the popular treatment gives life or destroys it.
People who believe embryos are children oppose IVF because it can involve the discarding of some embryos, which they say is akin to abortion.
“The popularity of IVF creates a dilemma for Republican politicians who have had anti-choice organizations as a key part of their constituency for their whole careers,” said Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.
After the Alabama Supreme Court ruled last year that embryos are people, fertility clinics around the state temporarily halted their services, sparking nationwide outrage.
Republicans and Democrats rushed to pledge their support for fertility treatments such as IVF and announce their plans to protect it.
Conservatives push to declare fetuses as people, with far-reaching consequences

On the campaign trail last year, Trump promised to make insurers cover IVF so that it would be free for patients. After taking office, he signed an executive order giving White House officials 90 days to assemble a list of policy recommendations on protecting IVF access and reducing costs.
In March, he called himself “the fertilization president.”
But a week later, his administration eliminated the team of experts at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention responsible for tracking IVF outcomes across the United States. The team had, among other things, operated a database allowing consumers to look up an individual fertility clinic’s success rates. Earlier this month, The Washington Post reported that the White House doesn’t plan to require insurers to cover IVF services, though administration officials told the newspaper that IVF access remains a priority.
Meanwhile, conservative groups that oppose abortion have begun pushing an obscure alternative treatment for infertility called “restorative reproductive medicine,” or RRM. Advocates have urged the White House and federal and state legislators to back RRM, which is based on the idea that the underlying causes of infertility can be treated through lifestyle changes and improving a person’s overall health.
Arkansas recently became the first to pass a pro-RRM law. Others might follow suit in upcoming legislative sessions.
Cole Muzio, founder and president of the Georgia conservative Christian nonprofit Frontline Policy Council, said he doesn’t expect to see legislators try to ban IVF outright, despite preemptive efforts by legislators in his state and others to protect it.
“Republicans are intrinsically pro-family, and the idea of supporting those who want to have a family is a conservative, noble, positive thing,” he said.
“At the same time, IVF discards an overwhelming number of human lives. We’ve got a lot of work to do to educate people.”
 IVF pushback grows louder

This spring, the Tennessee bill protecting IVF passed unanimously in the state Senate. But by the time it hit the House floor in April, many of its Republican supporters sat silently while a few of their GOP colleagues tried to derail it.
The bill’s sponsor, Republican state Rep. Iris Rudder, told the Tennessee Lookout that she hadn’t expected disagreement over the bill to “mushroom the way it did.”
It eventually passed. But 11 Tennessee House Republicans sent a letter to GOP Gov. Bill Lee urging him to veto it and calling it “a Trojan horse that could potentially undermine Tennessee’s strong and righteous stance on the protection of innocent human life.”
Lee signed it in April.
The following day, Tennessee Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson — who voted for the bill and said he supports IVF and contraceptives — told constituents during a legislative forum that he’d had “lots of conversations” about it and expects the legislature to revisit the issue again in the next session.
“I think we’ll be back next year to take another stab at it,” he said.
Potential threats to IVF push political novices into election-year advocacy

In Georgia, the state’s most powerful Republicans made a bill to codify the right to IVF a major priority this year. It was signed into law in May.
“Thanks to a lot of bipartisan support and hard work, Georgians who want to grow their families will never have to worry about whether or not they can access this vital treatment,” the bill’s sponsor, Republican state Rep. Lehman Franklin, posted to X after it passed through the legislature. Franklin and his wife conceived through IVF, a story he has shared publicly as he promoted the measure.
“At the end of the day, being pro-family means being pro-IVF,” he wrote.
Muzio, of the Frontline Policy Council, believes the IVF debate represents not so much a split in the Republican Party as it does a lack of education about what the treatment really means to people who believe human life begins as soon as an egg is fertilized.
“Hopefully you’ll see [legislation] put in place that either backs different fertility treatments that are more pro-life or guardrails put in place to restrict the discarding of human life for the purposes of IVF,” he said.
For conservatives who see IVF as akin to abortion, restorative reproductive medicine has emerged politically as an option for addressing infertility without explicitly supporting IVF, which remains overwhelmingly popular among Americans.
 Out of obscurity

RRM was a relatively obscure idea until anti-abortion groups such as The Heritage Foundation began elevating it over the past year as an alternative to IVF. With RRM, a practitioner might help patients analyze their diet, chart their menstrual cycle to look for conditions that can impact fertility, or treat reproductive disorders like endometriosis or thyroid dysfunction.
Supporters argue that a more holistic approach is a better way to treat infertility, and that RRM methods are much less expensive than IVF, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars.
But RRM has been criticized in mainstream medical circles. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists calls RRM a “nonmedical approach” and an “unproven concept” that can delay time to pregnancy and expose patients to needless and painful surgical interventions, such as procedures to treat polycystic ovarian syndrome. It says the approach overwhelmingly puts the onus on women, ignoring that infertility causes are just as common in men.
Some experts worry that patients spending months or years on RRM treatments will lose precious time when IVF could have helped them get pregnant.
And OB-GYNs warn RRM is closely tied to the anti-abortion “personhood” movement, which attempts to grant fertilized eggs the same legal status as people — potentially leading to a loss of rights for pregnant patients and more severe restrictions on birth control and other reproductive health care.










They put their considerable resources into asking, ‘How do we blunt the momentum IVF is getting without saying we’re opposed to IVF?’


– Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine


Tipton, of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, believes RRM is more “ideology” than medical practice.
“[RRM] got legs thanks to the work of really influential right-wing and anti-choice groups,” he said. “They put their considerable resources into asking, ‘How do we blunt the momentum IVF is getting without saying we’re opposed to IVF?’”
But as RRM gains mainstream attention, it’s also found supporters in the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement promoted by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Some consumers remain skeptical of the fertility industry, where some clinics have ties to private equity firms and other large corporations.
In March, Arkansas Republican state Rep. Alyssa Brown told fellow legislators that RRM “prioritizes women’s health over the profits of Big Pharma and Big Fertility.”
 First in the nation

Brown sponsored a first-of-its-kind bill in Arkansas — which passed in April and was signed into law — that requires state insurance companies to cover RRM treatments.
Brown promised during a hearing that it wouldn’t limit access to IVF. Arkansas was one of the earliest states, in 1991, to require insurance companies to cover IVF.
A similar bill with the same title, the RESTORE Act, was introduced in Congress again this year, after failing last year. It includes recommendations from The Heritage Foundation and the conservative, anti-abortion Ethics and Public Policy Center.
Arkansas’ new law also requires programs funded through Title X, which provides birth control and other reproductive care to low-income families, to use fertility awareness-based methods, mirroring a similar effort at the federal level. Under Kennedy, HHS has indicated plans to use Title X funding to open an “infertility training center.” Part of the center’s focus, according to its grant announcement, is to “educate on the root causes of infertility and the broad range of holistic infertility treatments” available to patients.
Meanwhile, state legislators around the country this year attempted to require health insurance to cover IVF, including in Montana, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia.
Nevada’s Democratic-controlled legislature passed a bill in June establishing the right to fertility treatments, including IVF, but it was swiftly vetoed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo.
In May, Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed a bill into law requiring a state insurance commission to consider coverage for procedures like IVF, a move that sets the stage for requiring health insurance companies to cover it. Before signing, Youngkin tried to insert a provision allowing private plans to opt out of coverage for religious or ethical beliefs, but the legislature rejected the change.
Although he signed the measure, Youngkin said his exemption idea needed to be taken up if the state eventually mandates coverage of fertility treatments.

Rob Clements of Elmwood speak about the state's first investments toward a $1 billion pledge to build an Education Future Fund. July 26, 2023. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)Concerns about the Nebraska Legislature’s commitment to public schools are again being raised. Currently, these issues revolve around the sustainability of the Education Future Fund.
The sustainability of the Education Future Fund is a red herring. The Legislature is not going to reduce funding for public schools. Wringing our hands over projected shortfalls two and three years out is futile.
During the eight years I was in the Legislature, future fiscal projections were frequently inaccurate by hundreds of millions of dollars. There is no evidence to support fears that the Legislature will pull back its commitment to pre-K-12 public education. Actually, the facts tell quite a different story.
During the 108th Legislature, the Legislature, along with Gov. Jim Pillen, greatly increased Nebraska public school funding. According to a Nebraska Examiner article from May 9, 2023, the increases is state aid “would represent Nebraska’s largest state investment in K-12 education since state aid to education was created in 1990.” The same Legislature created the Education Future Fund, improved programs for teacher recruitment and retention, reading proficiency and technology.
This additional state aid to public schools included $1,500 for every student in K-12 public schools and doubled reimbursements to 80% for school districts’ special education costs. Before these changes, the state only reimbursed school districts for about 42% of special education costs. This represents an annual increase of $328 million. And the new funding is in addition to the $1.6 billion the state provided before 2023.
To ensure the sustainability of the new public school funding, the 108th Legislature created the $1 billion “Education Future Fund.” This new fund is separate and in addition to the General Fund and Nebraska’s Cash Reserve Fund. It was the intent of the Legislature to appropriate an additional $250 million to the Education Future Fund in the following years, which the Legislature did in 2024 and in 2025. The current state budget contains this commitment going forward.
Nebraska’s Education Future Fund on track to depletion within five years

The 108th Legislature also funded several new programs to address teacher shortages and student needs. These programs allocated $250,000 for career readiness, $500,000 for student teachers, $2.5 million for extraordinary special education costs, $10 million for teacher recruitment and retention, $1 million for teacher apprenticeships, $3.8 million for Nebraska Department of Education Innovation Grants, $1.8 million for excellence in teaching grants, $5.3 million to increase career and technical education, $500,000 for dyslexia programs, $2 million for targeted reading instruction and $2.5 million for computer science and technology training. In addition, the Legislature appropriated $525,000 for critical response mapping and investments in school safety infrastructure.
According to the Nebraska Department of Education’s Annual Finance Report on school funding, the state contributed nearly $2 billion to Nebraska’s public schools in fiscal year 2023-2024. The state’s total contribution for FY 2024-2025 is not yet available but undoubtedly will be more than $2 billion.
Finally, during the 2024 special session, the Legislature, again with Pillen’s support, “front-loaded” a $750 million property tax credit that had been previously claimed as a credit toward income taxes owed. In other words, it sent $750 million directly to the schools for school property taxes to be reduced by an equal amount. With this addition, the state is contributing $2.75 billion to pre-K-12 public education. These increases represent a doubling of state aid over the past 10 years, the majority of which has happened in the last few years.
Considering the Legislature has doubled its commitment to public education, it is difficult to understand public schools’ concerns. Especially juxtaposed against the fact that schools taxing authority remained constant even though state aid has doubled. Schools can still levy up to $1.05 per $100 valuation for their general fund, an additional three cents for safety improvements, they can access 13% of their general fund for their building fund, and finally they can ask their constituents for a levy override — which some schools have done. They can also ask the public for bonding authority to improve infrastructure. In other words, public schools still have every taxing authority available that they had previously.
Ironically, there were state senators who suggested some of the schools’ taxing authority should be reduced considering the state’s significant new investments in public education. School leaders asked that the Legislature trust them, and the Legislature did. It is now time to realize trust is a two-way street.

(Screengrab courtesy US Wind)The Trump administration said Monday it plans to revoke the key federal permit issued to US Wind for wind farm proposed off the coast of Ocean City.
In a court filing Monday, the government said that the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management — which issued the critical construction and operations permit near the end of President Joe Biden’s (D) administration — is “in the process of reconsidering its prior approval” for the wind project.
The federal government is “intending to move no later than September 12 to remand and, separately, to vacate” the approval document,” read the court filing in the U.S. District Court of Maryland.
The government’s proposal to rescind the “construction and operations plan” permit it issued in December was filed jointly with Ocean City — which had sued the government last year in an attempt to block the wind farm. The reversal by the government left the project developer, US Wind, fighting to keep the previously approved permit in place.
In a statement Monday, US Wind Vice President of External Affairs Nancy Sopko said that the company still believes in the validity of its 2024 federal permit.
“Our construction and operations plan approval is the subject of ongoing litigation, but we remain confident that the federal permits we secured after a multi-year and rigorous public review process are legally sound,” Sopko’s statement said.
Trump EPA claws back $7 billion in solar funding already promised to states

Oceantic Network, a Baltimore nonprofit representing the offshore wind industry, echoed US Wind, arguing that the federal permit is valid, and that the project would be an economic boon to Maryland, thanks in part to a related steel facility planned for Baltimore County’s Sparrows Point.
“Once completed, the Maryland project and Sparrows Point Steel will enhance our national security and economic freedom by directly supporting steel mill investments and bring back important steel fabrication capabilities to America,” said Sam Salustro, Oceantic’s senior vice president for policy and market affairs, in a statement.
When the federal government gave a greenlight to Baltimore-based US Wind’s construction and operations plan in December, it marked a big victory in a permitting process about a decade in the making.
While the election of President Donald Trump (R) raised questions about the future of renewable energy projects, the US Wind project seemed more secure than others since it was federally permitted. Now, that crucial permit is officially in jeopardy.
It wouldn’t be the first time the Trump administration has intervened to slow construction on an offshore wind farm that had already received its federal permits. On Friday, the administration issued a “stop work” order to Revolution Wind in Rhode Island, which was 80% complete according to builder Ørsted.
Since receiving its federal approval, the US Wind project has continued to progress, receiving an air pollution permit from the Maryland Department of the Environment in June.
The project has a vocal critic in the town of Ocean City, which took to the courts to challenge both the federal permit and, most recently, the state permit. Town officials believe the farm would hamper tourism by impeding scenic beach views, harm local fishermen and injure local wildlife.
The proposed project would consist of up to 121 wind turbines about 10 nautical miles from shore, in addition to four offshore substations and one meteorological tower. The completed project would be able to generate 2,200 megawatts of energy, according to the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, enough to power up to 718,000 homes.

(Photo by Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)AMITE — Firefighters were close to extinguishing a fire Monday evening that’s been burning since Friday’s explosion at a petroleum products plant in Tangipahoa Parish. Emergency responders are now focused on containing and cleaning up materials believed to have spilled from the site.  
The fire at Smitty’s Supply in Roseland was roughly 98% contained as of about 4 p.m. Monday, said Bray Fisher, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s regional on-scene incident commander. After initially setting up an evacuation zone with a 1-mile radius, officials have allowed all but seven households directly adjacent to the plant site to return home. 
Students at Roseland Elementary School, a few hundred yards from Smitty’s Supply, will be able to return to campus Tuesday, officials said. 
There have been no injuries or deaths as a result of the explosion and fire.
Officials are awaiting lab results to confirm the chemicals and materials involved in the blast. Much of the surrounding area was covered in an oily mixture Friday afternoon when rainfall mixed with the plumes of smoke from Friday’s blaze. 
Gov. Jeff Landry, who traveled to Tangipahoa for Monday’s news conference, said there is no evidence the residue is harmful, but he recommended that residents refrain from cleaning their property until there are assurances there is no risk. Neighbors could take their vehicles to a carwash, he said.  
“If there wouldn’t have been a rain event, you probably wouldn’t have seen much,” the governor said.
Efforts to contain damage from the explosion are largely focused on the Tangipahoa River, which had a visible oil slick stretching several miles south to Independence and beyond. 
Residents in the Fletcher Isles neighborhood, near the river’s mouth in Ponchatoula, reported seeing oil where the river enters Lake Pontchartrain more than 40 miles downstream.

Tangipahoa Parish President Robby Miller said crews have deployed more than 5,900 feet of containment boom to recover contaminants from rivers, ponds and ditches. 
Among the many cleanup spots is Serenity Sands, a recreational site along the Tangipahoa River near Independence. Cleanup crews parked a vacuum truck on the bridge above the beach to drop containment material and recover a petroleum slick that had been flowing through the area since Friday.
Fisher said workers have so far recovered a total of 100,000 gallons of “material” and 10,000 gallons of firefighting foam.
The governor said officials are aware of reports of petroleum products entering open water.
“We are going to be here every step of the way until we get the site cleaned up and figure out a way to move forward,” Landry said.
Sam Paji, who owns a small gas station and convenience store along U.S. Highway 51 in Roseland, about 2 miles from Smitty’s, said chemical residue collected on his property, and one of his air conditioning units stopped working after Friday’s explosion. He has an inspector coming out this weekend to assess damages and determine the cause of the broken A/C unit. 
As of now, the biggest impact to his business has been the loss of revenue from officials shutting down the highway in that part of town. Paji said he was forced to close his store over the weekend and retreat to his home in Hammond.
“Obviously, we lost a lot of business,” he said.
Courtney Burdette, secretary of the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, said her agency and the EPA have continuously monitored the air near Smitty’s Supply for toxins. The results, which are posted to the agency’s website, have so far been within safe levels, she said.
The EPA and the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration are investigating the explosion, officials said. 
Smitty’s Supply has been previously cited for Clean Water Act violations for releasing contaminants into drainage areas, including oil, grease, fecal coliform and carbon compounds such as methane and ethanol. The company has been fined more than $161,000 since 2021, according to the EPA’s website. 
There is no indication that any of the past offenses are connected to last week’s explosion.
Asked about the company’s history of violations, Landry said emergency response efforts should take priority now, and the possibility of any additional infractions would be covered in the ongoing investigations. 
The governor also noted Smitty’s Supply is an “absolutely vital and important” company that creates products “that allow all of us to enjoy the quality of life not only in this country but in this world.” It employs some 400 workers, who Landry said are also impacted by the explosion.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A judge has ruled the Utah Legislature overstepped when it repealed and replaced a 2018 ballot initiative creating an independent redistricting commission and must now redraw its 2021 congressional map.
Third District Court Judge Dianna Gibson handed down the ruling Monday evening — a major development in a complex, yearslong court case that has major implications for the future of Utah’s federal political landscape. 
“Plaintiffs have proven, as a matter of law, that the Legislature unconstitutionally repealed Proposition 4, and enacted SB 200, in violation of the people’s fundamental right to reform redistricting in Utah and to prohibit partisan gerrymandering,” Gibson wrote in the ruling. 
The judge also enjoined the state’s 2021 congressional map and directed the Legislature to “design and enact a remedial congressional redistricting map in conformity” with the 2018 ballot initiative known as Better Boundaries and its mandatory independent requirements. 
The ruling — if allowed to stand — could force the Republican-controlled Utah Legislature to redraw maps for its congressional boundaries that it last set in 2021. Before those maps were adopted, one of Utah’s four U.S. House seats was competitive for Democrats. Today, Republicans consistently dominate all four.

However, that all depends on the final outcome of the case — which isn’t over. Attorneys for the Utah Legislature have indicated that if Gibson didn’t rule in their favor, they’d appeal to the Utah Supreme Court and possibly the U.S. Supreme Court.
Gibson’s ruling sides with the plaintiffs — which include the groups League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government and the Campaign Legal Center — in an anti-gerrymanding lawsuit that’s stretched on for more than two years over an issue that dates back even further. 
Now, with Gibson’s ruling, the court has reinstated the language of Proposition 4, the 2018 ballot initiative that requires redistricting maps to comply with a set of specific standards meant to prevent partisan gerrymandering.
In her ruling, however, Gibson proposed a timeline to govern additional court proceedings between now and Nov. 1, giving the Legislature 30 days to draw a new congressional map “that complies with the mandatory redistricting standards and requirements originally established under Proposition 4.”
“The Legislative Defendants are ordered to make their chosen remedial map available to Plaintiffs and the Court no later than 5:00 p.m. on September 24, 2025 or within 24 hours of enacting the new congressional map, whichever occurs earlier,” the judge wrote.
A redistricting arms race is unfolding. A looming court ruling may push Utah into the spotlight

She also said plaintiffs and other third parties “may also submit proposed remedial maps” to the court on Sept. 24 if the Legislature doesn’t enact a map that complies with Proposition 4 by its deadline or if the plaintiffs “contend that the remedial map fails to abide by and conform” to Proposition 4.
How did we get here?
In 2018, the anti-gerrymandering group Better Boundaries successfully pursued a ballot initiative known as Proposition 4 to create an independent redistricting commission that would have drawn proposed boundaries for Utah’s congressional, legislative, and state school board districts based on a set of standards that the Legislature would be required to consider. Voters narrowly approved that initiative, with 50.3% of the vote. 
However, in 2020, the Utah Legislature repealed and replaced Proposition 4 with SB200, a law that turned the independent redistricting commission into an advisory body that lawmakers could ultimately ignore. The next year, lawmakers did just that — ignored the independently-drawn maps and adopted their own, despite protests that the maps cracked Democratic strongholds in an otherwise staunchly conservative state. 
In 2022, the nonpartisan groups League of Women Voters of Utah and Mormon Women for Ethical Government sued, alleging the Utah Legislature violated Utahns’ constitutional right to alter and reform their government when lawmakers repealed and replaced Proposition 4. They also alleged the congressional map was an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander that favored Republicans. 
The case wound its way to the Utah Supreme Court, which last year on July 11 issued a groundbreaking ruling that prompted celebration from the plaintiffs and dismay from Utah’s Republican legislative leaders. 
Utah Supreme Court hands big win to plaintiffs in anti-gerrymandering lawsuit

That unanimous opinion reversed a previous decision issued by Gibson dismissing the claim that the Legislature overstepped when it repealed and replaced Prop 4. The Utah Supreme Court’s ruling made clear that lawmakers do not have unfettered power to repeal or change all types of ballot initiatives, and that if they make changes that “impair” a “government reform” initiative, they must show it’s “narrowly tailored to advance a compelling government interest.” 
The Supreme Court’s ruling sent the case back to Gibson’s courtroom to determine whether the Legislature met that “compelling government interest” standard to repeal and replace Prop 4. If not, the court would also need to decide a process to fix it. In January, Gibson heard more than three hours of oral arguments on the issue.
During that hearing, Tyler Green, an attorney representing the Utah Legislature, argued the Legislature repealed Proposition 4 with SB200 — the law that turned the independent redistricting commission into an advisory body — to address concerns that enacting Proposition 4 would have violated the Utah Constitution, which states the Legislature “shall divide the state into congressional, legislative and other districts.” 
Proposition 4’s independent commission created a constitutional conundrum, Green argued, because it would insert itself into the legislative process and “force” the Utah Legislature to act based on a new set of rules that strays from the Legislature’s regular legislative process. 
Will Utah get new congressional maps? Judge hears oral arguments in Utah redistricting case

“That’s the crux of the constitutional problem,” he argued. 
Aseem Mulji, an attorney for the Campaign Legal Center, which is also representing the plaintiffs in the case, argued there is “no dispute” that SB200 “impaired” Proposition 4. He also argued legislative attorneys have failed to show that their replacement of the ballot initiative was narrowly tailored enough to survive a constitutional challenge. 
Mulji also argued that just because lawmakers disagreed with the criteria required in Proposition 4, that doesn’t justify repealing and replacing the voter-approved law that harnessed the people’s constitutional right to alter and reform their government. 
“If they don’t like it, that’s not a good enough reason to impair a reform enacted by the people,” he said. 
The plaintiffs asked the judge to stop enforcement of SB200 and invalidate Utah’s current congressional maps ahead of the 2026 primary and general elections. They hoped that the court would in effect revive Proposition 4 and simultaneously invalidate the current congressional map while also allowing a process to proceed in 2026 to create a new map. 
Plaintiffs had encouraged the judge to make a decision sooner rather than later because a new congressional map would need to be drawn by November 2025, ahead of the 2026 election.

DemasThe University of Michigan’s statewide hospital network will stop providing medically necessary gender affirming health care service for minors, bowing to pressure from the administration of President Donald Trump.
The statewide hospital network received a subpoena as part of a criminal and civil investigation into gender-affirming care for minors, TPM reported.
“In light of that investigation, and given escalating external threats and risks, we will no longer provide gender affirming hormonal therapies and puberty blocker medications for minors,” University of Michigan Health said in a statement to TPM.
University of Michigan Health first received a subpoena from the Department of Justice in July, indicating that the DOJ was investigating doctors on suspicion of abusing their authority to prescribe medication, among other potential charges, the report says.
The FBI posted a tipline on X in June seeking the names of “any hospitals, clinics or practitioners” accused of “mutilating children under the guise of gender-affirming care.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Gender-affirming care – which can include things like hormone therapy and puberty blocker medication – is considered by many medical experts to be medically necessary and potentially life-saving for transgender youth.
“Transgender young people deserve healthcare that is informed by science, compassion, and respect. Gender-affirming care is backed by rigorous research, expert consensus, and patient-centered values. Studies consistently show its positive impact, including improved mental health and overall quality of life,” states the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH).
WPATH is an international organization of health professionals whose mission is to “promote evidence-based care, education, research, public policy, and respect in transgender health.”
They are joined by other major medical organizations in concluding that age-appropriate gender-affirming care is evidence-based and medically necessary, including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and the Endocrine Society.
University of Michigan Health said in its statement to TPM that they “recognize the gravity and impact of this decision” and are “working closely with all those impacted, and we will continuously support the well-being of our patients, their families and our teams.”
But that rings hollow for Equality Michigan Executive Director Erin Knott.
“Even in making this harmful decision, the University of Michigan appears to acknowledge the legitimacy and value of gender-affirming care,” Knott said. “Yet, it has chosen to retreat. This sends a chilling and damaging message to the very young people who most need affirmation, stability, and support.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_2684-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-25 21:57:09.420648

(Photo by Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Advocates launched a pair of ballot measures Monday for the 2026 election, one that aims to halve property taxes and the other to cap annual property valuation increases.
The petitions are the first of a handful being sought for 2026 by the new nonprofit “Advocates For All Nebraskans.” Leading the effort is former Nebraska Republican Party Chair Eric Underwood of Malcolm, State Board of Education member Kirk Penner of Aurora, former Nebraska State Patrol Superintendent Tom Nesbitt of Lincoln and former Lincoln talk radio host Doug Fitzgerald.

The first petition would amend state law and halve the percentage of a property’s valuation subject to property taxes after 2026 — for homes, from 100% to 50%, and for agricultural or horticultural land, from 75% to 37.5%.
A total of $5.3 billion in property taxes was assessed statewide in each of the past two years. A 50% reduction would mean a property tax savings of more than $2.6 billion. 
“This immediate property tax relief and others that are out there are literally one signature and then one vote in 2026 away from becoming reality for the people,” Underwood said at a Monday news conference launching the effort.
The second petition would amend the Nebraska Constitution to cap property valuation increases at the growth rate of Nebraska’s general fund tax receipts (as calculated at the end of each calendar year) or 3%, whichever is less.
The valuation cap would not apply when a property is built, sold or purchased.
Influence of valuations
Reducing property valuations does not mean property taxes will go down at the same rate, or at all.
There are more than 2,300 taxing subdivisions in the state, including 245 school districts, 93 counties, 528 municipalities, 408 fire districts and 327 townships. About 60% of property taxes pay for local schools, 17.2% for counties and 11.5% for municipalities.
The proposed ballot measures would offer no replacement revenue to cover immediate reductions in property valuations.


Qualifying for the ballot
Voter-led changes to state law require verified signatures from at least 7% of registered voters (about 90,000). Voter-led changes to the Nebraska Constitution require signatures from at least 10% of voters (about 126,000). 
Initiatives also need qualified signatures from at least 5% of registered voters in at least 38 of the state’s 93 counties.
Voter totals are calculated when petitions are due to the Nebraska Secretary of State’s Office.
Petitions seeking verification on the November 2026 ballot must be submitted in early July 2026.


Some local officials speaking with the Nebraska Examiner after Monday’s announcement said they were still reviewing the ballot language but noted a taxing entity at or below half of its tax-asking authority could theoretically make up the difference over time.
That would mean a school district at or below a 52.5-cent levy and counties or municipalities at or below 22.5-cent levies. The Legislature has capped how fast these three governments can increase property tax rates year over year.
School and local government officials have in the past worried that tight spending caps could hinder growth or hurt employee recruitment or retention, and some have noted local leaders are buying products facing inflationary pressures as taxpayers are.
Property tax rates can vary widely in the allowable range, such as for school districts. In the most recent year, Hyannis Public Schools and Humphrey Public Schools had mainline school levies of roughly 35 cents, while others were at or just below a $1.05 cap — public schools in Sidney, Plattsmouth, Medicine Valley, Gering or Walthill
Entities within the upper half of their tax-asking authority would absorb the reduced valuations and resulting decline in tax revenue, unless they have access to additional state funding or other sources of revenue.
In short, some Nebraskans would not receive a straight 50% reduction in property taxes.
It’s not yet clear how lower valuations might pair with changes to the state’s main funding formula for schools. A new state commission is looking at long-term fixes to that funding, with first recommendations to the Legislature due Dec. 1.
Leadership for the Nebraska State Education Association, Nebraska Association of County Officials and League of Nebraska Municipalities had no immediate comment Monday.
Underwood argued property tax savings from the ballot measure would be spent in local communities, which he said would energize and boost state and local sales or income tax revenue.
‘Rebalancing the funding structure’
Penner, who sat on the Aurora school board for 16 years before joining the State Board of Education in 2021, said he understands that property taxes play a balanced role in supporting schools. He said the ballot measures are “not about crippling local services. It’s about rebalancing the funding structure.”
  State Board of Education member Kirk Penner of Aurora. Aug. 25, 2025. (Photo by Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Over the next 18 months, Penner challenged local governments and taxing entities to prepare and engage with constituents to find new efficiencies and sustainable funding models. He said it could be a “new era” for transparency and direct public engagement.
“This is where elected representation should always be: a purposeful engagement of government to their constituents in a time and manner that truly listens to the voice and embraces the will of the people,” Penner said.
Underwood told the Examiner he understands the effort might seem a “forceful way” forward, but he asked at what point conversations would occur without the people as the “primary driver.” He said he also believes the effort could increase voter turnout in the 2026 midterm elections.
The group intends a “staged” release of petitions for 2026, Penner said, with the first two. He pledged another petition would “ensure our schools are properly funded while still moving them away from heavy reliance on property taxes.” He said the school funding mechanism is “broke” and has been for a while.

Underwood said subsequent petitions would prioritize local control and lead to a “historical rebalancing of schools” with a focus on caring for teachers and ensuring student education.
The group did not further detail or offer a timeline for when future petitions would be released.
Countering or pairing with EPIC Option
The Nebraska Constitution requires ballot measures to contain no more than a “single subject,” barring detailed but interconnected changes from appearing as a single item and requiring signatures to be gathered across multiple petitions, with each voted on separately.
However, juggling multiple petitions has proven challenging, as indicated in past years for medical cannabis advocates or the similarly tax-centered “EPIC Option.”
The “EPIC Option,” an acronym for the effort to eliminate property, income, inheritance and corporate taxes, is trying again for November 2026 with a “2.0” version that would take effect in 2028. Instead of two petitions to detail an alternative consumption tax, supporters landed this cycle on a single sentence. 
If the EPIC Option is successful, the Legislature would be left to devise alternative revenue.

Underwood told reporters Monday that his group’s effort no way counters EPIC and can be complementary or parallel.
“We don’t think there’s going to be confusion,” Underwood said.
However, former State Sen. Steve Erdman of Bayard, an EPIC creator and spokesperson, said while the Underwood-led effort might make Nebraska’s tax system better, it won’t fix the issue.
“There’s only one way to fix it, and that’s start over,” Erdman told the Examiner.
Erdman said he is worried about confusion because the more explaining his team had to do with EPIC, it hurt signature gathering in the past year, compared to now. He also expressed concern about whether the Legislature would carry out the intended 50% property tax reduction or whether capping valuations up to 3% would instead lock in unfair valuations.
State Sens. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha and Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County are continuing to look at legislative ways to tackle property valuations, including a cap as Underwood’s team proposed. 
The Andersen-Kauth effort did not advance past the Revenue Committee this spring, but the pair has not given up ahead of the 2026 legislative session, with hopes to reach the 2026 ballot, too.
‘Historic, lawful power’
Underwood, who led the Nebraska Republican Party between 2022 and 2025, and his fellow ballot sponsors said the Legislature has not listened to the public on property taxes, an argument Erdman has also championed.

Fitzgerald said he’s heard loud and clear from Nebraskans fed up with the state’s “property tax nightmare.”
Nesbitt said he appreciates the one-house Legislature, the only statehouse of its kind in the country. But he said that “over the years, I’ve watched an erosion of something fundamental: the will of the people taking a back seat to the machinery of government.”
“Our petitions aren’t radical by any means, or even partisan,” Nesbitt said. “They’re to return to a historic, lawful power of Nebraskans to legislate of, by and for the people.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s state-owned Pacific Spaceport Complex on Kodiak Island launched a secret U.S. Department of Defense missile last week during what observers believe was a hypersonic weapon being tested by the U.S. military.
The launch, which was not disclosed beforehand, took place about 10 p.m. Thursday night and was observed by people across the Kodiak Archipelago and was visible as far away as Seward.
Hypersonic missiles are those that can travel at least five times the speed of sound. 
While long-range ballistic missiles — produced since World War II — frequently exceed that threshold, they cannot typically maneuver to avoid defenses and are locked on a fixed trajectory.
Modern hypersonic missiles, under development by several countries, would be able to avoid anti-missile systems being deployed by the United States, Israel and other countries.
KMXT-FM public radio and the Kodiak Daily Mirror first reported the launch, which was preceded by warnings to navigators and road closures on Kodiak, home to Alaska’s state-owned spaceport. 
The spaceport is owned and operated by the Alaska Aerospace Corporation, a state-owned public corporation created in the late 1990s as part of legislative efforts to diversify Alaska’s economy. 
Officials issued a written statement the day after saying that “a successful government rocket launch” took place Thursday night and that it was the 35th launch from the Kodiak spaceport since its creation in 1998.
“The residents of Kodiak should be proud of yesterday’s achievement and the significant contribution their community provides to the space legacy of the United States,” the statement said in part.
The corporation did not state the purpose of the launch. 
Warning messages issued ahead of the launch are similar to those that observers saw in 2021, when the Department of Defense twice attempted and failed to launch a hypersonic missile from the Kodiak spaceport.
The corporation declined to answer questions asking about the launch on Monday. 
John Oberst, president and CEO of the corporation, said by email, “The Alaska Aerospace Corporation considers transparency with Alaskans a priority.  On occasion, there are some launches, like the one last week, that do not permit us this latitude. Thank you for your interest in our business.”
Research scientist Dr. Marco Langebroek, who tracks space launches from his home in the Netherlands, observed that the warnings to navigators match a planned three-stage missile test splashing down near the U.S. military’s rocket site at Kwajalein, Marshall Islands in the central Pacific Ocean.
Four years ago, the U.S. Army published documents indicating that it intended to test a hypersonic missile from Kodiak. The information in those documents matches the warning messages published ahead of last week’s flight.
In 2021, a prior test launch from Kodiak failed due to problems with the booster rocket intended to lift the hypersonic weapon to a high altitude.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0317-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-25 21:57:09.420648

(Photo by Mike Clark for the Daily Montanan)Public Service Commissioner Jennifer Fielder has called on Gov. Greg Gianforte to immediately suspend PSC President Brad Molnar, alleging Molnar is stymying an internal investigation into his conduct.
But Molnar has described the demand as “patently unlawful” and a calculated move to oust him as the PSC prepares to consider one of the largest proposed regulatory deals in Montana — a merger between NorthWestern Energy and South Dakota-based Black Hills Corp announced last week.
In Montana, the governor has the authority to suspend a commissioner if the commissioner fails to perform their duties, as described in state law.
In an email, a spokesperson for the Governor’s Office said the governor will review the complaint from Fielder and is committed to due process.
The call for Molnar’s temporary suspension for his alleged interference with the process — and his retort that the demand to the governor is “more about discouraging rigorous oversight of regulated utilities” — is the latest development in the investigation of “unprofessional conduct” by Molnar.

Molnar publicly announced the investigation last month and admitted he was probably guilty of inadvertently offending others at times as a “redneck wearing a white shirt.”
However, he also said he believed the charges didn’t merit the legal bill — potentially $10,000 to outside counsel. Additionally, he argued a resolution should have started with a meeting instead of a full blown investigation.
Monday, Commissioner Randy Pinocci raised a similar matter. He said Fielder should have brought her concerns to the full board and Molnar himself before calling on the governor.
He also said Molnar should have had the chance to voluntarily step aside as president first.
“He didn’t get that opportunity because Fielder did all that behind everybody’s back including the entire organization of the Public Service Commission,” Pinocci said. “That makes us look bad.”
In a letter dated August 20, Fielder told Gianforte it was her “unpleasant duty” to call on the governor for Molnar’s suspension on behalf of a “response team” investigating Molnar.
A PSC policy describes the “response team” as made up of the PSC president (in this case, vice president since Molnar is president and respondent) and three staff members — the executive director, chief legal counsel, and human resources officer.
Fielder, vice president of the all-Republican five-member PSC, said the response team has been “working to carefully address” the misconduct allegations, but Molnar has interfered.
“Commissioner Molnar has been using his high-level position in a multitude of ways to thwart the investigation and stop it from reaching its conclusion,” wrote Fielder, acting chairperson of the “response team.”
She said normally, agency management would suspend someone who tried to interfere with an investigation, but only the governor can suspend a member of the Public Service Commission.
Fielder also said Molnar has received “countless polite reminders” about workplace conduct, “a handful of stern rebukes” and two written warnings “reminding him that retaliation is unlawful,” but he is “averse” to following agency policies.
She outlined eight actions she described as part of a “hostile pattern of activity to derail the investigation,” including threats of retaliation — an allegation Molnar’s lawyer described as “inflammatory” —  and that Molnar held a press conference “to blow up publicity” on a confidential matter.
She also said he made public comments “that were dismissive, untruthful and retaliatory,” and that he demanded the investigation be terminated. (Fielder’s letter said retaliation details were “pending completion of investigation.”)
“Commissioner Molnar’s ongoing attempts to use his high-level position within the agency to stop an investigation of his own misconduct are reprehensible,” Fielder wrote.
(Molnar has previously said a title he uses for himself in jest is one example of the alleged misconduct — “El presidente de la grande mucho macho man Molnar commander of all the forces of the five districts.” He said he is accused of being insensitive to women in leadership, but he uses the title because because the PSC leader used to be called a chairperson, and he believes that’s the proper title.)
Fielder said his actions have driven up the cost of the investigation and created “serious liability risks” for the response team and the state of Montana.
In a letter to Gianforte on behalf of Molnar, however, lawyer Matthew Monforton not only said the governor should reject Fielder’s request, he chastised Gianforte for “publicly celebrating” the proposed NorthWestern merger the same day it was announced.
“The PSC’s job is to scrutinize whether or not the proposed merger will benefit not just the utility, its shareholders, your political allies, and Wall Street speculators, but Montana ratepayers, too,” Monforton wrote.
Molnar was on the PSC in 2007 and he voted against a proposal to sell NorthWestern to an Australian company, Babcock and Brown Infrastructure.
“History vindicated that judgment: Babcock and Brown collapsed into insolvency just two years later,” Monforton wrote.
He said Molnar is currently the only commissioner who has previously reviewed a NorthWestern buyout proposal and “ the only commissioner who remembers what rigorous regulatory oversight of such proposals looks like.”
Monforton argued the governor should reject Fielder’s complaint, and he believes Gianforte’s legal counsel has “undoubtedly” informed him of its “frivolousness.”
In an email, the communications director for the Governor’s Office said the office will review the complaint itself.
“The governor’s office is committed to an impartial review of any complaints made under MCA 69-1-113, and the review involves only the matters raised in the complaint,” said Communications Director Sean Southard.

MCA 69-1-113 states:
Removal or suspension of commissioner. If a commissioner fails to perform the commissioner’s duties as provided in this title, the commissioner may be removed from office as provided by 45-7-401. Upon complaint made and good cause shown, the governor may suspend any commissioner, and if, in the governor’s judgment the exigencies of the case require, the governor may appoint temporarily some competent person to perform the duties of the suspended commissioner during the period of the suspension.

The Public Service Commission director and legal counsel did not respond to questions, including about the procedure for suspension of a commissioner and status of the misconduct investigation, but said the PSC strives for fairness and accountability.
“Unfortunately, because this is a pending administrative matter, the agency cannot comment on this topic at this time,” said PSC Executive Director Alana Lake in an email.
Monforton, however, argued the governor should throw out Fielder’s complaint, both because it is “substantively deficient,” but also because she sent it “unilaterally and secretly,” violating the PSC’s policy manual and the state Constitution’s Right to Know.
In Montana, a public officer cannot be suspended or removed without first being apprised of the specific allegations against him, Monforton wrote. He said suspension or removal also requires “actual evidence of misconduct.”
But he said Fielder didn’t inform Molnar of any problems, nor did she provide evidence beyond her own conclusions.
“We learned of Commissioner Fielder’s complaint only after your General Counsel, Anita Milanovich, provided us with a copy,” Monforton wrote. “Commissioner Fielder’s systematic concealment of her actions violates both the letter and spirit of Montana’s constitutional commitment to transparent government.”
However, Southard said the Governor’s Office will respect due process in its review.
“The office is also committed to due process by issuing required notice and providing an opportunity to be heard as this process moves forward,” Southard said in an email.
In his response to the governor, Monforton said many of the allegations Fielder made against Molnar are over actions that constitute protected First Amendment activity, from taking a legal position about his duties to holding a press conference.
“He has every right to assert legal positions about his role and responsibilities,” the letter said. It also said he doesn’t need to stay quiet. “Commissioner Molnar is under no obligation to remain silent about the illegal and corrupt ‘investigation’ pending against him.”
The letter said Commissioner Fielder’s characterization that the purpose of Molnar’s press conference was to “blow up publicity” “betrays improper hostility toward protected speech rights.”
In a phone call, Commissioner Pinocci said the rest of the commissioners should have had a chance to weigh in on the letter Fielder sent — to add to or subtract from it or reject it altogether.
He said she should not have acted unilaterally.
“This is bizarre. It is unacceptable,” Pinocci said.
The PSC did not answer a question about the steps its response team took prior to sending the letter to the governor. The response team responds to and investigates internal complaints.
Pinocci, though, said he should have had the opportunity to confront Molnar himself, and the tact Fielder took runs contrary to any process he’s seen in 30 years in politics and on governing boards.
“She ought to be ashamed of herself,” Pinocci said.
He said the situation looks worse because her letter came within 24 hours of the announcement NorthWestern was seeking the multibillion dollar merger.
“I’m telling you, this just looks bad. You write that down. Commissioner Pinocci has got a responsibility, a duty, to his ratepayer,” Pinocci said.
But he said he suspects Fielder may have other motives.
“Maybe she just wants to be president so she can be the bigshot at the wheel,” he said.
In her request to the governor, however, Fielder said the demand is related to Molnar’s behavior and an interest in completing the investigation, not his regulatory stances.
She said people have the right to a workplace “free from harassment and discrimination,” and the response team needs time to resolve the misconduct allegations without interference from Molnar.
“As a result of Commissioner Molnar’s own actions, it has become abundantly clear that this is not possible with his presence in the workplace,” Fielder wrote.
“In no way is this recommendation based on Commissioner Molnar’s regulatory decisions, nor does it come in direct response to allegations (the response team) is currently assessing regarding workplace misconduct.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/230426-CapitolStockPhotos08-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-25 20:57:23.569613

Greg Gianforte receives a brief from fire officials at the Windy Rock fire near Drummond, Montana, on Monday, Aug. 25, 2025.GOLDCREEK — A giant, deeply detailed, map is currently tacked up in a barn just outside the small community of Goldcreek.
It shows the spread of the Windy Rock and Devil Mountain fires, and you can see smoke in the background. The barn is usually an event space, but right now it’s part of a large fire camp just off I-90. About 500 personnel were working the fire on Monday afternoon, and more are expected in the coming days, fire officials said.
Monday, the fire was listed at 3,368 acres and 0% contained.
Closer to the interstate, fire trucks fill up their tanks out of a nearby creek outside the fire camp. Trailers and trucks are parked around the camp and for sleeping, a number of tents.
While the tents are out in fields, the command structure — now Northwest Team 2, which handles large incidents — is busy setting up shop in another event space. The team took over for the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, although DNRC resources are still on the scene.
Maps and computers are everywhere, sectioned out into departments, such as finance. They were pretty much set up when Gov. Greg Gianforte visited the incident on Monday afternoon.
The governor talked with fire officials about the spread of the fire, as well as where structures were and what the plan of attack for the fire was.
Montana has had about 1,800 wildland fire incidents this year, but there’s been a silver lining. The state had roughly the same number of fires at this point last year, but they burned about 150,000 acres. It’s been just about 50,000 to date this year, Gianforte said.
“We’ve burned only 1/3 of the acres,” Gianforte told the Daily Montanan. “And I really attribute that to two things. One, we had a bunch of precipitation in July, which was a godsend. Two, the tremendous work by our firefighters. We’ve pursued a policy of aggressive attack on all fires, as long as we don’t put wildland firefighters’ health and safety at risk.”
The 2025 fire season in Montana has gone in ebbs and flows. The state dealt with a spate of fires in May and June that fire crews noted, at the time, were early. Much of the state saw precipitation in July, but dry conditions over the past two weeks have heightened fire worries.
Lighting has caused several fires, including the Windy Rock fire. It’s burning mostly in timber, though there are some clearings and scree which firefighters have been able to use to strengthen fire lines.
Fire officials told Gianforte that some bulldozer lines have been on private ranch land, and that the conversations have been productive as crews continue to try to contain the blaze. Much of the initial attack on the fire was done by the state’s Type-3 Incident Command Team, which they call the DNRC “County Assist Team.” That team has been around for about 40 years and has been commanded by David Hamilton since 2014.
The handover happened on Monday morning. The fire is technically being managed by the DNRC, Bureau of Land Management and Northwest Team 2.

“Everything that we do kind of leading it to that transition really is helping them determine what resources are on scene,” Hamilton said. “And helping them start to get their situational awareness about the fire, the resources, what has been working, what hasn’t been working, and really then just try to hand off a really nice product to them.”
Hamilton said the County Assist Team is usually called in when a fire outgrows what local services can handle. A number of similar teams are based in Montana, and they move around a lot. 
Hamilton said they put a few miles on their trucks over the fire season, which is maybe to be expected. They were outside of Billings when they got the call to head 15 miles northeast of Drummond.
“We were actually on a fire in eastern Montana that was pretty well in wrap-up mode,” Hamilton said on Saturday. “And the decision was made that this fire was a higher priority from a team standpoint. And so we turned around and drove all the way back across the state again.”
That’s sort of the life for the 20 to 30 people who get called into help the County Assist Team, who refer to themselves as “CAT.” There were about 50 on the Windy Rock fire before it got handed off to the larger team.
Terrain and topography have been an issue for fire crews, Hamilton said, as has fuel. It’s burning in a lot of lodgepole pine and alpine fir, and there’s a heavy “dead and downed” component. When firefighters say that, it means a couple things. 
First, heavy brush is hard to move through and does not lend itself to easy escape routes, which wildland firefighters need. Second, hazard trees called “snags” can be another issue for firefighters. Third, dead and downed trees also can burn differently, smouldering — sometimes for days on end, Hamilton said — before flaring up again. This can lead, especially in windy conditions, to new “spot” fires, or small fires outside of the main fire, which can be dangerous and complicated to tamp down.
“All of a sudden, it just kind of takes off,” Hamilton said. “And then once it takes off and it gets a little bit of heat built up in it and it then spreads from the spotting, it happens out of this particular fuel model, alpine fir.”
In an attempt to avoid dangers for hand crews, some areas may be turned over to heavy equipment. It’s safer, but does add time to containment efforts, Hamilton said.
Aerial resources have been used throughout the week, and some very large air tankers have been used on the fire. Some were even flying over as the governor spoke with fire officials on Monday.
“I would just say to folks, these firefighters are doing heroic work,” Gianforte said Monday. “They’re out in very hot conditions, protecting both the landscape, property and lives. Be careful when you’re out in the woods. It’s going to be hot and dry here for a few more weeks, we’re praying for rain, and hopefully that’ll give us an upper hand on these fires.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/WindyRock1-1024x741.jpg,,,2025-08-25 20:57:23.569613

(Julie O'Donoghue/Louisiana Illuminator)The Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services needs to better scrutinize the amount of money it pays to foster care vendors, especially transportation and “sitter” services, according to a recent state review. 

Louisiana Legislative Auditor Michael Waguespack released a report Monday that suggests the state agency overseeing adoption and foster care could be overpaying, in part because its online payment system doesn’t flag excessive charges or provide details about the service rendered. 
In a response to the audit, the child welfare agency said it is already working to improve its checks and balances, including an upgrade to its payment system to address the auditor’s concerns. Most of the improvements are expected to be in place by the end of November, Children and Family Services Secretary Rebecca Harris, who took over the agency in July, said in an Aug. 15 letter to the auditor. 

“DCFS remains committed to continuously evaluating ways to improve and streamline the process within the agency,” Harris wrote.

Over budget years 2021 through 2024, department payments through the child welfare agency’s online system increased far more than the number of clients served. Spending climbed 53% from $80.9 million to $124.1 million over the period, while the total number of people who received services increased 10% from 21,436 to 23,599.  

The department attributes these increases to rising day care and foster care costs and more demand for those services. The number of children in day care went from 1,528 to 2,784 per year over the review period, and the cost rose from $3.9 million to $12 million at the same time. 

The auditor believed costs could be better controlled in other areas, such as payments for “sitters” paid who watch children in child welfare custody. 

Children and Family Services policy sets the hourly rate for in-home sitters at a maximum of $28, but hospital sitters don’t have a maximum. The auditor found the agency paid some hospital sitters as much as $40 per hour – and sometimes paid two hospital sitters for the same client at the same time. 
The department also often paid for a hospital sitter when the service was being provided at an office or in a hotel room. Almost a third of the payments made for hospital sitters – $2.2 million in total – were paid out for client services that never involved a hospital stay. 

“Coding these payments as hospital sitters rather than in-home sitters could be a way to circumvent the maximum hourly rate set by the in-home sitter policy,” the audit report said. 
Children and Family Services also appeared to be paying more than its designated hourly rate for “restrictive staffing,” which is when one-on-one intervention is required for a child. The standard rate for this service is set at a maximum of $16 per hour. But out of 175 payments made for restrictive staffing during this audit review period, more than half may have exceeded the $16 per hour rate, according to the auditor. 
The auditor also flagged some payments for transportation services and said the agency should adopt more standard rates for travel. 
For example, the auditor questions a $2,100 payment made to a vendor for providing transportation for a child going from their home or the agency office to school and back. The charge was $60 each way for a little over two weeks. 

“While this payment went through the required approval process, there is no rate set in policy to ensure the rates are reasonable,” according to the audit. 

In some cases, Children and Family Services is also paying far higher reimbursement rates for transportation than Medicaid agrees to cover. In one example, the state agency’s compensation for a 2.5-mile trip within Monroe was $300, while the Medicare reimbursement would have ranged from $19 to $25, according to the auditor. 

The auditor suggested the agency could avoid overpayments by requiring higher-level staff members to approve payments made manually and outside of standard rates. Children and Family Services should also set more standard rates for services like “sitting” and transportation. 
“Because manual payments only require approval by a supervisor, this process creates a higher risk that payments are approved when they should not be,” according to the audit. 
The auditor also said more documentation backing up the reason for payments – such as the amount of hours the service was provided – is needed to ensure reasonable payments are made. 
In fiscal year 2024-25, about 56% of the child welfare department’s $327 million budget came from federal funding. The rest was provided by state funding or money the department generates itself.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200623_085452-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-25 20:57:23.569613

(Photo courtesy NM Senate Republicans)About a dozen New Mexico Republicans and one Democrat toured the state’s biggest immigration detention center Monday, where they spoke to officials running the facility that holds more than 850 detainees and saw conditions first-hand.
The roughly two-hour visit marked the culmination of several days of controversy and follows a July announcement from Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office that she’s mulling the inclusion in a forthcoming special session of legislation banning Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers in the state.
The tour, comprised mostly of Republican members of the Legislature’s Courts and Criminal Justice Committee, occurred at approximately 8 a.m. as the official CCJ meeting kicked off an hour away in Las Cruces. 
Cervantes had originally mentioned the possibility of a tour for the committee, but canceled it, he said, after  he received no response from ICE officials. State Sen. Crystal Brantley (R-Elephant Butte) subsequently emailed all committee members to tell them she’d used her contacts at the federal Department of Homeland Security to secure a visit to the facility. 
Brantley’s arrangement for a tour struck some Democrats as inappropriate and a political stunt, as state Republicans also issued an invitation to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to join the tour and posted an online poll about whether she was likely to do so (the governor did not attend). 
Emails provide new details on how NM lawmakers’ ICE lockup visit went off the rails

Senate Republicans, in a news release after the tour, touted the visit as “bipartisan,” even though only one Democrat, Rep. Andrea Romero of Santa Fe, attended. They said the tour proved that detainees are being housed humanely in a clean and safe environment, and that the facility’s closure would mean the loss of 300 well-paid jobs.
“Today’s tour was eye-opening,” Brantley said in the news release. “My biggest takeaway is this: This facility provides good jobs in Otero County and ensures detainees are treated humanely—far better than any alternative I’ve seen. ICE will do their job no matter what. Our choice is simple: a clean, safe, and accountable facility here, or one where we have no say in how detained migrants are treated.”
The tour did not include visits with detainees due to legal concerns, according to Otero County Attorney RB Nichols.
Sen. Nicholas Paul (R-Alamogordo) told Source that everything he saw on the tour Monday convinced him that closing the facilities should not be a high priority for the governor during a special session or otherwise. The Otero facility is safe and clean and treats detainees humanely, he said, with recreation facilities, a law library and a kitchen that can accommodate dietary restrictions.

Nichols told Source on Monday that the facility’s closure would mean lost jobs and gross receipts tax revenue, and would dissuade investors from buying municipal bonds in New Mexico, he said, given that the facility has at least $20 million in outstanding bonds.
“I think it was good for everyone to lay eyes on it and see for themselves what the situation is,” he said. “The facility’s clean; people going through it are provided with services, are provided with food and clothes, even dental care, mental health care. And there’s activities from a PlayStation 4 to, you know, exercise equipment, musical instruments, tablets and communication devices.”
The lone Democrat
But Romero, the lone Democratic representative, told Source that she came away from the tour deeply distressed about the rights of the people detained and feeling like she didn’t get the whole picture, saying that the jail operators had adequate advance notice to ensure the facility was clean and calm.

She saw no evidence that detainees are able to recreate, and noted that the equipment, like the Playstation Nichols and Paul mentioned, was locked up during the visit, and she saw hundreds of inmates “who just look absolutely in despair,” sitting or lying on their beds.
“People are confined to their beds, not speaking. It was eerily quiet across the facility,” she said. “I don’t know what the day-to-day really looks like. I don’t. But, certainly, a rosy picture painted, for sure.”
The majority of ICE detainees have no criminal history, according to data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. Romero said the operators they spoke with at Otero said that was also true in Otero, and the “vast majority” of the people held there had no prior criminal history or convictions. 
She repeatedly asked the detention center officials about the detainees’ due process rights and how quickly they’re being deported without adequate representation, she said. 
“Being the only Democrat on the tour, I’m the only one asking questions about all of this,” she said. “It became very lonely, trying to understand what was going on, and being the only one asking questions about constitutional rights, due process, contracts, etc.” 
Romero told Source she opted to go on the “unofficial” tour — Cervantes told committee members it was not officially sanctioned nor eligible for reimbursement — because she thought it might be her last chance to visit. She urged state and federal elected officials to seek access to the facilities. 
“Certainly the reality of the situation requires more oversight,” she said. “I hope that our state officials and federally elected officials get an opportunity to really see these places, because it shouldn’t just be one person trying to decipher what’s actually happening. We need to have a lot of transparency around people’s rights, around who we detain, and for what reason.”

Committee reconvenes
The competing CCJ events — one the Republican tour of the facility, the other meeting on campus — meant that the new president of New Mexico State University spoke to a group of just four or five lawmakers, which some members said was disrespectful to the leader of such a large New Mexico institution and one that was hosting them.
At the end of the committee hearing Monday, with Republicans and Democrats finally in attendance, Cervantes sought to explain his thinking on the canceled tour and the possible legislation, and to reconcile any lingering resentment among committee members.
He recounted working for months with Zach Cook, a former Republican lawmaker turned lobbyist for Otero County, who tried to arrange a visit with CCJ members. Cook assured him a visit was in the offing, Cervantes said, but as the day approached and Cook said he wasn’t hearing back from ICE, Cervantes said he decided it was best to cancel the visit. (Cook has not responded to Source’s requests for comment.)
“The person who I was relying upon to help me make this happen was telling me his phone calls were not being returned by ICE,” he said. He tried to work through other contacts, he said, including the Otero County Commission to “break the logjam” without success. 
When Brantley stepped in with her own tour, he said he felt obligated to keep the agenda intact, but that he “respects all of you” that chose to go on the tour instead of the meeting, and that he doesn’t think the whole matter is “much of a scandal.”
NM Gov declines GOP’s invite to visit ICE detention center

Brantley stressed to the committee that she and Cervantes are friends outside of the committee and also said she was disappointed that an email thread with the back-and-forth about the canceled tour was leaked to Source New Mexico. 
“I think the biggest concern isn’t really how the tour got scheduled, but why it got scheduled,” she said. “And that’s what the focus needs to remain on, is that as lawmakers, we’re going to be taking action on this very specific site and others.”
Committee Vice-Chair Rep. Christine Chandler (D-Los Alamos) said she remained disappointed that Brantley did not coordinate better to allow the tour to include more people, including Democrats. Sen. Antoinette Sedillo Lopez (D-Albuquerque), said she’s worked to get into the ICE facilities for years, but she’s skeptical tours like the one Monday are of much use if the operators have prior notice and if the visitors can’t have candid conversation with detainees. 
“If you can’t talk in private with the residents and assure them that there won’t be any kind of repercussions for them for an honest conversation, then that is not an adequate tour,” she said.
Lawmakers will discuss the tour and implications of the potential closure of New Mexico ICE facilities again on Tuesday, when Otero County officials and Sedillo-Lopez will present to the committee a presentation called, “Enterprise of Housing Immigration “Detainees by Local Governments.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0038-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-25 20:57:23.569613

There was standing room only at the first meeting of the “Education Freedom” select committee, formed by House Speaker Jason White to weigh the pros and cons of implementing a robust school choice program in Mississippi, ahead of the upcoming legislative session. 
Advocates, lobbyists and top education officials, including State Superintendent Lance Evans, were in attendance.
School choice — or “education freedom,” as White and other proponents of the legislation call it — refers to a plethora of policies that, in varying degrees, either give money to families to spend on their child’s K-12 education however they’d like or allow families to move their children to different schools, regardless of their location or whether the schools are public or private. White has indicated repeatedly in recent months that it will be a key issue during the 2026 session.
Those skeptical of the policy, though, say that the state’s hard-fought academic wins hang in the balance. 
Rep. Rob Roberson of Starkville, who chairs the House Education Committee and the Education Freedom committee, opened the meeting by asking attendees not to get too “emotional” and stressed that “this isn’t about politics.”

But the only two speakers at the committee’s first meeting were officials appointed to top U.S. Department of Education positions by President Donald Trump — Lindsey Burke, Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and Programs at the U.S. Department of Education, and Laurie Todd-Smith, who currently leads the federal office that oversees head start and child care. She previously served as former Gov. Phil Bryant’s senior education and workforce policy advisor.
Mississippi’s decision to hold out on expanding school choice was emphasized by Burke, who said it was “time to think differently” about how the state delivers K-12 education, given the uptake of surrounding states.  
Burke pushed legislators to consider adopting a universal education savings account, or ESA, program, though White has conceded that option may not be popular enough to pass the Legislature.
A universal ESA program would allow parents to spend the money the state allocates toward educating their child on whatever educational expenses they’d like, whether that’s private school tuition, a tutor or another option. Nineteen states have some sort of ESA model in place, including Mississippi — where only students with disabilities currently qualify. 
Burke encouraged the adoption of that kind of program because of Mississippi’s rurality, for one. She said a slow adoption would encourage the growth of private schools and allow parents to choose other options if there wasn’t a nearby private school. 
A voucher program, on the other hand, is a sort of coupon that parents can spend on tuition at a private school of their choice, including faith-based schools.
Burke also gave a detailed explanation of the new federal tax credit program, a different sort of school choice model altogether. If Mississippi opts in, which is likely, the program will allow Mississippians to contribute up to $1,700 to an organization that awards scholarships to private school students starting in 2027 in exchange for a tax break of equal amount. 
Burke said expanding these types of programs would incentivize public schools to better serve students in order to avoid declining enrollment. But opponents of school choice say that public schools who struggle to meet the needs of their students are chronically under-resourced — any loss of funds would only exacerbate that problem. 
Mississippi has only fully funded its education formula — both the old version and the newer version established last year — four times since 2003, Democratic legislators noted at the meeting. 
Rep. Jeffrey Hulum III, a Democrat from Gulfport, said the state should wait to see how the new funding formula impacts education before “giving up public funds.” But Republican Rep. Jansen Owen of Poplarville, co-chair of the committee, argued the only way to extend the state’s education gains involves “continuous efforts and reforms to the system.”

If Mississippi’s academic gains are now a model for the country, some legislators wondered why they’d rock the boat by funneling money away from public schools. 
Rep. Kevin Felsher, a Republican from Biloxi, noted that only two Mississippi school districts are considered failing by the state education department. 
“We’re having really great results,” he said. “What do you say to public school advocates who would say, ‘Why do we need to come in and do this?’”
Burke responded that “even the best school is not the best school for everybody” and that “not failing” was a low bar for the state to hold itself to. 
There’s practically no evidence to show that low-income students, who Burke said the programs would be aimed toward, see improved test scores from attending private schools. Some legislators also noted that private schools have less oversight than public schools and have no requirement to admit a child. 
Todd-Smith, the other speaker, framed her comments on school choice around early education. The state’s early education model is already choice-based, she noted — parents can send their child to a pre-K program associated with a school or a child care center of their choosing. She encouraged legislators to expand the state’s existing early education infrastructure, especially child care, to give parents even more choices.
Owens, a proponent of school choice, said he didn’t hear anything in the meeting that swayed him, but the Trump administration’s support came through loud and clear. 
Republican Rep. Kent McCarty of Hattiesburg, vice chair of the House Education Committee, said after the meeting that he appreciated the discussion but wants to see more data that supports expanded school choice. 
“We’ve heard a lot about all of the academic gains we’ve seen in Mississippi,” he said. “I don’t think this is a silver bullet to extend those gains. 
“We’ve come too far to regress.”

Gov. Dan McKee and Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) leadership have cobbled together a new plan to help dig the public transit agency out of its multimillion-dollar deficit.
The new budget framework avoids the wide and deep cuts proposed in July to plug the agency’s $10 million budget deficit. It also arrives just three days before the RIPTA board meets to vote on service changes, which would go into effect Sept. 27 if approved. It’s the first meeting since its Aug. 7 meeting, when it tabled the original roster of cuts following a last-minute intervention by McKee.
“Overall, our new proposal stabilizes the Authority’s finances, modernizes operations, realigns service deliberately and sustainably, and protects core services — all without asking more of the taxpayer,” McKee and RIPTA CEO Christopher Durand wrote in their jointly-signed letter to the RIPTA board.
The letter was shared publicly late Monday afternoon. While a complete copy of the new plan was not immediately available, the letter does describe its general features. Among the strategies offered: 

Boosting advertising revenue and federal reimbursements by about $2.5 million a year.
Slashing $2.4 million in administrative costs, while avoiding driver layoffs — something bundled with the original proposal that drew fierce opposition, given RIPTA’s recent struggle to hire and retain drivers. 
Creating a multi-year fare adjustment plan, although no definite timeline is provided for these fare increases.
Fronting $3 million in federal funds through the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) program, then later backfilling the funds with a transfer from RIPTA’s capital budget, to help support the new plan.
Expanding workforce partnerships over time via the Wave to Work commuter program, which is used by employers like Omni Hotel and Miriam Hospital. Route adjustments to workplaces like Amazon, Electric Boat, and Rhode Island Football Club will also be enhanced. 

It also leaves the RIde Anywhere program for riders with disabilities untouched, and strives to preserve service for routes used by Community College of Rhode Island, University of Rhode Island, Providence high school students.
Unlike the original plan which reduced service on 58 of 67 routes statewide — a maneuver which included outright elimination of 17 routes — the new plan’s more targeted service reductions would primarily affect weekend and off-peak hours.
A newly updated page on RIPTA’s website also details the extent of the proposal’s tweaks to service and operations.
The new schematic for saving RIPTA drew mixed reactions, with the harshest rebukes coming again from riders.
“Instead of gutting RIPTA, it leaves it on life support,” said Amy Glidden, a bus rider and advocate who co-chairs the group RI Transit Riders, in a phone call Monday. “I don’t know if [McKee] just thought like, ‘Oh, if I just don’t cut the route then people think I’m the hero,’ but he’s still the villain in the story.”
Glidden called McKee’s latest effort at saving RIPTA “misleading,” and gave the example of cuts on Route 69, which primarily serves University of Rhode Island students. One of the transit network’s lower-performing routes, according to a recent efficiency study, the 69 bus would have been removed from service entirely under the original proposal. The new proposal is not much more user-friendly, Glidden argued, as it drops bus arrivals to every 90 minutes on weekdays. Weekend hours would be eliminated, and weekday service would end at 10:20 p.m., rather than after midnight.
“You get out of class and you wait an hour and a half in a Rhode Island winter for your bus,” Glidden said.

Glidden added that federal funds like those from CMAQ can only be used to expand operations, not cut them. Cutting from future capital funds to support current operations in the present is like “robbing Peter to pay Paul,” Glidden said, characterizing the move as an “accounting trick” that wouldn’t do much for the agency’s financial future or its solvency.
Glidden also disputed McKee’s argument that RIPTA fares have not risen in years. While the individual $2 fare has not moved, the costs of monthly passes have risen, and free transfers were also eliminated for customers paying cash.
“He wants to shrink RIPTA. I don’t know why he has such a vendetta against bus riders, but this is utterly devastating,” Glidden said.
The Save RIPTA coalition also released a statement generally critical of the new plan.
“After months of sustained advocacy and an avalanche of opposition from across the state, we are glad that Governor McKee is bringing RIPTA back from the brink by choosing a pathway to avert massive layoffs and cuts to entire routes that would devastate our transit system beyond repair,” Liza Burkin, president of the organization’s board, wrote in the statement. “While slightly better than the initial proposal, the Governor’s new budget deal still reduces frequency and weekend service on 46 of RIPTA’s routes, making the system less convenient and reliable overall.”
In a statement released about an hour after McKee’s announcement, Rhode Island House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi took a blasé stance on the news, reiterating that the General Assembly played its part in the RIPTA “crisis” by investing an additional $15 million in the current budget.   
“As the House scrutinizes this latest announcement, we will continue to work with advocates and hold the Administration and the RIPTA board accountable to develop a comprehensive plan that will create a better public transit model for Rhode Island,” Shekarchi wrote.
The Community College of Rhode Island was at least happy with the changes. The school tweeted that it was “grateful” to McKee and RIPTA for a “commitment to maintaining critical service routes that our students depend on.”

Plague, a fast-moving bacterial infection that can impact the lungs, blood or bodies’ lymphatic symptoms, is a risk throughout the Western U.S. Infections are classed by the affected parts of the body. The most common infection is bubonic plague in the lymph nodes. Other types include plague in the lungs, called pneumatic, or blood infections, called septicemic plague. Plague spreads by fleas infected with bacteria that circulate in rodent populations such as mice, rats, prairie dogs or rabbits. It is most often transmitted to people and other domestic animals through infected fleas, but also through direct contact with infected animals.
The man, who was hospitalized and later released, received antibiotic treatments for both bubonic and septicemic plagues.
The source of the plague remains unclear, health officials said, noting the man had camped in Rio Arriba County and may have been exposed there.
“People who live or spend time near wild rodent populations in rural areas of the state should be aware of the risk of plague that is present,” New Mexico State Public Health Veterinarian Erin Phipps told Source NM.
Since 1970, approximately half of the U.S. plague cases have occurred within New Mexico — 250 infections during that time period — according to data from the New Mexico Department of Health. The most recent infection was a fatal case, killing a Lincoln County man in 2024.

Human plague symptoms include a sudden fever, chills, headache or weakness, often accompanied by a painful swelling in the groin, armpit or neck. Plague symptoms in pet cats and dogs include lethargy, loss of appetite or a swelling under the jaw.
Phipps said plague prevention includes avoiding contact with sick or dead rodents or rabbits; clearing up debris to prevent rodent infestations; using insect repellent while outdoors; talking to veterinarians about flea control for pets; and removing pet food and water to prevent wildlife access.
Phipps urged New Mexicans to see a doctor if they experience a sudden or severe fever, saying that while antibiotics are most effective at the beginning of an infection.
“The challenge with plague often is starting that treatment quickly, because plague can progress and become very severe, very rapidly,” Phipps said.

(Courtesy of Kevin Woster)Sometimes a guy gets so desperate for a little balance in South Dakota politics he comes up with some delusional ideas.
Like my idea on how Billie Sutton could be governor.
Sutton, I might remind you, is a Democrat. And a Democrat hasn’t been elected governor in South Dakota since just this side of the Pleistocene era or, more specifically, 1974.
Don’t get me wrong, Sutton is a really good candidate, even with a D after his name. And the rancher, banker, former saddle-bronc rider and state senator from Burke came close to the governor’s chair in 2018, when he lost to Republican Kristi Noem by just three percentage points.

That’s a miraculously close statewide finish for a Democrat in South Dakota these days. And it’s likely Sutton would have beaten Noem without help from John Thune and his team and other Republicans in South Dakota.
But there were some GOP visitors from out of state who helped make the difference, including President Trump. He flew into Sioux Falls in early September of 2018 for a Noem fundraiser.
South Carolina Sen. Lindsay Graham also made a late-campaign stop for Noem in South Dakota. And so did Mike Pence.
With all that help, Noem pulled out the win.
Now, seven years later, I think we’re even more conservative than we were in 2018. More, well, Trumpish. And even less likely to elect a Democrat to any statewide office.
So, it would be a harder run for Sutton, if he were interested. And last time I talked to him, he wasn’t. But his name still comes up regularly, and wistfully, when Democrats and others hoping for a change in state leadership think about possibilities.
That’s how I ended up gleefully considering a path to the governor’s office for Sutton. And the idea all hinged on Toby Doeden.


Election 2026
News and commentary on statewide races and ballot questions.
Read the latest >


“If Toby Doeden won the Republican primary, Billie Sutton could beat Doeden in the general,” I said confidently over coffee with a couple of friends. I repeated it to another friend, a traditional South Dakota conservative, a week or so later.
“If Dusty Johnson wins the primary, Billie wouldn’t have a chance,” I said. “Larry Rhoden? Well, I think Billie would have a chance, but probably not win. But Doeden? Yeah, Billie would beat Doeden.”
I didn’t mention Jon Hansen, a Republican state lawmaker and lawyer from Dell Rapids who is in the race. I guess I think his chances of winning the primary are so slim (no offense, Jon) he didn’t figure into my speculation.
Rhoden, of course, is a credible Republican candidate who happens to be the governor now, having stepped up from his lieutenant governor’s spot when Noem left in January for the Trump administration. Rhoden hasn’t made his campaign official quite yet, but he will.
And as the weeks and months have passed, Rhoden has looked more and more gubernatorial.
Doeden is the wild card. The Aberdeen businessman with a history of fringe ideas has personal wealth to spend, and has already been spending it on TV ads and mailers that are professional, smartly tailored to highlight Trump and likely to be effective among Republican primary voters.
In a limited-turnout primary, a higher percent of GOP voters tend to lean to the right of where most South Dakota Republicans are, or used to be, at least.
Beyond that, Doeden has been managing to come off as reasonable, which has been a surprise to me. He slips sometimes, like when he called Dusty Johnson evil. Which was, well, crazy talk.
Johnson is a 48-year-old fourth-term congressman who previously served as chief of staff to Gov. Dennis Daugaard and before that was twice elected to the state Public Utilities Commission. A proven winner in six statewide elections, he’s running for governor now, of course, and he has a nice pile of campaign cash. I’d have to call him the favorite.
Republican candidate spends $187,000 on TV ads so far, a year before SD’s primary election

Oh, and he’s not evil, by the way. You can disagree with Johnson’s politics or rhetoric or how he votes, but it’s ludicrous in a mean-spirited sort of way to call him evil.
Yet Doeden told KELO TV reporter Dan Santella: “I’m light. I’m good. Dusty’s dark. Dusty’s evil. Those are going to be the two choices.”
If I’d been Santella, I might have asked: “Um, are you being serious right now?”
First, primary voters will almost certainly have more than two choices. Beyond that, a candidate who calls another candidate “evil” seems like a very beatable candidate, if not necessarily in a primary certainly in a general election.
At least that’s what I was thinking when I arrived at my Doeden-beats-Johnson, Sutton-beats-Doeden equation. But after feeling good for a few days, I remembered something. Someone, actually: Trump.
Doeden has been banging the pro-Trump drum loudly and pretty smartly since he started his campaign. And if Doeden were to beat Johnson, it’s obvious that Trump would endorse Doeden. He’s certainly not going to stand by and watch a Democrat win that seat. If needed, he’d likely show up here and campaign.
So much for my Sutton formula. The Trump formula is what matters, especially in the GOP primary but probably even in the general.
Trump got 61.53% of the general election vote in South Dakota in 2016 and 61.77% in 2020. Then he lied about the 2020 election results and inspired an attack on the nation’s Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Did that reduce his win percentage here in South Dakota in 2024? No, it went up to 63.43%.
That’s Trump. And that’s the powerful hold he has on his supporters.
So much for my delusional hopes for balance in our politics.

Lisa Murkowski voted for the Big Ugly Bill, she is an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump and one of very few moderate Republicans left in the Senate. Her departure from Washington would be devastating for the entire USA.
As a moderate Democrat I understand the anger and disappointment about her vote, but Alaskans need to put it in context. Republicans were ready to flip holdout libertarian Sen. Rand Paul by making more cuts to vital programs. Murkowski did score some modest wins for Alaska, but she recognized she couldn’t get any more, and continuing to say no would only result in further damage to Alaska and the country.
At 78, I have closely followed Alaska and national politics since high school, and I followed her actions since she was in the state Legislature, when she pushed through a tax on alcohol, despite strong opposition from many corners. When she was appointed to the U.S. Senate, I was skeptical like many, but when she appeared before my group of Alaska shellfish growers during her amazing write-in run for reelection to the U.S, Senate, I introduced her as Sen. Lisa M-U-R-K-O-W-S-K-I; my compatriots gave her a standing ovation.
While Murkowski doesn’t have the power of the purse that Sen. Ted Stevens had during his long career, she has been very influential in bringing federal dollars to Alaska. Reaching across the political aisle during the Biden administration, she brought home hundreds of million dollars for Alaska projects. Unfortunately, the Trump administration pulled back many of those projects.
As an Alaska Native descendant, I am particularly impressed by her attention to the plight of rural Alaskans. I have worked closely with Native groups from Ketchikan to the Aleutians to create new economic opportunities. Climate change has hit rural Alaska very hard.

Josh Shapiro speaks with reporters Monday, Aug. 25, 2025, about the overdue state budget. (Photo by Ian Karbal/Capital-Star)Eight weeks after the constitutionally mandated deadline for the legislature to pass the next state budget, Gov. Josh Shapiro says the gap between Democrats and Republicans is narrowing.
But it isn’t closed yet.
While Shapiro told reporters at a press conference Monday that he had a “particularly busy” weekend talking with leaders of the House Democratic and Senate Republican majorities, more work remains.
“There are real differences between the parties, and real tugs on the parties in different directions,” Shapiro said. “But we have proven an ability to do that because we have found common ground.”
It’s a message that’s been repeated over the last few months, and Shapiro largely declined to provide any new details on the issues still dividing Democrats, who have a majority in the state House, and Republicans, who control the Senate.
However, Shapiro accused some Republicans of “play[ing] politics” and stalling the budget.
“I think it’s unfortunate that some in this building seemingly want to play politics now just to slow this process now,” he said. “When they seek to slow this process down to hurt me politically, all it does is hurt the good people of Pennsylvania.”
The statement comes just over a week after Republican state Treasurer Stacy Garrity announced a bid to challenge Shapiro in the 2026 gubernatorial race.
Garrity is widely seen among Republican insiders as the strongest candidate to challenge Shapiro when he seeks reelection. In 2024, she won reelection by the widest vote margin of any candidate in a row office race.
Republican leaders in the statehouse, including Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana), Senate president Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland) and House Minority Leader Jesse Topper (R-Beford), endorsed Garrity on Monday, even as their colleague, Sen. Doug Mastriano (R-Franklin), teases a potential primary bid of his own. Mastriano won the Republican gubernatorial primary in 2022, but lost to Shapiro by almost 15% of the vote in the general election.
A spokesperson for Pittman did not respond to specific questions from the Capital-Star, including about Shapiro’s accusation. She referred instead to a social media post.
“Negotiations continue as we work to reach consensus on a final budget product that puts our commonwealth on a stable spending path for future years,” Pittman said.
Points of contention
As it stands, a particular point of contention between Democrats and Republicans has been how to fund the state’s mass transit authorities, which operate trains, buses and shared ride services in all 67 Pennsylvania counties.
On Sunday, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), which operates in the Philadelphia area, enacted a 20% service cut it called a direct result of legislative inaction.
Other transportation authorities, operating in urban, suburban and rural areas, say they may have to follow suit if additional funding isn’t made available to them.
Earlier this month, the divide between House Democrats and Senate Republicans over how to fund transit authorities spilled out into the open, with both chambers passing bills, but no agreement ultimately reached. Republicans in the Senate passed a stop-gap solution, which would see the state dip into the public transportation trust fund, which typically funds long-term capital and maintenance projects, to shore up transit authorities through 2026, and divert some of those funds for road and bridge repair.
Democrats in the House passed a standalone transit funding bill that would direct an additional 1.75% of the state’s sales tax revenue to transit authorities, a solution they say could support transit authorities for the next decade. It also included Republican-backed measures designed to ensure transit authorities are addressing issues like fare evasion and working to bring in additional private revenue. But the Senate rejected the plan, and the House rejected the Senate’s.
Shapiro, however, said he was open to diverting funds from the public transportation trust fund, as long as it’s paired with other recurring funding.
Asked whether Senate Republicans had any flexibility on their proposal, a spokesperson for Pittman referred again to his statement on the social media site, X.
“The Senate advanced a mass transit and transportation infrastructure bill earlier this month, which would have prevented any of SEPTA’s cuts,” Pittman wrote. “The use of excess money in the Public Transportation Trust Fund is a responsible approach to address transportation needs across PA right now, while respecting taxpayers and ensuring safety and accountability in transit operations.”
Another source of division between Senate Republicans and House Democrats is over how much new funding K-12 public schools should receive. 
Last year, lawmakers passed a budget that included roughly $1 billion in new funding for Pennsylvania’s public schools, following a Commonwealth Court ruling that found the funding gap between the state’s richest and poorest schools was unconstitutionally inequitable.
A bipartisan commission convened to recommend a solution proposed increasing education spending by $5.4 billion over seven years. The additional money is to be doled out through what’s called an adequacy formula taking into account factors like poverty levels and the number of students learning English as a second language in a given school district.
Last year, lawmakers agreed to include the adequacy formula in their budget, sending out roughly $500 million through it. While Democrats hope to double that amount this year, Senate Republicans want to keep that spending flat. Some have even called for modifying the formula altogether.
Earlier this month, Senate Appropriations Chair Scott Martin (R-Lancaster) told reporters “We need a much fairer system. It’s going to be changing because our demographics change.”
He cited declining kindergarten enrollment, and broader population changes around the commonwealth
PA Schools Work, a coalition of non-profits that advocate for public education, told the Capital-Star earlier this month, that failing to increase education funding would be a failure to meet schools’ needs. 
Dan Urevick-Ackelsberg, a senior attorney at the Public Interest Law Center, a coalition member and a leader of the lawsuit that led to the Commonwealth Court ruling, said in a statement following Martin’s comments,  “Senate Republicans’ budget proposal isn’t just inadequate – it amounts to a massive education cut that betrays Pennsylvania students and leaves them holding the bag.”
School districts across the commonwealth have said that, if no budget is passed in the next few months, some will have to cut services or forego purchases of classroom supplies and textbooks.
Counties across Pennsylvania are also scrambling to ensure that safety net services remain active without state funds that are held up until a budget is signed by Shapiro. Some contractors who are hired to run county-backed services like child welfare enforcement and senior citizen programs, have already had to dip into reserves or cut staff pay.
Zooming out further, Republicans and Democrats have been divided over a more fundamental issue: how much the state should plan to spend in the coming year. Democrats have advocated for dipping into the state’s reserve funding, pointing to a $3 billion surplus and the $7 billion rainy day fund.
Republicans, however, are aiming to close the state’s structural deficit, a result of the state planning to spend more out of its general fund than it takes in over the last several years.
In February, Shapiro unveiled a plan to spend $51.5 billion in the 2025-2026 fiscal year, roughly $4.5 billion more than his office projected the state would bring in.
In July, the Democratic-led House passed a budget bill that would have cut Shapiro’s proposal by $1 billion, though the measure has stalled in the Republican-controlled Senate.
To offset the deficit, Shapiro has proposed legalizing and taxing recreational marijuana, and placing a tax on so-called skill games, slot machine-like devices that have popped up in bars and corner stores across Pennsylvania.
While Republican leaders have previously rejected legalizing recreational cannabis this year, and disagreements remain in the caucus over how to regulate skill games, Shapiro said Monday, “I’m not going to concede on any of those fronts … I think we’ll be able to pass a fiscally responsible budget that cuts taxes and makes significant investments.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_5757-scaled-e1756161858631-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-08-25 19:57:48.161195

(Photo by Maciej Toporowicz/Getty Images)Utah was awarded $100 million in funds that could help working-class families lower their utility bills and breathe cleaner air, but the Utah Office of Energy Development is dragging its feet. The rebates could offer Utah families between $2,000 and $4,000 per household, and up to $400,000 for multifamily buildings, to support energy efficiency retrofits in homes.
My name is Autumn Featherstone. I am a 19-year-old student at the University of Utah studying environmental and sustainability studies, and I’m currently an intern for the Sierra Club Utah Chapter. I’ve lived in Utah my whole life. I grew up spending time with my family exploring our beautiful mountains and landscapes. I love it here, and I want to be able to stay and raise a family someday.
But concerns about our air quality make me hesitant.
According to the American Heart Association, between 1,000 and 2,000 Utahns die prematurely every year due to air pollution. This is not the world we have to live in. We know the technologies that can help us reduce pollution in all sectors of our daily lives. We need the Office of Energy Development to do its job and use the $100 million it has received from the federal government to fund clean air solutions.
In 2022, the federal government established the Home Energy Rebates program, allocating millions of dollars to states to assist families in reducing their utility bills by transitioning to clean, healthy, and energy-efficient homes. While 12 other states have begun implementing the funds, our Office of Energy Development continues to stall and delay progress. I’m calling on my state to be a leader and leverage funding that will provide tangible benefits to save Utahns money on energy bills and cut pollution in our homes.
This delay is leaving Utahns vulnerable to rising inflation and toxic air pollution. Home appliances, including gas stoves and fossil-fuel-powered water heaters, release pollutants that harm our lungs. Cleaner, more energy-efficient electric alternatives that the home energy rebates provide significantly decrease energy use and indoor air pollution. The Office of Energy Development estimates that with the home energy rebates, consumers will save up to $1 billion annually in energy costs. That’s a 100-fold benefit multiplier.
Oftentimes, these energy-efficient upgrades are only available to wealthier families who can afford them, while lower-class families are left breathing in pollution just from heating and cooking in their homes. For the Home Energy Rebates, this is not the case. The Department of Energy’s guidance requires states to allocate at least half of program funds to reach low-income households. They are relying on Utah Office of Energy Development to begin implementation.
I currently live at home with my mom and little sister. We use a gas-burning stove and a gas water heater. These appliances release harmful pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, fine particulate matter, and carbon dioxide. These pollutants disproportionately impact children, with nitrogen oxides being a known contributor to the development of asthma in children. With the Home Energy Rebates, we could afford to protect our lungs and upgrade to a cleaner electric stove, along with other cleaner electric appliances. These funds could be helping everyone. But only if Utah decides to act on them.
Throughout my internship, I have worked alongside a team of incredible staff and volunteers to try and defend this program, alongside many others, that have been at risk of being slashed by the federal government. After nearly six months of work, sending letters to Congress, delivering public comments, sharing information on social media, and talking with communities, the home energy rebates program funds are secured and are ready to be used.
It’s incredibly disheartening to see Utah choose to sit on these funds that could be helping families. If the Office of Energy Development begins implementing these funds, Utah families like mine can have a cleaner, healthier, and more affordable future.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-92302551-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-25 19:57:48.161195

Jim Pillen at a news conference to celebrate legislation for Guard recruitment and retention. Dec. 10, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen clarified that the Nebraska National Guard’s role in the use of the McCook Work Ethic Camp as a federal detention facility for migrants will be administrative and not law enforcement.
The governor answered questions about the role during a news conference on a separate topic Monday in Douglas County. He said the 20 troops participating at the McCook-based U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation will do DNA swabs, fingerprint detainees and similar work.
He said he asked the Guard for volunteers and said the 20 headed to McCook will “not be doing any arresting.” He said their work “will be administrative support for ICE.” He said the facility would come online for immigration use within 45 days.
“We feel really, really proud that we’re able to play a part in that, to make sure we’re safe,” Pillen said. “This is about safety, not immigration.”
Critics have described the state-run federal detention facilities as inhumane and said they are part of a national effort by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to get migrants swept up in stings to self-deport rather than fight their cases in court.
Pillen was asked about a Fox News report that said several states, including Nebraska, were about to send National Guard troops to help in immigration and in some cases policing roles in major cities. He said Nebraska’s help is in McCook.
Pillen said he and Nebraska Guard leaders had not discussed assisting the Trump administration in  a criminal justice capacity in Washington, D.C., Chicago or other targeted Democratic-led cities.
“We’re a state of 2 million people,” he said. “We’re out-kicking our coverage here, but we can’t do everything.”

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)At least a dozen offshore millwrights assigned to Wind Scylla were stranded at sea Monday, three days after the Trump administration ordered an immediate stop on Rhode Island’s first large-scale offshore wind project.
They are just some of an estimated 1,000 unionized workers whose jobs remained in limbo as Gov. Dan McKee, congressional delegates, labor leaders and union workers gathered at Revolution Wind’s regional logistics hub at Quonset Point in North Kingstown to demand the federal government reverse the abrupt stop work order. Under development for over seven years, the multibillion dollar offshore wind farm is 80% complete, with 506 of the total 704 megawatt system installed. 
“Stopping now — that’s like running a marathon and sitting down the moment you see the finish line ahead of you,” McKee told the crowd of reporters and advocates. “It makes no sense.”
Trump orders Revolution Wind developers to stop offshore project already 80% complete

“Our jobs, our energy, and our families will all be negatively impacted if this stoppage does not end — and it should end now,” McKee added.
Wind Scylla, an offshore wind farm installation vessel that can accommodate 130 people on board, is one of a number of vessels involved in the plan to install 65 turbines off Block Island’s coastline. Forty of the turbines have already been installed.
Roughly 12 millwrights are on board Wind Scylla on a four-week rotation to finish up building one of the wind turbines, the union’s president told Rhode Island Current
Andy Benedetto, president of Millwrights Local 1121 said in a phone interview that one of his union stewards alerted him of the stoppage at 6 a.m. Saturday frantically asking what the next steps were.
“Nobody really knows what to do,” Benedetto said. “This is kind of a historic decision.”
More than jobs are at stake. Revolution Wind was on track to be operational in the second half of 2026, powering more than 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut, according to a statement Friday by Ørsted, the project’s Danish co-development company. 
Delays could increase risks to the region’s grid reliability, according to a statement issued Monday by energy grid operator ISO New England. 
“As demand for electricity grows, New England must maintain and add to its energy infrastructure,” the nonprofit organization responsible for overseeing New England’s energy grid wrote.
ISO New England said recent heat waves have pushed electricity demand in New England to high levels, showing that the region needs all available power sources to meet demand and maintain reserves.
Another goal of Revolution Wind is to stabilize electricity prices. A recently released report commissioned by RENEW Northeast found that if Revolution Wind had been operational this past winter, New England consumers could have saved a combined $400 million in energy costs.

‘The president’s insecurity’
In issuing the work stoppage, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) said it was “seeking to address concerns related to the protection of national security interests.”
But U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, doesn’t buy the administration’s argument. He told reporters that the U.S. Department of Defense had already approved the project last year, under former President Joe Biden.
“It’s not about national security, it’s about the president’s insecurity,” Reed said. “Do you know what is a threat to our national security? Oil that is controlled by OPEC and foreign countries that have animosity toward us.”
McKee, who wore a turbine pin on his lapel, called the work stoppage an “attack on Rhode Islanders” that could undercut the state’s plans to bring down energy costs through cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels.










Nobody really knows what to do. This is kind of a historic decision. 


– Andy Benedetto, president of Millwrights Local 1121


“Rhode Island doesn’t have oil wells, it doesn’t have easy access to natural gas,” he said. “We’re the Ocean State and we want to make sure we use the full benefit that the ocean brings us.”
Rhode Island AFL-CIO President Patrick Crowley said the Trump administration’s decision threatens not only the state’s energy needs but also an industry that was born in the Ocean State.
“These are six-figure jobs with overtime,” he told reporters. “These are highly-skilled tradespeople.”
Tony Vaz, a union carpenter who has already done two stints to install cables for Revolution Wind in 2024, was gearing up for another six-week offshore shift as a rope access technician starting Thursday. Vaz, an East Providence resident, underwent training to work on offshore wind farms as a rope access technician in 2009.
“My bags were ready to go, now it’s uncertain,” he told reporters Monday.

In April, the Trump administration stopped work on Empire Wind, New York’s offshore wind project. But officials reversed course in May after Gov. Kathy Hochul struck a deal with the administration to allow a new natural gas pipeline to be built in her state.
Asked if the state could strike a similar deal for Revolution Wind, McKee was noncommittal, saying he’s still unsure what exactly the Trump administration is seeking.
“We have no sense of what the ask is, and that’s what is troubling, right?” McKee said.
McKee told reporters he intends to connect with U.S. Secretary of Interior Doug Burgum within the next 24 hours to get a better understanding of the work stoppage. Alyse Sharpe, an Interior spokesperson, declined to confirm when the meeting will be held.
“Out of respect for the significance and oftentimes confidentiality of these discussions, the Department does not have a statement to offer on private meetings,” Sharpe wrote in an email to Rhode Island Current.
U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse called the move a “deliberate blow” to Rhode Island to help Big Oil maintain its hold over the region’s energy grid.
“We’re just in the way of this president wanting to serve his fossil fuel donors,” Whitehouse said. “This is not on the merits, this is not legitimate.”










Stopping now — that’s like running a marathon and sitting down the moment you see the finish line ahead of you. It makes no sense.

But not everyone is upset by the stop work order issued by the Trump administration. 
A press conference is scheduled for 10 a.m Tuesday in Galilee, where the Newport law firm of Desautel Browning Law and Rhode Island fisheries advocates plan to support The decision to halt Revolution Wind, saying they believe the wind farm “poses unacceptable risks to coastal communities.”
Later in the day, Climate Action Rhode Island’s Yes to Wind campaign holds a 5:30 p.m. protest at Queen Anne Square in Newport to oppose the Trump administration’s stop work order for the nearly complete Revolution Wind offshore wind project. 
Vaz said he’s hopeful a solution will be reached soon in order to get back to work.
“That’s how we are going to build America,” he said.

Cozy had been in foster care longer than any other person in Arkansas’ foster system — until Monday morning, when Anna and Tim Dietrich of Little Rock adopted the nonverbal 19-year-old. He took his new family’s last name.
An atmosphere of joy dominated the small Pulaski County Circuit Court hearing room where his adoption was finalized. When Circuit Judge Tjuana Byrd Manning brought the hearing to a close, the celebration started. The lights dimmed, and court staff — Manning included — pulled out flashing, multi-colored lights as Justin Timberlake’s “Don’t Stop the Feeling” played over the courtroom’s speakers and the standing-room-only audience clapped and cheered.
For many, the celebration was warranted. Cozy entered foster care in October 2010, and has been available for adoption since October 2011, according to a Department of Human Services spokesperson. In all, Cozy spent nearly 15 years in Arkansas’ foster system.

Anna Dietrich said she and her husband had always been open to adopting, but had been waiting for the right person. Anna Dietrich has long worked within the state’s foster system as a logistics coordinator for Project Zero, an Arkansas nonprofit dedicated to placing every child in a loving, permanent home.
Cozy’s disabilities meant having a family “with understanding, patience, and love would be instrumental in supporting” him, according to his Project Zero Heart Gallery page. The Heart Gallery has profiles of adoptable children in Arkansas to help match them with adoptive families.
“To say yes to one was to say no to others,” Anna Dietrich said. “The Lord was going to have to make it clear who was ours. He’s just made it abundantly clear.”
Cozy is their first child.
The Dietrichs were clearly thrilled about the adoption. Anna could be seen beaming at her new son as he ate peanut butter crackers and communicated via hand signals with a companion in the front row of the small gallery before the adoption hearing started.

Newly-confirmed Department of Human Services Secretary Janet Mann also attended and choked up after the hearing when congratulating the Dietrich family.
“This is what we all work for,” she said. “This is the inspirational example of how every child deserves a family.”
Not every foster child goes up for adoption. According to Tiffany Wright, the director of DHS’ Division of Child and Family Services, the vast majority that enter the foster system return to their families, but roughly 200 are currently waiting for adoptive families.
In fiscal year 2023, the most recent year with available data, over 36,000 children nationwide remained in foster care despite being available for adoption, according to the National Council for Adoption. Of the more than 184,000 children who exited the nation’s foster care systems that year, 27% were adopted.
“Youth who enter care often endure trauma or have medical conditions that make finding a family hard, but we will never give up. We work to identify an appropriate family that can provide for a child in the long term. That’s what happened in today’s case,” Wright said.
Cozy’s adoption was also significant due to who his adoptive parents were.
“Anna has championed and featured children in the Heart Gallery, and works hard to find adoptive families for them,” Wright  said. “There are countless children living happy lives with adoptive families across our state because of the work of Anna and Project Zero.”
Adopting a child isn’t as straightforward as filling out a form, Wright said. It’s a long process that involves home inspections, information sharing with interested families and transitional visits. Even when a suitable family is identified, adoptees also have to have lived with them for a certain period of time before the adoption can be finalized.
“You have to be in an adoptive home for six months, that’s typically the trigger that you can finalize the adoption,” Wright said.

(Ethan DeWitt | New Hampshire Bulletin)In the weeks before the high-profile murder of Marisol Fuentes-Huaracha in July, New Hampshire courts and police officers failed multiple opportunities to intervene, a new Judicial Branch review has concluded.
A court magistrate released Michael Gleason Jr., Fuentes-Huaracha’s husband, on $5,000 bail despite credible allegations by Fuentes-Huaracha that he posed a danger to her. A circuit court judge affirmed that bail decision. The court did not revisit its bail decision even as more information came to light about Gleason’s troubling pattern of behavior. And despite four separate orders requiring Gleason to relinquish his firearms, the Berlin Police Department failed to collect the weapons.
In the end, six weeks after Fuentes-Huaracha first approached local police alleging domestic violence by her husband, Gleason, free from preventative detention and with access to firearms, was able to fatally shoot Fuentes-Huaracha and himself at a restaurant in Berlin, shocking many in the state.
The case has prompted political rhetoric against magistrates and pleas for broader reform by domestic violence advocates. And on Monday, the Judicial Branch group tasked with reviewing the proceedings leading up to the murder suicide issued a series of sweeping recommendations of its own. 
Among them: train court staff and judges about what should count as dangerousness when making bail decisions in domestic violence cases; train police and attorneys how to better push for bail to be revoked in dangerous cases; improve how court systems share information about the potential dangerousness of a defendant; and improve the enforcement of firearm relinquishment orders.
“Based on its review, the Committee identified facts known or available at the time of the bail determinations that were indicators of Gleason’s dangerousness or of intimate partner violence,” the review states. “The Committee concludes that sufficient evidence existed to hold Gleason in preventive detention.”
In a statement Monday evening, Gov. Kelly Ayotte responded to the report by again calling for the resignation of the magistrate who issued the first bail order, Stephanie Johnson. Ayotte did not comment on the report’s recommendations.
“Marisol Fuentes’ murder was tragic and preventable, and the magistrate who made the decision to grant bail to her killer should resign,” Ayotte said. “While we cannot undo that horrific crime, we can and must do better in the future.”
A failure to collect firearms
In the Berlin case, Fuentes-Huaracha first approached police on April 25, the day she said Gleason had sexually assaulted her and seized her phone and $8,000. That day, a circuit court issued a protective order preventing Gleason from contacting Fuentes-Huaracha and ordering him to relinquish deadly weapons.
Gleason was arrested the next day and charged with felonious sexual assault, kidnapping, and theft. He was released on bail by Johnson the day after that, on the condition he avoid the marital home and, again, relinquish his weapons. The next day, April 28, a Berlin circuit court judge, Janet Jay Subers, upheld the bail order, denying a request by the prosecutor to overturn it and hold Gleason in jail ahead of the trial. 
In the weeks that passed, there were multiple court hearings, including those relating to the domestic violence protective order, the felony charges, and the ongoing divorce proceedings between Gleason and Fuentes-Huaracha. 
But despite clear orders in multiple cases, the Berlin Police Department showed no record that Gleason surrendered any weapons to officers who served the court orders that he do so. 
When she first approached police, Fuentes-Huaracha had testified that Gleason’s firearms and other weapons were “everywhere in the house (,) in the trucks (,) in the cabinets … literally in every part of the house,” according to the records.
And later, a week before the murder, a second person, a 17-year-old who also alleged Gleason had sexually assaulted them, testified that Gleason generally had access to guns and knives “wherever he’s staying.”
Yet on no visit did the police department appear to record that they retrieved any firearms, according to the Judicial Branch review of records. Instead, on the forms stating “Firearms and ammunition were relinquished,” the officers simply wrote “N/A,” and provided no further context.
Meanwhile, at no point after the April 28 arraignment did the prosecutor — a Berlin police officer acting as attorney — file an appeal of the circuit court’s bail decision or make a motion requesting that bail be revoked. 
Missed signs of dangerousness
The internal review committee, led by Judge Ellen Christo, the administrative judge of the circuit court, found that Johnson, the magistrate, and Subers, the judge, both had enough evidence of dangerousness to deny bail to Gleason in April. 
The committee cited the “violent and sexual nature of the charged offenses,” including that he had allegedly overpowered her by force, shoved her to the ground, and given her bruises. “Fuentes reported she was ‘petrified of what would happen to her’ and, although she went to work directly after the incident, she left soon after arriving because she was afraid,” the report states.
That and other factors, such as the weapons, Gleason’s theft of Fuentes-Huaracha’s phone, and other coercive actions, should have met the “clear and convincing” standard of dangerousness to others required to deny a defendant’s bail in New Hampshire, the review committee found.
New Hampshire’s bail laws are set to change in September in two ways significant to the Gleason case: The magistrate system will be repealed to require all bail decisions to be made by judges, and the standard for denying a person bail will drop significantly from “clear and convincing evidence” of dangerousness to “probable cause.”
In her statement Monday, Ayotte touted the law she signed that created those changes.
“Since I’ve been in office, I have said that the magistrate system should be eliminated, and once the bail law I signed takes effect next month, it will be. I was also proud to sign laws to protect victims and prevent future tragedies with the help of our new Domestic Violence Fatality Review Committee,” Ayotte said. “We will continue to work every day to protect victims and keep dangerous criminals behind bars.” 
In its list of recommended reforms Monday, the review committee said judges should be aware that the standard for denying bail in domestic abuse cases is lower than the standard for proving domestic abuse. 
The committee also said that prosecutors, victims’ advocates and police departments should be better trained to appeal adverse bail decisions in domestic violence cases where there is evidence of dangerousness.
They recommended that the forms filled out by officers serving protective orders and bail orders require a more clear “yes or no” answer as to whether the weapons were relinquished. And they urged police departments to request search warrants in cases in which a victim alleges the existence of firearms and the defendant fails to relinquish any. 
“Ultimately, legislative changes may be necessary to adequately address the issue of effective firearm relinquishment,” the report states.
The committee said the court system should consider steps to connect victims with legal counsel sooner; in Fuentes-Huaracha’s case, she did not have a lawyer for a month, despite having filed multiple protective orders and related forms. 
And the committee said courts should have better information-sharing systems to allow judges to make better decisions regarding bail conditions. The report noted existing technical barriers — currently, only docket entries about domestic violence protective orders are available electronically, not pleading and orders, and it stated the system is not likely to change soon.
Still, the committee suggested “other mechanisms” for sharing that information on domestic violence cases.
It did not elaborate on those mechanisms.

State Sen. Carolyn Bosn, a former Lancaster County prosecutor who steered parts of Legislative Bill 530 to passage, touted its tougher penalties for fentanyl poisoning and law enforcement access to sealed records on gun crimes by juveniles. 
“This bill prioritized … the tools those kiddos need,” Bosn said. “This package of bills was designed to improve community safety, public safety, improve communication, having the right hand and the left hand work together.”
But critics of the change allowing detention of kids as young as 11 years old for committing serious crimes say it will result in the months-long detainment of some teens with troubled pasts. Many of those kids might benefit from group-home placements, but few, if any, group homes are willing to accept them. 
Former State Sen. Justin Wayne, an Omaha lawyer who works cases in juvenile court and who led the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee until he was term-limited in January, says parts of LB 530 “make a system that’s already struggling to deliver services worse.”
  Douglas County Attorney Don Kleine speaks during a news conference about LB 530, including juvenile justice reforms. Aug. 25, 2025. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner.
“So what happens to a young man who is just sitting in DCYC [Douglas County Youth Center] for a year or more?” Wayne asked. “I mean, we don’t even have a trial. We have no type of thing that he can look forward to. Nobody’s asking what’s next.”
Pillen, Hanson and Kleine acknowledged the need to balance public safety with what’s best for teen offenders, young people who Pillen said were growing up in families that leave them with diminished hopes. 
“It’s much needed work to keep us safe, but it breaks my heart when we’re talking about kids,” Pillen said.
Hanson said state senators would need to focus attention soon on funding more secure group home placements for such teens, because the answer can’t just be keeping kids locked up.
“You are starting to see states that are implementing secure group home options, secure placement options for high-risk kids, so that they don’t continue in the cycle of committing worse and worse crimes,” Hanson said.
  State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln. Jan. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Kleine and Lancaster County Attorney Pat Condon made clear that they believe their teams need the more controversial tools in the new law, particularly when dealing with younger offenders committing violent crimes.
Kleine pointed to the Omaha-area death of an Uber driver last year that he said involved several teens, including one age 13 and another age 11. He said such younger teens needed to be treated more seriously by the system. 
Hanson and Kleine said the juvenile justice reforms the state has adopted in recent years are working for the vast majority of kids, but that the system was failing some of the most serious offenders. 
“There’s a lot of people that have ideas and try and tell us how we should do things that have never set foot in the juvenile court system,” Kleine said. “These senators listened. They listened to law enforcement, and we got this done.” 
Wayne said Pillen, Kleine and others pushing for the changes do not seem to care about adding to an already stressed system that now will have to try and safely keep pre-teens away from older youths. 
Asked how the state would protect pre-teens mixing in a juvenile justice detention setting, Pillen said, “No we’re not going to have an 11-year-old with a 17-year old. We’re going to have people in a system to get them back to a productive life.”
Said Wayne: “This is a short-sighted, politically driven bill that will only … cause more damage to a broken system. Nobody understands the scope of this problem until they’re in it. But they always want to play political games with the kids.”

The Green Mountain Care Board significantly reduced initial requests by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont and MVP for much larger increases.

File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
Vermont’s top health care regulator ordered health insurers selling plans on the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace to keep their premium price increases for next year much lower than the companies proposed in May 
On Friday, the Green Mountain Care Board released its final decision on the percentage increase that it would allow. The order impacts so-called Qualified Health Plans sold on Vermont Health Connect to both individuals and small groups. The regulatory board reviews proposed price increases for these plans annually.  
This year, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, which is one of only two insurers that sells plans on Vermont Health Connect, initially requested a 23.5% increase in rates for the individual insurance market and a 13.5% increase for its small group market plans. The care board ultimately approved a 9.6% and 4.4% increase, respectively. 
MVP Health Plan Inc., the other insurer selling plans on Vermont’s marketplace, initially requested a 6.2% increase for its individual market plans and an increase of 7.5% for its small group plans. Again, the care board approved rate increases that are far lower than those requested: 1.3% for individual plans and 2.5% for the small group plans.
The decision comes as Vermonters face higher insurance premiums than do residents of any other state and as Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont risks insolvency. 
The board-approved rates aim to balance keeping costs as low as possible for Vermonters, while also keeping the state’s largest insurer afloat, said Green Mountain Care Board chair Owen Foster during a Monday press briefing. 
“Blue Cross remains in a difficult position financially, but so too do Vermonters. The board’s responsibility is to balance those competing interests,” Foster said. “At the end of the day, we concluded that allowing these giant rate increases would be very detrimental to people’s ability to access care and that the status quo of double-digit rate increases was not acceptable.”
Whether these lower rates will be adequate to cover the cost of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont’s claims in 2026 remains to be seen, said Andrew Garland, a vice president and spokesperson for the insurer. That depends on the board’s review of hospital budgets — also done annually — and the subsequent price negotiations between hospitals and insurers, he added 
However, Garland remained optimistic: “A lot has changed since we filed these rates back in early May.” 
Namely, in June Gov. Phil Scott signed a new law that will cap how much certain hospitals can bill in 2026 for outpatient pharmaceutical drugs, like IVs or certain cancer treatments. Garland said Blue Cross Blue Shield expects that law to save its members “many millions of dollars.”

Additionally, Blue Cross Blue Shield plans to receive a larger risk-transfer payment from MVP than it had originally estimated, Garland said. To protect from insurers marketing plans only to healthy, low-cost patients, the Affordable Care Act stipulates that plans with lower-risk patients must redistribute funds to plans with higher-risk patients. For 2024, MVP had a larger portion of low-risk enrollees and thus will pay Blue Cross Blue Shield as part of this risk-transfer balance, which also helps mitigate some of the insurer’s concerns for the lower rate increases, he explained.
The regulatory board also sets how much each of the 14 hospitals it regulates can increase charges to insurers every year. Those hospitals were put on notice that their guideline for increases in prices for 2026 was just a 3% increase, though final decisions for each hospital are not expected until mid-September. 
At the same time, insurers are also bracing for a massive loss in marketplace customers due to the likely end of the Covid-19-era expanded federal insurance subsidies next year. Blue Cross Blue Shield estimates that 12.6% of its members on individual marketplace plans will drop their coverage. Those left on such plans, the insurer projects, will be the people who need and use it the most, meaning they expect an overall increase in costs. 
Board chair Foster added that Friday’s decision puts Vermont’s rate increases in line or lower than what many other states have approved or are expected to approve for next year’s marketplace premiums — about 15% on average. All across the country, individuals and insurers are likely to face this same loss of federal subsidies. 
MVP spokesperson Michelle Golden said Monday in an emailed statement that the board’s new rates “are a testament to collective efforts to responsibly manage costs while also ensuring access, high quality care, continued innovation, and overall community well-being.” 
During the Monday briefing, Foster said insurers often reported feeling powerless to negotiate with hospitals on fair rates. Recently the state’s Department of Financial Regulation weighed in to strengthen insurers’ stance in such negotiations, saying it will not approve any plans that do not protect the insurance companies’ solvency. 
Insurers can appeal the board’s decisions within 30 days, Foster said, though they have not confirmed any interest in doing so.

Article Summary

JB Pritzker and the state’s top Democrats condemned President Donald Trump’s threat to deploy the military in Chicago to fight crime.
The state’s leaders said Trump’s plan has similarities to authoritarian regimes.
Deploying troops to Chicago raises legal questions about the president’s authority.
Crime in Chicago has declined by 13% in 2025, according to the Chicago Police Department, and murders have declined by 51% since 2021.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story. 

CHICAGO — In front of gleaming skyscrapers along the Chicago River, Illinois’ Democratic leaders showed a united front Monday against President Donald Trump’s threats to deploy the military into Chicago’s streets to fight crime with one message: “Mr. President, do not come to Chicago.”
“You are neither wanted here nor needed here,” Gov. JB Pritzker said at a news conference. “Your remarks about this effort over the last several weeks have betrayed a continuing slip in your mental faculties and are not fit for the auspicious office that you occupy.”
The Washington Post reported Saturday that the Pentagon has been considering for weeks deploying the military to Chicago. The report came a day after Trump suggested Chicago will be the next city he sends the military to after he activated the National Guard and other federal law enforcement personnel in Washington, D.C., earlier this month.
Thousands of troops could be deployed in Chicago as soon as September, though two officials who spoke to the Post anonymously said the deployment is considered less likely for now.
“When I have some slob like Pritzker criticizing us before we even go there — I made the statement that next should be Chicago because Chicago is a killing field right now and they don’t acknowledge it and they say ‘we don’t need them, freedom, freedom, freedom, he’s a dictator. He’s a dictator.’ A lot of people are saying maybe we’d like a dictator,” Trump said Monday. “I don’t like a dictator. I’m not a dictator. I’m a man with great common sense and a smart person.”
The state’s leaders said they have not been contacted by the Trump administration asking whether the state wants policing help, and state leaders said they have not asked for help.
“If this were happening in any other country, we would have no trouble calling it what it is — a dangerous power grab,” Pritzker said.

The state’s top democrats said Trump is targeting Illinois for political reasons.
“This is an act of political theater by Donald Trump, and sadly, we have to take it extremely seriously,” said U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. “My friends, don’t walk away and say this is just another political issue. This is how democracies die.”
Anticipating Chicagoans will take to the streets to protest if the military arrives, Pritzker encouraged protestors to be peaceful.
“Remember that the members of the military and the National Guard who will be asked to walk these streets are, for the most part, here unwillingly, and remember that they can be court martialed, and their lives ruined if they resist deployment,” Pritzker said.
Legal questions
Trump’s move faces significant legal questions, and Illinois leaders promised to file lawsuits to block the mobilization of the military.
The president and Congress have more powers over Washington, D.C., because of its status as a federal district and not a state, but it’s unclear what legal authority the president is considering applying to send troops to Chicago.
The National Guard is under the control of the governor, though the president has the power to federalize it to quell a rebellion or “unable with the regular forces” to enforce laws. The president can also invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy troops to serve as law enforcement.

Those criteria haven’t been met, Attorney General Kwame Raoul said.
Trump’s decision earlier this year to deploy the California National Guard to Los Angeles was challenged and has so far been upheld by a federal appeals court. California argued in that case that the Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the military from acting as a domestic police force. The National Guard was sent to L.A. following protests over Trump’s immigration policies.
“This is exactly the type of overreach that our country’s founders warned against and it’s the reason that they established a federal system with a separation of powers built on checks and balances,” Pritzker said. “What President Trump is doing is unprecedented and unwarranted. It is illegal, it is unconstitutional, it is unamerican.”
Raoul noted his office has long had effective crime-fighting partnerships with federal agencies.
“I’m not and have never been opposed to collaborative help from well-trained federal law enforcement agents. Were the president serious about addressing crime or criminal threats in Chicago, he would dedicate more resources to collaborative work that we already engage in with these federal agencies,” Raoul said.
Crime data
Overall crime in Chicago has declined by 13% this year, according to data from the Chicago Police Department. Nearly every category of crime has decreased this year, including murders — down 31%. Chicago has seen 256 murders through Aug. 17 this year, compared to 370 over the same timeframe in 2024. Shooting incidents broadly are down 36%.
Crime in Chicago has trended downward since 2023 and is down 15% overall since then. Incidents of crime are still 40% higher at this point of 2025 than in 2021, though murder is down 50% since 2021 and shooting incidents are down 57%. Felony theft, misdemeanor theft and motor vehicle theft are all up significantly since 2021.
The city’s data portal shows crime has generally been trending down throughout the 21st century from nearly half a million crimes in 2001 to about that level in 2024. The number of annual crimes in the city has been relatively flat for about 10 years, however.
Nationally, Chicago ranked 92nd in violent crime per 100,000 people in 2024 among the nation’s 200 largest cities, according to FBI data. Memphis ranked first and Milwaukee and St. Louis were eighth and ninth, respectively, while Rockford ranked 19th. Chicago had the 22nd highest murder rate and was eighth in robbery.
“I know (Trump) doesn’t read, I know he doesn’t listen to very many people, but I know he watches television, and so perhaps if somebody from FOX News or from Newsmax is here, they’ll cover the fact that Chicago is in much better shape as a result of the work that we are doing to prevent crime,” Pritzker said.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson acknowledged the city must do more to reduce violence and said the Trump administration should release $800 million in violence prevention funding it has withheld this year and provide more funding for housing.
Also on Monday, Trump signed an executive order seeking to block federal funding to states and cities with cashless bail policies. Illinois eliminated cash bail in 2023 and Trump claimed jurisdictions with it have higher levels of crime. Early research of the first year without cash bail in Illinois did not show an increase in crime.

Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, is urging supporters and business leaders to push back against “messaging” from “legacy media” regarding the major tax and spending law passed by Congress in July.
Crapo spoke to a group of about 50 people Thursday morning in Boise at a breakfast held by Americans For Prosperity, or AFP, an advocacy organization founded by billionaires Charles and the late David Koch. The private event at a downtown hotel highlighted the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which is now a law and was supported by AFP through a $20 million campaign effort.
“Undeniably, AFP was the biggest ally we had in getting the One Big Beautiful Bill across the finish line,” Crapo said Thursday.
Crapo chairs the Senate Finance Committee, which, among its many areas of oversight, is charged with crafting tax policy. The Idaho senator played a key role in crafting the legislation.
He lauded AFP for going to the districts of lawmakers reluctant to vote for the bill.
“And it wasn’t because those House members and Senate members didn’t want to vote for the bill,” Crapo said, “it’s because their constituents were listening to the legacy media message about the bill and didn’t understand what it did, and AFP helped us there.”
Attendees included Idaho Gov. Brad Little, Superintendent of Public Instruction Debbie Critchfield, state House Majority Leader Jason Monks, R-Meridian, and Boise City Councilmember Luci Willits.
 Protestors call for open public meetings

Around 30 people protested the event outside, calling for public, free town halls instead. The protest was organized by the Idaho 50501 movement, which was also behind the No Kings Day protest in June, and Idaho Women in Action.
“Senator Crapo’s recent votes to restrict Medicaid and reduce funding for SNAP directly impact families across the state,” said in an Idaho 50501 press release. “Idaho 50501 and Idaho Women In Action believe these decisions should be discussed openly, with input from those most affected.”
Crapo had no public town halls scheduled as of Thursday, and a page on his office’s website with a calendar and map of town halls listed an August 2022 event as the most recent one.
Spokespeople for Idaho’s other members of Congress, Sen. Jim Risch and Rep. Mike Simpson, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on if they plan to hold town halls.
“As our townhall events, including tele-townhalls are organized and scheduled, we will update via our official office platforms, constituent emails, press releases and such,” a spokesperson for Idaho U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher said.
Crapo highlights laws’ deficit impact, tax cut extensions
The Idaho senator said Thursday he was “defensive” of the narrative he’s heard that the tax and spending bill — which among many things made cuts to Medicaid and food assistance, extended tax cuts passed in 2017, added temporary cuts to taxes on overtime pay and tips, and increased spending for immigration enforcement and border security.
An analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the total bill would raise the federal deficit by around $3 trillion in the next 10 years, FOX Business reported, and the law raised the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, which increases the legal limit on the amount the U.S. Treasury can borrow. 
Crapo countered that analysis, arguing that the office should have used the baseline revenue with the tax cuts enacted in 2017 that were set to expire this year. His office requested that CBO score the bill, using the current tax policy as a baseline; that request shows a $1.2 trillion deficit decrease over the next decade.
“That’s where we needed help from AFP to get our colleagues to agree to take this hit because they were attacked as a gimmick,” he said.” I don’t think most Idahoans think it’s a gimmick to say that the refusal to raise taxes is not increasing the deficit.”
He also said it wasn’t just wealthy Americans and businesses who benefited from the tax cuts, noting, “billionaires are paying the same taxes this year that they paid last year.”
A larger percentage of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was made permanent in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act go to the wealthiest Americans, according to analyses by the Tax Policy Center, Economic Policy Institute, and the Bipartisan Policy Center. On average, all income groups receive a tax benefit from the extension — or would have seen a tax increase had the cuts not been made permanent.
The bottom 20% of household incomes would likely see an average increase of .5% in after-tax income as a result of the extension of the child credit and larger standard deduction, according to the Tax Policy Center. The highest-income taxpayers would see net tax cuts of 2% of after-tax income for those in the top quintile.
The Council on Economic Advisors, an office under the office of the president, estimated that the average Idaho resident would see a raise in wages by $3,400 to $6,400 in the next four years as a result of the legislation.
 Another reconciliation bill may be coming 

Crapo underscored that while the massive law addressed many of President Donald Trump’s main priorities, it did not satisfy all of them. He said the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus also wanted to see larger spending reductions.
Of Trump’s “eight or nine” priorities, Crapo said, the law accomplished “three or four” of them.
As chairman of the Finance Committee, Crapo was present when Trump signed the bill into law in July. He said the president called him out as knowing “more about taxes than anybody,” but said he and Crapo didn’t always agree.
“That’s because he didn’t get all eight of his things, and he only got them for a number of years,” Crapo said with a laugh.
U.S. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, said he wanted another major bill to continue the work, Politico reported.
To pass the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, lawmakers used what’s called the reconciliation process. Through this process, lawmakers avoid the filibuster in the Senate and only need a simple majority of votes rather than 60. Reconciliation can only address tax policy and certain types of spending.
“So we are going to do another reconciliation bill,” Crapo said. “The politics of that one are going to be much, much more difficult because we don’t have the (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) engine driving it. And the pressure in that one will be spending reductions, and any kind of spending reform in Washington is an intense battle, so look for that and keep saying nice things about me when we start cutting more.”

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Lawmakers in Washington are divided on whether to dial back a state law critics blame for a sudden spike in deaths and serious injuries among children enmeshed in the state’s child welfare system.
Through June, at least 92 of these children had died or nearly died, the state’s Office of the Family and Children’s Ombuds reported last month. The figures only capture cases the state Department of Children, Youth and Families is aware of, including those not tied to child abuse or neglect
The initial sponsor of the 2021 law, known as the Keeping Families Together Act, stands by her measure, saying it’s not to blame for the jump. 
“We are all in a state of crisis trying to figure it out,” said Rep. Lillian Ortiz-Self, D-Mukilteo. “The reality is that this is a community problem that we all now have to face.”
The law raised the standard for separating children from their parents, and aimed to keep them with other family members if they needed to be removed from their parents’ homes due to abuse or neglect. The goal was to stop poverty from being used as a reason to take kids away from their parents, and to avoid inflicting the trauma of being separated from family. 
But Republican lawmakers believe the law is keeping children in unsafe environments. And some Democrats are also questioning whether it needs to be adjusted.
“Our state is going in the wrong direction,” said state Rep. Travis Couture, R-Allyn. “I know that foster care is not perfect, but to me, it’s much more preferable and safer than being dead.”
Meanwhile, to the dismay of Republicans, the state recently pulled support for a facility in Kent caring for drug-exposed babies.
The head of Washington’s child welfare agency says she’s learned “how blunt of an instrument policy is,” and that it can only go so far in addressing these complex cases.
“If we think that a child should be removed, we really need to prove it, and it shouldn’t be easy,” said Secretary Tana Senn, a former state lawmaker who co-sponsored the Keeping Families Together law. “I think that’s been an important change.”
But the chair of the House panel that tackles these issues, Rep. Steve Bergquist, said in an email that if the child fatality and injury statistics don’t improve by this winter, he’s made clear to officials that “there would be a need to revisit this policy next session.”
Bergquist, a Democrat from Renton, hopes to “come up with a bipartisan bill that will help improve supports for our youth and families that are caught up in these difficult situations.”
What that could look like is unclear at this point. 
House Democratic leaders, Speaker Laurie Jinkins and Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon, deferred to Ortiz-Self on how to proceed with the law.
What’s next?
Couture drafted a bill this past legislative session to lower the standard for removal. 
Currently, the state needs to prove a child is at risk of “imminent physical harm.” Couture’s bill would make it “imminent or serious physical harm.” 
The measure would also force officials to work from the presumption that children need to be removed if a parent or guardian’s use of any Schedule I or II drug, other than cannabis, puts the child at risk of being exposed to the controlled substance. To get their child back, parents would need to prove six months of sobriety or drug testing.
The Department of Children, Youth and Families, which oversees the state’s child welfare system,  doesn’t like the proposal, saying it goes too far and would make it more difficult to reunite children with their families even when it’s safe for them to return. 
Couture is open to suggestions. His legislation had some Democratic support, but didn’t get a hearing in Bergquist’s committee this year in Olympia. The chair said he was open to discussing the measure, along with another Democrat-led bill focused on removing kids from homes where parents are using drugs.
The number of children entering the state’s child welfare system since the Keeping Families Together law went into effect in mid-2023 has remained largely stable. 
In fiscal year 2023, running from July 2022 to June 2023, around 3,300 children were removed from their parents. This past fiscal year, ending in June, it was about 3,180, according to the Department of Children, Youth and Families. 
Fiscal year 2024 saw a major drop in children entering the welfare system, down to just over 2,800, as the Keeping Families Together Act didn’t initially weigh the presence of opioids in determining when children should be placed in foster care away from their parents.
Lawmakers addressed the issue in 2024, instructing courts to give “great weight” when factoring in this risk, and removals ticked back up.

For years, the number of children entering state care has been trending down, from a recent peak of more than 6,000 in 2017. The only time they’ve gone up since then was after legislators passed the 2024 fix.
“I think we’re back to a place where people are having more of a balanced test,” Senn said.
Ortiz-Self is open to discussing changes like those approved in 2024, but thinks people want a simple fix when the overarching problem is children being born with fentanyl in their systems and the opioid crisis.
“What we have to do is figure out, what are the services, what are the things that we need to do to help families and to address this opioid crisis that we are in, but removing, arbitrarily, kids from their homes without any due process is not the answer,” she said.
Senn also points to increasing financial stressors on families as fueling the rise in child fatalities and serious injuries.
Senn’s agency has already taken some steps to respond.
The state now requires “safe child consults” for all child welfare cases involving opioid use and a child younger than 3. These reviews help determine whether officials will allow a child to go home or petition a judge for care elsewhere. Caseworkers on neglect and medically complex cases are also getting increased training.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/washington-state-capitol-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-25 18:57:41.012996

Idaho Legislature’s DOGE panel looks to reorganize, reduce state government 

At its second meeting Monday, the DOGE Task Force — made up of state lawmakers, and named for the federal Department of Government Efficiency previously led by billionaire Elon Musk  — paved more of a roadmap for its work. 
The task force plans to review state laws to repeal, based on feedback from agencies required under a new state law to clean up state laws. The panel also plans to look into hundreds of tips from the public on government inefficiencies submitted to its online portal, which the task force announced a month ago at its first meeting. 
And Idaho’s DOGE panel might also explore cutting Medicaid expansion. 
After years of the Legislature not acting to fix a health insurance assistance gap, in 2018 nearly 61% of Idaho voters approved Medicaid expansion through a ballot initiative. But since then, Republican state lawmakers have complained about the program’s high costs.

Sen. Todd Lakey, a Nampa Republican who co-chairs the DOGE Task Force, asked if the panel should try to seek information about repealing or scaling back Medicaid expansion.
“I think jumping into that area would be good again,” replied Rep. Josh Tanner, an Eagle Republican. “… You are talking about able-bodied working adults living off of a socialistic system.”
In April, Idaho Republican legislative leaders announced the DOGE Task Force after a bill to create the panel stalled in the Legislature.
 Should Medicaid expansion be repealed or reduced? Idaho’s DOGE might look into that.

The DOGE panel didn’t discuss how Idaho Gov. Brad Little recently ordered nearly all state agencies to cut spending by 3% this year, a rarely used budget move to require mid-year cuts not ordered by the Legislature.

But next year, the Legislature might consider more cuts to state government — potentially even extending the governor’s temporary cuts, Tanner told the Sun in an interview Monday.

“If we can continue to do these hold backs, as the economy gets better, we’d like to see the money go back into taxpayers’ pockets,” he said. 
Instead of fully repealing Medicaid expansion, one potential cut could be capping costs at a set amount, Tanner said. 
“There’s a lot of different things that we can continually look at. …This may not be the perfect solution, but this is a really good solution for the state to help with cost containment aspects,” Tanner told the Sun. 
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare on Friday announced 4% cuts to Medicaid provider reimbursement rates, Idaho Reports reported. 
 Idaho DOGE to review ideas for Idaho Code Clean Up Act

Under the Idaho Code Clean Up Act, passed into law this year through House Bill 14, state agencies must review state laws to identify any parts that are “outdated,” obsolete” or “unnecessary.”
By Sept. 1, state agencies must report that information to the Idaho Legislative Services Office. 
The office’s goal is to provide the DOGE task force with weekly summaries of state agencies’ submissions, and the office’s assessment of how risky it is to repeal parts of or entire sections of state law, Legislative Services Office Principal Research Analyst Alex Penny told the panel. 
Then the DOGE task force could review suggestions for repeals, which could lead to efforts to repeal laws in the Legislature next year.
The DOGE task force plans to meet again on Sept. 29 and Oct. 23.

Officials say the state has likely spent more money, and seen more human-caused wildfires, than any year prior. And with weeks to go until fire season ends, those numbers could continue to climb. 
“It’s been a very busy year here in Utah,” said Jamie Barnes, director of the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands. “But we do have a lot of the season left.”

Barnes spoke during a presentation to lawmakers last week, where she pointed to several statistics that make this fire year stand out. Consider this: 

Human-caused fires burned at least 101,595 acres this year, which Barnes says is likely an all-time high. 
The estimated cost to Utah to fight these fires is about $29 million, likely another all-time high according to Barnes. 
The first ignition reported in Utah this year occurred on Jan. 5, with the East Hartford Fire in Duchesne County. Since then, Utah crews have responded to 1,093 reported fires (that number includes false alarms). 
Since May 14, Utah has seen at least one fire start each day. 
There’s been a total of 874 fires this year — at least 583 were human caused. That means nearly 70% of the fires in Utah have been human-caused, which is abnormally high. Typically, that figure is between 50% and 60%. 
About 93% of Utah fires this year were caught at 10 acres or less, which officials say has kept potential damage at bay. 
Fires burned at least 163,261 acres in Utah this year — about 4% was on state-owned land, with most of it on federal land.

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
According to data from the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands, since 2021 human-caused fires have been mostly the result of motor vehicle malfunctions or open burning. Here’s a breakdown: 

Motor vehicles were responsible for 29% of human-caused wildfires
Open burning: 22%
Camping: 12%
Heavy equipment: 8.5%
Utilities: 7.6%
Fireworks: 5.8%
Firearms: 5.5%
Arson: 5.3%

Since last Wednesday, when Barnes gave her presentation, a number of new fires have been sparked. That includes the human-caused Maple Fire, near Mapleton, that grew to about 50 acres over the weekend. Meanwhile, the Widemouth Fire, north of the intersection of interstates 15 and 70 near Cove Fort, has burned about 500 acres and is 8% contained, since being discovered Saturday.

(Screenshot from court documents)The plaintiffs challenging Arkansas’ law mandating a display of the Ten Commandments in schools asked a federal court Friday to allow them to sue an additional school district in the ongoing litigation.
Act 573 of 2025 requires that “a durable poster or framed copy of a historical representation of the Ten Commandments” be “prominently” displayed in taxpayer-funded public buildings, including school classrooms and libraries and colleges and universities.
U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks temporarily blocked Act 573 in response to a June lawsuit from seven multifaith families with children in the Fayetteville, Springdale, Bentonville and Siloam Springs school districts. Brooks issued his ruling Aug. 4, the day before the law’s effective date.
On Monday, the plaintiffs filed a motion for the court’s permission to add the Conway School District as a defendant and to add two families from the district to the case as plaintiffs.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas asked every school district in the state on Aug. 5 not to comply with Act 573 in response to Brooks’ ruling, but the “Conway School District nevertheless pressed forward with posting the Ten Commandments in every classroom, infringing the constitutional rights of students and parents,” the ACLU wrote in a Monday news release.
The Conway district’s decision “demonstrates a chilling disregard for the law,” ACLU of Arkansas Legal Director John Williams said in the release, and the organization “will not allow [districts] to get away with trampling families’ First Amendment rights.”
Court blocks new Arkansas law requiring Ten Commandments in classrooms

In Brooks’ 35-page ruling, the judge agreed with the plaintiffs that Act 573 likely violates two First Amendment provisions: the Establishment Clause, which guarantees that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,” and the Free Exercise Clause, which guarantees that “Congress shall make no law … prohibiting the free exercise [of religion].”
Republican lawmakers and conservative activists insisted on Aug. 12 that Act 573 is constitutional and based on historical tradition rather than religion. They cited a 2019 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that presumes Christian symbols and monuments are constitutional if they can be shown to be historical and traditional.
The Northwest Arkansas plaintiffs identify as Jewish, Unitarian Universalist, Humanist, agnostic, atheist and nonreligious, according to their June complaint.
Monday’s news release included a copy of the proposed amended complaint to be filed if Brooks grants Friday’s request from the plaintiffs.
Julee Jaeger, one of the potential Conway plaintiffs, is raising her child in a nonreligious household and “does not want the government to push any particular religion or religious morality” on her child, the amended complaint states.
Jaeger asked the Conway School Board via email to remove the Ten Commandments posters from district classrooms, and board member Trip Leach responded, “To answer your question, NO I do not think I will,” according to the complaint.
The other potential Conway plaintiffs are Kyle and April Berry, who are raising their two children as Christians but “do not believe in or teach their children the specific language of the state-mandated Ten Commandments in Act 573, which they find objectionable,” the complaint states.

79-1_-_proposed_amended_complaint 
“In fact, the Ten Commandments is not scripture that the Berrys or their faith community tend to focus on,” the complaint states. “Instead, they focus their religious instruction of children more on teachings found in the New Testament, such as the teaching to love your neighbors.”
The Berrys also believe “that people must be respectful of other people’s religions or lack thereof and that religious beliefs and practices should not be imposed on non-adherents,” and Act 573 conflicts with this value, according to the complaint.
Brooks’ ruling noted that Arkansas’ law is “most likely … [a] part of a coordinated strategy among several states to inject Christian religious doctrine into public-school classrooms.”
Education news outlet The 74 reported last month that a data analysis of 28 bills similar to Act 573 “exposes how their language, structure and requirements are inherently identical.”

BURLINGTON — On Sunday afternoon, Burlington police officers found explosive devices in an apartment building on Pearl Street they deemed to be associated with a resident, Justin Perkins, according to a press release from the Burlington Police Department. The 40-year-old man was arrested Thursday for allegedly bringing a pipe bomb to his work site in Colchester the week before. 
Before he was arrested last week, Perkins had talked with his coworkers about building bombs and making ghost AR-15 rifles in his residence, according to court documents. 
Around 3:30 p.m. on Sunday, officers responded after someone reported explosive devices in the building. The road in front of the apartment, at 90 Pearl St., was blocked off for the afternoon. 
Residents were evacuated from the apartment building and “explosive devices were safely removed and neutralized,” according to the press release. 
Police officers were assisted by local firefighters, the Vermont State Police Bomb Squad, the Vermont Hazardous Materials Response Team and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, according to the press release. John Russel, who works at Leonardo’s Pizza across the street, said the employees watched responders climb large firetruck ladders to a window in the apartment building. 
Residents were assisted by the American Red Cross before they were allowed to re-enter the building after it was deemed safe around 11 p.m., according to the press release. 
The incident comes four days after Perkins was arrested for allegedly bringing a pipe bomb to a job site on Dylan Avenue in Colchester. Court documents state that Perkins brought the bomb, which was about the size of a water bottle, to work on Aug. 14.
That day, he brought the bomb wrapped in what looked like white rags or a trash bag and “was excited to show” it to his coworkers, explaining how it worked and alleging it was simple for him to make, according to court documents.  
Perkins’ criminal history includes three failures to appear, 15 felony charges with one conviction, 43 misdemeanor charges with nine convictions, and three assaultive crime charges resulting in one conviction, according to court records. 
Perkins’ employer alerted police about the bomb on Aug.15. After his arrest on Aug. 21, Perkins was granted $10,000 bail, but did not post it, according to court documents. As of Monday morning, he’s being held without bail, according to the press release. 
The Burlington Police Department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Burlington did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Monday. The Vermont State Police referred all comments to local police.

Corn and soybean crops are a day or two behind the five year average schedule on several progression stages. Corn in the dough stage reached 88% which is three days behind the average for the Aug. 18 through Aug. 24 reporting period.
Corn acres rated 84% good to excellent and soybean acres rated 79% good to excellent, a slight drop from the previous reporting period for both crops.

The report also noted disease pressure continued to rise in Iowa crops. Field agronomists with Iowa State University Extension and Outreach noted continued presence of southern corn rust and sudden death syndrome, along with a slew of other diseases and pests have been present across the state. 
Oat harvest is nearly finished in the state at 97% completion, and nearly 80% of alfalfa hay acres have had a third cutting. 


Crop phenological stages:
— Corn in dough stage: a thick or dough-like substance is present in all kernels.
— Corn in dent stage: all the kernels have dented, ear is firm and no milk is present in the kernels.
— Soybeans setting pods: pods are developing on lower portions of the plant, with some blooming still on top of plant.
— Soybeans coloring: pods begin to reach mature color.


Farmers had nearly 6 days suitable for field work this week and enjoyed high temperatures in the upper 70s and low 80s later in the week due to a cold front that pushed in. 
“Farmers across Iowa enjoyed a welcome break from the rain last week along with cooler temperatures and less humidity,” Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said in a statement. 
Naig said the cooler temperatures are forecast to hang around for the remainder of the month. 
Despite the cool temperatures through the weekend, the average temperature for the reporting period was still 1.3 degrees above normal, according to State Climatologist Justin Glisan, who said temperatures were “unseasonably warm” for most of the period. 
Ames logged the highest temperature for the week, which at 97 degrees Fahrenheit was 16 degrees above the normal. 
Northeastern parts of the state had “unseasonably” high precipitation totals early in the week, with some areas logging as much as 6 inches of rain. 
The average precipitation across the state was 0.87 inch, just slightly below the normal of 0.93 inch.

This story by Brandon Canevari was first published in The Commons on Aug. 19, 2025.
The Windham County Sheriff’s Office (WCSO) is attempting to change the way that local law enforcement resources are provided and how they are funded by working with the legislature to make the system more stable.
According to Sheriff Mark Anderson, the Regional Policing Initiative could look to the Legislature to create one governing body to address the needs of the 19 towns in the county that are without their own policing infrastructure. Only Bellows Falls, Brattleboro, Dover and Wilmington have full-time police departments.
Whenever Vermont has attempted to share policing resources among municipalities in the past the system usually breaks down, Anderson said, describing a problem that he said has been documented for almost 70 years.
He noted that those who attended a series of information sessions about these potential changes were positive and optimistic about the need and curious as to how to accomplish it.
The meetings took place in Jamaica, Marlboro, Newfane and Putney in late July and earlier this month.
“Ultimately what we’re working on is approaching the Windham County legislative delegation to propose a pilot project where we can say, ‘Let’s actually stop studying this and talking about the changes. Let’s do a practice run so that we take the things that we believe, the subject matter experts believe, will actually fix the problems that we’ve been talking about for decades,'” Anderson said.

Some towns throughout Windham County have contracts with the sheriff’s office to provide services, a decision that is made by town selectboards. Those contracts are reviewed regularly and whether a contract remains in place is subject to change.
If one town decides to end a contract and another town wants the service, Anderson said under the current structure he moves the service to the other town.
The problem, he said, comes when a town that terminated a contract reverses course and wants the service back in six or 12 months time. At that point, Anderson said, the WCSO doesn’t have the funding to immediately be able to resume the service, and it takes approximately 12 months to recruit, hire, train and deploy a new officer.
“It just becomes this game of a waitlist, of a cycle, all because the selectboards are under pressure to be diligent stewards of funding,” he said.
“I need about 12 months to plan just about anything we do for any town, and they’re making a decision in May or June on what they want in their next fiscal year which starts in July. I can’t operate in that environment,” Anderson said. “They can’t operate in an environment where they’re depending on services. People get frustrated, and we’re just not doing the things.”
Anderson hopes the Legislature can form one governing body to represent the towns in the county.
“Rather than pursue this through 19 different towns in Windham County all with 19 separate decision making processes, what we’re trying to do is align this through the legislative process to say this is representative of the 19 towns through one deliberative conversation,” Anderson said.
Legislators will discuss the plan’s viability
On Sept. 22, Anderson will have a discussion with Windham County legislators to determine whether the concept is viable and, if so, to explore how to begin the legislative process when the new session begins in January.
Whether the change will come to pass will depend on the legislative process, Anderson said, starting with getting support from lawmakers to introduce a bill.
Even if the idea does not survive a journey through the legislative process, Anderson said he does not believe the public dialogue was in vain.
“I don’t see what we’ve done as wasted time. I see what we’ve done as educating our constituents and the community to say, ‘This is what to expect of the services and the government we have,'” Anderson said. “If we can’t get the change made, that’s not a failure, that’s also a decision of the public process, so both are fine.”
The meeting on Monday, Sept. 22 is scheduled to take place at the Windham County Superior Courthouse in Newfane at 5 p.m.

Alander Rocha/Georgia RecorderFor Jennifer Bullard, the decision to seek a physician-assisted death was not an act of wanting to die but of taking control over how and when she died, said Bullard’s sister, Jamie McNeil
Speaking to the Georgia House Public and Community Health Committee Monday, McNeil, shared how her sister’s ALS diagnosis progressively paralyzed her muscles, leading to “excruciating” and “brutal” suffering and that despite Bullard’s courage and her family’s round-the-clock care, could not be fully alleviated by conventional medical care. Bullard, McNeil said, was terrified of locked-in syndrome, a state of total paralysis while the mind remains conscious and alert.
“Unable to communicate, unable to speak, unable to move at all — to me, that is the very definition of torture, and my sister didn’t deserve to be tortured,” McNeil said. “Jennifer adamantly did not want to die, but she even more adamantly did not want to go through the locked-in syndrome.”

  Rep. Sharon Cooper. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
McNeil said that the medical aid in dying (MAID) option gave her sister a sense of dignity and peace, allowing her to coordinate a “beautiful passing” that included a final, intimate farewell with family and friends. After receiving the medication, McNeil said she held her sister, who peacefully passed away within minutes.
“The most harm that you could have done Jennifer would be to have made her live out this disease in that torture,” McNeil said.
Bullard underwent the procedure in California, where it is legal, unlike in Georgia.
Committee chair Rep. Sharon Cooper, a Marietta Republican, said the purpose for the committee hearing was to learn about MAID. There has not been a bill filed in previous sessions, and it’s unclear if legislation related to MAID will be considered yet in the next session.
Dr. Adrienne Mims, a geriatrician and vice chair of the Georgia Council on Aging, described MAID as a medical choice for a terminally ill, mentally capable adult to obtain and self-administer a prescription to die peacefully. She clarified it is distinct from suicide, which she noted is a separate public health issue. Mims presented data from Oregon, where MAID has been legal since 1997, showing that while thousands of prescriptions have been written, only a fraction are used.
“It is a choice. Sometimes people feel it’s empowering to be able to have that as an option,” Mims said.
  Rep. Scott Hilton. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Palliative care is focused on improving a patient’s quality of life at any stage of a serious illness, while hospice is for those with a prognosis of six months or less.
Anthony Davis, a social worker in palliative care, said that a patient’s request for MAID could stem from a lack of resources rather than a true desire to die. He said that as a social worker, he is in favor of autonomy in end-of-life care, but he said that there must be “resources in place,” such as proper mental health counseling, before MAID is an option.
“Once you assess further, you find it’s not death that they’re wanting, it’s the lack of resources,” Davis said. “It’s the fact that they don’t have the things needed, whether it be transportation, whether it be food, whether it be caregiver support, sometimes it’s that they don’t even have support from their family.”
Rep. Scott Hilton, a Republican from Peachtree Corners, expressed moral discomfort about family members’ ability to “push” such an option and fear of a “perverse incentive” where insurance companies might promote MAID as a cheaper alternative to costly long-term care.
  Rep. Dexter Sharper. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“How do we prohibit financial incentives from coming into play here, either from the family who is maybe seeking benefit from that person passing, or, for example, insurance companies who may begin to push this as a cheaper option as opposed to prolonging life?” he asked.
Rep. Dexter Sharper, a Valdosta Democrat who has worked as a paramedic for more than two decades, said that he’d much rather this be an option than hearing that a family member died by suicide because they had no other option.
“I remember all the suicides that I’ve been to as a paramedic over the last 30 years. Every last one of them, I don’t suffer with anything from it, thank God, but I remember where I was and where they did it to themselves. So those are things that you guys just have to keep in mind, there are going to be other issues that happen,” Sharper said.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PXL_20250825_170209229.PORTRAIT2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-25 18:57:41.012996

She updated them on the lab during the commiteee's Albuquerque meeting on Aug. 25, 2025. Pictured above talking to Srinivas Mukkamala, a CEO for AI-cybersecurity company Securin Inc. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Sandia National Laboratories Director Laura McGill anticipates “no further job losses” following layoffs for approximately 400 people to be completed by October, she told Source NM on Monday.
McGill, who assumed leadership at Sandia in May, presented an update Monday for lawmakers attending the Science Technology and Telecommunications committee meeting in Albuquerque. She gave an overview of the labs’ programs, which primarily focus on nuclear weapons research, and employ most employees at the main campus in Albuquerque.
In June, McGill initially announced proposed 1% to 3% cuts of Sandia Labs’ workforce of nearly 17,000 people, a departure from the job growth Sandia had reported every year since 2011.
On Monday, she confirmed to lawmakers that 2% of employees took a voluntary severance package, offsetting costs from higher salaries and reducing overhead. The restructuring will be complete by October, according to Kenny Vigil, a spokesperson at Sandia Labs.
After the meeting, McGill told Source NM that the job losses were mostly in “support positions,” which she described as non-contract work for federal agencies such as the U.S. Department of Defense or the National Nuclear Security Administration.
“Instead, it’s all the other things we do to support those activities, around administrative work, the planning work and all the other things that have to be in place to do the technical work,” McGill said.
In response to emailed questions seeking greater specificity about the eliminated positions, spokespeople at Sandia said just over three-quarters are from Albuquerque and the remaining layoffs are at the Livermore, California location.
McGill faced questions from lawmakers on the labs’ future and potential federal fallout, given the Trump Administration’s cuts to science grants and medical research. McGill noted that the laboratories do not have their full budgets yet, but she expects static funding or increases for nuclear weapons work, despite cuts to U.S. Department of Energy programs.
The NNSA received a $6 billion increase to its budget for designing, handling and storing nuclear weapons, and contracts with the NNSA account for more than 60% of Sandia’s work, McGill told lawmakers.
“As far as the federal budgets go, we’re in great shape,” she told lawmakers.
LANL expecting boon from Congressional spending bill; still faces workforce housing crunch

Rep. Joy Garratt (D-Albuquerque) asked McGill if the laboratories had received a directive regarding “diversity, equity and inclusion,” which the Trump administration has vowed to cut from universities and the federal government. 
“We’ve had some direction from the administration to talk about our outward-facing websites, but it hasn’t affected anything we’re doing internally,” McGill said. “We continue to support all our employees. We just believe in belonging.”
After the meeting, McGill told Source NM she hopes to reassure the workforce that further layoffs are not coming.
“We know there’s a lot of needs out there, but I can say we fully expect our programs to continue to be supported,” she said.

Houser/Getty Images) OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma Horse Racing Commission on Tuesday is expected to discuss finding a replacement for its executive director, who resigned last week.
John Chancey’s resignation follows months of turmoil at the small state agency, which regulates horse racing and gaming, under the oversight of its nine-member governing board. The agency is facing an Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation probe, an external financial forensic audit and recently had at least three Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaints filed against it.
When reached by phone Monday, Chancey declined to provide specific reasons for his resignation.
“I was not the guy,” he said, adding that it was time for him to leave and he didn’t want to be viewed as a “disgruntled employee.”
He would not discuss his specific concerns about the agency until things are fully investigated, but said he was trying to bring transparency and accountability to it. He said he plans to cooperate with investigators.
Chancey submitted a handwritten note Thursday to the governing board’s chairman and wrote that he was resigning effective immediately as executive director.
His resignation came the same day the governing board had scheduled an executive session for the personnel review committee to review Chancey. The agenda said it might include reports from Chancey, the Oklahoma Quarter Horse Association, Thoroughbred Racing Association of Oklahoma, and others affiliated with the industry.
Chancey, a veterinarian, was tapped interim director on Feb. 23, 2023, and made permanent a few months later.
Since his hiring, the Oklahoma Horse Racing Commission met about seven times behind closed doors to discuss his employment, according to board minutes.
Earlier this year, the Oklahoma Horse Racing Commission was hit with at least three Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaints that were discussed behind closed doors, according to previous meeting minutes. The EEOC investigates discrimination complaints. 
At the request of the Oklahoma Horse Racing Commission, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation said it was investigating “possible misconduct,” said Hunter McKee, an OSBI spokesman. He wouldn’t elaborate further.
The Horse Racing Commission has also requested a forensic audit into the Oklahoma Breeding Development Fund.
The Oklahoma Breeding Development Fund is an incentive fund administered by the commission that increases income for Oklahoma horse racing and breeding enterprises.
Joe Lucas, former Oklahoma Horse Racing Commission chairman who is no longer on the panel, said the audit, which is being conducted by a private entity, is expected to cover the entire agency.
Lucas, who served 12 years on the panel,  attributed the current agency turmoil to a number of factors, including incompetence at the agency and a lack of understanding about the industry.
“I just think those in charge do not have the knowledge or the wherewithal to know where the money is supposed to go,” he said.
Lucas said he does not believe any funds have been stolen.
“This isn’t over,” Lucas said. “I’m sure.”
Oklahoma Horse Racing Commission Chairman Brian Burget was not available for comment.

Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Township) discusses the impacts Republicans' One Big Beautiful Bill Act will have on Medicaid outside Capital Area Community Services Head Start in Lansing. Aug. 25, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceMarking his ninth annual motorcycle trip across the state since joining the U.S. Senate, Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Township) stopped in Lansing Monday afternoon to detail the impacts Republicans’ tax and spending plan would have on Medicaid and food assistance. 
Pulling up to Capital Area Community Services Head Start in Lansing, Peters shook hands with educators and staffers before meeting with reporters outside of the building to discuss the conversations he’s had with constituents while Congress remains in recess. 
“The important part of this whole trip is to come to places like this and get a sense of what’s happening in the communities, what are some of the challenges that we are having in our communities,” Peters said, warning that Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act will cause more Michiganders to lose their healthcare. 
Lansing Mayor Andy Schor, who joined Peters for his Lansing stop, said the city’s financial empowerment center, which offers residents free financial counseling, had surveyed individuals on their insurance status. Out of 298 individuals they’d served since October, 268 had health insurance. Of that group, nearly 46% received coverage through Medicaid. 
Additionally, 112 of those 298 individuals have a disability, with 76% of that group relying on Medicaid, Medicare or U.S. Veteran’s Administration benefits for coverage. 
“The numbers show how heavily our residents rely on government provided insurance, what a hardship it will be to lose that coverage. They show that our residents with little to no financial wiggle room could be completely derailed even by one expected health care expense, especially by losing food benefits,” Schor said, referencing the law’s cuts to SNAP benefits, which provide food assistance to low income families and individuals.

SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThese cuts will also harm the city’s food banks, school meals and nutrition outreach programs, Schor said. 
Cuts to Medicaid and essential services at the local level will only cost taxpayers more, Schor warned, as individuals without health care coverage will end up seeking care at hospital emergency rooms, with governments left to offset the cost of care for individuals who cannot pay. 
Peters said these impacts will affect individuals in communities all across the country, prodding his Republicans colleagues to take time to talk to their constituents.
“If they hear from people, they’ll hear the same stories that I’m hearing, and I would hope that they care. I’m going to ask them about that when I get back in a couple of weeks, because we have to revisit this stuff,” Peters said. 
Looking into the 2026 midterm election, Peters predicted healthcare will remain on the minds of Michigan voters, noting that some of the cuts will not take effect until after the midterm. 
“The Republicans tried to be too cute, saying, ‘Well, we’re going to make all these cuts, and people will forget about it, and then it’s going to happen after the election.’ Well, I know the people in Michigan are a whole lot smarter than that,” Peters said.

Additionally, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is estimated to increase the budget deficit by $3.4 billion over the next decade, with Peters warning this will lead to higher interest rates, making it more expensive to buy a house or a car.
Earlier this year, Peters announced he would not seek reelection in 2026, leaving his seat open. In response, U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), former gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed and research specialist Rachel Howard have stepped up in hopes of succeeding Peters in the Senate. 
However, Peters said he does not plan to endorse in the primary, allowing the Democratic candidates to go out and earn the support of Michiganders. 
“I will tell you when our Democratic nominee is selected, I am all in. We’re going to do everything we can to make sure that that person wins,” said Peters, who previously chaired the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. 
On the Republican side of the ticket, former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers of White Lake Township is the only candidate seeking the nomination.
Alongside slamming Republicans on the Big Beautiful Bill, Peters also addressed President Donald Trump’s threat to fire Federal Reserve Board Governor and former Michigan State University Professor Lisa Cook if she does not resign, following allegations of mortgage fraud raised by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte.
Pulte has leveled mortgage fraud allegations at other Trump opponents, including Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who served as the lead prosecutor in Trump’s first impeachment and New York Attorney General Letitia James, who secured a civil fraud judgment against Trump for misrepresenting his assets in financial statements.
“I think it’s ridiculous what he’s trying to do. What he’s trying to do is take control of the Federal Reserve Board so it is no longer an independent entity. The Federal Reserve has to be independent from politics,” Peters said, noting that he’d be angry if any president – Democrat or Republican – attempted to bring the board under their control. 
  U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Township) shakes hands outside Capital Area Community Services Head Start in Lansing. Aug. 25, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan Advance
Trump has repeatedly butted heads with Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell over Powell’s refusal to cut interest. With Trump working to fill an empty seat on the seven member board, Cook’s exit would allow Trump to install another loyalist onto the board. 

“Donald Trump is taking every step he can to take control of an economy in a way that ultimately will bring it down and hurt all Americans,” Peters said.
White House spokesman Kush Desai slammed Peters in an email, arguing Peters “is the absolute last person to weigh in on what’s best for our economy.” 
“Gary Peters openly abetted [former president] Joe Biden’s disastrous policies that fueled inflation, wrapped up our economy in red tape, and decimated 111,000 manufacturing jobs during his last year in office,” Desai said. 
While the Biden administration oversaw the loss of 111,000 in his final year, 610,000 manufacturing jobs were added over the course of Biden’s time in office.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_5143-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-25 18:57:41.012996

Idaho State University has hired a national consulting firm to study, and price out, the possible purchase of a for-profit medical school based in Meridian.
As political leaders wrestle with the state’s chronic physicians’ shortage, Idaho State has been looking at acquiring the Idaho College of Osteopathic Medicine for months. But the $100,000 consulting project doesn’t mean Idaho State is on the verge of making a bid, university President Robert Wagner said.

“We are still in the initial exploration phase,” Wagner told Idaho Education News in an interview.
But consultants are on a fast track — and they say they are looking at “the need for a state-owned medical school in Idaho.”
Consultants are getting an independent third-party analysis of ICOM’s fair-market value, and studying “the economic, educational, and social benefits of the proposed acquisition,” according to a PowerPoint presentation from Tripp Umbach, a Kansas City, Mo.-based consulting firm, obtained by Idaho Education News.
In this June 25 PowerPoint, Tripp Umbach lays out an aggressive timeline for the Idaho State project. The fair-market assessment and an economic impact report are both due in August. Its final report is expected in October.
Wagner is waiting to see what consultants come up with.
“We’ve not seen any work product from Tripp Umbach,” Wagner said Thursday. “They’re just doing their work.”
Tripp Umbach founding partner and President Paul Umbach declined comment, since his firm is still gathering data for its report.
On its website, Tripp Umbach says it has worked with two dozen new or proposed osteopathic medical schools, including ICOM. The company says it has worked with more than 500 universities and 1,000 health care organizations since it was founded in 1990.
Idaho State is not using state tax dollars or student tuition or fees to pay for the $100,000 Tripp Umbach study, Wagner said. The money will come from the university’s auxiliary funds, which can include charitable giving or revenues from facility rentals.
 How do Idaho State University and ICOM work together now?

Idaho State and ICOM are already closely aligned.
The medical school sits adjacent to Idaho State’s Meridian campus. And since its opening in 2018, ICOM has operated in partnership with Idaho State — offering several joint degrees and, most recently, signing a joint research agreement in January. Wagner is one of two Idaho State administrators who sit on ICOM’s board of trustees.

TPG, a private equity firm, and Rice University co-own the college. ICOM President Tracy Farnsworth has said a sale is likely at some point.
Given the close existing relationship between Idaho State and ICOM, would there be any added benefits to acquiring the school outright? Wagner says it’s an important question.
“That’s what we are exploring,” he said.
 Taking a look at the Idaho physician shortage

Rep. Dustin Manwaring says he wants to know more about the sticker price, given the high cost of public medical schools in other states.
“They’re not cheap propositions,” said Manwaring, R-Pocatello, “but they can be serious and strategic investments for the state of Idaho.”
Manwaring co-chairs a task force studying the state’s physician shortage. The group holds its second meeting Tuesday.

While the Tripp Umbach study is focused solely on ICOM, the task force is taking a more holistic look at Idaho’s physician shortage.
The 2025 Legislature passed a law creating the task force — and calling for the state to create an additional 30 taxpayer-funded medical school seats over three years. These seats could include subsidized slots at ICOM.
The law doesn’t expressly call for cutting seats at WWAMI, the University of Washington-led medical school program named for the member states of Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho. However, some lawmakers have pushed for cutting back the state’s 50-year partnership with WWAMI, which now takes in 40 Idaho students per year.
As the task force weighs all of these issues, Manwaring said he is considering the state’s options with ICOM. Simply having the for-profit medical school in Idaho is “a huge step forward,” he said. But Manwaring would want state ownership to build partnerships between ICOM and health care providers — securing the in-state clinical placements that encourage medical school graduates to practice in Idaho.
“If we’re going to grow something, what is it?” Manwaring said.

After cutting off $16 million for Vermont in February, the U.S. Department of Transportation backtracked this month to allow access to the money.

Vermont is taking steps to resume a long-planned buildout of electric vehicle chargers along its major highways after federal funding for the project was stripped away — and then, recently, made available again — by President Donald Trump’s administration.
In February, the U.S. Department of Transportation suspended funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure, or NEVI, program, which was created under President Joe Biden’s 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law. In Vermont, that meant almost $16 million in funding was thrown into limbo, $9 million of which had already been committed to help build high-speed chargers in 11 communities around the state. 
But earlier this month, the Trump administration changed course — albeit, it seems, reluctantly. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy wrote in an Aug. 11 press release that states could access program funding, again, if they submitted new plans on how they would use the money. The department also revised some of the program’s guidance in an effort to get more chargers built, more quickly, the secretary said in the release.

“While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress’ will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently,” Duffy said. 
The new guidance strips requirements created by the Biden administration that states engage with “rural, underserved, and disadvantaged communities” when deciding where to locate new charging stations, Duffy said, as well as stipulations that the charging network plans provide “opportunities for the participation of small businesses, including minority-owned and women-owned small businesses,” among other changes.
Vermont has submitted a new application for federal funding for the 11 charging stations as it had them planned out earlier this year, Rachel Noyes, a spokesperson for the state’s Agency of Transportation, said in a statement Monday.
Andrea Wright, the agency’s environmental policy manager, said in April that two of those projects — in Randolph and Wilmington — could move forward regardless, using state dollars. But work was put on hold for the other nine, even though contractors had already been awarded bids, she had said.
The other projects include charging sites in Bennington, Berlin, Brattleboro, Manchester, Middlebury, Rutland, South Burlington, St. Albans and White River Junction. Chargers would be located along Interstates 89 and 91, as well as U.S. 7 and VT-9. 
Meanwhile, one charging project in Bradford funded by the program was already completed, more than a year ago, before the funding was put on pause. 
Robb Kidd, director of the Vermont chapter of the national environmental advocacy group Sierra Club, said the state desperately needs more chargers along its major travel corridors to encourage more people to purchase electric vehicles over gas cars. 
Fast public chargers are important not just for people driving through and around the state, he said, but also for Vermonters who don’t have access to that infrastructure at home, often because they live in an apartment or other types of multifamily housing.
“We see it as a critical component to making sure that everybody can access reliable and high-speed charging, no matter where they are,” Kidd said Monday.
He added that the Trump administration’s reversal is significant, too, because it comes as other federal support for EV adoption continues to be slashed. That includes, as of Sept. 30, a planned end to up to $7,500 in federal tax credits that is available on new EV purchases. The tax credit elimination was part of the sweeping Republican-led tax and spending bill Trump signed into law in July.
Meanwhile, VTrans’ Wright noted in an email that the tax and spending bill also nixes, starting in July 2026, a federal tax credit for EV charging equipment — something that could drive up costs for the vendors the state had been planning to work with on the charger buildout.
Vermont was one of 16 states, along with Washington, D.C., that challenged the Trump administration’s decision to hit the brakes on funding for new EV chargers in federal court in May. A judge later ordered the administration to release the grant funding to most, though not all, of those states. Vermont, Minnesota and Washington, D.C., were not included because they did not show that they would face “irreparable harm” if the funding remained frozen, the federal judge decided. 
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, who is leading the joint lawsuit against the funding pause, told NPR this month that news of the money being available again was “encouraging” but said it did not mean the immediate end of the states’ legal challenge.
In a statement Monday, Amelia Vath, a spokesperson for Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark’s office, said Clark would “continue to monitor the progress of the case to ensure Vermont’s interests are protected.”

“One of the biggest things that I’ll be watching is whether or not FEMA’s going to be able to preposition resources ahead of a storm’s impact like they have had in the past,” said Deanne Criswell, who served as FEMA administrator during the Biden administration in a Zoom call on Monday.
“What we’ve heard is that [they] want to turn the responsibility for managing disaster to the state and locals, but they already had the responsibility. FEMA can only come in and support if the state asks them to, but they have the ability to be proactive and get resources ready and anticipate what they think a state may ask for.”
Warning to Congress
Earlier on Monday, more than 180 current and former FEMA employees issued a letter to Congress warning that the Trump administration has set back much of the progress in disaster response and recovery since Katrina smashed New Orleans in 2005.
The group listed six “statements of opposition” to what is going on with FEMA, such as the requirement by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that she personally must review and approve all contracts, grants, and mission assignments over $100,000.
“That means every single decision that goes into the response and recovery would require additional approval, and that’s what we saw as a failure during Hurricane Katrina. And I would fear that that’s really going to have an impact on the ability for some of these really large-scale events to slow down FEMA’s ability to support the people who have been impacted,” said Criswell.
In their letter, the group opposed the “failure to appoint a qualified FEMA administrator, as required by law.”
Lack of experience
Cameron Brown, former acting head of FEMA, was fired in May after he told lawmakers the day before that he didn’t think it was in the public’s interest to dismantle the federal agency. He was replaced led by David Richardson, who has no experience managing natural disasters.
Criswell noted that was also the case when Katrina hit in 2005, when Michael D. Brown served as FEMA director under President George W. Bush. Brown had been a lawyer active in GOP politics in Oklahoma who had supervised police and fire departments as an assistant city manager in an Oklahoma City suburb before being appointed to lead FEMA in 2003.
And she said she’s concerned that there have been several regional administrators who have stepped down in recent months. “If you’re a good leader, you’re going to rely on the knowledge and skills and abilities of your staff, yet we’ve seen much of the leadership across FEMA also leave,” she said.
The Zoom call was organized by the group Sabotaging our Safety, and included Jacksonville Democratic Rep. Angie Nixon and two other Democrats running for office next year: former Miami-Dade County state Sen. José Javier Rodríguez, who is running for attorney general, and Colonel Darren McAuley, running for Congress in Florida’s 15th District.
“We need to be very clear that FEMA cuts will have a direct impact on the health, well-being, and medical care of our neighbors and our communities,” McAuley said. “FEMA helps us prepare us for a storm, but it also helps us to mitigate the response after a storm.”
President Donald Trump said in June that he intended to phase FEMA out after this year’s hurricane season. In April, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis had said that the state could handle emergencies without federal funds but said he didn’t believe the president would do so without the federal government giving grants to the states.
FEMA approved more than $1 billion in individual assistance last year to Floridians following the destruction from Hurricanes Milton, Helene, and Debby.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)The loss of state government’s online and communications services for nearly two business days last week started with the failure of a data center core switch in Pierre, according to the office that maintains the network.
The problem with the switch at the state’s Capitol caused a power outage and chain reaction across the state “data center,” which is the term used by the Bureau of Information and Telecommunications to describe the hardware across South Dakota connected to its communications network. 
Power outages across South Dakota government stymie services statewide

The disruption began on Tuesday.
During the outage, people were unable to get birth or death records, marriage licenses, vehicle registrations, driver’s licenses or license plates. The state court system declared a judicial emergency because electronic court records were inaccessible. Law enforcement was unable to run license plates for driver information during traffic stops for a portion of the outage.
Lisa Rahja, spokeswoman for the bureau, told South Dakota Searchlight in an email that the replacement switch was shipped to Pierre overnight Tuesday and installed Wednesday. 
A data center core switch, Rahja said Monday, is “the high-capacity network backbone for all servers and systems located within the data center” that connects the rest of the network and routes data traffic.
Outage coincides with first meeting of infrastructure work group
Wednesday, the second day of the outage, marked the first meeting of the Governor’s Resilience and Infrastructure Task Force, a group led by Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen that’s tasked with studying the state’s physical and digital infrastructure with an eye to upgrades and improvements. The group’s meetings are not open to the public “due to the sensitive and secure nature” of the work, according to the Governor’s Office. The office also says the task force is a “working group,” and therefore not obligated to conduct its business in public under a subsection of the state’s open records law.
State network begins to come back online after second day of failures

Venhuizen, in an email to South Dakota Searchlight, said Thursday that the outage did not hamstring the group’s first meeting, but “it was a timely reminder of the many ways that critical infrastructure and systems can be disrupted.”
In his weekly column on Friday, Gov. Larry Rhoden emphasized that “the service disruption was the result of a power outage, not any kind of nefarious activity,” but said the situation shows why the group is needed.
“They exist as a strategic advisory body to assess risks and vulnerabilities and support long-term planning and investment in critical infrastructure,” Rhoden wrote. 
Rhoden’s column also said that Bureau of Information and Telecommunications Commissioner Mark Wixon missed the first task force meeting to “oversee the response.” At one point, the governor wrote, there were concerns that the replacement part had missed its truck and was stuck in Sioux Falls, but “thankfully, that ended up not being the case.”
Lawmakers react, plan to question bureau
The outage and its impact will be part of discussions during the next Government Operations and Audit Committee meeting, Rapid City Republican Sen. Taffy Howard confirmed on Saturday. The committee’s task is to oversee the operations of state government for the legislative branch.
The bureau was already set to appear during the Sept. 24 meeting, said Howard, who is chairwoman of the committee, and will now be expected to explain the outage. 
Rep. Marty Overweg, R-New Holland, is vice chairman of the committee. 
“Everybody needs to know what happened, because we don’t,” Overweg said last week. “I’ve heard a lot of different things.”
He noted that the Bureau of Finance and Management is in the midst of a multi-year, $70 million upgrade of the state’s money management, procurement, employee expense and risk management software system. The project, which began in June of 2024 under the name “BISON,” was endorsed as a replacement for a software system so old it could no longer be serviced.
The outage is concerning, Overweg said, at a time when “we just spent millions of dollars on this whole new program.”
Rep. Erik Muckey, D-Sioux Falls, is a member of the budget committee. He said last week he’s concerned about the outage, and that he hopes it shows the importance of investing in infrastructure upfront. The notion that a component failure could have such a widespread impact, Muckey said, should have lawmakers asking why there wasn’t a backup plan.
“I’m concerned that we might not have an adequate plan for redundancy,” Muckey said. “This should not happen. If we expect to operate effectively, we should not be down for two days.”

Brian Kemp shake hands with members of the Georgia National Guard in Evans at a briefing on Hurricane Helene recovery in 2024. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp is sending approximately 75 members of Georgia’s National Guard to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement with immigration enforcement efforts, his office announced Monday. The Peach State is joining 18 other states to mobilize a collective 1,700 troops nationwide.
Guard members will not be tasked with making immigration arrests, but instead will assist with “administrative and logistic support,” according to the governor’s office. Processing and training is scheduled to begin in mid-September.
“I am proud to stand with President Trump’s team in the ongoing efforts to secure our nation’s border and keep Americans safe,” Kemp said in a statement. “With the longest continuous presence at the border of any National Guard, Georgia has led on this front for years and will continue to do so through this latest measure while still meeting all responsibilities and duties the Guard has to the state.”
State officials also stressed that partnerships between the National Guard and other governmental entities are not new. In February of 2024, Kemp authorized members of Georgia’s National Guard to assist with Texas’ border operations.
They also said that the move to have guard members assist with immigration enforcement “is different and separate from” Trump’s recent takeover of the District of Columbia.

State Rep. Eric Bell, a Jonesboro Democrat who served in the U.S. Navy, condemned the use of the Georgia National Guard to assist with immigration enforcement.
“I believe Georgia is standing at a crossroads regarding governance and the protection of individual rights,” he said in a statement. “What is before us is not from foreign shores but from within—the possibility of deploying troops on our own soil, against our own citizens. This is no act of security. I believe this an attempt to create division among Americans and Georgians and could be seen as serving private interests rather than the public.”

(Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife)After more than six hours of public comment and debate, the Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission at its Aug. 21 meeting adopted new wolf hunting and trapping regulations that significantly increase the number of wolves hunters and trappers can kill statewide. 
Under the new hunting and trapping regulations, a 452-animal quota now exists for much of the state, with a few carveouts of more stringent regional quotas. That statewide quota is higher than harvest numbers for the last few seasons — hunters and trappers killed 297 wolves last season, while the most killed in a season was 326 during 2020.
The move follows a contentious legislative session this spring that saw several debates about Republican lawmakers’ intent to decrease the state’s population of roughly 1,100 wolves, though ultimately legislators fell short of more aggressive proposals for the state. 
“I support the management plan that you had today before you as amended, because it is a step in the right direction,” said Rep. Paul Fielder, R-Thompason Falls. “But you’re not done yet.”
The commission debated several amendments to the formal package of hunting and fishing regulations recommended by Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, and unanimously approved the following: 

A statewide quota of 452 wolves,
A three-wolf quota for two wolf management units north of Yellowstone National Park,
A 60-wolf quote for Region 3, covering Southwestern Montana,
Hunters and trappers will be able to take 15 wolves on a single hunting or trapping license — 30 in total — as long as five are hunted and five are trapped in Regions 1 or 2, and
The use of infrared scopes, and thermal imagery scopes on private land.

Fielder and other Republican legislators, including Reps. Jedidiah Hinkle, chairman of the Fish and Game Committee, and Shannon Maness, said that going back to the 2021 session, it has been the intent of the legislature to reduce the wolf population down to around 450 animals, enough to support 15 breeding pairs. In the years since that law was passed, the statewide population has barely dropped. 
“We are not getting desired results,” Maness said, adding that the Legislature would continue the debate in 2027 if that status quo continued. 
But opponents to the new hunting regulations, which included some legislators and conservation groups that opposed wolf hunting bills during the legislature, argued during the meeting that the commission was going too far in establishing its new quotas and using politics, instead of science, as a basis. 
“The department is bringing us, quite frankly, a proposal that looks a lot like those bills that were voted down in the legislative session. I will say, it’s frustrating,” said Karrie Kahle, conservation director for the Park County Environmental Council. “Quota doesn’t work, and it’s not going to work. We have regions. We have commissioners from regions who should be working within their regions to figure out what those quotas should be, and talking with their stakeholders and constituents and looking at the science.”
The environmental council and other opponents including Gallatin Wildlife Association, Wild Livelihoods Business Coalition, also argued for the commission to consider the economic impacts wolves have in the areas near Yellowstone National Park. 
According to a 2022 study by the University of Montana’s Institute for Tourism and Recreation Research, “wolf centric ecotourism” the Yellowstone region brings in more than $82.7 million to local economies. 
Representing the Wild Livelihoods Business Coalition as a guide, business owner and biologist Karen McGarry said that continuing to limit the number of wolves that can be killed outside of Yellowstone is a vital part of the regulations. The commission had proposed keeping a three-wolf quota in two hunting districts just north of the park. 
“This is crucial for protecting the product that attracts many visitors to my area, enables us to have really great jobs, while enabling a few locals in my area who want to hunt and trap wolves to also do that,” McGarry said. “Montana is big and diverse. There seems to be a lot of frustration around a lack of definition of what a sustainable wolf population is. I really hope the department works on defining that.”
Some opponents also brought up issues with the model the state uses to estimate wolf populations. That model, known as iPOM, was criticized in a recent federal court ruling for potentially giving inaccurate data. The ruling in the lawsuit now requires the federal government to reconsider whether gray wolves should be given protections under the Endangered Species Act again.  
In addition to the legislators who spoke in favor of reducing wolf populations, representatives from several organizations including the Foundation of Wildlife Management, the Montana Stockgrowers Association and the Montana Trappers Association favored the more aggressive harvest regulations, as populations have remained relatively steady ever since hunting and trapping were legalized in the state. 
According to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks data, the population of wolves peaked in 2011 and has declined slightly in the last decade due to hunting, trapping and management actions.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/gray-wolf-1536x1229-1-1024x819.jpg,,,2025-08-25 17:56:50.753080

Jared Polis’ desk after winning final approval from lawmakers over the weekend and on Monday morning.
The Legislature began its special session last Thursday to pass revenue-raising policies to help fill an approximately $750 million gap in the state’s budget. That hole follows the passage of the federal tax cut and spending law in July, which hit Colorado’s project tax revenue for the current fiscal year and years to come.
Democrats’ plan to rebalance the budget includes the policies passed this session to raise more tax revenue, a dip into the state’s reserve funds and a spending cut plan that the governor is scheduled to present to lawmakers later this week.

Republicans railed against the Democrat-backed bills that they see as detrimental to the state’s business community and in violation of the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights, which mandates voter approval for tax increases. They want the state to cut expenses rather than find ways to raise more money. 
“Why are we here talking about raising taxes on businesses, mortgaging future revenue, instead of talking about addressing the real issue? I don’t know,” Sen. Lisa Frizell, a Castle Rock Republican, said on the Senate floor Monday morning. “We are continuing to punish the businesses in this state.” 
The five bills focused on raising revenue would raise about $250 million in the current fiscal year by eliminating tax breaks at the state level and letting companies pre-pay taxes at a discount. Four of them were passed by the Senate on mostly party-line votes on Sunday evening and Monday morning.
House Bill 25B-1005 would repeal a provision in state law that allows retailers to keep 4% of their sales tax collections, sometimes referred to as a vendor fee, as a way for the businesses to cover the cost of collecting the taxes. 
The bill’s fiscal note estimates it would raise $28 million in revenue for the state in the current fiscal year, and $57 million the next year.
Sen. Cathy Kipp, a Fort Collins Democrat, said the tax incentive is outdated, and cutting it is necessary amid the state budget hole. Kipp also pointed to how tax code changes in the federal Republican domestic policy law primarily benefit businesses.
“Nobody wants to give up something they’ve already had, and nobody wants to be for asking people to do that,” said Sen. Cathy Kipp, a Fort Collins Democrat. “It’s just that this is where we find ourselves today. But we do not genuinely pay people to pay their taxes. We do not generally pay people to comply with the law.”
Sen. Lynda Zamora Wilson, an El Paso County Republican, spoke against the bill during its final debate on Monday morning, and so did several of her Republican colleagues.
“We should be incentivizing businesses, this is the time,” Zamora Wilson said. “We’ve got to make cuts. I’ll say it again and again.”
Five Democratic senators sided with Republicans in voting against it.
The Senate then passed House Bill 25B-1003. This would repeal a tax incentive for insurance companies that have at least 2.5% of their domestic employees in Colorado. The bill would raise $44 million for the state in the current fiscal year and $91 million the following year.
Finally, senators signed off on House Bill 25B-1001. This would permanently extend a requirement that high-income taxpayers who own sole proprietorships, S corporations or  partnerships add back their qualified business income federal tax deductions when calculating their Colorado taxable income. It will only impact single filers who make at least $500,000 and joint filers who make at least $1 million, so business owners who earn less than that still will benefit from the deduction at the federal and state levels.
Congress made the federal deduction, which can be up to 20% of that “pass-through” income for business owners, permanent with its recent law. Colorado decoupled from the federal deduction for high earners in 2020.
The bill’s fiscal note estimates it would raise about $46 million in the current fiscal year and about $95 million in the next one. 
On Sunday, the Senate passed House Bill 25B-1002. This bill would expand the list of countries that the state considers to be tax havens, which limits the deductions that corporations can claim on taxable income in those jurisdictions. The bill would bring in an estimated $36 million in state tax revenue for the current fiscal year, according to its fiscal note.
The bill’s Democrat sponsors have argued that the bill closes corporate tax loopholes during a time when the state budget is hurting. But Senate Republicans were wary that the bill could hurt businesses.
The Colorado Legislature sent four other bills to Gov. Polis’ desk over the weekend. 
The Senate signed off on amendments made in the House to a bill to redirect a small amount of money from the state’s wolf reintroduction program to the health insurance affordability fund.
Senate Bill 25B-3 would change a referred ballot measure in November to ask voters if the state can use extra money collected for universal school meals to also cover costs related to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Senate Bill 25B-2 would allow the state to pay for Medicaid services from organizations that provide reproductive health care, namely Planned Parenthood, that the federal government has withheld Medicaid money from. The bill’s fiscal notes estimates it would cost Colorado a maximum of $4.4 million during the current fiscal year, which began on July 1.
Senate Bill 25B-1 would set a process for the governor to notify and consult with the Joint Budget Committee on mid-year spending cuts needed to overcome a revenue shortfall, like the ones he is poised to do soon after this special session. The governor would be able to suspend and cut state funding, and therefore need to meet with the JBC, if the reserve needs to be tapped by up to 3% of the General Fund budget, or if that reserve is projected to dip below $1 billion.
No bill signings had been scheduled as of Monday afternoon.

(Photo by Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado Legislature is meeting in a special session to address a nearly $800 million hole in the state budget. Work began on Thursday morning and is expected to last through the weekend.
After Republicans in Congress passed the federal tax cut and spending bill in July, Colorado’s estimated tax revenue collections shrunk by about $1.2 billion for the current fiscal year, which began July 1. Most of that is a loss of corporate income taxes.
Colorado has to have a balanced state budget, so lawmakers must figure out a way to get backed to a balanced bottom line. The Democratic majority in both chambers, alongside Gov. Jared Polis, plan to do that by dipping into the state’s reserves, cutting program spending and passing an array of tax laws to eliminate some deductions and loopholes.
In his call for the special session, Polis also allowed bills on health insurance premiums and artificial intelligence regulations. A controversial AI law is set to go into effect next February and it has been a longtime goal of Polis and moderates to tweak it before then.
Legislative action is live-streamed and archived on the General Assembly’s website.

Both bills on artificial intelligence gained preliminary approval in the Colorado Legislature on Sunday evening.
House Bill 25B-1008 and Senate Bill 25-4 passed on a voice vote. The real test will be when the bills are up for final, recorded votes.
They are both in their first chambers, despite most other bills considered this session nearing the governor’s desk.
After it was amended, HB25B-1008 became a clean delay of the effective date for the state’s AI regulations to October of next year.
Senate Bill 25-4 was a pared-down version of 2024 legislation that seeks to prevent discrimination at the hands of AI. It eliminated some requirements the tech industry found arduous, such as risk assessments, and retained the transparency piece.
“It took the core values of what was in (the 2024 bill) and reduced it down to just the core thing, that the developer has to give (deployers) the information to know how the system is trained and use, and to be also be able to have the deployer give the information to the consumer when a decisions is being made about them (using AI),” Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez, a Denver Democrat, said.
It would relate to decisions regarding health care, education, finance and government services.
Rodriguez pushed the start date for the bill from next February to next May in committee earlier on Sunday.
He further amended the bill on the Senate floor. The bill now lets deployers tell affected people a general description of the information a system used to make a decisions, rather than a list of 20 specific personal characteristics, and allows the person to request that information within 90 days. Another amendment reduced the expected appropriation by about $275,000.
An amendment originally considered liability, but Rodriguez removed it later on so all stakeholders can look at and agree to the framework.
That amendment clarified when liability for harm is placed on the developer, the entity that actually created the AI system, versus the deployer, the company or group that uses the AI to make decisions.
“If you a buy a system or utilize one to make decisions…and you don’t change it, the business doesn’t get sued. If (the developer’s) system was wrong, it requires them to take some liability,” he said. “It’s a good thing for Colorado businesses and consumers, because they buy these things not knowing how it works. Any time we’re trying to open the transparency and knowledge of these systems, it promotes more trust.”
Lawmakers will reconvene on Monday for the fifth day of the special session.
Editor’s note: This post was updated at 10:25 p.m. on Aug. 24 to reflect that the liability amendment was passed, but then rescinded later on in the evening.

Colorado’s AI law could be pushed back to May or October next year, per special session bills


By: Sara Wilson -  4:50 pm





Colorado’s artificial intelligence regulation would go into effect in May 2026 instead of February under changes made to a special session bill on Sunday afternoon.
The Senate Appropriations Committee approved Senate Bill 25B-4 on Sunday afternoon, after four days of delay and negotiation on the topic. The bill is sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez, a Denver Democrat.
The start date delay has been an ask of the tech industry, some deployers of AI and Gov. Jared Polis.
The amended bill could now have a fiscal impact of about $2.7 million, Legislative Council Staff analyst John Armstrong told the Senate Appropriations Committee, though that number is fluid as analysts get more information and the bill undoubtedly goes through more changes. The money would go to the governor’s Office of Information and Technology Office to hire staff across executive agencies.
The uncertain budget impact incensed Republicans on the committee.
Colorado’s AI regulation has been the center of controversy during the ongoing special legislative session. Rodriguez’s bill to put guardrails on the technology is set to go into effect in 2024, despite worry about implementation among business and technology groups. Lawmakers and interested groups sought to reach a compromise during the regular lawmaking term this year but failed to do so, prompting Polis to include AI in his call for the special session.
But the special session has proven to be tough timing for fruitful negotiations. A delay would give stakeholders the rest of the year and nearly the entire regular session next year to hash out a deal.
Rodriguez’s bill focuses on transparency requirements about how an AI system works and whether it could be discriminatory if it is used to make consequential decisions. It has the support of consumer groups and unions. Another bill, House Bill 25B-1008, was originally focused on disclosure for tools like AI chatbots, but it was rewritten to be a simple delay of the AI law until next October. That bill is bipartisan and is supported by the tech industry.
Other amendments to SB25B-4 exempt a tool used to make probation decisions within the judicial department and makes some governmental AI disclosures subject to the state’s open records law.
Both bills now await initial floor debates in their first chamber.









Colorado Legislature passes bill to fund Medicaid reimbursements for Planned Parenthood


By: Delilah Brumer -  3:14 pm





The Colorado House of Representatives on Sunday passed a bill that would use state money to fund Medicaid reimbursements for reproductive health care providers, namely Planned Parenthood, that have recently faced federal funding cuts.
Senate Bill 25B-2 was approved in a party-line 43-19 vote, with Democrats in favor. It passed the Senate on Friday, during the ongoing special legislative session that is focused on raising revenue to soften the impact of recent changes to the federal tax code. The bill now goes to Gov. Jared Polis’ desk for his signature.

Lawmakers change funding for health insurance bill in special session


By: Sara Wilson -  12:46 pm





Lawmakers now want to sell additional tax credits instead of borrowing from the state’s unclaimed property fund to shore up the Health Insurance Affordability Enterprise fund, which pays for programs to reduce individual insurance market premiums.
House Bill 25B-1006 aims to raise $100 million for that enterprise to soften the impact of the expiration of federal enhanced premium tax credits. Health insurance premiums for people who buy it on the individual market are expected to face an average of a 28% increase next year, with higher increases along the Western Slope.
HIAE funds the state’s reinsurance for claims from high-cost individuals, subsidies for carriers on the state’s Health Insurance Exchange and the state’s OmniSalud program for undocumented people.
It is possible Congress will extend or partially restore the federal enhanced premium tax credit in question, in which case the loan considered in the bill wouldn’t happen.
The bill originally planned to borrow money from the state’s Unclaimed Property Trust Fund. That is how it passed the House, but the funding mechanism was amended in the Senate Finance Committee on Sunday morning.
“We worked with the treasurer’s office to do this, broadening the pool to make sure we’re not having a negative impact on existing tax credit programs, like affordable housing,” bill sponsor Sen. Kyle Mullica, a Thornton Democrat, said.
The state’s treasury department would tap a third-party vendor to sell the tax credits to insurance companies and C corporations during this fiscal year. The credits would allow companies to essentially get a discount on future tax liabilities to the tune of 80 cents on the dollar — the department could sell up to $100 million in credits that would then have a face value of $125 million.
“This $100 million is going to have a meaningful impact on folks,” Colorado Insurance Commissioner Michael Conway told lawmakers on Sunday morning. “But it’s not going to replace everything at the federal level. It’s not even close.”
The bill would give the Legislature some time and breathing room to come up with a “sustainable solution,” Conway said.
It is a similar strategy to another bill on the table this special session to raise revenue for the state’s General Fund.
The Legislature also allowed the treasury department to sell tax credits to fund loans for small businesses in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
HB25B-1006 now needs to get through the Senate Appropriations Committee.

House approves six bills on third day of special session


By: Delilah Brumer - Saturday August 23, 2025 4:22 pm





The Colorado House of Representatives gave final approval to six bills on Saturday, sending them to the Senate for consideration as part of the ongoing special legislative session.
The bills focus on raising additional state tax revenue to help close the state’s nearly $800 million budget hole, which was triggered by federal tax code changes.

House Democrats use chamber rule to end lengthy debate on tax bills


By: Sara Wilson -  3:46 pm





House Democrats used a seldom-used chamber rule to prevent debate on four of the bills after Republicans spoke at length about the first pair of bills. They used House Rule 16 to call the question — end debate and immediately vote on the bill in question — as debate on the second bill on the agenda extended past an hour.
Before that, Rep. Sean Camacho, a Denver Democrat, accused Republicans of filibustering.
“If every member on this side of the room,” he said, motioning to the Republican caucus, “uses your full allotted 10 minutes to filibuster on bills instead of doing the people’s work, that costs the state $283.” He was referring to the extra cost of operating the Colorado Capitol during a special legislative session.
The remark drew anger from Republicans.
“I will not let them be accused of wasting the people’s time when they are telling the story of their district,” Assistant Minority Leader Ty Winter, a Trinidad Republican, said.
“Don’t make our fighting four our constituents to be a cheap trick,” he said.
Democratic leadership then used Rule 16 on the next four bills, and they all passed. Members are typically allotted ten minutes each ahead of the final vote on a bill, meaning that if all 21 Republicans used their time, debate would be over three hours per bill.
The House is now doing initial debate and votes on the five bills that made it through committee yesterday. Democratic leadership limited floor debate to one hour per bill.









Colorado Legislature begins third day of special session


By: Sara Wilson -  12:27 pm





The House began work on the third day of the special legislative session around 10 a.m. on Saturday morning. The plan is do final votes on a series of tax-related bills and send them over to the Senate for consideration.
Their first vote, after about two hours of debate, was a 43-19 approval of House Bill 25B-1001, which would make permanent an add-back for federal qualified business income deduction on state taxes.
In federal law, some businesses can deduct up to 20% of their QBI for their taxes. It was set to expire this year, but the recent federal tax and spending law extended that tax deduction. The bill would continue to decouple Colorado from the deduction, so taxpayers making above $500,000 individually or $1,000,000 jointly would need to add back that federal deduction for their state taxes.
Republicans argued that the federal deduction is important for small business owners in the state.
“This bill removes a key deduction passed in federal law. It’s a deduction designed to level the playing field between large corporations and small businesses,” Rep. Brandi Bradley, a Littleton Republican, said.
But bill sponsor Rep. Emily Sirota, a Denver Democrat, countered that the bill just maintains the status quo in Colorado tax code.
“They still get this benefit at the federal level. In this bill, we’re not making tax policy change. We are simply extending our current tax policy,” she said.
The bill’s fiscal note estimates it will raise about $46 million in the current fiscal year and about $95 million in the next one.
The House has five more bills on its calendar for final votes today. It will likely then head into initial debate on the bills cleared through committee yesterday.









Amended AI bill proposes to delay implementation of 2024 law


By: Sara Wilson - Friday August 22, 2025 5:36 pm





House Bill 25B-1008, one of the dueling artificial intelligence bills introduced by Colorado lawmakers during the special session, was gutted during its House Appropriations Committee hearing on Friday afternoon to become a simple extension of the controversial 2024 law’s effective date.
The bill would now push implementation of Senate Bill 24-205 until October 2026, rather than February 2026. The change was approved on an 8-3 bipartisan vote and now heads to the full House for debate.
“That’s where we are, so that we as a Legislature can come back to this issue and have a proper discussion when have time during a session. Doing this during a special session is quite difficult,” Rep. William Lindstedt, a Broomfield Democrat, said. “I’m asking that we move out the date so we can do this responsibly during the next session.”

Colorado Democrats want to raise revenue for food assistance program during special session


By: Sara Wilson -  4:00 pm





Colorado voters could be asked this November whether the state can keep extra tax money to fully fund universal school meals and offset lost federal funding for food assistance programs.
The Legislature referred Proposition MM to the ballot during its regular lawmaking session earlier this year, seeking to raise more money for the Healthy School Meals for All program. Senate Bill 25B-3, being considered during the current special session, would tweak that proposition to allow any leftover money to cover costs associated with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.

Senate ends work for the day as House sets slugglish pace for bill debate


By: Sara Wilson -  3:55 pm





As of mid-afternoon on Friday, the Senate had adjourned and the House broke into committee work after moving through just two bills in floor debate.
Senate Bill 25B-4, the artificial intelligence bill from Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez, was originally scheduled for its appropriations committee hearing, but that is now delayed as sponsors work through possible amendments.  The bill has an approximate $7 million annual price tag to retain more employees in the Office of Information and Technology and Judicial Department.
The Senate will continue work on Saturday.
The other AI bill, favored by moderates and the governor, is set for its own appropriations committee hearing in the House later on Friday afternoon.
The House got through two bills for initial floor debate and voice votes in four hours. The chamber recessed around 2 p.m. for committee work, including for those four bills passed in the Senate on Friday morning.

Senate gives initial OK to 4 bills on first day of special session


By: Sara Wilson - Thursday August 21, 2025 9:03 pm





By the end of Thursday, the Colorado Legislature made it through the bulk of their committee work for the special session and the Senate gave its initial approval to four bills. Tomorrow morning, the Senate will have formal votes on those bills and the House will begin floor debate on its own set of bills.
The bills the Senate considered on second reading were:

Senate Bill 25B-1: This bill sets a process for the governor to notify and consult with the Joint Budget Committee on mid-year spending cuts needed to overcome a revenue shortfall, like the ones he is poised to do soon after this special session. The governor would be able to suspend and cut state funding, and therefore need to meet with the JBC, if the reserve needs to be tapped by up to 2% of the General Fund budget, or if that reserve is projected to dip below $1 billion.
Senate Bill 25B-2: This would allow the state to pay for Medicaid services from organizations that provide reproductive health care, namely Planned Parenthood, that the federal government has withheld Medicaid money from.
Senate Bill 25B-3: This changes a referred ballot measure in November to ask voters if the state can use extra money collected for universal school meals to also cover costs related to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Senate Bill 25B-5: This bill would reallocate about $260,000 from the wolf reintroduction program to the state health insurance fund. It was amended in committee to still allow the capture and release of wolves this winter.

The Senate still needs to take up Senate Bill 25B-4, the artificial intelligence bill focused on transparency and disclosure. That bill, backed by progressive lawmakers and consumer advocates, would require notification when people interact with AI and allow people to request information about how AI influences important decisions related to things like employment or school admissions. It awaits a hearing in the Appropriations Committee.
Over in the House, committees gave approval to the series of Democrat-backed tax policies. The chamber will start debate on them tomorrow. Those were:

House Bill 25B-1001: This would permanently extend a requirement that high-income taxpayers add back their qualified business income federal tax deductions when calculating their Colorado taxable income.
House Bill 25B-1002: This bill would expand the list of countries that the state considers to be tax havens.
House Bill 25B-1003: This would repeal a tax incentive for insurance companies that have at least 2.5% of their domestic employees in Colorado.
House Bill 25B-1004: This would allow qualifying companies to pay certain state taxes early at a discount.
House Bill 25B-1005: This bill would repeal a provision in state law that allows retailers to keep 4% of their sales tax collections, as a way for the businesses to cover the cost of collecting the taxes.

A House committee also signed off on House Bill 25B-1006, which would loan $100 million from the Unclaimed Property Trust Fund to prevent major health insurance premium increases.
House Bill 25B-1008, the dueling AI bill, also cleared its committee even with some Democrats voting against it. That bill would require companies to tell consumers when they are interacting with AI and fold the technology into the state’s existing anti-discrimination and consumer-protection laws. Bill sponsors removed a provisions that would have only allowed the attorney general, not consumers, from suing developers and deployers that violate consumer-protection laws.
Both HB25-1008 and HB25B-1006 need to pass the Appropriations Committee.
Democrats, who make up a majority in both chambers, also killed Republican-backed bills in committee on Thursday. The entire House State, Civic, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee agenda, for example, was made of Republican bills that died.

Lawmakers back off plan to pause Colorado’s wolf reintroduction program


By: Chase Woodruff -  5:16 pm





Colorado lawmakers gave initial approval Thursday to a bill to redirect a small amount of state money from gray wolf restoration efforts to a health insurance affordability fund, but stopped short of requiring Colorado Parks and Wildlife to pause the capture and release of new wolves this winter.
With the Legislature convened for a special session to cope with a billion-dollar revenue shortfall triggered by changes to the federal tax code, Senate Bill 25B-5 would withhold $264,268 from the state’s general fund previously appropriated for wolf reintroduction. The money would instead be directed to the state’s Health Insurance Affordability Enterprise, which helps subsidize health coverage costs and faces an estimated shortfall of around $100 million after Congress failed to extend federal tax credits for insurance premiums.

Republican-backed artificial intelligence bills killed in committee


By: Sara Wilson -  4:13 pm





Both Republican-backed bills on artificial intelligence died on the first day of the special legislative session, as Senate Bill 25B-8 and House Bill 25B-1009 did not make it through their respective committees.
“Because of the pace of the special session, I did not have the time I needed to refine the language for the standard our small businesses deserve,” Rep. Ron Weinberg, a Loveland Republican, told the House Business Affairs and Labor Committee before he asked members to vote against his bill.
His bill would have narrowed the definition of “consequential decision” in the state’s forthcoming artificial intelligence law to include decisions related to employment or public safety. The Senate bill, backed by Republican Sen. Mark Baisley of Woodland Park, would have broadly prohibited discrimination using any technology.
Lawmakers are considering changes to the state’s artificial intelligence law, which was passed in 2024 and is set to go into effect next February, at the behest of Gov. Jared Polis. The technology business community worry about implementation of the law, which sets rules for companies that use AI in their decision making, while consumer rights advocates say the law it gives necessary guardrails for technology that can inform life-changing decisions.
The Legislature will likely debate and vote on two competing AI-related bills backed by Democrats. Legislation from the sponsors of the 2024, Senate Bill 25B-4, law would strip the law to become essentially a disclosure policy. The other bill, House Bill 25B-1008, would extend existing civil rights laws and consumer protections to AI and require notice if a consumer is interacting with AI in some circumstances.
The Senate bill passed its committee earlier this afternoon. The House bill’s committee hearing was ongoing as of 4:15 p.m. on Thursday.









Colorado Senate committee approves bill to fund Medicaid reimbursements for abortion providers

The Colorado Senate Health and Human Services committee on Thursday approved a bill to use state money to fund Medicaid reimbursements for reproductive health care providers that have recently faced federal funding cuts.
Senate Bill 25B-2  passed the committee on a party-line vote, with Democrats in favor. The bill was introduced because of the “enormously negative impact” of the federal Republican domestic policy law on Coloradans seeking abortion services and other reproductive health care, bill sponsor Sen. Jeff Bridges, a Greenwood Village Democrat, said. The law, which President Donald Trump signed in July, blocks certain abortion providers from receiving Medicaid funding.
The bill would require the Department of Health Care Policy and Financing to use state funds to reimburse health care providers that are prohibited from receiving federal Medicaid reimbursements. The non-partisan Legislative Council Staff estimates the bill would cost the state a maximum of $4.4 million during the current fiscal year, which began on July 1.
Jack Teter, the vice president of government affairs for Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, said 991 appointments had to be canceled in the days after the federal law went into effect. Planned Parenthood’s operations are now in limbo, Teter said, while challenges to the law’s provision affecting abortion providers move through federal courts.
“We can’t keep canceling people’s appointments and then trying to bring them back again,” Teter said. “It’s not sustainable and it’s not fair to our patients. This bill allows the state to cover the difference for the Medicaid reimbursements and ensures we don’t have to close our doors to those patients.”
During the committee hearing, dozens of Planned Parenthood volunteers and reproductive rights advocates sat in the audience, wearing pink clothing and showing their support for the bill. Teter said PPRM expects more than 150 supporters of the bill to come to the Capitol throughout the special session as the bill moves through the Legislature.
“We sent out a call to action to our incredible activists across the state, and people are showing up,” Teter said. “It’s awesome.”

Special session on Colorado budget woes gets underway

The Colorado House and Senate gaveled in for the special session shortly after 10 a.m. After some procedural business, the chambers recessed to start committee work for the first introduced bills.
Earlier this morning, the caucuses laid out their priorities in separate press conferences.
“We’ve got our work cut out for us. We’re back to address a $1 billion budget shortfall thanks to Trump and Republicans in Congress — $1 billion that should be invested in Colorado, for Colorado, but instead is for tax breaks for corporations and the ultra wealthy,” Senate President James Coleman, a Denver Democrat, said.
The Republicans were less optimistic.
“When we walk away from this session, the Democrats will have increased taxes. The Democrats will have done nothing to cut General Fund spending — that’s the $700 million we’re in the red — and the Democrats will not have rebalanced the state’s budget,” Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, a Brighton Republican, said.
In addition to finding solutions to that revenue shortfall, Gov. Jared Polis tasked lawmakers with addressing health insurance premium costs, tweaking the state’s artificial intelligence law and shoring up food assistance program funding.
Committee work will begin around 11:30 a.m.

Vermont is seeking a federal disaster declaration that would reimburse affected municipalities for their expenses from last month’s flooding in Caledonia and Essex counties.
Some communities in the Northeast Kingdom counties experienced flooding on July 10 for the third year in a row. Federal assessors tallied more than $1.8 million in damages to property owned by public entities, according to a press release from Gov. Phil Scott’s office, including more than $1 million in Sutton alone. 
“The damage from last month’s storm impacted small towns with limited financial resources,” Scott said in the release. “Submitting this request is an important step in the process to bring FEMA funds to Vermont to help towns rebuild and recover.”

The federal government approved major disaster declarations for Vermont’s catastrophic summer storms in 2023 and 2024. Vermont is among the states with the most such declarations caused by extreme weather. In the two previous years’ requests, the state asked for reimbursement assistance for both public entities and for individuals. 
If approved, the 2025 declaration will allow eligible towns to receive 75% reimbursement for costs like road repairs and debris removal, according to the state. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will review the request, which must be approved by President Donald Trump.

(Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montanan)Earlier this month, mining company Montana Resources discovered that a fire hydrant hooked up to the City of Butte’s water supply was cross-contaminating the municipal water with mine water, which has high levels of calcium and sulfates, which can cause laxative effects in humans. Calcium can lead to scale and build-up in water lines and appliances.
Now, a group of Butte residents have filed a class-action lawsuit against the mining company in Butte-Silver Bow District Court, asking for damage claims, as well as a punitive judgment against Montana Resources. Montana Resources is owned by Dennis Washington and is part of the Washington Companies. Washington is often listed as the most wealthy person in Montana, with an estimated $7.8 billion in assets, according to Forbes magazine.
Montana Resources operates the open-pit Continental Mine, near the Continental Divide. Since its opening in 1985, the mine has produced more than 2.5 billion pounds of copper and more than 300 million pounds of molybdenum. It has approximately 32 years of production remaining, according to its website.
On Aug. 13, the mining company reported the cross-contamination. It discovered “a cross-connection between the processed water they use for milling and mining and the municipal water supply.”
“The cross-connection was the result of an over pressurization event, which allowed contaminants to be flushed from the defendants’ mine into the potable water system of Butte-Silver Bow,” court documents said.
At 4 p.m., Aug. 13, the Butte-Silver Bow authorities, along with the Department of Environmental Quality, issued a warning to Butte residents not to consume tap water.  According to court documents, this contaminants could contain “total coliform bacteria, fecal coliform bacteria and other chemicals.”
The potential class-action lawsuit is not only concerned about the health affects and costs, including providing bottled water, but also the damage done to residences through the scale and chemicals that can build up in water lines or interfere with appliances.
“The plaintiffs and class members were damaged because Montana Resources’ actions and inactions resulted in the likely contamination of the Butte-silver Bow municipal water supply, and distribution of water that was not, and still is not, assuredly safe in quality for domestic consumption,” the lawsuit said.
Montana Resources was contacted by the Daily Montanan on Friday. By publication on Monday, the company had not responded.
“Plaintiffs and class members have also expended time and money to respond to the water contaminated by Montana Resources not being assuredly safe, including incurring out-of-pocket costs for bottled water, among other things,” the court documents said. “If ordinary care was used, contaminated water would not have been discharged into plaintiff’s and class members’ water, posing a risk of harm to their health.”
It will be up to District Court Judge Frank Joseph to determine whether the lawsuit meets the standards for a class-action suit.

Each of the four nominees has experience as in the federal courts. Rodriguez serves as a magistrate judge for the Western District while Orso clerked for Judge Robert J. Conrad, then the court’s chief judge. Bragdon and Freeman are both federal prosecutors, with the former currently the appellate chief at U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District and the latter an assistant U.S. attorney in the Middle District.
The announcement comes as Trump has renewed his focus on shaping the federal courts. Throughout July and August, he has hammered Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) over the Senate’s “blue slip” judicial nomination process, whereby senators must sign off on district court appointees in their states.
“I have a Constitutional Right to appoint Judges and U.S. Attorneys, but that RIGHT has been completely taken away from me in States that have just one Democrat United States Senator. This is because of an old and outdated “custom” known as a BLUE SLIP, that Senator Chuck Grassley, of the Great State of Iowa, refuses to overturn,” Trump posted Sunday. “Chuck Grassley should allow strong Republican candidates to ascend to these very vital and powerful roles, and tell the Democrats, as they often tell us, to go to HELL!”
That the four vacancies in North Carolina are available for Trump is itself a product of the blue slip rule. All of the seats were vacated under President Joe Biden while Democrats held a majority in the U.S. Senate — as did a Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals seat — and the state’s senators declined to sign off on Biden’s proposed candidates. (The Fourth Circuit vacancy was eliminated when Judge James Wynn Jr. reversed his decision to retire following the election.)
All four of Trump’s picks were recommended by Sens. Thom Tillis and Ted Budd, despite the former’s break with the President over Medicaid cuts led him to announced his planned retirement from the Senate. Despite that clash, Tillis has continued to support Trump’s judicial nominees, even amid significant controversy. Tillis cast the deciding vote in favor of Third Circuit Court of Appeals nominee Emil Bove, whose fitness and character more than 80 former federal and state judges and roughly 900 former Department of Justice officials spoke out against.

“These four nominees are well-qualified to fill these important judicial vacancies in North Carolina, and I have confidence they will serve our great state with distinction,” Tillis said in a press release. “I want to thank the White House for their partnership in working to select these outstanding nominees and look forward to getting them through the Judiciary Committee and confirmed on the Senate floor.”
“Ensuring principled constitutionalist judges are confirmed to the federal courts is a privilege and responsibility I take very seriously,” Budd said. “I am grateful to President Trump for his inspired choices, and to Sen. Tillis for his partnership as we work to confirm these nominees in the Senate.”
Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond and an observer of the federal courts, said the nominees appear similar to the types of judges Trump named in his first term, with relevant credentials and likely conservative judicial philosophies. He said he would expect them to be confirmed within the year, absent any red flags emerging.
“They look like they’ll be relatively easy to confirm, I would think, and don’t seem highly controversial,” Tobias said. “Those look like pretty typical picks in a Republican administration.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG-3443-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-25 17:56:50.753080

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-25 20:59:18+00:00,CT Mirror,Blumenthal: Trump decision to halt offshore wind project is ‘insane’,John Moritz and Jan Ellen Spiegel,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/25/revolution-wind-trump-halt-lamont/,Roughly 50 workers were told not to show up for the planned start of a 2-week shift assembling the turbines for the Revolution Wind project.,"The sudden decision by the Trump administration to halt work on a nearly completed wind farm under assembly in New London has left state officials and the developers scrambling to find a way to convince federal authorities to reverse course — and keep the multibillion-dollar project afloat.
On Monday, officials said they had yet to find such a resolution or even a clearer understanding for why the decision was made to target the project, Revolution Wind.
“I think some of the key facets of the federal government were taken by surprise by this decision as well,” Gov. Ned Lamont told reporters at the State Pier in New London, where a backdrop of hundred-foot-tall turbine shafts and propeller blades stood ready to be transported offshore and installed into pilings already fixed to the seabed.
“We’re trying to get all the players together, but I’ve talked to almost everybody,” he added.
The most immediate impact of the order was to roughly 50 workers, who were told not to show up on Monday for the expected start of a two-week shift assembling the turbines several miles off the coast of Rhode Island, according to Keith Brothers, president of the Connecticut Building and Construction Trades Council.
Brothers said it was unclear whether those crews — made up of union workers from New York, Connecticut and Rhode Island — had been laid off or were being told to stand by for further orders. But he said that if work doesn’t resume soon, the workers are likely to move on to other jobs.
“We train those workers for survival training, to work in the open water, and they’ll go somewhere else,” he said. “Now we have to retrain those other workers, so it’s a bad circle of letting people go that you’ve trained and then trying to re-initiate [them] into those programs.”
A letter sent from the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Management to the project’s developer, Ørsted, on Friday ordered an immediate halt to any work taking place on the outer continental shelf. The letter cited unspecified concerns having to do with “national security interests” and “interference” with the use of various maritime areas.
A spokesperson for BOEM declined to comment further on the order Monday.
The letter did not expressly prohibit Ørsted from continuing onshore activities related to Revolution Wind or another project, Sunrise Wind, which is being readied for installation. About 150 onshore workers in and around the State Pier are expected to continue working for the time being, Brothers said.
The Trump administration’s order has also further worsened the already troubled financial situation of Ørsted, a Danish company that is among the world’s leading developers of offshore wind.
On Monday the company’s stock dropped more than 16%. That was on top of a nosedive earlier this month when the company said it would need more than $9 billion to help finance Sunrise Wind. Overall the stock is down more than 50% in the last year.
In a statement Monday, an Ørsted spokeswoman said Revolution Wind supports more than 2,500 jobs around the U.S., including “hundreds” of local offshore jobs. “All these jobs remain in the balance from this stop-work order,” said the spokeswoman, Meaghan Wims.
The company had previously issued a statement on Friday saying it was evaluating its options for the project, which is about 80% complete.
The decision to halt work on Revolution Wind was not the first time the Trump administration has targeted a wind project that was already under construction.
Earlier this year, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum ordered the Norwegian energy company Equinor to suspend work on its Empire Wind project being staged at the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal for construction off the coast of Long Island.
The administration reversed course about a month later, allowing the project to proceed following negotiations with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul over permitting approvals for a pair of natural gas pipelines, the Wall Street Journal reported. (Hochul’s office has denied making explicit agreements to approve new gas pipelines.)
The delay cost Equinor a reported $1 billion in additional regulatory and tariff costs.
Lamont, a supporter of developing pipeline infrastructure, has previously suggested he was aware of ongoing talks between Hochul and the Trump administration involving Empire Wind.
After getting word last week that Trump’s BOEM had halted work on Revolution Wind, Lamont said he spoke to Hochul. Still, he told reporters Monday, he has “no idea” what concessions, if any, the Trump administration would be seeking in order to allow work to resume on the project.
“You never quite know with this administration, but I think there’s a deal to be had,” Lamont said. “I’ve got to see what the ask is.” 
Regardless of any future deal, Democratic leaders in Connecticut and Rhode Island expressed outrage over the decision to cancel work on a project with significant implications for the the local economy and the regional electric grid.
U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who formerly served as the state’s attorney general, called the administration’s decision to halt work on a fully-permitted project “insane,” and one that would likely be overturned in court. 
His colleague, U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, said any attempt by the Trump administration to use the project as part of a quid-pro-quo with state officials would be illegal. “The president of the United States doesn’t have the legal authority to suspend a project that’s permitted and then use it as a leverage point on some unrelated grievance he has with a Democratic state,” Murphy said.
While no legal action has action has been taken against the stop work order, both Ørsted and Connecticut Attorney General William Tong’s office indicated over the weekend they are considering their legal options. So is the New England-based Conservation Law Foundation. 
“It definitely seems illegal,” said Kate Sinding Daly, the group’s senior vice president for law and policy. “There’s no valid statutory or executive authority for issuing a stop work order under these circumstances.”
Earlier this year, Tong’s office joined its counterparts in other states to challenge the Trump’s administration’s broader moratorium on new offshore wind leases. That lawsuit is still pending.
As part of power purchase agreements signed with both states, Revolution Wind was due to deliver about 300 megawatts of electricity to Connecticut and 400 megawatts to Rhode Island upon its completion in 2026. 
If the project is mothballed, officials said Monday that both states and their power utilities will have to procure other, potentially costlier, sources of electricity to meet customer demand. 
In a statement on Monday, regional grid operator ISO New England said that Revolution Wind’s expected output had already been included in forecasts for near-term and future electric demand, and that any delays to the project could put the grid’s reliability at risk.
“As demand for electricity grows, New England must maintain and add to its energy infrastructure,” the statement said. “Unpredictable risks and threats to resources — regardless of technology — that have made significant capital investments, secured necessary permits, and are close to completion will stifle future investments, increase costs to consumers, and undermine the power grid’s reliability and the region’s economy now and in the future.”
Late in the day Monday, Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration may have its sights on stopping a third offshore wind project. According to the article, Trump’s Interior Department plans to remand and vacate a permit granted by the Biden administration for a $6 billion, 114-turbine project off Maryland.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/LAMONT-WIND-0825-DE-SONY-089-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-25 17:56:50.753080
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-25 20:58:25+00:00,CT Mirror,Murphy warns of ‘food crisis for kids’ caused by ‘Big Beautiful Bill’,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/25/big-beautiful-bill-kids-food-crisis/,CT lawmakers and advocates say Trump's tariffs and the 'big beautiful bill' will hurt students and teachers as they return to school.,"Last week, Angel of Edgewood, a Hartford nonprofit fighting poverty and hunger, distributed more than 6,000 pounds of fresh produce at its annual back-to-school event.
Founder and CEO Jendayi Scott-Miller said the number sounds high but is actually “heartbreaking” — the organization has typically provided thousands more pounds of food at its past events. Community partner organizations that hand out school supplies say they also need to significantly scale back.
Scott-Miller attributed the reduction in food and supplies to rising costs, caused in part by tariffs. Many of these items needed for the school year are imported into the U.S. and now face steeper tariffs recently imposed by the Trump administration.
“For the first time, our distributors could not match our purchase request because of skyrocketing costs and tariffs,” Scott-Miller said Monday. “When children are starting the school year with less food on their tables, we are not just failing them, we are failing our future.”
Connecticut lawmakers and local groups are pushing back against some of the policies and legislation from the Trump administration that they argue will hurt families, students and teachers as they return to the classroom.
In addition to sweeping new tariffs on U.S. imports from dozens of countries, they also pointed to the implications of President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” on public education and food assistance. The cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, also put at risk eligibility for free and reduced-price school meals.
“There are tens of millions of kids all across the country who are going to have less food on the table when they get up in the morning, when they come home at night, because the average SNAP benefit will be much lower for families all across this country,” U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said Monday at the state Capitol.
Murphy argued there is “a coming food crisis for kids. Lawmakers and advocates noted that children that go hungry have a harder time concentrating on assignments and homework, whether that’s because they don’t get enough to eat at home or at school.”
“We cannot build a strong education system, or a strong country, if our foundation in education is weak. We know hungry kids can’t focus as well,” said Miguel Cardona, the former U.S. Secretary of Education and the former commissioner of the Connecticut State Department of Education.
SNAP allows students to automatically enroll in free school meals without needing to fill out an application to qualify. Losing access to a program like SNAP would mean a student is no longer directly certified in the school meals program. They would then need to fill out the paperwork to see if they are eligible.
In higher poverty areas, school districts can qualify for the Community Eligibility Provision, a federal program that allows a school to offer free meals to all enrolled students. Dozens of school districts in Connecticut were approved in the prior school year for a universal free school meals program under CEP.
Because of changes to SNAP in the new federal law, some of those universal school meal programs could face higher costs and lose access to the Community Eligibility Program, which could affect an estimated 18 million students, according to a May report from the think tank Urban Institute.
“Although individual students would remain income-eligible for free school meals, the changes to SNAP could leave fewer students automatically enrolled for these meals, especially if students enrolled in both SNAP and Medicaid were to lose both benefits,” according to Urban Institute’s report. “Further, reduced participation rates in SNAP and Medicaid could increase school meal costs in schools, districts, and states.”
The “Big Beautiful Bill” will make major changes to both SNAP recipients and the state agencies that administer the program in the coming years. While the state is still waiting for federal guidance on expanded work requirements to access SNAP, Connecticut could also pick up a much larger portion of the tab when it comes to those benefits in the next several years.
The state could face nearly $180 million in annual extra costs to its food stamps program within the next five years, according to a preliminary analysis of federal budget cuts by Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration.
Tariffs are also hitting some imported food items and school supplies.
For years, teachers have used their own money to pay for additional supplies and resources for their classrooms that their schools haven’t been able to cover.
And now with the new tariff policies, they say, the higher costs will keep falling on teachers as well as families. U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., referred to it as a “back-to-school tax.”
“This stuff is imported whether it’s apparel, crayons, calculators, strawberries, grapes. Whether the tariff is 15% or 50%, the ones who pay for are the students, their parents, teachers and the American people,” Blumenthal said Monday.
In response to the “Big Beautiful Bill” and other policies, state legislators are weighing how Connecticut will make up shortfalls to federal assistance for programs like SNAP and Medicaid.
But lawmakers on Monday wouldn’t weigh in on whether the General Assembly should take up the issue of more funding for school meals during a special session anticipated for the fall.
Cardona generally said there’s a role for the state but noted the “additional burdens” placed on states that may have to take up certain services in the absence of the U.S. Department of Education.
The state’s U.S. senators said they will be focused on the debate over funding the federal government when they return to Congress after Labor Day.
“That will be a chance for us to say to our Republican colleagues, ‘Do you want our vote on that budget? Then you have to roll back some of the health care cuts that are going to devastate families in this country,'” Murphy said.
Blumenthal agreed that filling the gaps shouldn’t fall squarely on the states. He said Connecticut is better positioned than others because of its rainy day fund, but, “It doesn’t have endless resources.”
“It’s about parents having to make a choice between dinners and bearing school supplies,” said Julieth Callejas, executive director of End Hunger CT! “In a state that is so full of wealth and opportunities, our children should not be worrying about their meals.”

Credit: Shannon Downey/ USFWSA new lawsuit filed late last week against the U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says that a logging project in western Montana should be halted because it’s just one of more than a dozen projects that have chipped away at habitat for native bull trout, which are on the federal Endangered Species list.
The lawsuit filed by the Alliance for the Wild Rockies in federal court says that the Redd Bull 2 Project, which has been sited west of St. Regis, would authorize logging on 6,408 acres of land, which would include the use of prescribed fire and commercial thinning.
Furthermore, the conservation group says that the federal agencies have acknowledged that the project will likely continue to hurt already imperiled populations of bull trout as well as adversely affecting grizzly bears in the area, also protected by the Endangered Species Act.
The lawsuit says that road construction, including construction of new roads, road maintenance on 111 miles, as well as “road realignment” will increase the amount of sediment that will wash into the watersheds where bull trout are already struggling. Furthermore, the lawsuit said that 17 different smaller projects in the area have all contributed to gradual but substantial habitat loss for the endangered fish.
And while the U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service do not comment on pending litigation, the agencies filed documents about the project’s scope, which say despite the habitat becoming temporary degraded, the overall project will be “beneficial through improved habitat conditions.”
According to the lawsuit, the project includes three of the most important bull trout spawning areas in the Middle Clark Fork River Core area — Ward Creek, North Fork Little Joe Creek and the South Fork of Little Joe Creek.
In written comments, the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks noted that the project includes streams that “act as essential spawning and rearing areas providing wild trout to the fishery that underlies an important part of the local economy.”
By the Forest Service’s own estimations, sediment deposits would increase 26% during the 15-year project in the South Fork Little Joe Creek; 26% during that same period for North Fork Little Joe Creek, and 106% in Ward Creek.
A 2008 species analysis completed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service showed that the bull trout in the area are “at risk because of very limited and/or declining numbers, range, and/or habitat, making the bull trout in this core area vulnerable to extirpation.” Last year, the FWS updated that estimate and found that bull trout populations in the area are “significantly decreasing,” being wiped out in some areas of the streams in the past 15 to 30 years, according to court documents.
To help bolster its case, attorneys for the Alliance for the Wild Rockies reported that Montana FWP has stopped counts in Cedar Creek and both forks of Little Joe Creek “because so few fluvial bull trout were present that conducting annual … counts was not productive.”
The lawsuit asks federal magistrate Kathleen DeSoto to halt the project, noting that it violates federal law, and force the Forest Service to vacate the finding of “No Significant Impact” until the project’s plan complies with the law.
“Bull trout lost an estimated 60% of their historical habitat range before they were even listed as ‘threatened’ on the Endangered Species List,” said Mike Garrity, executive director of the Alliance for the Wild Rockies. “Yet the Forest Service wants to bulldoze and clearcut some of Montana’s few remaining, most pristine, bull trout watersheds that flow out of the Great Burn of 1910 area. Given the bull trout’s struggle against extinction, we’re going to court to halt this highly destructive project.”

(Screenshot | WisEye)A Dane County judge ruled last week that the criminal cases will be allowed to continue against two former attorneys and a campaign staff member of President Donald Trump for orchestrating the scheme to have Wisconsin Republicans cast false Electoral College votes for Trump in 2020. 
John D. Hyland denied the motion to dismiss in an Aug. 22 order. Last year, Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul filed criminal charges against Kenneth Cheseboro, Jim Troupis and Mike Roman. 
Cheseboro, a Wisconsin native, was one of the main planners of the false elector scheme. The scheme led to Electoral College votes being cast for Trump in seven states and began the series of events that led to the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Troupis, a former Dane County judge, worked as an attorney for the Trump campaign. Roman allegedly delivered the false paperwork from Wisconsin Republicans to the staff member of a Pennsylvania congressman in order to get them to Vice President Mike Pence on Jan. 6. 
The three men each face 11 criminal charges related to felony forgery. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of six years in prison and a $10,000 fine. 
“Troupis does not show that the First Amendment protects the right to commit forgery, does not show that the government violated his right to due process by entrapping him into that forgery, and does not show prosecutors must exercise discretion to charge an accused of his preferred offense,” Hyland wrote in his order denying the motion to dismiss.

John Hoffman, DFL-Champlin, gives a thumbs-up to Democratic National Committee members as he takes the stage in his first public appearance since he was shot nine times in June. (Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer)In Sen. John Hoffman’s first major public appearance since he and his family were the survivors of attempted political assassinations in June, Hoffman urged top Democratic officials from around the country to re-establish trust — in institutions, and among people. 
“In this political climate, we must recommit ourselves to governance over grievance, to service over self, and to action over anger,” Hoffman said in a speech closing out the first general session of the Democratic National Committee summer meeting in Minneapolis. 
Hoffman spoke in the same hotel where he and other Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor elected officials had gathered for a celebratory dinner on June 13, hours before a masked man shot him and his wife, Yvette, and killed DFL House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark.
Hortman was frequently invoked in the meeting’s opening session, which featured speeches from DNC Chair Ken Martin, Gov. Tim Walz, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, state Rep. Zack Stephenson of Coon Rapids and Texas House Minority Leader Gene Wu.
“We have not moved on from it,” Walz said of the assassinations. “It is not a new news cycle for us. We are forever changed by it, but we are a hearty people.”
Hoffman spent many weeks in the hospital after sustaining nine gunshot wounds; his wife was shot eight times. Bullets narrowly missed their daughter, Hope. 
Sporting a splint on a finger of his left hand — he has a rod in it — Hoffman listed three values he wants Democrats to revive: courage, truth, and listening to the American people. 
“I heard from many people from across this country since June 14, and Americans across the political spectrum are thirsting for those things,” Hoffman said
His example of courage: An early-career Hubert Humphrey standing up at the Democratic National Convention in 1948 and challenging the party to adopt a strong civil rights agenda. 
The Minnesota speakers offered remembrances of Hortman and offered lessons from her leadership.
DNC Chair Ken Martin ended his speech with a common Hortman refrain: “Power is fleeting, and you never know when you’ll have it again.”
“So use your power,” Martin said. “Use your power, when you have it, to make the biggest difference you can for as many people as you can.”
Minnesota Democrats did that in 2023, passing a sweeping progressive agenda with a single-vote majority in the state Senate. 
Now, the problem for Democrats is figuring out what power they have to resist President Trump’s agenda without control of Congress. The party of the president in office typically suffers midterm losses, but Trump is angling to retain power in the House by having red states redraw electoral maps in their favor. 
Martin supports blue states like California responding in kind, saying, “We can’t be the only party that’s playing by the rules.”
On Monday, Klobuchar — who has introduced a bill to rein in gerrymandering — also voiced her support for California’s redistricting response. 
“While we wait to get (this bill) in place and put some national rules of the road in place, we will not back down,” Klobuchar said. “We will not let them set the playing field.”
Clawing back power is going to take more than redrawing maps, and Martin must find a way to unite party officials and rank-and-file Democrats who are divided over Israel’s destruction of Gaza, and deal with the party’s lackluster financial situation and lagging fundraising.
At the party meetings this week, delegates will debate the party’s position on Israel; consider which states should have the first presidential primary elections in 2028; and search for a path to mobilizing nonvoters and those who have drifted from the party.
For Hoffman, the path to regaining that support comes from resisting polarization and finding common ground — and working for the prosperity of the common person rather than the wealthiest class.
“I believe all Americans and Minnesotans want to talk to each other again without being demeaned and without the threat of violence,” Hoffman said.

Dwight Evans (D-Philadelphia), who declared he would be retiring at the end of his current term.","Sen. Sharif Street and senate Democrats at a press conference opposing the proposed U.S. budget on Monday, June 30State Sen. Sharif Street (D-Philadelphia), who is seeking his party’s nomination to run for Congress, announced Monday he will step down from his role as Pennsylvania Democratic Party chair.
“This was not an easy decision–but it is the right one,” Street wrote in a post on social media. “I took on this role to build a Democratic Party that was more inclusive, more united, and more powerful.”
“Together, we’ve done exactly that — delivering historic victories, strengthening our grassroots, and expanding our coalition across Pennsylvania,” he added. “I’m proud of the progress we’ve made and confident the party is strong, energized, and ready to meet the challenges ahead. Now it’s time to make space for the next chapter of leadership so we can keep building on that progress.”
Street is one of several Democrats in the race to succeed U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (D-Philadelphia), who declared he would be retiring at the end of his current term. Street announced his candidacy for the 3rd District seat in July along with state Rep. Chris Rabb (D-Philadelphia).
Since Street entered the race for Congress, DNC Chairman Ken Martin and Gov. Josh Shapiro questioned whether it was best for him to continue leading the state party while he is competing with other Democratic candidates in an 2026 open primary election.
Street, first elected to the state Senate in 2016, has held a leadership role with the state Democratic Party for the past seven years. In 2018, he was elected to serve as the vice chair of the state Democratic Party, as Nancy Patton Mills was elected to serve as Chair.
In 2022, Street made history by becoming the first Black man and Muslim to win the race for Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairman. He defeated the state party’s Southeast Caucus Chair Jerry Lawrence for the position by a 174-138 vote, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. Lawrence had the support of then-Attorney General Josh Shapiro, Gov. Tom Wolf, and U.S. Sen. Bob Casey.
Street’s tenure at the helm of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party featured two vastly different election cycles. In 2022, Shapiro cruised to a double digit victory over state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R-Franklin) to keep a Democrat in the governor’s mansion for a third consecutive term, while John Fetterman flipped a U.S. Senate seat blue with his win over Republican Mehmet Oz.
In 2024, Republicans had a clean sweep in Pennsylvania with Donald Trump securing the state’s 19 electoral votes, plus GOP candidates winning all three row offices and flipping a U.S. Senate seat red with Dave McCormick’s victory over three-term incumbent Bob Casey. Republicans also flipped two seats in the U.S. House that year, although Democrats maintained their one-seat majority in the state House.
The Philadelphia Inquirer reports that Street plans to endorse former state Auditor General Eugene DePasquale to succeed him at the next state committee meeting Sept. 6 in Lancaster.

Article Summary

The U.S. Department of Justice is seeking access to Illinois’ complete, unredacted statewide voter registration database, including voters’ personal information such as dates of birth, driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers.
The Illinois State Board of Elections has so far maintained that both state and federal laws prohibit it from releasing such personal information.
DOJ claims it has the legal authority to demand the information as part of its effort to enforce federal laws requiring states to maintain accurate and up-to-date voter registration lists, but it has not said why the sensitive personal information is needed for that effort.


SPRINGFIELD — Federal officials are continuing to press their demand for Illinois’ unredacted voter registration database, which includes  sensitive personal information, and are now giving state officials until Monday, Sept. 1, to comply.
In an email Thursday, Aug. 21, Michael E. Gates, an attorney in the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, rejected the Illinois State Board of Elections’ request for additional time to research the legal issues involved in the demand to determine what data it can lawfully turn over.
“The electronic form of Illinois’s Voter Registration List already exists and can be easily transmitted to the Justice Department by following the instructions in our (July 28) letter,” Gates wrote. “The legal authorities presented by the Justice Deprtment’s (sic) for the transmittal of the VRL are clear. Having said this, we will extend the time to respond for Illinois to September 1st.”

The Justice Department has said it wants the state’s complete voter registration database – including “all fields contained within the list” – so it can determine whether the state is complying with provisions of the 1993 National Voter Registration Act.
That law requires states to keep those lists accurate and up to date. That includes occasionally purging the list of registrations of people who have died or moved.
In addition to the database, DOJ also asked the state in its July 28 letter to identify the number of people purged from the rolls due to being noncitizens, adjudicated as incompetent or having felony convictions. And the agency asked for a list of all state and local election officials who have been responsible for carrying out list maintenance functions since the November 2022 elections.
The elections board responded to that request on Aug. 11 by providing most of the information DOJ sought, including a copy of the same voter registration database that state law allows it to release to political committees and other government agencies.
That list includes voters’ names, addresses, voting history and the date when they registered to vote. It does not include other sensitive personal information contained in voters’ records such as their dates of birth, driver’s license numbers and the last four digits of their Social Security numbers.
The board cited both federal and state laws for redacting that sensitive information including the federal Privacy Act, the Illinois Identity Protection Act and the Illinois Personal Information Protection Act.
But DOJ wrote  on Aug. 14  the state’s response was insufficient and insisted on access to the entire, unredacted database, “including the registrant’s full name, date of birth, residential address, his or her state driver’s license number or the last four digits of the registrant’s social security number as required under the Help America Vote Act (“HAVA”) to register individuals for federal elections.”
HAVA is a 2002 federal law that was enacted in the wake of the contested 2000 presidential election. Among other things, it sets minimum standards for states to follow in several areas of election administration, including voting equipment and maintaining statewide voter registration databases.
DOJ has not said why that information is necessary for it to investigate the state’s compliance with requirements for maintaining up-to-date voter registration rolls.

(Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — An active shooter scare at South Carolina’s flagship university over the weekend was a swatting hoax, University of South Carolina police said.
The USC Police Department received two calls around 6:30 p.m. Sunday reporting gunfire at the college’s main Thomas Cooper Library, during students’ first week on campus. Both calls came from an unknown man and included background noise that mimicked gunfire.
Within minutes the school sent out a message to students and parents on its campus-wide alert system saying, “An active shooter has been reported on the University of South Carolina’s Columbia campus. Avoid the area. Evacuate the area or seek safe shelter and barricade yourself in a safe area as necessary until further notice. Defend yourself if you encounter the suspect. Obey public safety officials’ commands.”
About 30 minutes later, the school sent an update saying there was no evidence of a gunman or shooting. Law enforcement continued to search, clearing the library.
Police gave the “all clear” at 8:05 p.m.
Two students sustained minor injuries related to the evacuation and have since been released from the hospital, according to a statement from the university.
“These types of situations require split-second decisions with limited information, and our police officers, communications center staff, and emergency management unit acted swiftly to protect students, faculty, and staff,” according to a statement from the school.
USC is not the only college to receive a false active shooter report in the last week. The hoax is called swatting because the calls are designed to get a heavy response from law enforcement, to include SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics) teams.
Two hoax calls came in to Villanova University in Pennsylvania, one Sunday morning and one the previous Thursday.
Police at the University of Tennessee last Thursday received a call reporting a man shot an AR-15 on campus. That report, too, was found to be fake.
And on Monday, Iowa State University students became the latest victims of a false report.
This is also not South Carolina’s first experience with swatting. In October 2022, a wave of hoax calls came in to more than a dozen K-12 schools across the state, creating mass chaos.
USC police say they have no evidence that these latest calls originated on campus.
During the event, people posted photos and video of a USC student carrying an umbrella on social media. According to the school, the student had no role in the incident.
Among those who reposted an image of the student was U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., who is running for governor.
After the second alert saying police had found no evidence of a shooter, Mace then posted: “Real, or a hoax, or a mistake, now would be an appropriate time to talk about hardened security at schools of all grades, colleges and universities.”
“As the mom of a student at USC, tonight was terrifying,” Mace wrote in a follow-up post. “Frantically calling my child to see if they were at the library or barricaded somewhere else on campus, making sure they and their roommates were safe, your heart just drops to the ground, for a minute you can’t breathe.”
Other gubernatorial candidates also posted on social media following the alert: U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman of Rock Hill, Attorney General Alan Wilson, and Lt. Gov. Pam Evette posted messages urging calm, offering prayers and thanking law enforcement.
Police agencies that responded include the Columbia Police Department, the Richland County Sheriff’s Department, the State Law Enforcement Division, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
The investigation, in conjunction with the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, is ongoing, according to the university.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/russell-house-1024x762.jpg,,,2025-08-25 16:56:36.599890

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig announced Monday the state agriculture department has initiated a pilot project that will pay farmers to implement buffer strips along streams that feed the municipal water supplies of Des Moines and Cedar Rapids. 
The buffer strips must be between 30 to 100 feet wide and on land that is currently in row-crop production. According to a press release on the announcement, the buffer strips are intended to prevent nutrients from entering the waterways upstream of the cities. 
The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship said it has initially allocated $3 million from the Iowa Water Quality Initiative for the pilot. Farmers, depending on the type of buffer strip, can garner up to $3,500 per acre enrolled.

If every participant elected for streamside buffers that would not be harvested for forage, the initial allocation for the pilot could fund projects on 850 acres. 
Naig said the project will help to “accelerate the adoption of streamside buffers in fields and watersheds” that will benefit downstream water users. 
These buffers, sometimes referred to as riparian buffers, are long strips of land that are planted with vegetation or trees along a waterway. The natural vegetation helps to absorb soil and nutrients that could otherwise run off of a field and into a waterway.
Naig said IDALS has invested more than $65.8 million in the Cedar Rapids and Des Moines watersheds since 2003. 
“We recognize there’s still a tremendous amount of work to do, especially in these watersheds because they provide source water for the state’s largest metropolitan areas,” Naig said in the release. “The Streamside Buffer Initiative is yet another example of my commitment to empowering farmers and landowners to adopt the conservation practices that are right for their fields in a way that has meaningful impact on soil health and water quality.”
The new program comes shortly after Polk County released a study on its source waters, the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers, that pointed to agriculture as the primary polluter. Linn County officials have announced plans for a similar water quality study. 
In July, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency revoked a previous decision that labeled sections of the Des Moines, Raccoon and Cedar rivers, among several other rivers, as impaired waters due to high concentrations of nitrates. 
Des Moines Water Works publicly opposed this decision, saying it did not align with the “operational and financial” challenges the utility has encountered in providing safe drinking water to the metro area. 
While similar federal programs exist, the press release from IDALS said the Streamside Buffer Initiative is designed to be more flexible to “encourage even more farmers and landowners to participate.” 
Farmers, and landowners, with row crops on at least one side of a stream in Dubuque County, or the North Raccoon, Boone, Middle Cedar and Turkey watersheds are eligible for the program. All buffers must be maintained for at least 10 years.

Producers who harvest their buffers for hay or forage, will receive one-time payments of $250 per acre to establish the buffer and $1,500 per acre for foregone income. Farmers who do not harvest their buffers can receive a one-time establishment payment of $500 per acre and $3,000 per acre for foregone income. 
Participating landowners are also encouraged to implement complimentary conservation practices like bioreactors and saturated buffers, which also help to keep nutrients out of waterways.
Landowners interested in the Streamside Buffer Initiative can reach out to their local U.S. Department of Agriculture service center for enrollment information.

The company says it’s Cybercab, a “fully autonomous” taxi service, is coming “in the future.” (Photo courtesy of Tesla)Elon Musk, who says he hopes to make Tesla robotaxis available to half of America by year’s end, is soliciting job applicants to test his driverless cars on the streets of Southern Nevada. An advertisement on the company’s website seeks a “Data Collection Supervisor, Autopilot (Night Shift)” in Henderson.
The person hired for the position would “accelerate our vehicle-level testing” and manage “a team of vehicle operators.”
Battered by lagging sales, a tumble in stock prices, and fallout over his political activity, Musk is out to expand his fleet of autonomous taxis to a handful of metropolitan areas, including Houston, Miami, and New York City, according to the job listings.
“We’re getting the regulatory permission to launch in the Bay Area, Nevada, Arizona, and a number of, and Florida. and a number of other places,” Musk said last month, according to a transcript of Tesla’s second quarter earnings call. “So as we get the approvals and we prove our safety, then we’ll be launching autonomous ride-hailing in most of the country. And I think we’ll probably have autonomous ride-hailing in probably half the population of the U.S. by the end of the year. That’s at least our goal, subject to regulatory approvals.”
Despite the assertion, Tesla has filed no applications in California to operate driverless taxis, though it’s launched a scaled-down, human-operated version akin to a standard taxi in San Francisco.
The Current was unable to locate any applications filed by Tesla with the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles, which issues permits to autonomous vehicle companies to test and operate their services. However, a spokesperson for the DMV told Bloomberg that discussions regarding robotaxis took place in July among Gov. Joe Lombardo’s office, the DMV, and Tesla.
Lombardo did not respond to requests for comment.
Tesla would also require approval from the Nevada Transportation Authority to operate as an autonomous vehicle network company.
Robotaxis on the Las Vegas Strip would solidify what some suggest is an effort by Musk, the world’s richest man, to put local cab and rideshare companies out of business. The Current reported earlier this month that a subsidiary of Musk’s Boring Company, which is building a labyrinth of tunnels beneath the Strip, is seeking a permit to operate a human-driven taxi and special event transportation service.
Jonathan Schwartz, director of Yellow Checker Star Transportation, Southern Nevada’s largest cab company, says he’s not confident his drivers and their passengers would be safe sharing streets with driverless Teslas.
Nevada law, he noted, “is extremely permissive to automation. The only avenue to change it would be at the next legislative session, if they amended the current legislation.”
In 2011, Nevada became the first state to allow the testing and operation of self-driving technology on highways. In 2013, the law was amended to require a human operator be along for the ride.
Lawmakers removed that requirement in 2017, permitting operation without a human operator in vehicles capable of “achieving a minimal risk condition upon a failure of its automated driving system,” meaning the vehicle can safely come to a stop.
A bill introduced this year by Las Vegas Democratic state Sen. James Ohrenschall sought to address safety concerns by requiring a human operator in vehicles with eight or more passengers, and in some autonomous commercial vehicles on highways. The measure died in committee.
Currently, Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet, which is the parent company of Google, is the big fish in the driverless taxi lane. The service has operated in a number of cities since 2017, and is testing its cars in Southern Nevada. Zoox, Amazon’s contender in the driverless taxi space, recently began ferrying passengers on the Strip.
 A field of its own

Full self-driving (FSD) is the “future of transport” according to Tesla. But it remains an elusive concept today, despite Tesla’s efforts to bill its vehicles as self-driving.
Tesla did not respond to requests for comment on this story.
“Cars and trucks that drive us — instead of us driving them — may offer transformative safety opportunities at their maturity,” says the website of the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA). “At this time, even the highest level of driving automation available to consumers requires the full engagement and undivided attention of drivers.”
Tesla faces lawsuits from regulators, shareholders, and litigants alleging injury or death at the hands of Tesla FSD technology.
Last week, a judge ordered Tesla to face a certified class action suit from California drivers who said Musk misled them about the self-driving capabilities of his company’s electric vehicles.
U.S. District Judge Rita Lin said the question of whether Tesla lacked sensors to achieve high-level autonomy plus its inability to “demonstrate a long-distance autonomous drive with any of its vehicles” justified lawsuits by two groups of motorists who bought its Full Self-Driving package.
The California Department of Motor Vehicles is suing Tesla for false advertising, claiming the company misled consumers about the capabilities or its technology. The DMV is asking an administrative judge to halt manufacturing and sales of Autopilot (which features some automated driving features) and FSD Teslas in California for at least 30 days
During a hearing in July, Tesla attorney Matthew Benedetto asserted the company has never tried to conceal the fact that its vehicles cannot drive themselves.
“Cars with Full Self-Driving capabilities are currently not capable of driving themselves,” Benedetto said.
Following a test rollout of Tesla’s robotaxi in Austin, Texas this summer, shareholders filed a federal lawsuit alleging the company misled them about its autonomous driving software.
“That test showed the vehicles speeding, braking suddenly, driving over a curb, entering the wrong lane, and dropping off passengers in the middle of multilane roads,” Reuters reported.
The Dawn Project, which seeks to “identify and call out the software that puts humanity at risk and to demand that defective and insecure software be replaced,” conducted a demonstration in June that revealed what organizers say are critical safety defects in Tesla’s Full Self-Driving software, including repeatedly running down child-size mannequins and blowing past a school bus with its lights on.
 ‘As wrong 10 years ago as it is today’

The federal government regulates autonomous vehicles to a degree, but leaves much of the process to states. NHTSA has issued voluntary guidelines for automated driving systems (ADS) for all automakers, but without compliance requirements.
In 2021, the federal government required that automakers provide safety reports for their ADS vehicles. Out of 392 crashes reported by 11 automakers and one supplier from June 2021 through May 15, 2022, some 273 accidents involved Teslas. Honda was second with 90 reported accidents, followed by Subaru at 10 and Ford Motor with five.
NHTSA launched a probe last year into Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system following reports of crashes in low-visibility conditions, including one involving the death of a pedestrian. The investigation covers about 2.4 million Tesla models from 2016 through 2024.
Tesla contends its Autopilot technology “is 10x safer than the average U.S. driver.”
Attorney Donald Slavik counters that Teslas employing Autopilot “are no safer than manual driving.” Slavik, who represents individuals injured or killed in crashes involving autonomous vehicles, says Tesla’s accident data is not an apples-to-apples comparison with data collected by other automakers.
“Tesla counts an accident when an airbag in a vehicle is deployed, and they count how many million of miles are between each of those events,” Slavik says, while its comparison data for other autos counts accident reports. An airbag deployed in only one in six of those accidents, meaning Tesla is potentially counting only a fraction of its crashes.
“The worst cases are where someone has operated a Tesla on Autopilot, relied on its reported safety and superiority over driving manually, and they end up hitting another car or hitting a pedestrian, resulting in their injury or death,” he says.
Earlier this month, a Miami jury awarded $242.6 million in the case of a man who was critically injured and his girlfriend killed when their parked car was hit by a Tesla operating on Autopilot. The vehicle blew through a stop sign at more than 60 miles an hour before hitting the car.
Attorneys for the plaintiffs argued that Tesla falsely claimed its Autopilot system has the ability to stop without the help of drivers.
“What Musk has been saying about this technology was as wrong 10 years ago as it is today,” plaintiff’s attorney Brett Schreiber said following the verdict. “The Tesla car is a good car. It’s the Autopilot that will kill you.”
Tesla blamed the driver of the car, who blew through a stop sign as he searched for his dropped cell phone. The jury found the driver, who settled a suit separately, was also responsible.
Slavik had a similar case in which a man who was putting his trash cans on the street was hit by a Tesla on Autopilot. The man suffered spinal cord and brain injuries, and eventually died as a result, Slavik says.
Tesla has defied safety measures adopted and adhered to by other automakers with autonomous driving features.
Slavik points to differences between Tesla and manufacturers with features similar to Tesla’s Autopilot, such as Ford BlueCruise, or General Motors Super Cruise. Ford and GM limit the operation of the technology to roads that have been “mapped, checked and double-checked to ensure that they’re safe to use.”
Tesla, by contrast, does not engage in geofencing, the process of confining the use of driverless software to certain areas. “Tesla allows you to use Autopilot anywhere, anytime,” Slavik says.
Another difference is that Tesla ensures drivers are paying attention through the presence of a hand on the steering wheel, while Ford and GM, through a dashboard-mounted camera, require that drivers keep an eye on the road.
“Tesla didn’t do that,” said Slavik, adding that newer-model Teslas equipped with a camera will continue to drive, even with tape placed over the lens.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration provides Voluntary Safety Self-Assessments from two dozen automatic driving manufacturers. Tesla is not one of them.
Slavik attributes the lack of consistency among automakers to the “present administration that doesn’t want to deal with this.”
In January, the NHTSA opened an investigation into Tesla’s self-driving systems. Months later,
Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) took its chainsaw to NHTSA, and fired a disproportionate number of employees on the agency’s vehicle automation safety team, according to news reports.
 Look, Ma. No hands! 

A survey of U.S. drivers found in February that 13% would trust riding in self-driving vehicles – up from 9% a year earlier – while six out of 10 drivers report being afraid to ride in an autonomous vehicle. Enhancing vehicle safety remains a priority over the development of self-driving technology, U.S. drivers said.
Clark County Commission Chairman Tick Segerblom declined to say on the record whether he is confident Tesla’s robotaxis would be a safe addition to traffic on the pedestrian-laden Las Vegas Strip.
Commissioner Marilyn Kirkpatrick, who served with Segerblom in the Nevada Assembly when both voted in 2011 for legislation to allow autonomous vehicles, says she’s unaware of Tesla’s plan for robotaxis in Southern Nevada and knows of no meetings between Tesla and Clark County.
Taxi company executive Schwartz is hoping for a change in the law before robotaxis hit the Strip.
“It’s something that we’re concerned with. It’s just a matter of whether or not legislators take it up,” he said. “The unfortunate thing is things like this only change when there’s some sort of tragedy.”

State Ports Authority will pay nearly $1 million in a severance package for Barbara Melvin, the maritime agency’s former president and CEO who abruptly resigned last week.
The bulk of that will be $822,780 in pre-tax salary continuation payments to Melvin through the end of this year and a $100,000 contribution to her state retirement account, according to the agreement obtained by the SC Gazette.
The authority – which owns and operates the Port of Charleston, the state’s top economic driver – will also hire Melvin as a consultant on an as-needed basis to help with the transition to new leadership through the end of this year. She will be paid $350 per hour for that work.
SC ports director Melvin abruptly resigns, citing ‘personal reasons’

Melvin, who held the authority’s top job for a little more than three years, resigned unexpectedly on Aug. 21, two days after the agency’s board of directors held an unscheduled closed-door session following their regular meeting. There was no public mention of Melvin’s job during that meeting.
Melvin, in her resignation letter, did not give a reason for her departure. The authority, in a news release, said she “plans to pursue other opportunities.”
“I am grateful for the opportunity to have served South Carolina and the Ports Authority over these many years,” Melvin said in a written statement included with the news release. “However, for personal and professional reasons, I want to pursue other opportunities.”
Phil Padgett, the authority’s chief financial officer and vice president of administration, has been named interim president and CEO.
Melvin’s severance package includes several other perks.
For example, she will be allowed to keep her company iPad, laptop and cellphone after authority-related information has been wiped from them. She also will receive the balance of any accrued leave she hasn’t used.
Melvin had been with the authority for 27 years, holding various jobs including head of government relations and chief operating officer at the agency that employs about 740 people. She succeeded former CEO Jim Newsome in July 2022 after Newsome retired.
Melvin’s tenure as top boss was met with several challenges.
Last year, the authority lost a court battle in which the International Longshoreman’s Association – the dockworkers’ union – won the right to operate cranes at Charleston’s port. The case, which made it to the U.S. Supreme Court, overturned a decades-old practice in which non-union authority employees operated cranes while union workers moved cargo on the port’s terminals.
That legal challenge shut down the authority’s new Leatherman Terminal, a $1 billion investment in North Charleston, for nearly two years while the case made its way through the courts.
Melvin also announced an unpopular redevelopment plan for the authority’s roughly 70-acre Union Pier property in downtown Charleston.
The plan, which included a dense mix of retail and residential uses along Charleston Harbor, was abandoned after criticism from local environmental and preservation groups. A community-based planning process followed, but it was also abandoned when the authority agreed to sell the property to Charleston billionaire Ben Navarro. That sale has not yet closed.
Most recently, a taxpayer-funded rail project the authority says it needs to stay competitive with other ports fell behind schedule while its budget ballooned. The rail yard, where trains will load and unload cargo containers near the Leatherman Terminal, was supposed to open in July but now won’t fully open until March 2027.
Feds finish reimbursing SC to close the books on Charleston Harbor deepening

State legislators, who agreed to set aside $550 million for the project, said they had been given little information about its progress. The project’s cost estimate has now climbed to $690 million.
Melvin also had several successes, overseeing operations that generate $87 billion in annual economic benefit statewide.
She oversaw the completion of a harbor deepening project that gives the Port of Charleston the deepest waterway along the East Coast, allowing the world’s biggest and heaviest container ships to visit the port at any time regardless of tides.
And she helped orchestrate the authority’s purchase of a former WestRock paper mill adjacent to the North Charleston Terminal – allowing for expansions that will eventually double the port’s cargo capacity.
“She has been instrumental in moving the ports authority in a positive direction as CEO these last three years and advancing several critical infrastructure projects, including overseeing the reopening of the Leatherman Terminal,” Bill Stern, the authority’s board chairman, said in a written statement. “We wish her the best as she embarks upon new challenges and opportunities.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/barbara-melvin-speaking-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-25 16:56:36.599890

Ruling from the bench during a status hearing Monday, Froble denied a request from the state Board of Education that he suspend the case as education officials appeal to the state Supreme Court over his July ruling granting preliminary injunction to three families who sued to have their children admitted to school with a religious exemption to the state’s vaccination requirements. 
Froble suggested that the board should file a motion to suspend the case with the Supreme Court. 
“My experience with the Supreme Court is, I truly believe that this case appealing the preliminary injunction case is premature,” Froble said. “And the Supreme Court would benefit immensely from [full] development.” 
“The court believes that most of these are a lot of legal issues that need to be resolved and need to be presented in a manner in which the Supreme Court can fully understand the issues and have the opportunity to rule on those,” Froble said. “I believe that if there’s further discovery or factual issues that need to be resolved, the court can always remand it back.”
State Attorney General J.B. McCuskey filed the motion to consolidate the two lawsuits filed by plaintiffs on opposite sides of battle over the state’s compulsory school vaccination law and Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s executive order requiring the state to allow religious exemptions to the law. 
All states require school students to be vaccinated against a series of infectious diseases including polio, chicken pox and measles. West Virginia has been one of only five states in the country that do not allow religious or philosophical exemptions for the shots. West Virginia has only allowed medical exemptions. 
Morrisey issued an executive order requiring the state to accept religious exemptions on his second day in office. He has not rescinded the order despite the Legislature this year voting down a bill that would have established religious exemptions in state law. Morrisey argues that the state’s school vaccination law, read alongside the state’s Equal Protection for Religion Act of 2023, legally requires religious exemptions. 
The state board has said it would continue to instruct county boards to accept only medical exemptions.
Joshua Hess and Marisa Jackson, parents of immunocompromised students, sued the state Department of Health in Kanawha County Circuit Court in an attempt to stop the department from granting religious exemptions. They’re represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia and Mountain State Justice. 
Miranda Guzman and two other families sued the state Board of Education after the board directed county school districts not to allow religious exemptions to the state’s school vaccination requirements. 
Froble in July granted a preliminary injunction in the case — a ruling that applies to the three plaintiffs in the case. 
Froble’s ruling to consolidate the cases came over objections from attorneys with the ACLU of West Virginia and Mountain State Justice on behalf of Hess and Jackson. The attorneys argued that the cases do not arise from the same transaction or occurrence, seek different relief, and present different legal questions.
Froble has set a hearing for Sept. 10 and 11. In a court filing recently, Froble said the agenda for the hearing will include: 

Whether the state’s school vaccination law is constitutional without religious exemptions. 
Whether his ruling should apply only to plaintiffs, to Raleigh County or statewide.
Whether Morrisey has authority under his executive authority as it relates to the state’s mandatory immunization law and the Equal Protection for Religion Act.
Whether, if the ruling applies county or statewide, the court has the authority to establish a process for parental applications for religious exemptions and for responding to any potential outbreak.

The hearing is set for 9 a.m. both days in Froble’s courtroom in Raleigh County Circuit Court.

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Siding with the Trump administration, a federal judge is allowing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to halt Medicaid payments to reproductive health care providers in Maine.
Maine Family Planning, which operates 18 clinics across the state, had asked the court for a temporary injunction to block a provision in congressional Republicans’ massive tax cut and spending law from taking effect, arguing in court on August 14 that it would cause the agency and its clients irreparable harm. 
On Monday, Judge Lance Walker of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine, an appointee of President Donald Trump, issued the decision denying Maine Family Planning’s request, despite the organization facing potential layoffs, losses of up to $1.9 million and disruption of care for about 8,000 patients.
Maine Family Planning did not demonstrate the irreparable harm it claimed to face, Walker wrote in his decision. He also acknowledged that after the U.S. Supreme Court decision that eliminated the constitutional right to an abortion, Maine Family Planning and other providers knew about the increased risk of losing federal funding for continuing to provide abortions and that the provider still “stood firm in its mission.” 
“Over the years, political winds have shifted and [Maine Family Planning] can only be understood as voluntarily standing its ground … despite the dramatically increased likelihood of defunding after Dobbs,” he said. “Fair enough, but while its adherents may celebrate the firmness of its convictions, those convictions are not equal to the task of enjoining congressional will in this arena.”
Medicaid funding can’t be used for abortions, but Maine Family Planning and other reproductive health care providers have argued that they are being targeted for continuing to offer abortions alongside may other health care services.
The law has already forced Maine’s largest reproductive health care provider to stop accepting new primary care patients enrolled in MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program. Now, they may have no choice but to close clinics, cut services, or severely limit the number of patients served, according to a statement by Maine Family Planning in reaction to Walker’s decision. These disruptions will destabilize the entire state health infrastructure, impacting patients who rely on Medicaid as well as those who don’t, the organization warned. 
“This ruling is a devastating setback for Mainers who depend on us for basic primary care,” said George Hill, president and CEO of Maine Family Planning. “The loss of Medicaid funds — which nearly half our patients rely on — threatens our ability to provide life-saving services to communities across the state. Mainers’ health should never be jeopardized by political decisions, and we will continue to fight for them.”
In a similar case Planned Parenthood filed against the Trump administration, a federal judge granted the organization a temporary injunction. That means Maine Family Planning will the the only reproductive health care provider in Maine impacted by the law.
Maine Family Planning makes case to restore Medicaid funding for reproductive health care providers

Without Maine Family Planning clinics, thousands of rural patients would have nowhere else to access cancer screenings, STI testing, contraception and annual checkups, argued Meetra Mehdizadeh, senior attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, the national organization representing the Maine plaintiff. Mehdizadeh noted that about 70% of Maine Family Planning’s 8,000 patients rely exclusively on the provider for health care needs.
Maine Family Planning said it has been unable to access Medicaid funding since July 4, when Trump signed the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” into law. 
Walker’s decision comes weeks after U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani in Massachusetts granted an emergency injunction for Planned Parenthood and its national affiliates after an initial injunction blocked only certain clinics receiving Medicaid funds under the new law.
Maine Family Planning filed the lawsuit in late July against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz.
Maine Family Planning has not yet said whether it plans to appeal Walker’s decision.

(Photo by Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images)Republican support for in vitro fertilization, after surging in the wake of a 2024 Alabama Supreme Court decision that threatened the procedure, may be splintering as President Donald Trump retreats from his IVF promises and more far-right voices gain ground.
Earlier this year, conservatives in the Tennessee House staged an eleventh-hour skirmish over an IVF protection bill introduced by two of their Republican colleagues. The bill eventually passed, becoming one of the first in the nation to explicitly protect access to IVF. But some lawmakers who voted for it have signaled their willingness to revisit the issue.
In Georgia, a Republican-sponsored bill to codify the right to IVF into law sailed through the legislature, even as fellow conservative lawmakers introduced their own anti-abortion bill that opponents warned would undermine the IVF protections in the new law.
In statehouses around the nation, IVF has emerged as a dividing line running through the Republican Party. Particularly in states where abortion is banned, lawmakers who unite under the “pro-life” banner disagree over whether the popular treatment gives life or destroys it.
People who believe embryos are children oppose IVF because it can involve the discarding of some embryos, which they say is akin to abortion.
“The popularity of IVF creates a dilemma for Republican politicians who have had anti-choice organizations as a key part of their constituency for their whole careers,” said Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.
After the Alabama Supreme Court ruled last year that embryos are people, fertility clinics around the state temporarily halted their services, sparking nationwide outrage.
Republicans and Democrats rushed to pledge their support for fertility treatments such as IVF and announce their plans to protect it.
Conservatives push to declare fetuses as people, with far-reaching consequences

On the campaign trail last year, Trump promised to make insurers cover IVF so that it would be free for patients. After taking office, he signed an executive order giving White House officials 90 days to assemble a list of policy recommendations on protecting IVF access and reducing costs.
In March, he called himself “the fertilization president.”
But a week later, his administration eliminated the team of experts at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention responsible for tracking IVF outcomes across the United States. The team had, among other things, operated a database allowing consumers to look up an individual fertility clinic’s success rates. Earlier this month, The Washington Post reported that the White House doesn’t plan to require insurers to cover IVF services, though administration officials told the newspaper that IVF access remains a priority.
Meanwhile, conservative groups that oppose abortion have begun pushing an obscure alternative treatment for infertility called “restorative reproductive medicine,” or RRM. Advocates have urged the White House and federal and state legislators to back RRM, which is based on the idea that the underlying causes of infertility can be treated through lifestyle changes and improving a person’s overall health.
Arkansas recently became the first to pass a pro-RRM law. Others might follow suit in upcoming legislative sessions.
Cole Muzio, founder and president of the Georgia conservative Christian nonprofit Frontline Policy Council, said he doesn’t expect to see legislators try to ban IVF outright, despite preemptive efforts by legislators in his state and others to protect it.
“Republicans are intrinsically pro-family, and the idea of supporting those who want to have a family is a conservative, noble, positive thing,” he said.
“At the same time, IVF discards an overwhelming number of human lives. We’ve got a lot of work to do to educate people.”
IVF pushback grows louder
This spring, the Tennessee bill protecting IVF passed unanimously in the state Senate. But by the time it hit the House floor in April, many of its Republican supporters sat silently while a few of their GOP colleagues tried to derail it.
The bill’s sponsor, Republican state Rep. Iris Rudder, told the Tennessee Lookout that she hadn’t expected disagreement over the bill to “mushroom the way it did.”
It eventually passed. But 11 Tennessee House Republicans sent a letter to GOP Gov. Bill Lee urging him to veto it and calling it “a Trojan horse that could potentially undermine Tennessee’s strong and righteous stance on the protection of innocent human life.”
Lee signed it in April.
The following day, Tennessee Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson — who voted for the bill and said he supports IVF and contraceptives — told constituents during a legislative forum that he’d had “lots of conversations” about it and expects the legislature to revisit the issue again in the next session.
“I think we’ll be back next year to take another stab at it,” he said.
Potential threats to IVF push political novices into election-year advocacy

In Georgia, the state’s most powerful Republicans made a bill to codify the right to IVF a major priority this year. It was signed into law in May.
“Thanks to a lot of bipartisan support and hard work, Georgians who want to grow their families will never have to worry about whether or not they can access this vital treatment,” the bill’s sponsor, Republican state Rep. Lehman Franklin, posted to X after it passed through the legislature. Franklin and his wife conceived through IVF, a story he has shared publicly as he promoted the measure.
“At the end of the day, being pro-family means being pro-IVF,” he wrote.
Muzio, of the Frontline Policy Council, believes the IVF debate represents not so much a split in the Republican Party as it does a lack of education about what the treatment really means to people who believe human life begins as soon as an egg is fertilized.
“Hopefully you’ll see [legislation] put in place that either backs different fertility treatments that are more pro-life or guardrails put in place to restrict the discarding of human life for the purposes of IVF,” he said.
For conservatives who see IVF as akin to abortion, restorative reproductive medicine has emerged politically as an option for addressing infertility without explicitly supporting IVF, which remains overwhelmingly popular among Americans.
Out of obscurity
RRM was a relatively obscure idea until anti-abortion groups such as The Heritage Foundation began elevating it over the past year as an alternative to IVF. With RRM, a practitioner might help patients analyze their diet, chart their menstrual cycle to look for conditions that can impact fertility, or treat reproductive disorders like endometriosis or thyroid dysfunction.
Supporters argue that a more holistic approach is a better way to treat infertility, and that RRM methods are much less expensive than IVF, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars.
But RRM has been criticized in mainstream medical circles. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists calls RRM a “nonmedical approach” and an “unproven concept” that can delay time to pregnancy and expose patients to needless and painful surgical interventions, such as procedures to treat polycystic ovarian syndrome. It says the approach overwhelmingly puts the onus on women, ignoring that infertility causes are just as common in men.
Some experts worry that patients spending months or years on RRM treatments will lose precious time when IVF could have helped them get pregnant.
And OB-GYNs warn RRM is closely tied to the anti-abortion “personhood” movement, which attempts to grant fertilized eggs the same legal status as people — potentially leading to a loss of rights for pregnant patients and more severe restrictions on birth control and other reproductive health care.












They put their considerable resources into asking, ‘How do we blunt the momentum IVF is getting without saying we’re opposed to IVF?’


– Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine




Tipton, of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, believes RRM is more “ideology” than medical practice.
“[RRM] got legs thanks to the work of really influential right-wing and anti-choice groups,” he said. “They put their considerable resources into asking, ‘How do we blunt the momentum IVF is getting without saying we’re opposed to IVF?’”
But as RRM gains mainstream attention, it’s also found supporters in the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement promoted by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Some consumers remain skeptical of the fertility industry, where some clinics have ties to private equity firms and other large corporations.
In March, Arkansas Republican state Rep. Alyssa Brown told fellow legislators that RRM “prioritizes women’s health over the profits of Big Pharma and Big Fertility.”
First in the nation
Brown sponsored a first-of-its-kind bill in Arkansas — which passed in April and was signed into law — that requires state insurance companies to cover RRM treatments.
Brown promised during a hearing that it wouldn’t limit access to IVF. Arkansas was one of the earliest states, in 1991, to require insurance companies to cover IVF.
A similar bill with the same title, the RESTORE Act, was introduced in Congress again this year, after failing last year. It includes recommendations from The Heritage Foundation and the conservative, anti-abortion Ethics and Public Policy Center.
Arkansas’ new law also requires programs funded through Title X, which provides birth control and other reproductive care to low-income families, to use fertility awareness-based methods, mirroring a similar effort at the federal level. Under Kennedy, HHS has indicated plans to use Title X funding to open an “infertility training center.” Part of the center’s focus, according to its grant announcement, is to “educate on the root causes of infertility and the broad range of holistic infertility treatments” available to patients.
Meanwhile, state legislators around the country this year attempted to require health insurance to cover IVF, including in Montana, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia.
Nevada’s Democratic-controlled legislature passed a bill in June establishing the right to fertility treatments, including IVF, but it was swiftly vetoed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo.
In May, Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed a bill into law requiring a state insurance commission to consider coverage for procedures like IVF, a move that sets the stage for requiring health insurance companies to cover it. Before signing, Youngkin tried to insert a provision allowing private plans to opt out of coverage for religious or ethical beliefs, but the legislature rejected the change.
Although he signed the measure, Youngkin said his exemption idea needed to be taken up if the state eventually mandates coverage of fertility treatments.

(Photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — For the first time in more than 20 years, a sitting South Carolina Supreme Court justice faces a challenge for keeping his seat.
Incumbent Justice John Few will go up against three other candidates as he seeks re-election to another 10-year term on the state’s highest court: former state House Speaker Jay Lucas, Administrative Law Court Chief Judge Ralph King “Tripp” Anderson and S.C. Court of Appeals Judge Blake Hewitt, according to a release from the state’s judicial screening panel.
Filings for judicial openings in the state closed at noon Monday.
“I am excited about the opportunity I have to get out there and talk with representatives and senators about my 25 years as a judge and justice,” Few said in a statement originally reported by The State. He declined to say more to the SC Daily Gazette, and none of the other candidates responded to emails.
New SC chief justice seeks extra Family Court judges to handle backlogged cases

Few’s term expires July 31, 2026.
Under South Carolina law, the 62-year-old justice is eligible to work for another decade, before he reaches the mandatory retirement age for judges in the state. And if tradition holds, he’d be next in line to take over the chief justice seat, which historically has gone to the court’s longest-serving justice.
Few, who lives in the Upstate town of Mountain Rest, was sworn in on the court in 2016, a year before Justice George James Jr., who is 65 years old. His election filled the vacancy left when then-Chief Justice Jean Toal retired from full-time work.
Challengers
Before joining the Supreme Court, Few was chief judge of the state Court of Appeals and a district court judge, giving him a total of 25 years on the bench.
Lucas, a Republican who works as an attorney in Hartsville, spent 24 years in the state House and nearly eight years as speaker before leaving his post in 2022. He then went on to head government relations for the state’s largest hospital system, Prisma Health.
At age 68, Lucas would be eligible to serve on the high court for 3½ years. (Judges must retire from full-time work by Dec. 31 after turning 72.)

Hewitt, age 45, and Anderson, age 65, have run unsuccessfully for a Supreme Court seat in the past. Last year, both sought the seat now held by Justice Letitia Verdin. Anderson has made numerous attempts prior.
A review of Judicial Merit Selection Committee records going back to 2003 show no other instances of an incumbent justice facing opposition.
It’s unknown why Few drew a slate of challengers. Still, he was among the justices, in a 3-2 split, that tossed out South Carolina’s 2021 law that banned abortions once an ultrasound detects cardiac activity. That law briefly took effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade in summer 2022. In their January 2023 ruling, each of the five justices wrote separate opinions in the case.
The ruling drew immediate blowback from GOP leaders, who accused justices of overstepping their authority.
When Statehouse Republicans sought a re-do on the law, they tailored the rewrite specifically to address concerns Few raised in his opinion, ultimately picking up his vote when the matter came back before an all-male court in 2023. The 2023 version of the abortion law referred to as a six-week ban was upheld 4-1.
Few, in his original opinion, cited conflicting language in the law on women’s right to an “informed choice.” He also indicated he might have upheld a ban “despite a complete invasion of a pregnant woman’s right to privacy” if state law had specifically declared that life begins at conception.
To flip Few’s vote, Republicans deleted all references to “informed choice” and inserted a finding that “the State of South Carolina has a compelling interest from the outset of a woman’s pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the unborn child.”
In 2023, again writing a separate opinion, Few said the rewritten law fixed his issues. The most important change, he wrote, was the promotion of “active family planning” by requiring all insurance companies to cover contraceptives. He also noted that post-sex emergency contraceptives such as Plan B remain legal.
Other elections
Besides the Supreme Court race, there also are crowded slates of candidates for a Circuit Court seat covering South Carolina’s Charlotte-area suburbs and an opening on the state court that hears challenges of actions by state agencies.
Among those seeking a seat on the Administrative Law Court are former state House member and lieutenant governor candidate Mandy Powers Norrell. The Lancaster Democrat was in the House for eight years before losing to one-term Republican Rep. Sandy McGarry in 2020.
She unsuccessfully ran on a joint ticket with the Democratic gubernatorial nominee James Smith in 2018.
Others seeking the Administrative Law Court seat include lawyers from the state agencies that govern professional licensing, tax collections, consumer protections, and Medicaid, as well as a law clerk for the Administrative Law Court, an environmental lawyer and a Richland County magistrate judge.
SC Legislature again breaks precedent, rejects lone York County judicial candidate

In the judicial circuit covering York and Union counties, a public defender has returned to seek the seat legislators rejected her for earlier this year.
Legislators turned down Melissa Inzerillo, of Rock Hill, for the 16th Circuit judicial seat despite her being the only candidate.
State Sen. Wes Climer, R-Rock Hill, led the campaign against her suggesting she might be too lenient when it comes to criminal sentencing.
Now, in addition to Inzerillo, the seat is sought by a pair of assistant solicitors, two other public defenders, a lawyer for the city of Rock Hill and a lawyer for the South Carolina National Guard who also previously was a Rock Hill city lawyer.
The only other competitive elections are for three new Family Court judgeships — one in Lexington, one in Beaufort and one in Berkeley County. Chief Justice John Kittredge requested the slots to speed up cases going through the state’s courts that hear adoption, child custody, juvenile delinquency and domestic abuse cases.
Public hearings for the candidates are scheduled to begin Nov. 17. The election by the Legislature is tentatively set for March 4.
This will mark the first election since a law tweaking how legislators pick judges went into effect July 1.
Among the changes are an increase in the number of candidates forwarded to the General Assembly for an election. Instead of limiting the pool to three, the screening panel can send up to six for a vote. Only two contests have more than six candidates.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/supreme-court-at-night-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-25 16:56:36.599890

(Photo courtesy Dylan Taylor/University of Florida)The University of Florida Board of Trustees unanimously approved Donald Landry, a Columbia University medical researcher and professor, as its interim president Monday. 
During a special meeting in Gainesville, Landry committed to uphold state laws relating to diversity, equity, and inclusion and to condemn antisemitism.
“The decision to come to the University of Florida was very simple. This is the opportunity of a lifetime. A preeminent university in what one could argue is the preeminent state in this nation at this moment in time,” Landry said.
Until 2023, Landry was chair of Columbia’s Department of Medicine. 
“This is the culmination of my career of four decades at Columbia and my years with the American Academy of Sciences and Letters,” Landry said. 
Landry is president of the American Academy of Sciences and Letters. The organization focuses on “truth-seeking” and science, arts, and “learned professions” by awarding scholars for intellectual freedom, distinction, and scholarly integrity.
Landry continued to serve as a professor at Columbia, and said that during his time there he’s  been “watching in awe at the way the University of Florida has handled this difficult moment.”
“The chance to come here and to live the mission that we’ve been lauding and rewarding through our prizes at the academy is another great opportunity,” Landry said. 
A neutral institution, Landry said, is conservative. 
“Not espousing conservative values, certainly not indoctrinating in conservatism. It would be neutral. It wouldn’t choose sides. There wouldn’t be constant pronouncements that divide the faculty into those who are aligned and those who are not, dividing the students among those who are aligned, those who are not,” Landry said. 
Landry hold a Presidential Citizens Medal, awarded by former President George W. Bush in 2008. 
Landry, who has a doctorate in organic chemistry from Harvard University and a medical degree from Columbia, is director of the Columbia Center for Human Longevity and a professor at New York Presbyterian/Columbia Medical Center. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Inclusion
The search for an official president at UF took an unprecedented turn earlier this year.
UF trustees in May unanimously approved former University of Michigan President Santa Ono to be the next leader of the institution. However, final approval by the Board of Governors of the State University System proved a problem.
Following a long interview in which governors grilled Ono about his past support for diversity, equity, and inclusion, among other topics, they rejected him in June, sending UF trustees back to the beginning.
The topic surfaced during Landy’s interview with trustees Monday. 
“When DEI first emerged, it was a bit vague what it actually meant, and you could define the words to be many things. By the time it crystalized, it was clear it had gone too far, and I think we can all be thankful that government has intervened and returned us to a rational meritocracy,” Landry said.
The Florida Legislature has passed laws prohibiting spending state funds on diversity, equity, and inclusion. 
“I would absolutely uphold the position of the university, complying with the laws of the state,” Landry said. 
Kent Fuchs, president of the flagship university from 2015-2023, agreed to serve as interim president on Aug. 1, 2024, after former President Ben Sasse unexpectedly left the post last summer. 
A year elapsed, and Fuchs agreed to extend his one-year agreement for another month, until Sept. 1.
Landry will start next week and final approval for his interim presidency is expected to be taken up by the Board of Governors in two weeks.

Free.,Trump creates 'quick reaction force' out of state Guard troops for law enforcement,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-creates-quick-reaction-force-out-state-guard-troops-law-enforcement,,"President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday directing state National Guard units to be ready to assist local, state and federal law enforcement, a potential step toward a dramatic expansion of Trump’s use of military personnel for domestic policing.The order calls for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to ensure troops in the National Guard of every state “are resourced, trained, organized, and available to assist Federal, State, and local law enforcement in quelling civil disturbances and ensuring the public safety” and directs the secretary to establish “a standing National Guard quick reaction force” for “nationwide deployment.”Hegseth will also work with adjutant generals to decide a number of each state’s Guard “to be reasonably available for rapid mobilization for such purposes,” the order said.State National Guard units are generally controlled by the state’s governor, except in emergencies. In comments in the Oval Office on Monday, Trump said the Guard deployment could rapidly “solve” crime in some major cities, but left doubt about his desire to overrule governors who do not want Guard troops in their cities.Trump mobilized the District of Columbia National Guard, which he is able to do because the district is not a state, to assist local law enforcement this month. Guard troops from West Virginia, Louisiana, Ohio, Mississippi, Tennessee and South Carolina also have sent troops to the nation’s capital.Free DC, a group that advocates for district self-governance, issued a lengthy statement calling the move dictatorial. “Trump is laying the groundwork to quell all public dissent to his agenda. If he is successful, it would spell the end of American democracy,” the group said. “We refuse to allow that to happen.”Chicago next?Following the deployment to Washington, D.C., Trump said “Chicago should be next.”Democratic governors, such as Illinois’ J.B. Pritzker, should request National Guard assistance, Trump said. But if they would not, Trump said he may not send troops.Asked if he would send troops into cities over governors’ objections, Trump complained that governors could be ungrateful for federal deployment.“We may wait,” he continued. “We may or may not. We may just go in and do it, which is probably what we should do. The problem is it's not nice when you go in and do it, and somebody else is standing there saying, as we give great results, say, ‘Well, we don't want the military.’”Pritzker slammed Trump on social media and said he would not accept Trump sending troops to his state’s largest city.“I’ve said it once, and I’ll say it again and again: We don’t have kings or wannabe dictators in America, and I don’t intend to bend the knee to one,” he posted with a link to Trump’s comments.The 1878 Posse Comitatus Act generally prohibits federal military forces from engaging in domestic law enforcement. ‘I’m not a dictator’Trump dismissed criticism that deploying the military for law enforcement purposes is antidemocratic, saying that most people agree with extreme measures to crack down on urban crime.“They say, ‘We don’t need ‘em. Freedom, freedom. He’s a dictator, he’s a dictator,’” Trump said of his critics. “A lot of people are saying, ‘Maybe we like a dictator.’ I don’t like a dictator. I’m not a dictator. I’m a man with great common sense and a smart person. And when I see what's happening to our cities, and then you send in troops, instead of being praised, they're saying, ‘You're trying to take over the republic.’ These people are sick.”Trump earlier this summer called up the California National Guard to quell protests over immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, setting the stage for his actions in the district. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, has challenged the president’s authority in a case that is still in court.Trump over the weekend also fought with Maryland Gov.

Santiago/Getty Images)Gun safety advocates gathered last week to highlight the threat of constitutional carry ahead of a potential veto override of Senate Bill 50 from the state legislature, a bill allowing concealed carry without permits.
Senate Bill 50 would allow North Carolinians above the age of 18 to carry concealed, loaded handguns without a permit, a change from the current system that requires background checks, safety training, and live-fire training.
Democratic Gov. Josh Stein vetoed the measure on June 20. But when the Senate returned to Raleigh in July, lawmakers overrode Stein’s veto.
In order to override a veto, three-fifths of each chamber must approve.
Now, it’s all up to the House, where Republicans are one vote short of a supermajority. With legislators coming back to town on Tuesday, SB 50 remains on the calendar and it’s possible the lower chamber will take up the bill if Republicans feel the votes are there to override Stein’s veto.
Two House Republicans, Rep. William Brisson and Rep. Ted Davis, joined Democrats in initially voting against the bill.
Last Friday, North Carolinians Against Gun Violence and concerned community members spoke at Strategic Tactics Of Protection LLC (STOP) against the bill.
“More people will die in NC if the House overrides Gov. Stein’s veto. The Senate already has,” Becky Ceartas, executive director of North Carolinians Against Gun Violence, said. “We cannot let this happen. Too much is at stake. Lives are on the line.”
Jessica Burroughs with the group MomsRising said the pervasiveness of guns and gun violence is chipping away at the freedom to learn, play, and live in North Carolina communities without fear.
“Look at what the data tells us about states with weaker concealed carry weapon permitting laws. They have 10.8% higher firearm homicide rates than states with stronger laws,” said Burroughs.
STOP was chosen as the press conference’s location because it’s a firearms training academy.
The facility offers classes ranging from concealed carry handguns to unarmed defense and personal protection in the home.
Tony DeRico, president and instructor at STOP, stressed the importance of having proper training to handle weapons.
That includes knowing how to inspect a weapon to see if it’s loaded and laws regarding carrying one. He also supported maintaining background checks on those who wish to purchase and possess weapons.
“Without those parameters, you are putting up a wide open fence that will allow much harm to be done,” he said. “We don’t need to have young people who aren’t ready to have a firearm.”

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)ST. PETERSBURG – St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch vowed Monday, amid a dispute over street murals depicting Gay Pride colors and other themes, that his city will “build back stronger” and create “even more powerful expressions of who we are.”
However, he said he would bow to a directive from the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) to remove five of the murals, including ones that celebrate Black history.
Following the effective date of a new state law in June, FDOT updated its Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, which now includes a prohibition on “non-uniform traffic control devices,” such as pavement markings on state and local roads, and notified local governments of that directive.
Shortly thereafter, U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy sent a letter to all 50 governors around the country to keep crosswalk and intersection markings “free from distraction” for safety reasons.
FDOT followed up last week, demanding that local governments that hadn’t removed painted crosswalks do so within weeks or lose access to state transportation funds.
In some cases, FDOT is erasing such crosswalks itself, as it did last week in Orlando at the site of the Pulse Memorial.
Evan Mory, St. Petersburg’s transportation and parking director, had asked FDOT to exempt five specific murals, noting that they were all in place before the law changd. City officials also noted that traffic crashes had been reduced by 70% at the Common Ground mural painted at Fifth Street and Central Ave. in downtown St. Petersburg.
That mural, painted by Argentinian artist Cecilia Lueza, features a rainbow of huge triangles and geometric shapes that spread across the intersection.
However, on Friday, Justin Hall, FDOT’s District 7 secretary, rejected that request. He said in his response that if the FDOT removes the markings instead of the city, those costs will be assessed to St. Petersburg.
Mayor Welch began his press conference by bemoaning what he said was the state’s latest move “to usurp local values and priorities and instead mandate what our values should be.”
  State Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith stands near the crosswalk outside the Pulse Memorial site in Orlando on Aug. 23, 2025.

Murals to ‘live on’ in other forms
“We’ve seen repeated attempts to silence our voices, to change the definition of terms from climate change to DEI, even banning the recognition of Black history and the LGBTQ community,” he said. “We’ve seen the attempts to stifle our ability to express and celebrate our community values. Yet time and time again, our community has risen to the occasion. And this latest challenge will be no exception.”
How that response will be manifested isn’t exactly clear yet. Welch said that the murals will “live on” in other forms, “on city and privately owned properties, on flags and banners and other installations. Whatever is taken away will be replaced in new, more impactful ways.”
While cities such as Key West have asked for and received an administrative hearing with FDOT to fight to maintain their rainbow crosswalks, Mayor Welch said on Monday that he saw no reason to do likewise. FDOT’s Justin Hall told the city on Friday that “the hearing will not involve a request for an exception of waiver to permit the nonconforming pavement markings to remain in place. The Department has already reviewed the pavement markings at the location(s) mentioned above and determined that the pavement markings will not be allowed.”
St. Petersburg City Council member Copley Gerdes said at the news conference that while the city was speaking rationally, the state wasn’t, “and that’s what we’re experiencing today.”
“We have been data-driven,” he said. “We’ve been intentional. Forward-thinking. We are trying to [be] rational. Unfortunately, our partner in this conversation is not. And so, we’re never going to see eye-to-eye in this conversation until they start using rational as well.”
State pressure
Gov. Ron DeSantis and Attorney General James Uthmeier have previously used threats of removing local officials from office in pushing local governments to see things their way when it comes to cooperating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Now they are using the threat of denying state funds for cities that refuse to remove street art.
After insisting he wasn’t going to allow Uthmeier to “bully” him or other Orange County leaders, Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings backed down earlier this month and signed an updated agreement with ICE to transport immigration detainees to ICE facilities, although he later said he did so “under protest and extreme duress.”
Uthmeier had threatened to have DeSantis remove Demings and every other Orange County commissioner unless they signed that agreement.
Welch said Monday that he and his administration had not conceded initially to the state’s order and had provided data showing the street markings had actually increased public safety, based on data before and after the installation of the murals.
But he said FDOT’s position was clear that a refusal to remove the public art “would jeopardize millions of dollars in state transportation funding and potentially tens of millions more in broader state funding in other areas.”
He encouraged members of the public to visit the murals and share them on social media before they are removed. He said that the city won’t remove them directly, but instead will reimburse FDOT to do so, because “it’s not our decision.”
“As the mayor of our city, I will not risk these essential investments in a fight that I don’t believe we can win. That would be irresponsible leadership and detrimental to our city in the long run, but make no mistake, this is not the end of the story.”

ADPH said in a statement the 5-year-old living in north Alabama was not vaccinated against the viral respiratory disease. The child did not attend a day care or school and their siblings were vaccinated in accordance with official guidelines on the vaccine. ADPH was not able to find out why the infected child had not been vaccinated.
Symptoms of the disease can take seven to 14 days to present after infection, and can be particularly dangerous for infants and young children.

It is the first confirmed case of measles in Alabama since 2002. Measles is a highly contagious disease, and ADPH officials have for years expressed alarm at the state’s dropping Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccination rates. In 2023-24, the rate among kindergartners was 93.8%, below the 95% rate the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers necessary to achieve herd immunity.
Dr. Karen Landers, ADPH’s chief medical officer, said in the statement that unvaccinated people, if exposed, have a 90% chance of becoming infected, and infected people can spread the disease several days before becoming symptomatic. 
“Measles follows a pattern in which the child first develops fever, cough, runny nose, and watery/red eyes, then a rash develops. Persons can start spreading the virus up to four days before symptoms appear, and those with weak immune systems can spread the measles virus longer,” Landers said. 
The case comes a week after Texas, where a measles outbreak originated earlier this year, announced the outbreak was over. State Health Officer Dr. Scott Harris said at the ADPH monthly meeting that there had not been any cases in Alabama, but there were two cases where the patient had passed through Alabama.
“We think that the largest outbreak in the country is over, although there’s still several jurisdictions still have active outbreaks, because it’s been less than 42 days,” Harris said Thursday.
ADPH in March investigated possible measles exposure in the state after an unvaccinated child who traveled through Alabama tested positive for measles, but did not report any cases.  A Lee County child who showed measles-like symptoms earlier this year tested negative for the disease.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been 1,375 confirmed cases of measles this year as of Aug. 19. In 2024, there were 285 cases.

,DC,2025-08-25 19:41:46+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,More states joining race to redraw congressional maps,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/more-states-joining-race-redraw-congressional-maps,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s push to bolster the GOP’s narrow congressional majority in next year’s elections has prompted a rare nationwide mid-decade redistricting battle that has rapidly taken shape over the past weeks. Indiana GOP lawmakers’ White House visit this week highlights how the race to redraw congressional districts for partisan advantage may soon expand beyond Texas and California — two states that have reached new stages in their dueling redistricting efforts. Missouri could also be on its way to redrawing its map to favor Republicans.“Drawing districts to put your thumb on the scale is almost as old as the country,” said David Niven, a political science professor at the University of Cincinnati who conducts research on gerrymandering, elections and voting rights.“The revolutionary twist is: Almost all of the history of gerrymandering has been about personal gain and about advancing your friends’ interests — this is a real dramatic turn toward using gerrymandering for national political control.”The national scuffle originated with Trump urging Texas to draw a new congressional map to defend the GOP’s razor-thin control of the U.S. House. The map could give Republicans five new congressional seats in the 2026 midterms.The GOP has 219 U.S. House seats, with Democrats holding 212 spots and four current vacancies — a slim margin that has created hurdles for U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, as he tries to enact Trump’s agenda and cater to both the demands of the president and the GOP conference’s factions. As Republicans in the Hoosier State face mounting pressure to join in on the redistricting fight, Indiana GOP state lawmakers are headed to the White House on Tuesday.The meeting was scheduled before Vice President JD Vance’s Aug. 7 meeting with Indiana GOP leadership as part of the administration’s redistricting push but after redistricting was added to Texas’ special legislative session agenda in July, according to the Indiana Capital Chronicle. As of last week, Republican Indiana Gov. Mike Braun remained noncommittal about whether he would call a special session to redraw the state’s lines, per the Capital Chronicle. California, Texas redistricting battle heats up The Indiana lawmakers’ visit to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. comes as Lone Star State Republicans inch closer to adopting a new congressional map and California Democrats fight back with their own effort. The Texas Senate on Saturday approved the new map, which Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said he would “swiftly” sign into law.Texas lawmakers approved the new congressional map after two weeks of delays following widespread opposition from Texas’ Democratic legislators. But the Golden State is ramping up its retaliatory efforts against Texas Republicans.California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a legislative package Aug. 21 that calls for a special election, in which voters will decide the fate of a new congressional map that could give Democrats five more seats in the U.S. House. Newsom has framed the effort as pushing back against political hardball by Trump. “We got here because the president of the United States is struggling,” Newsom said shortly before signing the legislative package. “We got here because the president of the United States is one of the most unpopular presidents in U.S. history. We got here because he recognizes that he will lose the election. Congress will go back into the hands of the Democratic Party next November. We got here because of his failed policies,” he said. The California governor added that Texas “fired the first shot.”“We wouldn’t be here if Texas had not done what they just did, Donald Trump didn’t do what he just did.” Meanwhile, Trump said Monday that the Department of Justice will file a lawsuit over Newsom’s redistricting efforts.More states could follow Missouri could also soon follow in Texas’ redistricting footsteps to give the GOP more of an advantage in the upcoming midterms. Trump took to social media Aug. 21 saying “the Great State of Missouri is now IN,” adding that “we’re going to win the Midterms in Missouri again, bigger and better than ever before!”The administration has put pressure on Missouri in recent weeks to redraw their lines to help defend Republicans’ majority in the U.S. House by eliminating one of two Democratic districts in the state.Though Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe said no decisions about calling a special legislative session had been made, a spokesperson for the Republican said he “continues to have conversations with House and Senate leadership to assess options for a special session that would allow the General Assembly to provide congressional districts that best represent Missourians,” according to the Missouri Independent.Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore said Sunday he is considering redistricting efforts in the state, where the GOP currently holds just one of eight congressional seats. “I want to make sure that we have fair lines and fair seats, where we don’t have situations where politicians are choosing voters, but that voters actually have a chance to choose their elected officials,” Moore told CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “We need to be able to have fair maps, and we also need to make sure that if the president of the United States is putting his finger on the scale to try to manipulate elections because he knows that his policies cannot win in a ballot box, then it behooves each and every one of us to be able to keep all options on the table to ensure that the voters’ voices can actually be heard, and we can have maps.”",,,,2025-08-25 15:57:43.445752

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A state investment board’s vote to challenge several companies’ policies at minimum violated the “spirit” of Oklahoma’s open meetings law, two government transparency experts said. 
While Leslie Briggs and Joey Senat, who specialize in Oklahoma’s Open Meeting Act, said it would be up to a court to decide if a state law was violated last week, they said the meeting agenda for the Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust’s board of investors didn’t provide enough information for the public to understand the planned vote or which companies would be impacted.
The board voted Wednesday to approve sending shareholder proposals to 10 major companies in an effort to pressure executives to change their policies, including the dispensing of the medication mifepristone and the distribution of images of child sex abuse. Most public companies give shareholders the opportunity to vote on compensation packages for executives and let management know their views on issues that could affect the value of shares, and the TSET wants shareholders to vote on their ideas.
Briggs, the Oklahoma local legal initiative attorney for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said the agenda did not provide details on which companies would receive a shareholder proposal and what would be included in the content of each. The question is whether the agenda item was deceptively vague, she said.
Treasurer Todd Russ, who chairs the board, said in a statement Monday there is “no reason to believe non-compliance occurred.”
“The Board relies on its legal counsel to ensure all actions are consistent with both the letter and spirit of Oklahoma’s sunshine laws,” he said in a statement. “Counsel from the Attorney General’s Office was present and advises the Board on compliance with the Open Meetings Act.”
A spokesperson for the Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office declined to comment. Public Access Counselor Anthony Sykes did not return a request for comment. Sykes’ unit within the Attorney General’s Office works to ensure compliance with the state’s open meeting and records laws. 
Oklahoma Voice initially requested the names of the companies that would receive letters  Wednesday but a spokesperson from the Oklahoma Treasurer’s Office said they weren’t publicly available. Oklahoma Voice submitted a formal open records to TSET on Thursday. A TSET official redirected Oklahoma Voice’s request to the Treasurer’s Office. The Treasurer’s Office had not provided records as of Monday. 
Spokespeople for Gov. Kevin Stitt, State Auditor and Inspector Cindy Byrd and Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, did not comment. The three leaders appointed the trio of board members serving alongside Russ. 
Senat, an Open Records Act expert and associate professor at Oklahoma State University, said the agenda posted ahead of Wednesday’s meeting should give notice of what will be discussed in “plain, simple language.” Senat said he doesn’t think the posted agenda meets these terms and said it could be argued the agenda obscures the “actual purpose of the discussion.”  
“This board is acting on behalf of and in the name of Oklahomans,” he said. “And Oklahomans were entitled to know which 10 companies and more specifics about these policies. That’s the point of our Open Records and Open Meetings Act.” 
The item on Wednesday’s agenda includes the “Presentation, Discussion, and Possible Action of 2026 Shareholder Proposals.” Listed as sub-items were “anti-trafficking” policies, “politicized and anti-religious discrimination in charitable gift matching,” “gender ideology activism in healthcare coverage,” dispensing of mifepristone, “risks of executive compensation plans that include DEI and ESG,” and “risks of China exposure on shareholder return.” 
The TSET board members, who oversee the investment of nearly $2 billion in public funds, said they were concerned that the companies’ policies could open the trust up to backlash and litigation. 
Briggs said a court would have to decide whether or not state law was violated. 
Since the TSET Board of Investors included “great specificity” about the specific companies and policies up for discussion during the November 2024 meeting, Briggs said it brings into question whether this information was intentionally left out of the agenda for Wednesday’s meeting. 
“You have a situation where at one meeting, and in one instance, they were willing to tell the public what companies and what policies they were worried about,” she said. “And you have another instance where they have deliberately decided not to reveal that information. And in fact, are misinterpreting the open records law to state that information is not public. Those are polar opposite interpretations of the law, and that violates the spirit of those laws. That doesn’t lend itself to good faith in government.”
Without stating publicly the exact action and who the individuals or entities are, it’s difficult to know what the actual purpose of those shareholder proposals are, she said. 
“If they knew in advance or during the meeting the specifics of the proposals that they would be voting on but the public did not, that would cut in favor of an agenda that was deceptive or misleading,” she said.

Although the rate hike would only amount to an 11% percent increase, the full dollar amount is staggering, Nessel said, and comes just three months after DTE received approval from the commission to increase its rates by $217 million.
Nessel urged the commission to reduce DTE’s rate hike by nearly 75%, reducing it to a 2.5% increase instead of the 11% initially requested.
The attorney general also recommended that DTE reprioritize customer dollars toward vegetation management and tree trimming, as opposed to raising rates on customers to bolster its grid. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“DTE is once again showing us where its priorities lie – and it isn’t with Michigan ratepayers,” Nessel said in a statement. “Just months after being granted a $200 million rate hike, DTE is back at the trough demanding half a billion dollars more from its customers. Our thorough review shows that nearly 75% of this proposed hike can’t be demonstrated to meaningfully improve service or do so cost effectively and stands only to enrich millionaire executives and far-flung shareholders.”
Nessel added: “At some point, this endless cycle of rate hike after rate hike from Consumers Energy and DTE must end.”
“Why not now? Michigan ratepayers deserve utility companies that deliver affordable, reliable energy, not ones that treat them like blank checks,” Nessel said.

How we choose judges is neither perfect nor devoid of politics. Yet Iowa does it better than many states, where judicial elections attract partisanship, ethical quagmires, and loads of PAC money.
For more than 60 years, Iowa governors have appointed trial and appellate judges from a list of applicants selected by nonpartisan judicial nominating commissions. Such commissions are considered the model process for choosing qualified, impartial judges.

Threat to nonpartisan judge selection
The nonpartisan nature of the commissions has come under threat recently. In 2019, the Legislature made changes to the composition of the State Judicial Nominating Commission, which picks nominees for the Iowa Supreme Court and the Iowa Court of Appeals, to give the governor the majority of appointments to the commission. Lawmakers have attempted similar changes to the commissions that pick district court judges.

Jeffrey Goodman has served on several judicial nominating committees at both the state and federal level. He is a friend, an attorney, a jury consultant, and now an author, and he’s shedding light on the often-opaque process of choosing judges.





“The Book of Judges: Perspectives from the Bench” contains essays from 66 judges. Goodman said he curated these essays because “those aspiring to serve on the bench deserve a reliable guidebook.” He plans a companion volume that imparts his perspectives on the nomination and selection process.
The book brims with wisdom for would-be judges in its 644 pages. It also offers the public insight into how judges wear their heavy robes: how they approach difficult decisions, learn unfamiliar areas of law, put aside their biases, and approach what retired District Judge Robert J. Blink called “the great unknowns of judging.”
I was particularly interested in how judges climbed to the bench. I suspect if there were elections, many accomplished jurists would have never been chosen.

Susan Christensen, chief justice of the Iowa Supreme Court, and Mary Chicchelly, an Iowa Court of Appeals judge, write of the persistence and perseverance required. Christensen received 14 “no’s” before she was nominated to become an associate district judge. The rejections were gut-punches, she said, that helped her grow into a more qualified candidate.
Colleagues warned Mark Bennett against expecting a nomination to federal judge, since he had no “campaign manager” nor had done anything to help the senator who would choose from more than 70 applicants. In fact, he never met a U.S. senator “until the day of my interview.” Department of Justice attorneys who interviewed him recommended that he change one of his answers if he wanted to be nominated. He didn’t, and he was eventually recommended by Sen. Tom Harkin and nominated by President Clinton.
John Jarvey, former chief U.S. district judge in Iowa’s Southern District, expounds on the questions that judicial candidates should receive, and those they should ignore.











And when the appointment process is political, it seems like the peripheral political players (often non-lawyers) just want to know if you identify more closely with Justice Antonin Scalia or Chief Justice Earl Warren. Others are concerned only with where you stand on abortion and the death penalty. (I never handled either question in 34 years on the federal bench.) This reductionist line of questioning is both annoying and unhelpful, because it does not get to where the fights are every day in court, nor does it capture what distinguishes one candidate from another.


– John Jarvey, former chief U.S. district judge for Iowa’s Southern District



Jarvey goes on to list questions he believes candidates should be able to answer. I liked this one: “What will you do for juries and the public to show them that the system is fair, effective, and efficient?”
Iowa state judges stand for retention, and a few have lost their positions because of controversial decisions. Former Chief Justice Marsha Ternus was voted out of office in 2010 after the Iowa Supreme Court’s Varnum v. Brien decision. That historic ruling said Iowa’s law prohibiting same-sex marriage was unconstitutional. She writes why the court’s unanimous decision was neither difficult nor surprising: Each justice came to his or her own independent decision “without fear, favor, or hope of reward.”
“We focused solely on the governing legal principles and in doing so found that the outcome was an easy decision for our court,” Ternus wrote. “The law guided us, and nothing else mattered.”
I’ve scratched only the surface of this remarkable book. Its insights should guide the next generation of judges and ensure they are worthy of the responsibility.

“Since the original call, multiple calls at multiple locations around the university have come in,” the Fayetteville Police Department posted on its Facebook page shortly after 2 p.m. “As of now, there are no confirmed gunshots, no confirmed injuries, no known suspects, and no arrests have been made.”
The first alert came on the University of Arkansas’ official social media account: “RazALERT Emergency Notification: Avoid the area of Mullins Library due to an active shooter reported. Avoid. Deny. Defend.”
University police guided students away from the library and into the nearby student union, one student told KNWA News in an on-air interview. Other buildings went into lockdown with students and faculty barricading themselves in place, one professor told the television stationg.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a social media post that she was monitoring the situation. U.S. Sen. John Boozman, and Reps. Bruce Westerman, Rick Crawford and Steve Womack released similar statements shortly after the university’s alert went out.
“My team and I are closely monitoring reports of an active shooter near Mullins Library on the University of Arkansas Fayetteville campus. If you’re in the vicinity, please follow all safety alerts,” Womack, who represents the Fayetteville area, wrote on X.
University spokesperson John Thomas saidn an in emailed statement just before 2 p.m.: “A RazALERT notification was sent to campus at 12:27 pm telling campus to avoid the area of Mullins Library due to a reported active shooter. Police are responding to multiple reports around campus.”
The reports come after multiple false reports of active shooters at other university campuses around the U.S. in recent days.

(Photo courtesy of the Arkansas Economic Development Commission)The Arkansas Economic Development Commission awarded more than $11.9 million in grants to local communities for facilities, emergency response equipment and wastewater projects at the Capitol in Little Rock Thursday.
According to a news release from the commission, 65 grants across three programs — the General Assistance Community Development Block Grant, Rural Services Block Grant and Rural Community Grant — were awarded.
The funding for both the general assistance block grants and rural services awards came from $17.48 million in community development grant money for small cities allocated to Arkansas by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
The grants help ensure Arkansans can live in “safe, vibrant communities,” Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said during a presentation in the governor’s conference room.
“Not only will this funding go towards critical infrastructure projects throughout the Natural State, but it will also fund community parks, walking trails, youth centers, and more – projects that will improve residents’ quality of life and ensure our towns and cities are great places to call home,” Sanders said.
Of the 65 grants, 20 will go toward projects like a wastewater treatment plant rehabilitation in Norfolk and storm siren replacements in Paragould. Other projects include renovations to a disabled adults learning center in Franklin County, were also given funding from the community development money.
The largest grant — $1 million — went to Benton County for a water line extension. The smallest, $3,500, will go toward a fire station remodel in Altus.
Funding for emergency response needs, such as special rescue team equipment in Huntsville and “jaws of life” equipment for the Cherry Valley Fire Department, comes from 29 rural community grants and 16 rural services block grants, according to the AEDC press release. The rural services grants also fund telecommunications equipment, pumper trucks and utility vehicles in some areas.
The grants were awarded through the commission’s Division of Rural Services and Grants Division.
“In Arkansas, strong communities are the foundation of our success,” said AEDC Executive Director Clint O’Neal.

The post DCFS timeline in foster child’s death reveals 10 caseworkers, but no credible findings of abuse by Beth Hundsdorfer appeared first on Capitol News Illinois - A service of the Illinois Press Foundation","The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services released a timeline into the case of Mackenzi Felmlee, inset, who mysteriously died in her Fairview Heights foster home. (Capitol News Illinois file photos)
Article Summary

Two months after it was first requested, the Illinois Department of Children Family Services released a timeline of involvement with a Fairview Heights foster child who died in the agency’s care.
Mackenzi Felmlee had 10 caseworkers from 2019 to 2024 while in state care.
The last contact Mackenzi’s caseworker made was a phone call with the foster mother that occurred two days before her death.

This summary was prepared by the editors and reporters who worked on the story.

Two days before police found Mackenzi Felmlee gasping for breath at the bottom of the stairs, her caseworker noted the foster mother told her the girl was “struggling.”
On May 11, 2024, Mackenzi, an 18-year-old foster child, died at a local hospital after she was found unresponsive in her Fairview Heights home. Shemeka Williams, Mackenzi’s foster mother, and Williams’ mother, Cornelia Reid, face first degree murder and child abuse charges.
The caseworker, identified only as S.M., was the 10th child welfare specialist in Mackenzi’s five-year-old case, according to a timeline released by the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services.
One of those 10 caseworkers, identified as D.R., was on Mackenzi’s case for only three weeks. D.R. was assigned the case on May 17, 2023, and ended the assignment on June 5, 2023 – just under a year before Mackenzi’s death.
“That is antithetical to sound social work practices,” said Cook County Public Guardian Charles Golbert, a critic of DCFS. “These kinds of complicated cases need consistency and if there’s not, it’s likely that things will fall through the cracks.”
DCFS released the timeline in Mackenzi’s case on Friday afternoon, two months after Capitol News Illinois requested it. The state agency noted the information released was sourced from Lutheran Child and Family Services, which monitored Mackenzi’s case, and Caritas Family Solutions, which licensed Shemeka Williams as a foster parent, and “is subject to change as the investigation continues.”
DCFS initially resisted releasing a timeline on Mackenzi’s case, citing the wishes of local prosecutors handling the murder charges against Williams and Reid. The St. Clair County state’s attorney’s office later confirmed to Capitol News Illinois last month they did not oppose the release of the information.
Williams and Reid were arrested in June, more than a year after Mackenzi’s death. They remain in St. Clair County Jail pending trial.
Mackenzi died from a blood clot that hit her lungs, doctors have said. Her neck, shoulders, legs and face were bruised, and her dehydrated body weighed just 90 pounds.
Williams’ 15-year-old biological daughter recorded a video of Mackenzi as she struggled to breathe at the bottom of the stairs in the Fairview Heights home. Police said it took nearly an hour for someone to call 911.
A doctor who reviewed the case told police if Mackenzi had received immediate treatment, she likely would have survived the clot and made a full recovery.
Mackenzi’s tumultuous teen years
The details of Mackenzi’s tumultuous teens years included parental criminal activity, drug use, abandonment, sexual exploitation and molestation by a guardian, then bouncing between relatives and foster placements.
From May 2019 to April 2020, Mackenzi was placed in “several” foster and relative placements that were “not able to meet her needs,” according to the DCFS timeline.
In April 2020, Mackenzi was placed in Williams’ foster home after DCFS determined she needed a specialized foster home for children with medical, emotional or behavioral disorders.
Mackenzi, a former honor roll student, was diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses, including post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder and depression.  She reportedly was under psychiatric care.
She was also incontinent; Williams made her wear diapers tied with plastic bags to her legs to keep the waste from leaking, prosecutors said. One doctor opined those bindings, coupled with her diminished physical condition likely caused the blood clot that went to her lungs and caused her death.
The investigation into her death also revealed videotaped evidence of Mackenzi’s abuse, including humiliation by mocking and being forced to wear feces-stained masks and underwear on her face, prosecutors said.
Video footage played during a court hearing showed Mackenzi being beaten by Williams with a belt while the teen is forced to say, “It’s not good to manipulate.”
In another video, Williams forced Mackenzi to repeat: “I am a doof. I hate myself.”
In the final year of her life, DCFS records showed LCFS caseworkers and supervisors visited Mackenzi in person 24 times.
But a search warrant application filed in court as part of the criminal investigation into Williams and Reid called into question some of the documentation made by at least one caseworker. In it, a Fairview Heights detective stated that during their investigation into Mackenzi’s death a caseworker was “copying and pasting notes for home visits, which does not appear to have correctly documented the visits.”
In addition to the reported visits with caseworkers and supervisors, she also met with an unspecified professional who was mandated by law to report allegations of child abuse or neglect. Seven of those visits were virtual and five were in-person.
Mackenzi’s juvenile case in Fayette County continued. On April 19, 2022, the parental rights of Mackenzi’s mother and father were terminated. LCFS reported that Mackenzi wanted to be adopted by Williams. Mackenzi was 16 at the time.
Mackenzi met with her court-appointed lawyer in December 2023 — six months before her death. There were also two court hearings on her case — one on Sept. 14-15, 2023, and another on March 14, 2024.   At the March hearing, the DCFS timeline noted the court considered whether to change Mackenzi’s goal, from adoption, but to independence. It’s unclear whether Mackenzi attended those hearings either in person or virtually.
Requests to open Mackenzi’s juvenile case were denied.
Mackenzi attended Belleville East High School for 10th and 11th grade. Prosecutors said Mackenzi was failing and truant, missing 15 out of 55 school days. She returned for the first semester of her senior year but after turning 18 in July 2023, she stopped going to school, opting to take night classes to finish her GED. She failed most of her classes for not completing the work, prosecutors have said.
Caritas Family Solutions, the agency that licensed Williams as a foster parent, also visited the home in person eight times and conducted two virtual visits.
Timeline details other reports of abuse 
Though DCFS stated in the timeline there were no reports of suspected abuse of Mackenzi until May 11 when police called the agency hotline to report Mackenzi’s death, there were reports of abuse of other children in the care of Reid and Williams:

In 2022, while Mackenzi was living with Williams, another child who was in the home alleged Williams abused them. DCFS interviewed the child at the hospital and found no evidence of physical abuse. Williams told DCFS she was trying to keep the child from jumping out of a car. The allegation was unfounded.
In 2015, Reid was accused of abuse or neglect. The allegation was unfounded and expunged. Four years later, Reid was accused of using a belt as corporal punishment. DCFS did not find sufficient evidence to support the allegation. But a 14-year-old boy told the investigator that if he was returned to Williams, he would attack her and run away, preferring to “die in the cold than stay.” The boy was removed, but the allegation again was unfounded by the agency.
In January 2015 and January 2017, Williams was the subject of two allegations related to abuse and neglect. DCFS investigated both allegations. Both were unfounded and the allegations were expunged.
A 17-year-old girl told DCFS in 2017 that Williams left town without planning for the girl’s care, according to prosecutors. Williams allegedly told the girl to “sleep outside” because no one would care for her because she wasn’t behaving. Williams later left the girl in the care of a friend, who was supposed to take her to school. The foster child missed four days of school. The teen told the worker she cried herself to sleep. The allegation was unfounded.
A 16-year-old foster child in Williams’ care took a bus to her former foster home. Williams went and dragged the child out and threw her in the car. She told medical personnel that she didn’t feel safe at Williams’ home and reported thoughts of suicide, as well as of killing Williams. This allegation, too, was unfounded.

Because DCFS investigators found no evidence of abuse, Caritas continued to license Williams’ home and LCFS continued to place children, including Mackenzi, with Williams.
In the month following Mackenzi’s death, DCFS interviewed Reid and Williams, according to the timeline. Police gave access to some of the investigatory files to a DCFS investigator, but a later request for videos and other evidence is denied by police in September 2024. Fairview Heights police inform DCFS that they are taking the lead on the investigation.
In December 2024, DCFS asked again for information from police, but the requests are denied, citing an ongoing investigation. For six months, DCFS was told the investigation was pending. In May, police informed DCFS that the case will go before a grand jury.

(Photo by Gage Skidmore)The Trump administration is appealing a judge’s recent ruling that Alina Habba has unlawfully served as New Jersey’s top federal prosecutor since July 1.
Attorney General Pamela Bondi vowed last week to challenge U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann’s ruling, just hours after it was filed, and she officially did so in a one-page notice of appeal Monday.
Habba, President Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer, didn’t wait for things to be official. She went on the offensive Sunday on Fox News, bashing a U.S. Senate tradition known as “blue slips,” which allows senators to block judicial and U.S. attorney nominees in their home states from advancing. Trump on Monday threatened to sue to end the century-old practice.
New Jersey’s two U.S. senators, Democrats Cory Booker and Andy Kim, have criticized Trump’s pick of Habba as U.S. attorney.
“Senator Booker and Senator Kim had absolutely every right to vote no for me for the U.S. Attorney position, but I had the right as the nominee to get in front of Senate and to be voted on, to be vetted. I never even got there. Of course not. I was, according to them, unqualified,” Habba said. “Why? Look at (Dem Rep.) Hakeem Jeffries’ tweet. Because I arrested a congresswoman for a charge of assaulting a police officer. And you know what? I stand by my work as the U.S. attorney, and I won’t be intimidated by this type of political rhetoric.”
She repeated that message on social media Monday, calling on Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who chairs the Senate’s Judiciary Committee, to end the blue-slip tradition.
“Remember, President Trump nominates individuals that he knows can get the job done. Your job is to work with your committee to advance their nominations. Doing the dirty work of Thom Tillis, Corey (sic) Booker and Andy Kim is NOT what America voted for,” she wrote. “Now New Jersey is becoming a playground for criminals because of partisan Federal Judges.”
Sen. Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina) also sits on the judiciary committee and has said he would honor blue slips.
It’s not clear whether opposition from Booker and Kim is all that has kept Habba from receiving confirmation from the U.S. Senate. Grassley on Monday said when Trump withdrew her name as a nominee for U.S. attorney — part of a series of legal and personnel moves the Trump administration undertook to keep Habba in the job past a statutory deadline — the judiciary committee had not received any of the paperwork needed for it to vet her nomination.
Habba has had a turbulent tenure since Trump named her to the post in an acting capacity in March, most rooted in her prosecutions of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver, both Democrats, stemming from their May visit to an immigrant jail in Newark. Her office has reportedly subpoenaed Gov. Phil Murphy, also a Democrat, over comments he made in February that suggested he might hide an undocumented immigrant in his home.
After the Senate did not act to confirm her, a federal panel of judges in New Jersey in July declined to extend her tenure and chose her top deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace, for the post. Trump officials, though, fired Grace and reinstalled Habba, setting off the legal battle that ended up before Brann.
Brann voided all Habba’s actions as acting U.S. attorney since July 1, but he stayed his decision pending appeal. He also called on her to recuse herself from prosecutions until the ongoing court battle ends, because federal prosecutions in New Jersey have largely ground to a halt, with questions about her authority unresolved. But she has refused to do so.
The case’s next stop will be the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals.

After several months of uncertainty and waiting, the State Health Plan board finally made some decisions recently about how it will deal with the half-billion-dollar shortfall it’s been running. And topping the list, as had been expected, will be some new and not insignificant premium hikes for state employees. The increases – especially when paired with the state legislature’s failure to reach agreement on a new state budget (and the freeze that’s effectively placed on employee salaries) – is causing a lot of heartburn for teachers and state employees and recently to learn more about how the increases will work, the concerns they’re provoking in various circles, and some of the other changes in store for Health Plan enrollees, senior contributor Rob Schofield caught up with NC Newsline reporter Lynn Bonner.

The recent action of the State Health Plan Board to raise employee premiums at a time in which teacher and state employee salaries remain stagnant is causing great concern in many circles – especially among the employees who will see their take-home pay decline even further.
Indeed, as became clear in a recent conversation with the President of the North Carolina Association of Educators, Tamika Walker Kelly, these developments can be seen, especially when combined with recent actions in Washington, as just the latest in what amounts to an ongoing ideological war on public schools.

The 2023 federal complaint against Kappa Kappa Gamma for welcoming a transgender woman was dismissed Friday for the second time. 
The post University of Wyoming sorority free to admit who it wants, including transgender students, judge rules appeared first on WyoFile .","Almost two years to the day after a federal court dismissed a lawsuit against a University of Wyoming sorority for admitting a transgender woman, U.S. District Court Judge Alan B. Johnson dismissed the case again.
In his ruling Friday, Johnson’s reasoning was much the same as it was the last time he tossed the case. Kappa Kappa Gamma, the sorority that admitted student Artemis Langford in the fall of 2022, has the freedom as a private organization to decide who it wants to admit as members — including transgender women — the judge concluded.
“In short, we are required to leave Kappa alone,” Johnson wrote. 
In 2023, six Kappa Kappa Gamma members sued the sorority for allegedly breaking its bylaws, breaching housing contracts and misleading sisters when it admitted Langford by a vote of its members. 
The case attracted national media attention, especially from conservative outlets, and the Trump administration announced in June that it was investigating UW for alleged Title IX violations stemming from the case. 
Arguing that the government cannot interfere with how a private, voluntary organization determines its members, Johnson dismissed the case in August 2023. Plaintiffs then attempted to appeal the decision, but the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver rejected the case in June 2024, kicking it back down to the lower court on the grounds Johnson’s ruling did not amount to a final order. As a result, the appeals panel did not have jurisdiction over the matter.
The dispute then went unresolved as the plaintiffs failed to take any action. In May, Johnson gave them a deadline: file an amended complaint or ask for a final ruling. 
In June, a new set of plaintiffs — former UW students Hannah Holtmeier, Allison Coghan and Haley Rutsch — filed an amended complaint. They also dropped Langford as a defendant. 
But even with slightly different claims and bolstered arguments, Johnson reached a similar conclusion as before.
“Having considered the issues presented (again), we find that the majority of the claims must be dismissed on the grounds that this Court still may not interfere with Kappa’s contractually valid interpretation of its own Bylaws,” Johnson ruled. 
Nothing in Kappa’s governing documents requires the exclusion of transgender women, Johnson determined, and therefore the organization has not broken its own rules. 
Furthermore, neither the sorority nor its governing body have concealed its inclusive definition — “in fact, it has published and distributed multiple texts clarifying the issue,” Johnson wrote.
The plaintiffs also alleged the sorority broke its voting procedure when it admitted Langford. But “they have not shown that any resulting damages surpass the amount in controversy” required to have standing in court, Johnson wrote.
While the plaintiffs did not present new evidence in the amended complaint, they did point to an executive order issued by the Trump administration earlier this year.
May Mailman, a former attorney for the plaintiffs, has been credited with crafting the order alongside Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff for policy. 
It states that “women… shall mean adult… human females” and “female… means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell.”
“We are not entirely sure what this definition means, not having a degree in biology,” Johnson wrote. “But even assuming this definition aligned with Plaintiffs’, it only applies to the Executive Branch’s interpretation of federal laws and administration policy. It is not relevant in the world of private contacts, which is where we currently find ourselves.”
Unlike the case’s dismissal in 2023, Johnson ruled “with prejudice” on Friday, meaning the same claims cannot be brought back to his court. An appeal, however, could be filed. 
But Johnson pointed to another means of resolution in his ruling. 
“Plaintiffs could advocate for a new amendment to the Bylaws, defining the word ‘woman’ as they wish, which would restrain Kappa from choosing between various reasonable definitions of the term,” Johnson wrote, pointing to the organization’s biennial conventions where such decisions are made. 
“If as many Kappa members are upset about the admission of transgender women members as Plaintiffs claim, this internal remedy should be more than sufficient to achieve their aims.”

Duke Energy. Most households in North Carolina pay their electric bill each month to the Charlotte-based energy giant. What many may not realize, however, is that there are two Duke Energies — Duke Energy Carolinas in the west and Duke Energy Progress in the east. And now, thirteen years after they first got together, the two have filed documents with state and federal regulators to complete their merger into one giant utility provider. So, what does this mean, what is Duke saying and what happens next? And how will all of this interact with a new state law that allows Duke to delay its carbon reduction goals?
Recently Newsline got a chance to pose all these questions and more to a journalist and researcher who has followed the state’s electricity industry for many years — Energy and Policy Institute Research and Communications manager Sue Sturgis.

Rural residents will be hardest hit by looming health insurance premium increases, according to a new report. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)A combination of Trump administration policies will make health care coverage more expensive for people who purchase plans from health insurance marketplaces — and rural residents will be hit the hardest, according to a new analysis.
Researchers from the Century Foundation say Trump administration policies — especially its refusal to ask Congress to extend Biden-era tax credits that are set to expire at the end of this year — will boost out-of-pocket premiums by 93% in the 32 states that allow the federal government to operate their Affordable Care Act insurance marketplaces. New rules and tariffs will have a smaller impact.
Rural county residents in those states will see an increase of 107%, while residents of urban counties will pay 89% more, according to the analysis by the Century Foundation, a left-leaning research nonprofit.
Insurers participating in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces are proposing a median premium increase of 18% for 2026 — the biggest jump since 2018 and 11 points more than the growth from 2024 to this year. That bump would come on top of the increase resulting from the expiration of the tax credits and the other policy changes.
About 2.8 million people who are enrolled in marketplace plans in the 32 states live in rural counties, including 776,000 adults between the ages of 55 to 64 and more than 223,000 children, according to the Century Foundation.
“Rural residents tend to be older. They may be more likely to have chronic illness at the same time,” said Jeanne Lambrew, director of health care reform at the foundation. “It costs more, both because they have somewhat greater needs and less access to health care.”
Millions will see rise in health insurance premiums if federal subsidies expire

The researchers calculated that average annual premiums for rural residents will increase by $760 — 28% more than the expected average increase for urban residents. States where rural enrollees are expected to see the highest cost increases are Wyoming ($1,943), Alaska ($1,835), and Illinois ($1,700).
Many of the states with a large number of rural residents have chosen not to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, meaning many people who earn between 100% and 138% of the federal poverty level, between $15,650 and $21,597 for an individual, get their coverage from an insurance marketplace, Lambrew said.
Of the seven states where 10% or more of rural residents are enrolled in marketplace plans (Alabama, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Wyoming), only two — Nebraska and North Carolina — have expanded Medicaid.
State officials in Pennsylvania recently advised residents who use the marketplace that they should closely examine the plans that are available.
“This year, even more than previous years, Pennsylvanians should consider shopping around to find the best plans to meet their individual needs, at a price that makes sense for their current financial situation,” Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner Michael Humphreys said in a statement released at the beginning of this month.
Lambrew said the increases will force many people to forgo insurance altogether.
“It’s harmful for those individuals in terms of their own health and life expectancy. It’s harmful for our providers, because they’re now dealing with people who are sicker and in the wrong settings, and it’s kind of expensive for our society,” Lambrew said.
“We know health insurance matters, so having these large potential increases on uninsured Americans is distressing.”

This week on the Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon editor Laura Colarusso sits down with Gateway Cities reporter Hallie Claflin to talk about her recent reporting in Holyoke – where city leaders and housing developers have struggled to restore vacant mills and blighted industrial buildings. They discuss the costly environmental hazards associated with these proj[...]","EPISODE INFO

HOST:  Laura Colarusso
GUEST: Hallie Claflin







IN RECENT DECADES, many historic mills and old industrial buildings in Gateway Cities across the Commonwealth have found a second life – renovated and converted into much-needed housing. The projects are often a way for cities to preserve their historic charm while creating modern residential units in high demand. They also help to revitalize post-industrial era cities that suffered from the long-term decline of manufacturing. 
On The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon editor Laura Colarusso and Gateway Cities reporter Hallie Claflin discuss why Eastern Massachusetts cities like Lowell and Lawrence have found success in their renovation efforts, with almost no former industrial buildings left to restore. Meanwhile, cities farther west, with weaker housing markets and that don’t enjoy the luxury of being connected to Greater Boston via the commuter rail, still struggle with an array of blighted properties that have yet to be developed.  
Claflin recently travelled to Holyoke and reported on the city’s sluggish housing market and a handful of its restoration projects. In these communities – like Holyoke, Springfield, and Fitchburg – the market rarely supports rents that attract developers for these projects. 
The renovation projects are often seen by researchers and policymakers as a faster, cheaper alternative to new housing construction, which developers say couldn’t be further from the truth. State and federal funding is almost always needed to fill a developer’s project financing gap, but those tax credits and payouts come slowly and to only a handful of developers who are willing to invest years into a project before making a profit. But many aren’t willing to stick around in cities like Holyoke.  
Claflin explains how the stigma that comes with being a diverse, low-income city works to stunt housing development in Holyoke. Small businesses that would otherwise promote growth and further development don’t want to open next to old, blighted buildings that are boarded up.  
Blighted properties and century-old mills often require extensive environmental clean-up and remediation efforts, which is time-consuming, expensive, and drives developers away. If a mill can be rehabilitated, it often takes 10 years or more. Holyoke officials told Claflin their housing crisis cannot be remedied on that timeline. 
Despite the challenges, a number of small-scale, local developers have managed to restore a handful of vacant mills in Holyoke. Those developers say it took market-rate housing subsidies, a lot of patience, and a little bit of luck.  
“I talked about this as the stars aligning, because that really is what needs to happen in order for these projects to work,” Claflin said. “It seems like everything has to fall in place perfectly, otherwise there would be no difference between this building that got renovated and this one that’s been sitting vacant.”  
Backlogged tax credits, competitive funding pools, and inadequate state grants and credits have served as barriers. On top of elevated construction costs, developers are now grappling with the uncertainty of tariffs.  
During the episode, Claflin and Colarusso discuss why it is so difficult to restore blighted industrial properties (15:51), state and federal funding barriers (20:15), and why Western Massachusetts cities struggle more than those connected to Greater Boston (5:20).

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Roanoke College has been found in violation of state and federal civil rights laws, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares announced Monday, citing discrimination against female student athletes.
The findings come after the institution “retaliated” against multiple female swimmers for speaking out against the private liberal arts college, according to the AG’s office, for allowing a transgender woman athlete to compete with them in August 2023.
Roanoke College did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday. But President Frank Shushok Jr. said in a past statement about the issue that the school’s goal was “maintaining fairness in competition and protecting the integrity of all athletics at Roanoke College,” and reiterated that the college was “committed to supporting our LGBTQ+ community and our student-athletes, all of whom are valued members of our vibrant community.”   
“Women deserve an equal opportunity to participate in competitive sports,” Miyares said in a statement on Monday. “That opportunity is protected by state and federal law. The Roanoke women swimmers endured harassment, discrimination, and retaliation just for standing up for their right to compete. My office will keep working to ensure equal opportunities for female athletes in sex-separated collegiate sports.” Miyares is running for reelection this fall.
Upon the completion of the investigation, the office said that the school violated the Virginia Human Rights Act (VHRA), which prohibits unlawful discrimination and retaliation by educational institutions on the basis of sex. Miyares added that the college treated biologically female swimmers unfairly and punished them for speaking out, which violates Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.
According to the Office of Civil Rights, the investigation began after the college notified the women’s swim team that a biological male, who identified as trans and who underwent hormone therapy, would be competing on the women’s swim team around August 2023. The swimmer, a former member of the men’s team, underwent the treatment as a requirement to meet the National Collegiate Athletic Association’s (NCAA) then-existing anti-competitive guidelines.
The school said in an October 5, 2023 statement that it was the first time the school encountered this type of situation, which prompted school administrators to launch “a process to help inform our decision on transgender student-athlete participation in all sports at the College.” The statement also noted that the NCAA had provided “confusing and contradictory guidance for schools to navigate” concerning trans athletes. 
Ultimately, the Board of Trustees voted to “defer to the policy of the national governing body of each sport regarding student-athlete participation eligibility” moving forward. 
Concerned about perceived disparities in treatment and expectations, the female swimmers voiced their concerns to the college’s leadership. The trans athlete withdrew their request to participate on the women’s swim team.
The office stated that the athletic director and the college’s administration “ignored their objections,” kept the swimmer, and refused to change its policy. Upon speaking publicly about the issue, the female swimmers said they faced retaliation from the college and an unspecified educator, which denied their applications for a study-abroad program.
“I urge Roanoke College to ensure that no educator can unjustly derail a student’s journey in the future without facing serious consequences,” Katie Mullins, mother to former team captain Lily Mullins, in a statement on behalf of her daughter. “Your actions were not just a reflection of personal bias; they were a betrayal of the values that an education should uphold.”
Nationally, conservatives have argued that having transgender student athletes compete in women’s sports destroys moral and religious freedoms. Republicans have also expressed concern about competitive fairness, which triggered President Donald Trump to sign an executive order prohibiting transgender athletes from competing in women’s sports on Feb. 5. The order included a pledge to rescind federal funding from educational programs that didn’t comply.
In Virginia, Gov. Glenn Youngkin attended Trump’s executive order signing in February and Republicans in the state have opposed transgender athletes playing women’s sports.
Youngkin’s administration also overhauled the state’s policies on the treatment of transgender students in K-12 public education by requiring students to use bathrooms and locker rooms based on their biological sex at birth.

“The benefits in this filing are unprecedented and underscore Blackstone Infrastructure’s commitment to PNM and New Mexico,” PNM President and CEO Don Tarry said in a statement. “The energy landscape is changing, and New Mexico is at a critical point in time. This transaction keeps PNM rooted in New Mexico while giving it the financial strength to transform our grid and harness the opportunities to benefit our customers and communities for decades to come.”
The deal is subject to approval by the PRC.
In a news release Monday, PNM said the acquisition would “provide the financial resources necessary to thrive in a rapidly changing energy environment and is designed to strengthen the state’s largest electricity provider, not change it.” The news release says Blackstone has committed to hold TXNM Energy for at least 10 years; keep PNM headquartered in New Mexico; and honor its current union commitments.
“We’ve been talking with various parties and leaders across New Mexico to share our intentions for this proposed investment, and today’s filing backs up these conversations with real commitments that exceed any amounts delivered in state history,” Sean Klimczak, global head of Blackstone Infrastructure, said in a statement. The news release said Klimczak’s company “has a long-term ‘patient capital’ approach to investing and that it invests in well-run companies and ensures those companies have the resources they need to flourish.” PNM provides that opportunity, Klimczak said, “as it works to maximize New Mexico’s unique potential to serve growing energy demands with carbon-free energy.”
As outlined in the news release, the application filed Monday says Blackstone will provide a $105 million in rate credits to PNM customers paid over four years, an average $168 savings per customer; triple PNM’s Good Neighbor Fund for low-income customers; and invest $35 million in “large-impact” economic development programs and $25 million to accelerate the state’s energy transition goals.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/IMG_0836-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-25 14:57:46.808491

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The panel overseeing Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita’s professional misconduct case denied his effort to force the state’s disciplinary commission to turn over internal records and instead set the matter for a December hearing.
In two orders issued Friday, the three-member panel — Indiana Court of Appeals Judges Cale J. Bradford and Nancy H. Vaidik, along with former U.S. Magistrate Judge William G. Hussmann Jr. — said the only question before them is whether Rokita “violated his duty of candor to the Supreme Court by admitting that he had violated the disciplinary rules without really meaning it.”
Rokita’s defense lawyers sought to obtain internal communications from the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission about him and the motives for its investigations.
They argued his comments were protected by the First Amendment and claimed the commission’s complaint violated Indiana’s Anti-SLAPP statute, which prohibits frivolous lawsuits aimed at silencing critics.











We cannot see how any internal communication, investigation, or other information gathered by the Commission could shed any light on Respondent’s state of mind when he indicated to the Supreme Court that he had taken responsibility.


– court order issued Friday, Aug. 22, 2025


Earlier this month, Rokita formally replied to the commission’s allegations, denying that his 2023 press release contradicted his sworn statements to the Supreme Court. His defense maintained the case was an attempt to punish him for protected political speech.
But the panel flatly rejected those arguments.
The judges ruled that such internal records fall outside the scope of the Indiana Supreme Court’s guidance, which limited the case to whether Rokita “intentionally misled” the justices in 2023, “thereby violating his duty of candor, and nothing more.”
“Because the matters for which Respondent [Rokita] seeks discovery are not before the Panel, they are not relevant, and we therefore deny Respondent’s motion to compel discovery in all respects,” the panel wrote.
Panel rejects Anti-SLAPP defense
In Friday’s discovery order, the panel said Rokita cannot pursue an Anti-SLAPP defense because disciplinary proceedings are “neither criminal nor civil” and no U.S. jurisdiction has allowed such a defense.
The panel cited precedent from Rhode Island and emphasized that “the purpose and application of the anti-SLAPP statute are wholly inapplicable to attorney disciplinary proceedings.”
“The respondent is not being sued for his exercise of First Amendment rights of free speech; rather, he is the subject of a disciplinary complaint, deriving from his conduct as a licensed attorney … ,” the panel wrote. “We find no merit in respondent’s claim that this process is somehow being used as a vehicle for chilling his free speech rights.”
The panel denied the discovery requests entirely, noting they were all aimed at supporting Rokita’s argument that the case was meant to chill his free speech.
Story continues below.
Hearing Officer Order Issued - O
 
“We cannot see how any internal communication, investigation, or other information gathered by the Commission could shed any light on Respondent’s state of mind when he indicated to the Supreme Court that he had taken responsibility,” the order continued.
The panel further ruled that no motions to delay or dismiss the case will be entertained going forward and ordered all discovery to be completed by Nov. 12.
A separate scheduling order set a full evidentiary hearing on the case for Dec. 18 in Marion Superior Court, to continue “until completion.” 
Preliminary witness and exhibit lists are due Sept. 18, followed by a pre-hearing on Sept. 30 and a final pre-hearing on Nov. 19. Final witness lists and pre-hearing briefs must be filed by Dec. 4.
The panel also urged the parties to attempt mediation within 45 days, naming three potential mediators — former Indiana Supreme Court Justice Steven David, and Indianapolis attorneys Patricia Polis McCrory and James Riley Jr. The parties must report back to the court if they’re able to agree on one.
The three-judge panel will oversee the trial-like hearing and make a recommendation, but the Indiana Supreme Court will ultimately decide whether Rokita faces discipline. That discipline could range from another reprimand to law license suspension or disbarment.
An ongoing saga
The disciplinary commission’s case stems from Rokita’s public comments in 2022 about Indianapolis OB-GYN Dr. Caitlin Bernard, who provided abortion care to a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio. 
The commission alleged that Rokita’s Fox News interview remarks risked prejudicing proceedings against Bernard and served “no substantial purpose” beyond embarrassing or burdening her — violating Indiana’s professional conduct rules for attorneys.
Rokita’s office settled an initial complaint about his comments in November 2023. In a sworn affidavit, Rokita admitted to violating two professional conduct rules in exchange for a public reprimand. A third count was dismissed.
The Indiana Supreme Court approved the agreement, publicly reprimanding the Republican attorney general. Bernard was also disciplined before the Medical Licensing Board for discussing the procedure publicly.
Indiana AG Todd Rokita continues to dispute misconduct charges in new supreme court filing

Although he agreed not to contest the charges, the conflict resumed after Rokita issued a news release and gave interviews suggesting he had not actually done anything wrong. He said he had “evidence and explanation” for what he said on air, but chose not to fight the complaint any further to save “taxpayer money and distraction.”
The commission filed a new complaint in January, accusing Rokita of misleading the court and misrepresenting his acceptance of responsibility in the earlier disciplinary case.
The commission said Rokita acted with “a deliberate or reckless disregard for the truth” and has since opposed his request to dismiss the new charges.
Rokita attempted to get the new complaint dismissed, but the state supreme court ruled in July to let it go forward.
The attorney general has consistently maintained the professional conduct proceedings are the result of a politically charged and unaccountable disciplinary process.
Public records show taxpayers have already spent nearly $500,000 on Rokita’s legal defense in the matter.
Rokita flatly denied each allegation in his latest response and claimed the commission created “widespread confusion in the media” by pursuing charges it had already agreed to dismiss.
His lawyers also cast the complaints against him as partisan attacks, maintaining that, “Democrat activists filed complaints against him for politically motivated reasons” and insisted that Rokita “denies ethical misconduct or that he was dishonest with the Court.”

Police said a man shot dead by police in Springfield last Thursday was accelerating toward officers in a vehicle when they opened fire.
Vermont State Police said the man killed, James Crary, 36, was a resident of Newport, New Hampshire. State police detectives are continuing to investigate the shooting.
According to a state police press release, Springfield Police Officer Vincent T. Franchi and Windsor County Sheriff’s Deputy Bryan Jalava both opened fire on Crary using department-issued firearms. The officers were standing outside their vehicles when Crary accelerated toward them, the release stated.
According to the release, Franchi and Jalava arrived at 78 Valley Street in Springfield around 9:30 p.m. Thursday as part of an investigation. They encountered Crary in a vehicle outside a home there.
Crary was pronounced dead on scene. State police then responded and began investigating the shooting, according to the release. Crary’s cause of death was determined by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner to be gunshot wounds to the head, and his death is considered a homicide.
Franchi was hired by the Springfield Police Department as a full-time officer in August 2020 and worked in that role until March 2024. He returned to the department as a full-time officer in April 2025, according to state police.
Jalava began work as a full-time officer with the Windsor County Sheriff’s Department in May 2024 after beginning his career with the Hinsdale Police Department in New Hampshire in 2016, and later working for the Windham County Sheriff’s Department, according to state police. 
Both officers have been placed on paid leave while the investigation continues.
Vermont State Police said they were not involved in the investigation that brought Franchi and Jalava to the scene.
Vermont State Police said they will turn over the results of the investigation to the Vermont Attorney General’s Office and the appropriate state’s attorney’s office for review of the deadly use of force.

Ruben Gallego said New Hampshire “definitely has to be in the mix” to be the first primary election in the 2028 U.S. presidential cycle despite telling the state to “move on” a few years back.
In 2021, as Democrats debated whether to move the beginning of the presidential primary election season to South Carolina, the Arizona Democrat posted to social media: “Love my friends in Iowa and New Hampshire but time to move on. South Carolina and Nevada should start the primaries.”
However, his view seems to have changed.
“I won’t tell the DNC what to do,” he told reporters before a town hall in Nashua. “I will say that, the Democrats, as you notice, we’re hemorrhaging independent voters. We’re going to have to figure out how to win independent voters. This is a state that will probably be one of those really pivotal states where Democrats figure that out. But it definitely has to be, in my opinion, definitely has to be in the mix, especially considering how politics has changed.”
Asked about his previous statements, Gallego said: “Certainly, that was a response to what was happening on the ground back in the day.”
During his visit, Gallego — who also visited Iowa the same month and Pennsylvania in May — stoked rumors he was considering a 2028 presidential run. Friday, he also visited union workers alongside New Hampshire U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, answered questions from voters at a Nashua townhall with U.S. Rep. Maggie Goodlander, and participated in the New Hampshire Institute of Politics’ “Politics and Eggs” event, a common stop for New Hampshire primary candidates. However, the Arizona Democrat denied the speculation.
“I don’t know where my future goes,” he said at the Institute of Politics. “I don’t see it happening. Largely because I have three kids and a new one.”
He said his trip was meant to simply support Democrats like Pappas and Goodlander.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3017-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-25 13:57:38.548722

The family of Curtis and Lori Wagler are suing Sheriff Rich McNamee, Henry County Deputy Carlos Lopez, and the county in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. They allege Lopez’s conduct was “so clearly abusive and in violation of the law that he earned his way to being the sole member of the county’s Brady-Giglio list” — a reference to the list of law enforcement officers known by prosecutors to have been untruthful in the course of their police work.
The lawsuit, filed in federal court, says the Waglers own a family lumber business called Outdoor Tradition. On April 21, 2023, Lopez and seven other police officers are alleged to have arrived at the Wagler home to execute a search warrant allowing them to seize financial records related to Outdoor Tradition. The couple and their 20-year-old son, Owen Wagler, were arrested on 10 felony counts each, the lawsuit claims, and Curtis Wagler allegedly was subjected to two body-cavity searches.

The Waglers were released later that day and returned home to find “their belongings were all over the floor,” with closets “ripped out” and their house ransacked by police, the lawsuit claims. It also alleges that Lopez then “commenced a smear campaign against the Waglers” and contacted the couple’s customers claiming they were being scammed and defrauded. In early November 2023, the criminal case against the Waglers was dismissed by Henry County Attorney Darin Stater, the lawsuit states.
According to the lawsuit, Stater said in a letter tied to his decision to dismiss the case that “my office was left scrambling to determine the legitimacy of 30 felony charges without a single report or any type of notification that Deputy Lopez intended to take any of these actions … After I informed Deputy Lopez that I didn’t approve the theft charges, a press release was distributed by the Henry County Sheriff’s Office stating that the Waglers had been arrested and charged with ongoing criminal conduct and falsely stating that they had each been charged with nine felony thefts.”
The prosecutor’s letter allegedly goes on to say that “it turns out that my decision to dismiss the charges was the right thing to do. Not only did Deputy Lopez’s report fail to include evidence in support of criminal charges, but there is information showing that at least one of Deputy Lopez’s sworn affidavits contains a false statement. To date, my office has not been presented with any evidence to support any criminal charge on any of the Waglers.”
In December 2023, Stater placed Lopez on the county’s Brady-Giglio list, citing the April 21 incident. Since then, the lawsuit claims, the sheriff’s office has publicly claimed the Waglers are being “actively investigated” and has continued to imply they are engaged in criminal activity.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for unlawful arrest, illegal search, assault, battery and malicious prosecution.
Court records indicate the search warrant application filled out by Lopez was tied to a criminal investigation into the Waglers that stemmed from the complaints by individuals and companies who alleged they’d each paid the Waglers $3,000 to $54,000 for wood products that were never delivered.
In Curtis and Lori Wagler’s 2021 bankruptcy case, one bank that acted as a lender to the couple alleged the Waglers had reorganized a failed business, Wagler Manufacturing, as the newly formed Outdoor Tradition, which the bank said was owned largely by the couple’s children, two of whom were minors.
The bank characterized that reorganization as an attempted “end-run” around bankruptcy laws, made in an alleged effort to shield assets “with the intent to defraud” the Waglers’ creditors. The Waglers subsequently agreed to consider themselves 100% owners of Outdoor Traditions for purposes of the bankruptcy case, which remains open.
In a 2024 bankruptcy filing, the couple listed $133,000 in assets and $3.5 million in debts and liabilities.
In court filings, the county says that over the course of at least seven months, the sheriff’s department investigated the theft and fraud allegations made by customers of Outdoor Traditions. The warrant to search of the Wagler home and business and to seize “books, records, receipts, notes, ledgers, and other papers” was approved by a judge and an assistant county attorney, lawyers for the county state, adding that the Waglers have failed to show any evidence their Fourth Amendment rights were violated.
“After seven months of investigation, on April 18, 2023, Deputy Lopez sought approval of the search warrant at issue,” the county says in its motion to dismiss the case. “Finding the information Deputy Lopez included in the warrant justified probable cause, Magistrate Timothy Liechty also signed the warrant in approval.”
The county also claims that with regard to the claims of malicious prosecution and assault, the family has not backed up those claims with any factual evidence of malice or assault. The county acknowledges that while the family claims Curtis Wagler was subjected to cavity searches and that another family member was handcuffed, there is no allegation of harmful or offensive contact with Lori Wagler.
A trial in the matter is currently scheduled for April 12, 2027.

(Photo courtesy of attorney general's X account)The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services is “not just looking for agricultural bugs” at its inspection points on highways, but also “drugs and thugs,” the department’s commissioner said Monday. 
During a news conference Monday, Attorney General James Uthmeier and Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson focused on the recent immigration-related hot topic, non-domiciled commercial drivers, or nonresidents of the state their driver’s license was issued in. 
“If you can’t read street signs, how are you going to drive large commercial vehicles, 18-wheelers, tractor trailers in a safe manner?” Uthmeier said. 
Last week, Lt. Gov. Jay Collins flew to California to extradite Harjinder Singh, an immigrant with a California commercial driver’s license being charged with three counts of vehicular homicide after attempting a U-Turn in a semi-truck on the Florida Turnpike. A minivan crashed into his vehicle, killing three people.
Driver’s licenses from “sanctuary states” “are no good here,” Uthmeier said.
Monday, the attorney general sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, asking the federal government to “decertify California’s and Washington’s CDL [commerial drivers’ license] programs if the audit confirms a pattern or practice of deliberately, recklessly, or negligently issuing CDLs in violation of federal law.”
“The administrative and financial consequences attending to decertification would incentivize offending states to quickly bring themselves into compliance, making all American roadways safer,” Uthmeier wrote.
Following the news of Singh’s arrest, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a pause in work visas for some truck drivers.
The news conference was staged in Live Oak at an agricultural interdiction point on Interstate 10. 
“Our goal is to continue to ramp up our encounters here at the interdiction stations and make sure we’re getting these guys off the road,” Simpson said, adding that all sworn state agricultural law enforcement officers are deputized by the federal government to enforce immigration laws. 
Last week, Florida Highway Patrol and federal officials focused on Panhandle immigration enforcement, announcing nearly 200 people apprehended over three days. 
“There’s no telling how many illegal aliens are in this country driving large commercial vehicles and putting American families in a safety risk every single day,” Uthmeier said. 
Simpson said the state will enforce President Donald Trump’s executive order, signed earlier this year, in which the president said, “Proficiency in English … should be a non-negotiable safety requirement for professional drivers,” among other expectations of truck drivers under federal law.

DemasThis article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.
As experts gathered in Geneva this month to negotiate an enforceable global plastic pollution treaty, scientists studying the Great Lakes continued their research that could pinpoint how microplastics impact human health and ultimately inform decisions made across the world.
The effects of microplastics in wildlife have been documented for over a decade. These effects include declines in fertility in aquatic wildlife; negative behavioral changes; decline in reproduction and metabolic disorders.
However, because microplastics come from so many different sources—such as the air, drinking water and foods—that data can’t be used to determine exact impacts on humans. Other scientists have found microplastics in human brains, placentas and other organs.
Microplastics and other contaminants threaten the ecology of the Great Lakes, which contain almost 90 percent of the freshwater in the United States. Experts are warning their colleagues and those who rely on the Great Lakes about the documented and potential effects of these materials on the environment and human health. The Great Lakes basin, which spans the U.S. and Canada, provides millions of people with freshwater for drinking, agriculture and industry.
Chelsea Rochman, a microplastics researcher and associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Toronto, is currently studying how microplastics act in the environment of the Great Lakes. She is currently a research fellow at the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) Experimental Lakes Area, a remote area of 58 freshwater lakes in Ontario, where scientists can manipulate bodies of water for research purposes to understand how human activity impacts freshwater.
Rochman said that when she began researching microplastics in the Great Lakes, she partnered with Canada’s Ministry of the Environment to test fish that humans eat, specifically in the fillet parts of fish from Lakes Ontario and Superior. While there is no direct research or data showing impacts of microplastics on human health yet, Rochman said that based on the documented impacts on animals and ecological systems, the findings alarmed her.

“When we look at those fish, we find microplastics in every single fish,” Rochman said. “Near the city of Toronto, we find hundreds of particles in an individual fish, sometimes as many as 1,000 in the gut, and dozens of particles in the filet. So it’s a contamination like I’ve never seen before.”
She said that “relevant to other fish,” the fish in the Great Lakes have the highest concentration of plastic in the world in their gut, among areas that have been measured and reported.
“People who eat fish from the Great Lakes could be at risk of being more exposed [to microplastics] from fish than anywhere else in the world,” she said, but emphasized that because microplastics come from so many different sources, fish aren’t a main concern in terms of sources of exposure.
Rochman’s research has helped her develop policy recommendations for both the United States and Canada, which she hopes governments will use in the near future. Those recommendations include protocols for setting up a monitoring framework for microplastics, creating a risk assessment framework and implementing a monitoring program across the basin.
One of the main challenges of microplastics research is determining how the particles act in nature. In the Great Lakes, since there are so many other sources of microplastics—such as stormwater runoff and pollution—documenting their impacts in the natural environment isn’t as easy. The Experimental Lakes Area enables more accurate research that can inform policy and potentially provide clearer answers about impacts on human health in the future..
Other researchers are applying their work to the basin directly. Junhong Chen, a professor at the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering at the University of Chicago, is co-leading the Great Lakes ReNEW Water Innovation Engine program, which aims to recycle water from the Great Lakes into a clean energy resource and recover heavy metal contaminants to build batteries. The project also focuses on removing contaminants—including heavy metals, bacteria, nutrients and microplastics—from the water. The 10-year effort is funded by a $160 million grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) Recovery of any Nutrients, Energy, Water (ReNEW) program.
The project is currently calling for proposals, with a focus on separation and detection of contaminants, namely microplastics and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), from wastewater. Chen said separating useful resources and contaminants from wastewater helps create a circular water economy, in which water is circulated sustainably so that it isn’t wasted and contaminants are turned into feedstock for new products.
“We don’t have any new data on the plastics yet, but it’s in the pipeline for us to focus on,” he said. “We need to design approaches that can selectively attract or bind with PFAS and microplastics so that they can be preferentially taken out [of water].”
By selecting and removing contaminants, Chen said that water can continue to serve “practical uses,” such as for drinking. The goal is to develop technology to effectively remove contaminants from water while preserving beneficial minerals. The technology could have the potential to improve the health of the Great Lakes and other bodies of water around the world.
Chen said he hopes the program will impact the Great Lakes region “for many decades beyond the 10-year period.”
Developing policy recommendations is a primary goal of microplastics research, experts believe. Susanne Brander, an ecotoxicologist and associate professor at Oregon State University who is also working on the global plastics treaty as a scientist coalition steering committee member, said that her work encourages policy development to reduce plastic inputs from upstream sources, such as plastic production from single-use plastics, food and beverage waste and industrial practices that is carried into large bodies of water by rivers and stormwater runoff.
Brander said that methods like recycling and cleanup efforts aren’t enough to address the problem on a global scale, and producing less plastic is necessary to mitigate plastic pollution.
“All those things are good, but they are a drop in the bucket compared to having legislation,” Brander said. She encourages developing quantitative reduction targets for plastic production, banning the use of highly toxic plastic polymers that are most likely to fragment into microplastics and then get into the environment and mandating recycling rates.
“Those upstream measures are what we need for the Great Lakes and also for the planet in general,” she said.
Rochman echoed this, saying that she hopes to see progress made at the treaty negotiations regardless of U.S. involvement: “Maybe even if they’re going to sign a treaty and agree on anything in general, they probably should be open to the fact that the U.S. might not sign.”
The Geneva talks ended Aug. 14 without agreement on a treaty.
Beyond the treaty, Chen and others expressed confidence in the research currently being done in the Great Lakes region to inform that.
For example, Rochman co-chaired a joint commission workgroup on microplastics for the Great Lakes region of the International Joint Commission (IJC), a bi-national organization created by the governments of the U.S. and Canada that brings in experts who can advise governments on what to do about an issue.
While the IJC only makes policy recommendations, not decisions, Rochman, as co-chair, applied for microplastics to be listed as a chemical of mutual concern under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (GLWQA), which would require governments to quantify microplastics and use the framework every three years to measure the health of the Great Lakes. The workgroup released its final report in November 2024.
In addition to having microplastics be listed as a chemical of mutual concern, the group also recommended that they be listed as a toxic chemicals sub-indicator under the GLWQA. It also called for the implementation of a basin-wide monitoring program for microplastics to quantify sources and emissions and the establishment of measures to prevent the emissions of plastic pollution.
The next step would be to develop a workgroup of experts to determine the impact of microplastics on human health.
“It’s prime time for another work group to come in on human health and see if there’s now enough data to do a risk assessment,” Rochman said. She said the goal of her research is to “create the tools that we need to better monitor and quantify plastic pollution and risk to inform” frameworks that governments use to understand risk, urgency and action, as well as how microplastics “transform in the environment.”
One way microplastics transform is by breaking down into even smaller pieces, known as nanoplastics. According to Tasha Stoiber, a senior scientist at the Environmental Working Group (EWG), there is no standardized method to measure plastics below a specific size that often fall into the nanometer range. Having one would make it easier to inform policymaking decisions and to have certainty of where these plastics exist.
It would also make it easier to measure plastic in samples in laboratory settings.
“The much smaller particles might make up the bulk of the plastic that’s in your sample, so that has been the limiting factor,” Stoiber said. “What we’re going to need to move forward with this, to have that certainty, to pass policy, [is] reliable, reproducible methods to be able to look at plastics in that smaller range.”
On a policy level, even without a treaty, both Chen and Rochman are confident that state legislation can inspire action on a patchwork basis.
Specifically, Rochman cited California’s protocol for microplastics in drinking water. In 2018, the state passed a bill requiring the State Water Board to adopt a definition of microplastics in drinking water on or before July 1, 2020, and on or before July 1, 2021, to adopt a standard methodology to be used in the testing of drinking water for microplastics. In 2022, the water board approved the implementation of a four-year water testing plan.
And last year, Michigan lawmakers introduced legislation to create a statewide microplastics research and monitoring plan.
State legislation could involve, they said, methods like treating stormwater to prevent plastics from entering the environment, using trash traps and storm drains; or establishing total maximum daily loads for the amount of plastic that enters the Great Lakes.
“I think states can be leaders, and I think the way they should take leadership, especially in the Great Lakes region, is to start monitoring programs, to adopt the risk assessment framework,” Rochman said, “and you use that framework to inform policies that they can do so they can reduce their use of certain single use plastic items.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/lake-michigan2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-25 13:57:38.548722

Three East Tennessee companies devastated by Hurricane Helene in fall 2024 are set to receive an unprecedented million-dollar infusion each to help rehire workers and resume production.
Gov. Bill Lee and Economic and Community Development Commissioner Stuart McWhorter announced the Unicoi County factories will receive grants totaling more than $4 million to retain and retrain employees who lost jobs after the hurricane destroyed factories last September.
“Hurricane Helene was an unprecedented disaster for our state, and one year later, many Tennesseans remain forever changed by the loss of life and severe flood damage,” Lee said in a statement.
All three companies are located along the Nolichucky River in Erwin Riverview Industrial Park and are either in the preliminary stages of resuming work or preparing to restart, according to the state.
The grants mark the first time the Economic and Community Development Department has provided funds after a natural disaster for companies to keep employees and retrain them, according to McWhorter.
Companies receiving the grants are:

Foam Products, a fabricator and distributor of foam insulation and packaging products, which is investing $4.4 million and retaining 47 employees. The company estimates $20 million in damages if it were to rebuild the entire facility.
PlastiExports, a Mexico-based plastics company, which is investing $7.4 million and keeping 53 employees. It sustained more than $14 million in damages and loss.
PolyPipe, which manufactures polyethylene pipe to deliver natural gas, is investing $27.1 million and retaining 66 employees. The storm completely destroyed its building.

“The devastation from Hurricane Helene was unlike anything we’ve faced in our company’s history,” said PolyPipe CEO Mark Brenon. “This grant is not just funding – it’s a lifeline for our employees, our customers and our future here in Erwin.”

Congress, Trump debate agency’s fate",Jennifer Shutt | States Newsroom,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/25/fema-states-congress-bill/,"Members of both political parties have long criticized FEMA, but a bipartisan bill could lead to a big shift in emergency management.","WASHINGTON — The Federal Emergency Management Agency could look significantly different by next year’s hurricane season, with state and local governments shouldering more of the responsibility for natural disaster response and recovery.
Members of both political parties have long criticized FEMA, but a bipartisan bill moving along in Congress combined with President Donald Trump’s disdain for the agency may provide momentum for a big shift in emergency management.
Trump has said repeatedly he doesn’t support FEMA’s current structure and wants to see a special review council he put together propose a complete overhaul of the agency, possibly eliminating it entirely. That’s provoked deep concern among some local and state officials who don’t see how they would have the funding or background to handle a sudden natural disaster.
“We want to wean off of FEMA and we want to bring it down to the state level,” Trump said in June. “We’re moving it back to the states so the governors can handle it. That’s why they’re governors. Now, if they can’t handle it, they shouldn’t be governor.”
Trump’s FEMA Review Council, a 12-member board led by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, has until mid-November to write a report detailing its recommendations for the president.
But, as Noem has noted several times during the group’s two public meetings, Congress holds authority over FEMA and would need to sign off on any major changes.
[RELATED: Where have FEMA grant programs in CT been cancelled?]
Lawmakers, some of whom have spent years working on federal emergency management issues, aren’t waiting for the review council’s report to get started.
House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Sam Graves, R-Mo., ranking member Rick Larsen, D-Wash., Florida Republican Rep. Daniel Webster and Arizona Democratic Rep. Greg Stanton released their bill in late July, before the review council held its second meeting. It does not aim to eliminate FEMA.
“FEMA is in need of serious reform, and the goal of the FEMA Act of 2025 is to fix it,” Graves wrote in a statement. “This bill does more than any recent reforms to cut through the bureaucracy, streamline programs, provide flexibility, and return FEMA to its core purpose of empowering the states to lead and coordinating the federal response when it’s needed.”
Separately, a U.S. House spending committee is recommending a substantial boost in FEMA funding for the next fiscal year.
Make FEMA a Cabinet-level agency?
Stanton said during an interview with States Newsroom on Wednesday the Transportation Committee’s bill  “recognizes the challenges we have learned from past disasters; that sometimes the rules and regulations in place make it very difficult for victims of natural disasters to get the help that they need, whether it be housing or even financial assistance.”
The legislation, he said, focuses on four broad improvements:

Making FEMA a Cabinet-level agency instead of housing it within the Department of Homeland Security;
Emphasizing mitigation projects that lessen the impact of natural disasters;
Streamlining processes that have become too complex over the years; and
Adding flexibility so states can choose the type of housing or other support that best helps their residents following a natural disaster.

Stanton does not support Trump’s inclination to eliminate FEMA, arguing the federal government should help when local and state governments are overwhelmed by the scale of a natural disaster.
“That’s the whole point of it, that Americans help our fellow Americans at their point of greatest need,” he said.
But Stanton added he’s willing to read through the FEMA Review Council’s report once it’s released and work with its members to improve the agency.
“I’m open-minded,” Stanton said. “If they have good ideas that actually will strengthen FEMA, I’m all ears.”
The bill, while a sign of bipartisan progress in an increasingly polarized Congress, still has several steps to go before reaching Trump’s desk. To gain his signature, lawmakers may need to blend in some of the review council’s recommendations later this year.
A handful of outside groups, including the National Emergency Management Association, sent the committee a letter applauding the bipartisan group for its work so far but hinting they expect changes in the coming months.
“We recognize and appreciate that the legislation is part of an ongoing effort to modernize FEMA and ensure its programs reflect current and emerging challenges,” the four organizations wrote. “In that spirit, we also await the work of the FEMA Review Council and understand that its recommendations may inform refinements to the legislation.”
‘We’re going to have to turn to our own resources’
The review council’s two public meetings so far haven’t included much debate. The members have mostly shared general statements about grievances with FEMA and issued some warnings for state governments that rely heavily on the federal government.
Phil Bryant, former Republican governor of Mississippi, said that states should prepare to begin spending much more on natural disasters.
“We’re going to have to turn to our own resources,” Bryant said. “States are going to have to develop that emergency response fund, take some of their rainy day funds or funds that they may want to use for musical events and put it into disaster recovery.”
Larger states or those with strong economies may be able to absorb some of the cost that the federal government has carried for years, but other members of the council have cautioned their colleagues against going too far.
Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said the committee will need to clearly explain what costs state and local governments will be responsible for and which will be covered by the federal government.
He also highlighted the challenges of completely reshaping FEMA while it’s in the middle of responding to natural disasters ranging from hurricanes to wildfires to tornadoes.
“We’re going to be changing the tires on this car while this car is barreling 100 miles an hour,” Youngkin said.
Jane Castor, mayor of Tampa, Florida, signaled the panel’s recommendations should take into consideration that many small or rural areas won’t be able to raise the amount of funds they’ve received from FEMA.
“The locals should be prepared to respond to these incidents in the immediate aftermath,” Castor said. “But as was stated before, there are some — London, Kentucky, and Asheville, North Carolina — (where) this is probably the first time that they’ve probably experienced anything like this. And so we have to be there to help them through the worst of their time.”
Noem has been blunt in her assessment of FEMA, calling the agency “disastrous” and “incompetent.”
She’s also been clear that Trump doesn’t expect incremental changes but an entirely new approach to how the federal government responds to natural disasters.
“The president’s vision is that FEMA would not be in the long-term recovery model,” Noem said. “He wants the state and local governments and emergency management directors to lead response immediately when something happens in a state or jurisdiction and for us to be in a supporting role; a financial role that would be there much in a state block grant model.”
A wary eye on Trump panel
Local and state officials throughout the country are keeping a close eye on the Trump administration’s review council, wary of the implications a loss in federal disaster response would have on local and state governments.
Houston, Texas, Controller Chris Hollins said on a call with reporters in August the city has typically put away between $25 million and $30 million for natural disasters with the expectation that FEMA would help with additional costs.
After Trump proposed eliminating FEMA, Hollins began encouraging city leaders “to take a broader look at what’s going to be necessary to be self-reliant. But that’s an incredibly tall task.”
“If we’re all on our own, it’s going to put our individual finances in an extreme state of turmoil, because we’re either going to have to tax our citizens and our residents at extremely high rates to have enough money to be prepared, or we’re going to intentionally roll the dice and run the risk of being unprepared when these moments come,” Hollins said. “And you know, both of those are unacceptable predicaments.”
Minnesota Auditor Julie Blaha said on the same call that some communities will need years or even decades to build up the type of reserve needed to cover just one major natural disaster.
“In a small town it’s going to be pretty hard to put away millions of dollars, and by the time you can get a reserve of millions of dollars, you are likely to have another disaster,” Blaha said. “The only way to respond to that, you have to go into debt, and you have again increased costs.”
Two committees and a funding boost
Congress has a two-track system for determining the size and scope of federal departments like FEMA — authorizing committees, which set policy and generally determine each agency’s mission, and the appropriations committees that provide funding through annual bills.
The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee’s bipartisan bill represents a significant step on the authorizing side. But the legislation still has to make it through committee debate, the House floor and the Senate before it could reach Trump’s desk.
Separately, the House Appropriations Committee released a partisan bill earlier this summer that would provide a robust $31.8 billion for FEMA during the next fiscal year, $4.5 billion higher than the agency’s current spending level.
During debate on the legislation, Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz proposed an amendment that would have blocked any federal funding from being used to eliminate FEMA.
“Yes, FEMA needs fixes but FEMA helps all of our communities and we can make it better and should be making it better without killing it,” Wasserman Schultz said. “The states cannot handle the responsibilities of FEMA in the aftermath of a storm on their own. That is simply not possible.”
Republicans opposed the amendment, arguing the spending panel shouldn’t do anything that would tie the hands of the review council, the authorizing committees, or Trump.
Oklahoma Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice sharply criticized FEMA during debate, saying the agency “isn’t working anymore” and has “become bloated.”
But Bice also made the point that federal funding is necessary, saying she was trying to address issues within her district “where FEMA hasn’t paid for disaster debris removal for two years.”
“These communities cannot afford the huge costs of debris removal for two years or more when FEMA doesn’t pay them, reimburse them for the services that they have provided,” Bice said. “This can’t continue.”
Dems say Congress in charge
Democrats on the committee, including Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer, urged their GOP colleagues to support the amendment, pressing for any changes to FEMA to be made solely by Congress.
“If FEMA needs reforming, and I may certainly agree with that, we are the reformers,” Hoyer said.
North Carolina Republican Rep. Chuck Edwards, who represents western sections of the state devastated by Hurricane Helene, said he opposed the amendment because he wanted to see a complete overhaul of FEMA — though he appeared to back the idea that lawmakers should decide what changes and when.
“There are few people in this room that have more up close and personal interaction with FEMA over the last eight months than I,” Edwards said. “Up until Sept. 27, FEMA was nothing more than a line item on a budget for me. Since Sept. 27, I’ve very much been getting an education.
“I can tell you that FEMA needs major reform and Congress is best suited to do that.”

Bluesky said on Friday that it made the decision after the U.S. Supreme Court declined for now to block a Mississippi state law that the platform said limits free expression, invades people’s privacy and unfairly targets smaller social media companies. The state law, passed in 2024, requires users of websites and other digital services to verify their age.
“The Supreme Court’s recent decision leaves us facing a hard reality: comply with Mississippi’s age assurance law—and make every Mississippi Bluesky user hand over sensitive personal information and undergo age checks to access the site—or risk massive fines,” the company wrote in a statement. “The law would also require us to identify and track which users are children, unlike our approach in other regions. We think this law creates challenges that go beyond its child safety goals, and creates significant barriers that limit free speech and disproportionately harm smaller platforms and emerging technologies.”
Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, whose office defended the law, told the justices that age verification could help protect young people from “sexual abuse, trafficking, physical violence, sextortion and more,” activities that the First Amendment does not protect.
The age verification law added Mississippi to a list of Republican-led states where similar legal challenges are playing out. 
NetChoice is challenging laws passed in Mississippi and other states that require social media users to verify their ages, and asked the Supreme Court to keep the measure on hold while a lawsuit plays out.
That came after a federal judge prevented the 2024 law from taking effect. But a three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in July that the law could be enforced while the lawsuit proceeds.
On Aug. 14, the Supreme Court rejected an emergency appeal from a tech industry group representing major platforms such as Facebook, X and YouTube.
There were no noted dissents from the brief, unsigned order. Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that there’s a good chance NetChoice will eventually succeed in showing that the law is unconstitutional, but hadn’t shown it must be blocked while the lawsuit unfolds.
Bluesky grew after the 2024 presidential election. Many users of X, which is owned by Elon Musk, retreated from the platform in response to the billionaire’s strong support of Donald Trump. 
In Bluesky’s statement explaining its decision to block access in Mississippi, the company said age verification systems “require substantial infrastructure and developer time investments, complex privacy protections, and ongoing compliance monitoring — costs that can easily overwhelm smaller providers.”
“This dynamic entrenches existing big tech platforms while stifling the innovation and competition that benefits users,” the company added. 
Bluesky said it did follow other digital safety regulations, such as the United Kingdom’s Online Safety Act. Under that statute, age checks are required only for accessing certain content and features, and Bluesky does not track which users are under 18, the platform said:
“Mississippi’s law, by contrast, would block everyone from accessing the site—teens and adults—unless they hand over sensitive information, and once they do, the law in Mississippi requires Bluesky to keep track of which users are children.”
The Mississippi law, authored by Rep. Jill Ford, a Republican from Madison, is called the “Walker Montgomery Protecting Children Online Act,” named after a Mississippi teen who reportedly committed suicide after an overseas online predator threatened to blackmail him.

(Courtesy photo)ReCenter Indiana Inc. is expanding its leadership team as it harnesses a grant to take aim at the state’s notoriously poor voter turnout and shifts its mission.
The group will no longer endorse or support centrist candidates, as it did through a political action committee in 2023 and 2024.
Jocelyn Vare has been named ReCenter’s first executive director.
“Our new mission as a nonpartisan 501c3 is to remind elected officials to prioritize Hoosiers’ needs,” Vare said. “Our efforts will now focus on collecting non-partisan data, such as the young adult non-voter survey planned for this fall, developing civic health programs, and fostering connections and partnerships with like-minded organizations.”
A news release called Vare a strong supporter of balanced government and citizen engagement. Vare made history in 2019 when her election as an at-large city council member made the Fishers City Council bipartisan for the first time. She also ran for the Indiana Senate and served as the Democratic Party chair for Hamilton County, the state’s most politically competitive county.
“Jocelyn has an impressive track record of working across the aisle for the public good. And she brings a depth of experience that is typically found only among those who have rolled up their sleeves in party politics,” said the founder of ReCenter Indiana Inc., Don Knebel. He is president of its board of directors, which consists of Republicans, Democrats and independents.
Vare encouraged Hoosiers to help drive the state’s future: “When we vote, we remind elected officials to work together and recenter on the priorities of the people.”
ReCenter Indiana is preparing a survey to be conducted this fall. Unlike most election research, which samples voters and likely voters, this survey is focused on the 18-34 age bracket of central Indiana residents who were registered but did not vote in the 2024 general election.
“The future of our state and our republic depends on civic participation by generation after generation,” Vare explained.
The polling will be done by two national research firms, one Democratic and the other Republican. Results will help shape strategies to boost voter turnout for the 2026 elections and beyond.
Supporting that research is a $50,000 grant award from the Nicholas H. Noyes Jr. Memorial Foundation.
When ReCenter Indiana was founded in 2022, its core mission was to reclaim the political center by supporting centrist candidates through a political action committee. Those efforts included a statewide billboard campaign that encouraged Democrats to vote in the 2024 Republican primary.
But as political polarization intensifies, ReCenter Indiana is refining its mission of reminding public officials to listen to “the people, not just the most extreme partisans,” according to the news release.
“The chasm between our elected officials and the people keeps widening,” Knebel said. “We can help close that gap by encouraging everyday Hoosiers to use their power, and by reminding our elected servants that the best interests of the people should always be front and center.”",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/JocelynVare_ReCenter_headshot.jpg,,,2025-08-25 13:57:38.548722

Erin Campbell has begun working as the Alaska state geologist and director of the Division of Geological and Geophysical Survey, the Department of Natural Resources announced on Aug. 19.
Campbell, who has a background in petroleum studies and structural geology, served as Wyoming’s state geologist from 2017 to this year.
Prior to that, she managed the energy and mineral resources division of the Wyoming State Geological Survey.
Before working for the state, Campbell taught undergraduate and graduate courses for several years at the University of Wyoming, where she received her doctoral degree and directed that university’s Geology Field Camp. Earlier in her career, she spent four years working as a geologist for Chevron in Louisiana and California.
The Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys has 70 employees who study and map geologic resources, manage hydrology and natural hazards programs and perform other functions. The division operates the Geological Materials Center in Anchorage, the state’s largest archive of geological samples.
“Dr. Campbell is superbly qualified for this technical role and brings an established record of state-level leadership,” DNR Commissioner John Boyle said in a statement. “I’m delighted to have such an impressive scientist serving as State Geologist, leading the division and guiding natural resource policy in Alaska.”
Melanie Werdon, who previously led the division, retired this year, DNR’s statement said.

The sale is also expected to give the One Health Innovation District a boost.,"A rendering of Elanco Animal Health's new global headquarters in Indianapolis. (Courtesy Indiana Economic Development Corp.)The state of Indiana sold a chunk of a massive, long-vacant Indianapolis industrial site to Elanco Animal Health for $27 million, Gov. Mike Braun announced Monday.
“This agreement is a responsible step forward. It places this property in the hands of a company with a clear vision of a world-class innovation district, while ensuring the State of Indiana remains a full partner in what comes next,” Braun said. “This is about more than redeveloping land; it’s about creating jobs, attracting talent, and driving long-term growth for Indiana.”
Greenfield-based Elanco is building its new global headquarters on part of the former General Motors stamping plant site on the White River’s west bank, near downtown.
“This is about partnership and progress. The State’s willingness to work with us — not as a landowner but as a partner — makes this possible,” Elanco CEO Jeff Simmons said. “Securing this property now gives us the certainty we need to integrate it into our headquarters campus and move forward with speed.”
The company broke ground three years ago and plans to move into its new digs in early October, per Simmons.
The sale will also “accelerate the creation of” a larger One Health Innovation District anchored by the headquarters, according to the news release.
The district will “intentionally connect” research institutes, pilot-scale facilities, diagnostic labs, and animal clinical care with a vibrant community of offices, housing, retail and green space.  
“That means jobs, investment, and an accelerated path to creating an innovation district dedicated (to) One Health,” Simmons said. “… Together with Purdue (University) and the State of Indiana, we’re building something that will drive innovation and improve lives for decades to come.” 
Purdue President Mung Chiang said the university was “excited” to bring its expertise in animal, plant and human health to the project, and committed to “help(ing) create One Health jobs and workforce.”
“This strategic step will also further accelerate Purdue’s growth in the state’s capital city as part of our main campus across the Hard Tech Corridor between West Lafayette and Indianapolis,” he added.
General Motors closed its stamping plant in 2011. After demolition, the 100-acre site — which required environmental remediation — lay vacant for years.

Tanya Miller announces her candidacy for Georgia attorney general Aug. 25, 2025, outside the state Capitol. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder.The contest to be Georgia’s next attorney general is now a four-way race after attorney and Atlanta state Rep. Tanya Miller announced her candidacy outside the state Capitol Monday.
Miller, who serves as chair of the House Democratic Caucus, touted her background as a prosecutor and civil rights attorney with more than 20 years of experience. She pledged to prioritize pursuing sex traffickers, child predators, scammers, slumlords and other criminals.
She also leveled  criticism at Republican Attorney General Chris Carr, who is stepping down to run for governor next year, characterizing him as overprioritizing politics.
“The attorney general is the people’s lawyer,” she said. “And that’s why I’m running, because the people of Georgia need an attorney general who will stand up and fight for them, no matter what, no matter what part of this great state they call home, no matter their politics, no matter their personal beliefs, no matter what. Let’s face it, many Georgians don’t even know what the Attorney General does, because the office has done so little for them, for you, for your family, for your community.”
While President Joe Biden was in office, Carr regularly led or participated in lawsuits challenging that administration’s policies. Democratic attorneys general nationwide are involved in numerous lawsuits against the Trump administration’s actions.
Miller said she will not play politics if elected.
“The attorney general’s job is to be Georgia’s lawyer,” she said. “So whether that means standing against a Washington, D.C., policy or supporting a Washington, D.C., policy, if it helps the people of Georgia, I’m with it. If it hurts the people of Georgia, I’m against it.”
State law requires candidates for attorney general to be members of the state bar for at least seven years, which limits the pool of candidates compared with other statewide offices.
Miller will be up against former House Minority Leader Bob Trammell, an attorney from Luthersville, in the May Democratic primary.
In a text message, Trammell indicated he welcomes the competition.
“That’s the Democratic process and a sign of a vibrant party ––  and people wanting fundamental change,” he said. “As I talk to Georgians all over the state, folks are fed up with politicians looking out for big corporations and billionaires, while we pay the price. I’ve spent my life fighting for Georgians because everyone deserves a fair shot to get ahead.”
The winner of that contest will go on to face the GOP’s nominee in November. So far, two Republican state senators have announced their candidacies: Sen. Bill Cowsert of Athens and Sen. Brian Strickland of McDonough.
In a statement, Strickland said a competitive Democratic primary will only serve to swing voters to the Republican side.
“The Democratic primary for attorney general will turn into a squabble over who will most obstruct President Trump’s conservative agenda that Georgians voted for,” he said. “I welcome a competitive primary because it will highlight for voters the importance of keeping the Georgia attorney general’s office in the hands of a law and order Republican.”

(Photo provided by DHMC)Dr. Joanne Conroy, president and CEO of Dartmouth Health, wrote in a report released Friday that a recent meeting of rural health leaders in Hanover “offered a clear and urgent mandate: advancing rural health is not optional.”
In the U.S., 20% of Americans live in rural areas, yet only 9% of physicians serve rural areas. In May, the Rural Health Symposium, hosted by Dartmouth Health and the Giesel School of Medicine, brought 271 people from the rural health field to Hanover to address the repercussions of that.
Panelists at the symposium discussed the factors within rural areas driving disparities and deficits in health care. Some of the factors identified include transportation issues, rural hospital closures and provider shortages, threatened cuts to Medicaid and Medicare, (which since the symposium have become imminent) lack of affordable housing, and poverty. They also discussed underinvestment in public infrastructure, mistrust in health care institutions, and how poor social networks — particularly for LGBTQ patients and patients of color — impact health outcomes.
In addition to poor health outcomes, panelists argued these factors are resulting in higher hospital readmissions, patients receiving less preventative care, and more people using informal sources for medical advice. Panelists also floated potential solutions: creating a new designation for rural emergency hospitals, expanding telehealth, and partnerships with community health workers, housing trusts, and nongovernmental organizations.
There was also a panel focused on how preventable causes of early death like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer are significantly higher in rural areas. They argued this was the result of policies designed for urban areas without regard for the different circumstances of rural areas, that generational poverty in rural areas plays a role, and that each rural area is unique, requiring different approaches.

(Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — The ethanol industry won’t tell you to fill your vehicle with illegal fuel, but thanks to a long-term study of fleet vehicles in Nebraska, it now says your vehicle would be fine if you did.
Most of the ethanol-blended gasoline sold in the U.S. is 90% petroleum and 10% ethanol. The Trump administration issued an executive order in April allowing nationwide, year-round sales of E15, despite concerns that it worsens air pollution in some areas during the summer. The next administration could rescind it, so some farm-state lawmakers are pushing to codify E15 availability.
The leader of the Nebraska Ethanol Board said Friday that a 30% ethanol blend — approved by the EPA for use in flex-fuel vehicles, but not in others — is “the fuel of the future.” Flex-fuel vehicles can run on gas, ethanol, or any blend of the two.
A representative for South Dakota Corn, meanwhile, said a marketing partnership with KwikStar shows that teens are more likely to start their driving careers buying E15 if they see it as a way to save money for snacks. Typically, the more ethanol a fuel has, the cheaper it is.
Both speakers at the the American Coalition for Ethanol’s annual conference in downtown Sioux Falls pressed the idea that ethanol — and the corn markets that rely on it — can overcome consumer skittishness with the right message.
 Nebraska study: Most cars do well with E30

Ben Rhodes, executive director of the Nebraska Ethanol Board, backed his claims on 30% ethanol’s fuel efficiency with a presentation about a long-term study of its use in Nebraska state government fleet vehicles.
The first phase came in 2019, when 50 non-flex-fuel vehicles of various model years, all located in Lincoln or Omaha, filled up with either E30 or E15 for a year. The study required a waiver from the EPA, he said.
The results of the study’s first phase were published in a peer-reviewed paper in 2021, and showed that the vehicles using E30 got similar gas mileage, suffered no engine damage and produced fewer carbon dioxide emissions.
Rhodes said the second phase of the study offers stronger proof still. Since 2023, 100 state fleet vehicles have used either E30 or E10 and the results have been similar. That phase used E10 because the fleet vehicles were used across the entire state, and E15 isn’t available everywhere.
Newer vehicles lost about one mile per gallon with E30, Rhodes said.
“For the older vehicles, 2003 to 2013, E30 had a better fuel economy,” Rhodes said.
After the presentation, Rhodes told Searchlight that “we shouldn’t take our eyes off the prize” of E15 to start pushing for the adoption of E30. Even so, he said, the fleet study shows that there’s a future for higher blends.
“This is a long term, forward thinking project, because we know that the data will have to lead,” Rhodes said. “The horse has to pull the cart.”
Ron Lamberty, the ethanol coalition’s chief marketing officer, said the Nebraska results are “the best study we’ve seen” to confirm a claim he’s heard for years from farmers: That they don’t lose mileage with E30.
“Even then, I was skeptical,” Lamberty said. “Are they saying that because they love ethanol, or is it true? Now we’ve shown it to be true.”
Lamberty stressed that he can’t recommend people use E30 in a non-flex-fuel vehicle, given its legal status. But he also said he’d be happy to see the EPA issue a fine to a driver for ignoring that advice, and for that driver to challenge the EPA, “because they would lose the case.”
“Then we’d have a legal judgment,” Lamberty said, to show that the fuel is safe to use.
 Kwik Star partnership: Selling ethanol to young people

Ethanol’s cultural stock as an antidote to climate change and reducer of carbon emissions has fallen since its mainstream adoption decades ago.
Some studies performed by researchers outside the industry have suggested that the carbon intensity and water demands of corn cultivation cancel out the environmental benefits of ethanol. It’s been more than a decade since the Environmental Working Group lambasted the industry with a report called “Ethanol’s Broken Promise,” which accused it of causing the conversion of grassland to crops. Greenpeace opposes the U.S. biofuels mandate, which incentivizes the use of ethanol, citing similar reasoning.
Ethanol backers have pushed back on such assertions.

Amanda Bechen, director of marketing and communications for South Dakota Corn, said last year’s marketing partnership with the convenience store chain Kwik Stop was part of a strategy to target the youngest generation of drivers, ideally before they develop opinions on ethanol.
“Fourteen-year-olds can drive,” Bechen said. “We want to make sure that they see this message and before they develop the behavior of not using ethanol, so we get them to understand that this is a fuel that they can use for the rest of their life.”
The “Fuel Up South Dakota” marketing campaign, which ran from last July through the end of June 2025, used splashy signs with taglines like “it’s okay to go low” at the pump to push lower-priced E15. Video ads encouraging young people to save their money for snacks were aired across social media, as well as during televised Summit League collegiate basketball games and on streaming video platforms.
Bechen visits high schools as part of her regular duties, and said teens tend to know little about the kinds of fuel they’ve often just recently begun to put in their cars. Gas is labeled by octane, but she said kids don’t usually know what the numbers mean. The number “87” corresponds to E10, “88” to E15. An “89” on the pump handle would signal a mid-grade fuel without ethanol.
Bechen told South Dakota Searchlight she’s heard teens say they pick “87” because it’s Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce’s jersey number, or “89” because it corresponds to the album “1989” from Kelce’s girlfriend Taylor Swift.
The Kwik Star promotion’s biggest day came on March 29. On that day, the campaign ran a promotion offering 88-octane E15 fuel for $1.88 a gallon, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Bechen said it was “a landmark event, the largest single day of sales for unleaded 88 in South Dakota” for Kwik Star.

Chuck Grassley are sparring on social media over whether the Judiciary Committee chairman should abandon a century-old tradition that allows senators to block the advancement of judicial nominees who would serve in the senators’ home states.The practice, referred to as “blue slips,” has irked Trump, who has had some of his picks for the federal bench opposed by Democratic senators. Trump posted on social media over the weekend that he wanted GOP Senate leaders to move his judicial nominees through, regardless of the level of opposition from Democrats, and said Monday he would sue over the practice, which he called “unconstitutional.” “We're also going to be filing a lawsuit on blue slipping,” he said in the Oval Office Monday morning. “You know, blue slips make it impossible for me as president to appoint a judge or a U.S. attorney, because they have a gentleman's agreement — nothing memorialized.”The White House comments came after Trump slammed the practice on social media over the weekend and told Grassley how to proceed.“I have a Constitutional Right to appoint Judges and U.S. Attorneys, but that RIGHT has been completely taken away from me in States that have just one Democrat United States Senator,” Trump posted on social media. “This is because of an old and outdated’“custom’ known as a BLUE SLIP, that Senator Chuck Grassley, of the Great State of Iowa, refuses to overturn, even though the Democrats, including Crooked Joe Biden (Twice!), have done so on numerous occasions,” he added. “Therefore, the only candidates that I can get confirmed for these most important positions are, believe it or not, Democrats! Chuck Grassley should allow strong Republican candidates to ascend to these very vital and powerful roles, and tell the Democrats, as they often tell us, to go to HELL!”Grassley won’t end blue slipsGrassley responded on Monday morning that he wouldn’t be ending the blue slip tradition. “A U.S. Atty/district judge nominee without a blue slip does not hv the votes to get confirmed on the Senate floor & they don’t hv the votes to get out of cmte As chairman I set Pres Trump noms up for SUCCESS NOT FAILURE,” Grassley wrote. He wrote in a separate post that Alina “Habba was withdrawn as the President's nominee for New Jersey U.S. Atty on July 24 &the Judic cmte never received any of the paperwork needed for the Senate to vet her nomination.” A federal judge on Thursday said Habba has no lawful authority to be New Jersey’s acting U.S. attorney.Grassley was reelected in November 2022, for a six-year term that will end in January 2029. Tradition since 1917The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service writes in a report on the process that since “at least 1917, the committee’s use of the blue slip has been a feature of its consideration of such nominations.”“After a President selects a nominee for a U.S. circuit or district court judgeship, the chairman sends a blue-colored form to the two Senators representing the home state of the nominee,” the report explains. “The form seeks the home state Senators’ assessment of the nominee. If a home state Senator has no objection to a nominee, the blue slip is returned to the chairman with a positive response. If, however, a home state Senator objects to a nominee, the blue slip is either withheld or returned with a negative response. For the purposes of this report, any instance of a blue slip being withheld is treated the same as if a blue slip were returned with a negative response—that is, both instances indicate a nominee lacked the support of at least one home state Senator.”Jacob Fischler contributed to this report.",,,,2025-08-25 12:58:04.088203

(Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) HARWOOD, N.D. – Residents from in and around Harwood lined up Monday to ask questions about a $3 billion data center planned for the town. 
There were questions about noise, water use, jobs and utility bills for officials from data center company Applied Digital and Cass County Electric Co-op. But another theme was how the data center might change Harwood, a town of about 900 people on Interstate 29 north of Fargo. 
It was the first meeting on what the company calls an artificial intelligence factory since the project was made public Aug. 18. 
“We don’t want Harwood to turn into another Horace,” said Mark Kerkvliet, a 38-year resident of Harwood, referring to the community south of West Fargo that has experienced rapid growth.

After Applied Digital Vice President Nick Phillips answered questions for 90 minutes, some audience members in the Harwood Community Center shouted “when’s the vote?” 
Harwood Mayor Blake Hankey, who had been standing at the back of the room, then took several angry questions and comments from audience members, some yelling that the city “sold out” to Applied Digital. 
“I think it’s a good idea,” Hankey said. 
Hankey noted that there is a zoning vote change vote scheduled for Sept. 2 and a vote of the Harwood City Council at its September meeting.

Those approvals would be needed for Applied Digital’s preferred site southeast of Harwood. Phillips said Applied Digital did have a secondary site identified west of Harwood, but would not offer specifics, which frustrated some people. 
Phillips said one reason the company preferred the site southeast of Harwood is that it would be protected from flooding by the Red River Diversion project. The site to the west would be outside the diversion where flooding could still be an issue. 
The diversion came up in other comments. 
James Haag, who lives about three miles from Harwood, said new neighbors have built houses since work started on the flood protection project and he expects more to come with or without Applied Digital. 
He said people should give the company a chance. “We’re all going to get new neighbors,” he said. “These folks are asking to be a part of the community, to pay taxes. I don’t think that’s bad.” 
Phillips often referred to the company’s data center campus in Ellendale, a town he said had been shrinking. While there was some resistance, especially early on, he said city leaders saw it as a way to reverse population. 
Applied Digital has partnered on a housing project for its employees there. 
Company announces plan for $3 billion data center north of Fargo

Phillips addressed some of the common questions:
Noise: He said within a half mile of the facility the noise level should be about 45 decibels. 
Water: Each of the two planned facilities at Harwood would use about two-thirds of the water an average home would use. The water in the closed-loop system used to cool the computers at the data center would not come from Cass County Rural Water, the source for the rest of the facility. Instead, the system would use a water-glycol mix formulated just for the cooling system. 
Jobs: The data center would have about 200 to 250 jobs, primarily people in electrical and mechanical trades to keep computers and cooling systems running. 
Utility bills: Cass County Electric Co-op said a recent off-peak rate increase was not related to the data center and that no power generation is planned for the data center. Phillips said Applied Digital would be responsible for transmission and substation upgrades it might need. 
Shane Husar of Harwood echoed some concerns about the data center being too close to the elementary school in Harwood, but also noted that the school is right next to the railroad tracks, which is another source of noise. 
He also asked why Applied Digital had secured 900 acres of land, three times the size of the Ellendale site, to house a building half the size of what is planned for Ellendale. 
Phillips said the company wanted to provide plenty of buffer space as it honed in on an exact building site within those 900 acres. 
Husar expressed some resignation that Harwood may lose its small-town feel. 
“Urban sprawl is coming our way whether we like it or not,” he said.

The outbreak soon became the worst the United States has endured in over three decades.
In the month after Donald Trump took office, his administration interfered with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention communications, stalled the agency’s reports, censored its data, and abruptly laid off staff. In the chaos, CDC experts felt restrained from talking openly with local public health workers, according to interviews with seven CDC officials with direct knowledge of events, as well as local health department emails obtained by KFF Health News through public records requests.
“CDC hasn’t reached out to us locally,” Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, Texas, wrote in a Feb. 5 email exchange with a colleague two weeks after children with measles were hospitalized in Lubbock. “My staff feels like we are out here all alone,” she added.
A child would die before CDC scientists contacted Wells.

“All of us at CDC train for this moment, a massive outbreak,” one CDC researcher told KFF Health News, which agreed not to name CDC officials who fear retaliation for speaking with the press. “All this training and then we weren’t allowed to do anything.”
Delays have catastrophic consequences when measles spreads in undervaccinated communities, like many in West Texas. If a person with measles is in the same room with 10 unvaccinated people, nine will be infected, researchers estimate. If those nine go about their lives in public spaces, numbers multiply exponentially.
The outbreak that unfolded in West Texas illustrates the danger the country faces under the Trump administration as vaccination rates drop, misinformation flourishes, public health budgets are cut, and science agencies are subject to political manipulation.
While the Trump administration stifled CDC communications, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fueled doubt in vaccines and exaggerated the ability of vitamins to ward off disease. Suffering followed: The Texas outbreak spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, and Mexico’s Chihuahua state — at minimum. Together these linked outbreaks have sickened more than 4,500 people, killed at least 16, and levied exorbitant costs on hospitals, health departments, and those paying medical bills.
“This is absolutely outrageous,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. “When you’re battling contagious diseases, time is everything.”
‘The CDC Is “Stressed” Currently’
Wells was anxious the moment she learned that two unvaccinated children hospitalized in late January had the measles. Hospitals are legally required to report measles cases to health departments and the CDC, but Wells worried many children weren’t getting tested.
“I think this may be very large,” she wrote in a Feb. 3 email to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Wells relayed in another email what she’d learned from conversations around town: “According to one of the women I spoke with 55 children were absent from one school on 1/24. The women reported that there were sick children with measles symptoms as early as November.”
In that email and others, Wells asked state health officials to put her in touch with CDC experts who could answer complicated questions on testing, how to care for infants exposed to measles, and more. What transpired was a plodding game of telephone.
One email asked whether clinics could decontaminate rooms where people with measles had just been if the clinics were too small to follow the CDC’s recommendation to keep those rooms empty for two hours.
“Would it be possible to arrange a consultation with the CDC?” Wells wrote on Feb. 5.
“It never hurts to ask the CDC,” said Scott Milton, a medical officer at the Texas health department. About 25 minutes later, he told Wells that an information specialist at the CDC had echoed the guidelines advising two hours.
“I asked him to escalate this question to someone more qualified,” Milton wrote. “Of course, we know the CDC is ‘stressed’ currently.”

Local officials resorted to advice from doctors and researchers outside the government, including those at the Immunization Partnership, a Texas nonprofit.
“The CDC had gone dark,” said Terri Burke, executive director of the partnership. “We had anticipated a measles outbreak, but we didn’t expect the federal government to be in collapse when it hit.”
Technically, the Trump administration’s freeze on federal communications had ended Feb. 1. However, CDC scientists told KFF Health News that they could not speak freely for weeks after.
“There was a lot of confusion and nonanswers over what communications were allowed,” one CDC scientist said.
Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said the situation was not unique to measles. “Like most public health organizations, we weren’t able to get ahold of our program people in February,” he said. Information trickled out through the CDC’s communications office, but CDC scientists gave no press briefings and went dark on their closest partners across the country. “The CDC was gagged,” he said.
Through private conversations, Benjamin learned that CDC experts were being diverted to remove information from websites to comply with executive orders. And they were afraid to resume communication without a green light from their directors or the Department of Health and Human Services as they watched the Trump administration lay off CDC staffers in droves.
“It’s not that the CDC was delinquent,” Benjamin said. “It’s that they had their hands tied behind their backs.”
To work on the ground, the CDC needs an invitation from the state. But Anne Schuchat, a former CDC deputy director, said that during her 33 years with the agency, federal health officials didn’t need special permission to talk freely with local health departments during outbreaks. “We would always offer a conversation and ask if there’s anything we could do,” she said.
Lara Anton, a press officer at the Texas health department, said the state never prevented the CDC from calling county officials. To learn more about the state’s correspondences with the CDC, KFF Health News filed a public records request to the Texas health department. The department refused to release the records. Anton called the records “confidential under the Texas Health and Safety Code.”
Anton said the state sent vaccines, testing supplies, and staff to assist West Texas in the early weeks of February. That’s corroborated in emails from the South Plains Public Health District, which oversees Gaines County, the area hit hardest by measles.
“Texas will try to handle what it needs to before it goes to the CDC,” Zach Holbrooks, the health district’s executive director, told KFF Health News.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Responding to an outbreak in an undervaccinated community, however, requires enormous effort. To keep numbers from exploding, public health workers ideally would notify all people exposed to an infected person and ask them to get vaccinated immediately if they weren’t already. If they declined, officials would try to persuade them to avoid public spaces for three weeks so that they wouldn’t spread measles to others.
Holbrooks said this was nearly impossible. Cases were concentrated in close-knit Mennonite communities where people relied on home remedies before seeking medical care. He said many people didn’t want to be tested, didn’t want to name their contacts, and didn’t want to talk with the health department. “It doesn’t matter what resources I have if people won’t avail themselves of it,” Holbrooks said.
Historically, Mennonites faced persecution in other countries, making them leery of interacting with authorities, Holbrooks said. A backlash against covid restrictions deepened that mistrust.
Another reason Mennonites may seek to avoid authorities is that some live in the U.S. illegally, having immigrated to Texas from Canada, Mexico, and Bolivia in waves over the past 50 years. Locals guess the population of Seminole, the main city in Gaines County, is far larger than the U.S. Census count.
“I have no idea how many cases we might have missed, since I don’t know how many people are in the community,” Holbrooks said. “There’s a lot of people in the shadows out here.”
Public health experts say the situation in Gaines sounds tough but familiar. Measles tends to take hold in undervaccinated communities, and therefore public health workers must overcome mistrust, misinformation, language barriers, and more.

About 450 people — including local health officials, CDC scientists, nurses, and volunteers — helped control a measles outbreak sparked in an Eastern European immigrant community in Clark County, Washington, in 2018.
Alan Melnick, Clark County’s public health director, said his team spoke with hundreds of unvaccinated people who were exposed. “We were calling them basically every day to see how they were doing and ask them not to go out in public,” he said.
Melnick spoke with CDC scientists from the start, and the intensity of the response was buoyed by emergency declarations by the county and the state. Within a couple of months, the outbreak was largely contained. No one died, and only two people were hospitalized.
In New York, hundreds of people in the city’s health department responded to a larger measles outbreak in 2018 and 2019 concentrated among Orthodox Jewish communities. The work included meeting with dozens of rabbis and distributing booklets to nearly 30,000 households to combat vaccine misinformation.
The effort cost more than $7 million, but Jane Zucker, New York City’s assistant health commissioner at the time, said it yielded immense savings. The average medical bill for measles hospitalizations is roughly $18,500, according to data from prior outbreaks. Then there’s the cost of diverting hospital resources, of children missing school, of parents staying home from work to care for sick kids, and the lasting toll of some measles infections, including deafness or worse.
“I don’t think there’s a price tag to put on a child’s death that would otherwise be prevented,” Zucker said.
Local health departments in West Texas were understaffed from the start. About 18 people work at the South Plains health department, which oversees four vast rural counties. About 50 staff the department in Lubbock, where patients were hospitalized and health workers struggled to figure out who was exposed. In mid-February, Wells emailed a colleague: “I’m so overwhelmed.”
A death ignites a response
On Feb. 26, Texas announced that a 6-year-old child had died of measles. Wells heard from CDC scientists for the first time the following day. Also that day, the CDC issued a brief notice on the outbreak. The notice recommended vaccines, but it worried public health specialists because it also promoted vitamin A as a treatment under medical supervision.
In emails, Texas health officials privately discussed how the CDC’s notice might exacerbate a problem: Doctors were treating children with measles for toxic levels of vitamin A, suggesting that parents were delaying medical care and administering the supplements at home. A local Lubbock news outlet reported on a large drugstore where vitamin A supplements and cod liver oil, which contains high levels of vitamin A, were “flying off the shelf.”
Too much vitamin A can cause liver damage, blindness, and dire abnormalities during fetal development.

Milton worried that parents were listening to misinformation from anti-vaccine groups — including one founded by Kennedy — that diminished the need for vaccination by inaccurately claiming that vitamin A staved off the disease’s worst outcomes.
“How many people will choose Vitamin A and not a vaccine because it appears to them there are two options?” Milton asked in an email.
Scientists at the CDC privately fretted, too. “HHS pressed us to insert vitamin A into all of our communications with clinicians and health officials,” one CDC scientist told KFF Health News, referring to the agency’s notices and alerts. “If pregnant women took too much vitamin A during the outbreak, their babies could be profoundly disabled. We haven’t seen those babies born yet.”
Another CDC official said they’ve had to “walk a fine line” between protecting the public based on scientific evidence and aligning with HHS.
While CDC scientists held their tongues, Kennedy exaggerated the power of nutrition and vitamin A while furthering mistrust in vaccines. “We’re providing vitamin A,” Kennedy said in an interview on Fox News. “There are many studies, some showing 87% effectiveness,” he claimed, “against serious disease and death.”
The studies Kennedy referenced were conducted in low-income countries where children are malnourished. Evidence suggests that vitamin A supplementation is seldom useful against measles in the United States, because deficiency is exceedingly rare.
Kennedy deflected criticism from those who call him anti-vaccine, saying that any parent in Texas who wants a measles vaccine can get one. He followed this with dangerously inaccurate statements. “There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year,” he said. “It causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes, encephalitis and blindness, et cetera.” There is no evidence that measles vaccines “cause deaths every year.” Scores of studies show that the vaccine doesn’t cause encephalitis, that most potential side effects resolve quickly on their own, and serious adverse reactions are far rarer than measles complications.
In another interview, Kennedy said, “The MMR vaccine contains a lot of aborted fetus debris.” The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine does not contain an iota of fetal cells.
HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon and spokespeople at the CDC did not respond to queries from KFF Health News.
‘Staff are exhausted’
Despite national attention after the country’s first measles death in a decade, West Texas was overwhelmed. In late February and March, hospital administrators and health officials exchanged emails about how to lobby for resources.
“Local hospitals are at capacity,” wrote Jeffrey Hill, a senior vice president at the University Medical Center Health System in Lubbock. “The state reports emergency funds that typically cover a response like the measles outbreak are not available from the federal government right now,” he added.
“I am writing to express our urgent need for additional staff and funding,” Ronald Cook, medical director for Lubbock, said in an email, drafted with other Lubbock health authorities, to the deputy city manager. “Our Capacity is Stretched Thin: The health department has been operating seven days a week since February 2nd. Staff are exhausted.”
The city of Lubbock fronted money to help the local health department hire temporary staff. The state did not provide money, but it asked the CDC to send epidemiologists. Some came to Texas in early March. Then Texas requested federal funds.
None arrived, even as the outbreak approached 500 cases. It spread to Mexico when an unvaccinated Mennonite child returned home after visiting family in Seminole. This would fuel the largest outbreak Mexico has seen in decades, with at least 3,700 cases and 13 deaths in the state of Chihuahua.
Then another child in West Texas died of measles.
In a rare moment of openness, CDC scientist David Sugarman mentioned the outbreak at a vaccine advisory meeting in late April. “There are quite a number of resource requests coming in, in particular from Texas,” Sugarman said. “We are scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions.”
Federal funds arrived in Texas on May 21, said Anton, the state health department spokesperson. By then, the crisis was fading. The outbreak seemed to have burned until every unvaccinated person in Seminole was infected, said Richard Eby, a doctor at Permian Regional Medical Center who treated some measles patients. Hundreds, if not thousands, of cases have probably gone undetected, he said. “A lot of people presumed their kids had measles,” he said, “and didn’t see the need to confirm it.”
On Aug. 18, health officials declared the West Texas outbreak over, but the consequences of the catastrophe will be lasting.
The outbreaks it sparked across the U.S. and Mexico are still spreading.
More are inevitable, Nuzzo said. A growing number of parents are deciding not to vaccinate their kids, worried over unfounded rumors about the shots. Misinformation is flourishing, especially after Kennedy fired vaccine experts who advise the CDC and replaced them with doctors and researchers on the fringes of the scientific establishment. For example, one of his recent appointees, Robert Malone, blamed the deaths of children with measles on “medical mismanagement,” without evidence.
At the same time, states are downsizing programs for emergency response, disease surveillance, and immunization after the Trump administration clawed back more than $11 billion in public health funds earlier this year.
Amid Lubbock’s toughest months, Wells sent an email to the department’s exhausted staff. “The future is uncertain, and I know this is an unsettling time for many of us,” she wrote. “Every day we show up and do our jobs is an act of resilience.”

[…]","Immigration attorney Anne Parelkar, a democrat candidate for the U.S. Senate, speaks at the Aug. 5, 2025, Lenexa City Council meeting. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — An immigration attorney from Overland Park traveled across the state in March to a town hall in Yates Center to confront U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, and now, she is running for his seat.
Anne Parelkar is one of three Democrats challenging Marshall, a Republican who said he will run for reelection in 2026.
“I did tell him that day, I said, ‘I’m going to take your job,’ ” Parelkar said.
Parelkar said she is tired of watching Kansas’ elected offices being used for self-enrichment.
The 2026 election cycle will be her first time running for an elected position. She wants to give voters another option, she said.
“I think that the rule of law is under attack right now,” Parelkar said in an interview for the Kansas Reflector podcast. “I’m worried about our constitution not being followed. I renew my oath to the Constitution every year when I renew my law licenses, so that’s a big deal to me.”



Parelkar’s opponents in the 2026 Democratic primary would include Christy Davis of Cottonwood Falls and Michael Soetaert of Wellington.
Parelkar is licensed to practice law in Kansas, Arkansas and Missouri. She was raised Presbyterian in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and still practices. She graduated from Lyon College in Batesville, Arkansas, in 2005 and graduated in 2011 from law school at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. She has lived in Kansas for more than a decade. Parelkar is married to a first-generation immigrant, and they have two children.
 
Americans first
Kansas voters have not elected a Democrat to the U.S. Senate since 1932, and Republicans have held both Senate seats since 1939.
While running as a Democrat, Parelkar isn’t fully on board with party labels. When political parties come up, she said, tensions arise, emotions get high.
She is taking a people-first, America-first approach to her campaign and said she rejects the custom of loyalty to party. However, she also said she doesn’t think “the Republicans are the answer to our problems at all.”
“I do think it’s time for something else, something new, and I think I bring that to the table,” she said.
As an immigration attorney, Parelkar is attuned to the impacts of immigration locally and across the country.
“We have a very big problem with immigration in our country right now, in the sense that there’s a lot of confusion over it, there’s a lot of anger over it and there’s a lot of good people being impacted by it,” she said.
Immigration reform is necessary, she said, but that reform must be a solution, not another problem.
Immigration for Parelkar has historically been a professional and personal issue. As it’s becoming political for her, she said she believes in the rule of law. She said she wants violent criminals off the street but that the current approach is not the right one. She said she does not want people who have been established in the United States with jobs and children who are citizens to be punished for their immigration status.
“I don’t want children taken away from their mothers,” she said.
She believes she can bridge the gaps between differing party ideologies.
“We are Americans first. We are one nation, indivisible, and we’ve gotta start acting like it,” she said.
 
Fixing the broken things
One of Parelkar’s biggest concerns leading up to her campaign is how the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — or the “big ugly bill,” as she called it — is going to impact Kansans. In particular, she worries about access to health care in rural areas of the state and how farmers will fare.
Parelkar has bound copies of the act, which President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4. It is dense reading material, she said.
“If I have to put in so much effort to understand this, how can I possibly expect that people who have dedicated their lives to anything other than the law are going to make it through this and understand it?” she said. “That’s not going to happen.”
The way she sees it, voters have two options: re-elect the ones responsible for cuts to health care, or elect new officials who might be able to fix it.
Parelkar is opposed to eliminating funding for public schools. She said she is concerned about curricula, including mingling church and state and the prevalence of screens in schools. Families ought to have the right to choose what kind of education their kids receive, she said, but “I do not want anyone indoctrinating my kids.”
In addition to the U.S. Senate election, Kansans in 2026 will also be voting on a state constitutional amendment that attempts to change the way Kansas Supreme Court justices are appointed to the bench. Currently, the process is merit-based, through which three nominees are selected by a group of people, more than half of whom are attorneys, and the governor appoints a justice to the bench. Justices must go up for retention votes after their appointments. Republicans are proposing a popular vote system. Candidates would campaign much like other elected offices and voters will select the candidates they deem most appropriate.
Parelkar said she believes the current system is the best way to do it.
“And I’ve heard people say, ‘Well, it’s hard to find out if they’re Republican or Democrat.’ Good,” Parelkar said. “I don’t want to know if they’re Republican or Democrat.”
She added: “There should be no Republican or Democrat influence over our judiciary. We see the circus that is our campaign system today that is throwing mud at each other, tearing each other down.”
Parelkar said she never dreamed she would run for public office. People have asked why she didn’t run for local office.
“And my simple answer to that is I have no interest in holding office for a long time,” she said. “I have an interest in going and fixing the things that are broken, and finding ways to help people while I’m there.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P8050444-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-25 12:58:04.088203

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Nearly a third of telemedicine patients with opioid use disorder had to go without buprenorphine because they had trouble filling their prescription at a pharmacy, according to a new study.
The study, published in the medical journal JAMA Network Open this month, surveyed 600 telemedicine patients across five states: Florida, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio and Texas. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorder. The drug reduces a patient’s cravings for opioids and reduces the likelihood of a fatal overdose.
The most common reason that patients had trouble was that buprenorphine was unavailable at the pharmacy, followed by coverage-related issues and the pharmacy’s hesitancy in filling a telemedicine prescription.
Previous research has shown that some pharmacists, fearing scrutiny, hesitate to dispense buprenorphine, which is a controlled substance. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services say people with opioid use disorder “who need buprenorphine [should be] able to access it without undue delay,” the authors note.
Roughly half of the patients who participated in the survey were covered by Medicaid. A majority of patients had been in treatment for at least six months, and half lived in rural areas.
The analysis didn’t find statistically significant differences between patients in rural and non-rural areas. But the authors noted that the study only surveyed participants from those five states, and results might be different in other ones.
In general, they noted, patients living in rural areas might have a harder time finding buprenorphine and other opioid use disorder drugs at a pharmacy because there are fewer pharmacies in rural areas.
The study underscores recent data suggesting a lack of access to opioid use disorder medication. An analysis released last year by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that in 2022, only a quarter of people with opioid use disorder received recommended medications. About 4% of U.S. adults have opioid use disorder.
Other research has shown many pharmacies lack buprenorphine. Two studies found that between 42% and 51% of U.S. pharmacies did not have buprenorphine in stock, and availability varied widely across states.
The JAMA Network Open study was led by Workit Health, a telemedicine addiction treatment app that operates in four of the states included in the survey. Researchers from the University of Pittsburgh, Johns Hopkins University, and Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine in Pennsylvania also contributed. In their conflict of interest disclosures, some of the authors reported holding equity in Workit Health.

Joe Cervantes (D-Las Cruces); right: A pair of visitors walks down a hallway in the Otero County Processing Center in Chaparral in 2021. (Lawmakers photos courtesy NM Legislature; jail photo by Santa Ochoa for Source NM)When the New Mexico Courts and Criminal Justice Committee convened Monday morning on the campus of New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, they did so half an hour late and without any Republican members in the room.
That’s because the GOP legislators were 45 miles away touring the Otero County Processing Center, which holds more than 850 Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees.
Emails between New Mexico lawmakers and staff on the Courts and Criminal Justice Committee  — obtained by Source New Mexico — shed new light on how the partisan split came to be, and how what was supposed to be a bi-partisan opportunity to examine the state’s largest immigrant detention facility turned into something more like political theater.
The visit’s backdrop includes the possibility that Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham may consider legislation to ban immigration detention facilities in the state during a special session — a possibility her chief counsel raised in July.
CCJ Chair Sen. Joseph Cervantes (D-Las Cruces), however, told fellow committee members even prior to learning of that possibility, he’d been in touch with Otero County officials about a visit to the facility in Chaparral.
Medicaid, ICE detention on agenda for forthcoming special legislative session

Then, on Aug. 14, he told colleagues on the committee that while he’d been assured for months that the CCJ committee would be able to visit the facility,  “over the last 24 hours” he’d learned that Immigration and Customs Enforcement “has not returned phone calls or otherwise been cooperative for us to schedule such [a] tour.”
Cervantes added that he had also learned that committee members might be required to undergo background checks in order to visit. Anticipating, he wrote, that some members “might reasonably object” to background checks, and not wanting to limit participation, he said he and Committee Co-Chair Rep. Christine Chandler (D-Los Alamos) had canceled the tour.
Cervantes and Otero County attorney’s office officials did not respond to Source’s requests for comment.
With the trip canceled, Cervantes scheduled other hearings for the CCJ committee meeting scheduled for Monday and Tuesday in Las Cruces. 
A few days later, on Aug. 18, all committee and staff members received an email from Sen. Crystal Brantley (R-Elephant Butte), subject-lined “CCJ Member Tour of Otero Detention Facility Aug. 25.”
NM Gov declines GOP’s invite to visit ICE detention center

Brantley wrote that she had worked out a last-minute visit to the facility during a gathering with federal officials and local sheriffs held the prior weekend. 
Brantley’s meeting coincided with U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s visit to the state. Brantley posted a photograph of herself with Noem and touted the state lawmakers receiving “firsthand access to ICE facilities.”  
She and Rep. Andrea Reeb (R-Clovis) also touted the invite in another post on social media Aug. 20, this time inviting Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to come on the tour with them, saying her presence would “provide invaluable context for discussions about policy.” 
The next day, Senate Republicans joined in, posting a poll on X that asked:, “Will @GovMLG join lawmakers on the ICE Detention Facility Tour before attempting to shut them down?” (Thirty-seven people voted, most of them saying “no.”)
The governor’s office on Thursday told Source that her busy schedule prevented her from visiting and that she had still not decided whether ICE detention legislation will be on the special session agenda, the date for which has also not yet been set. 
However, the new prospect of a tour — this one organized by Brantley —sparked a flurry of responses from lawmakers on the CCJ committee, particularly Democrats who criticized Brantley for failing to coordinate with Cervantes to make it a sanctioned, scheduled visit with both parties.
Brantley told Source in an interview the tour came about after she asked federal officials during their trip to Ruidoso why the committee hadn’t received permission to visit the detention facility. She says officials told her they had no request on record to visit the facility. An ICE spokesperson said Friday afternoon she was looking into inquiries from Source about whether the agency had a record of the CCJ’s effort to visit the facility.
“Cervantes was working directly, he claims, with the county of Otero, to facilitate this tour,” Brantley said, “ but it seems that the local [ICE] office out of El Paso did not have that on their radar.”
All she did, Brantley noted, was “try to leverage” her contacts and the meetings with federal officials to make the tour happen.
What resulted was a “pretty quick turnaround” for the visit, she said, and she opted to schedule the tour at 8 a.m. on Monday to minimize disruptions to the committee meeting. She also told Source she emailed Cervantes and his staff member on Aug. 17 to try to put the visit back on the committee’s agenda. Brantley agreed to forward that email to Source, but had not provided it by publication, nor responded to further inquiries about it. 
Sewage flooding cells inside Torrance County ICE prison again, advocates say

Brantley’s Aug. 18 email to committee members, sent in the morning, urged them to respond by 5 p.m that day with required information for their background checks.
That request had mixed results, with members such as Rep. Joy Garratt (D-Albuquerque) noting that she had missed the deadline after not having access to her email all day and was “disappointed that it is presented as a done deal on the first day of a scheduled CCJ meeting.”
Rep. Marianna Anaya (D- Albuquerque) highlighted Brantley’s ability, as a Republican, to leverage federal contacts and arrange a visit as an “example important to the conversation.”
“Oversight is clearly lacking if Otero County itself cannot arrange a visit, the Chair of CCJ Senator Cervantes’ request was not accommodated and Senator Brantley (although I believe well intended) was allowed to schedule,” she wrote. “This seems backward. Out of respect for the Chair, I’ll be skipping the tour and attending our regularly scheduled meeting.”
Other Democrats chimed in to say they didn’t feel the tour was necessary, after all: 
“I have been inside the Core Civic detention center in Torrance County. I have seen (and smelled) enough,” Rep. Antoinette Sedillo Lopez (D-Albuquerque) wrote, an apparent reference to sewage backups at the Torrance County center operated by a private company with an ICE detention contract.  
For his part, Cervantes noted that Brantley’s tour did not constitute a “sanctioned CCJ activity” and therefore wouldn’t be on the agenda or eligible for per diem for those who attended. He also said that, instead of the planned Tuesday tour, committee members would hear from Otero County commissioners about implications of the legislation that would prohibit local governments from associating with ICE detention facilities. 
“I appreciate Sen. Brantley’s efforts but for reasons I am sure everyone understands, as Chair I am responsible for the agenda,” he wrote. 
 In the interview with Source, Brantley defended her efforts to get lawmakers access to a facility so that lawmakers can meet some of roughly 500 New Mexicans who could lose well-paying jobs if the legislation goes into effect. 
“That’s important,” she said, “to look these New Mexicans in the eye if we intend to take their jobs from them.”
She told Source she did not know whether the tour would include visits with detainees.
According to the latest figures, the facility now houses an average daily population of more than 860 ICE detainees, up from around 800 late last year. 
As a result of the controversy, Brantley said she expects the tour to mostly include Republicans, though she estimated that three Democrats RSVP’d Monday for the tour by the 5 p.m. deadline.
That predominantly Republicans will go on the tour “is unfortunate,” Brantley said, “because we’re all expected to vote on the issue. If we are to arrive in Santa Fe we’ll all have to take a position. We’ll all have to know the background and the details and of what we’re doing.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screen-Shot-2025-08-25-at-9.47.17-AM-1024x549.png,,,2025-08-25 12:58:04.088203

Burlington, Vermont
Details of services
A celebration of Tiana’s life will take place at the First Unitarian Universalist Society of Burlington on Friday, August 29th at 4 pm.
In lieu of flowers, please consider honoring Tiana’s memory by visiting your local animal shelter and adopting a cat in her name or making a donation to From Feral to Fur-Ever Rescue (49 Pine Street, Swanton, VT 05488), a rescue organization close to Tiana’s heart. Nothing would have made Tiana smile more than knowing a cat had found a safe and loving home.

Tiana (“TT”) Regina Roussin, beloved partner of Luke Clavelle and loving mother of Ryley Roussin, passed away unexpectedly at the University of Vermont Medical Center on August 22nd. Tiana, only 32 years old, suffered from postpartum hemorrhaging. The only bright moment on a very dark day was the birth of Clara Clavelle, the beautiful and healthy daughter of Tiana and Luke.
Tiana was a remarkable and resilient woman. As a young single mother, she was fiercely protective and a force to behold. Tiana raised her daughter Ryley, now 13, with love, laughter, affection, and friendship.
Anyone who knew Tiana looked forward to spending time with her. Her beautiful smile and effervescent laughter came easily, and those vibrant blue eyes lit up any room that she graced. Her spirit and energy were infectious and she always left you wanting more time with her.
Tiana’s creative talents included drawing, painting, music, singing, comedy, playing cribbage and Wordle. She was a lover of aquariums and animals. She particularly loved her cats, Nova and Beans (most of the time). Tiana loved hiking and was always up for an adventure. With Luke, she found a love for travel and had only just begun to explore the world.
Tiana graduated with honors from Milton High School in 2010 and pursued Higher Education at Emmanuel College in Boston and Community College of Vermont. She worked her way up the ranks in the hospitality industry before moving on to become a Commercial Lines Customer Service Representative at Cheeseman Insurance. In March of 2024, Tiana proudly joined Acrisure as a Commercial Lines Account Manager.
In addition to Luke, Ryley, and Clara; Tiana is survived by her parents, Leslie and Jeff Thayer, siblings Trista Roussin (her twin and first soulmate), Jenni Roussin and her fiancé Dimitrius Palmer, Lillian Thayer and her partner Rayshaun Haggray, Nicholas Roussin and his wife Kate, Jamie Roussin, and Ethan Roussin. Tiana is also survived by her adoring Roussin uncles and aunts, Paul, Lynda, David, and Anne.
Along with her family, Tiana will be forever missed by her extended family: Peter Clavelle and Betsy Ferries who loved Tiana like their own daughter and honorary siblings; Jae Clavelle and her husband, Zac Araujo and Will Clavelle and his wife, Anne Culp. It is impossible to capture all the names of the friends who loved her like a sister from grade school on. We mourn as one.
Tiana had a remarkable way of making people feel seen, valued, and loved. Whether it was through a warm hug, a compliment, or a presence in times of need, she reminded us that love should never be left unspoken. And so, in honoring Tiana’s memory, let’s carry that forward. Let’s tell our people we love them. Let’s not leave anything unsaid.
We thank the doctors, nurses and staff at UVM MC.

At one corner, there’s a recently renovated building, its painted exterior covered in brightly-colored sketches of people eating ice cream and sipping on cups of coffee. 
This is the home of Riverside Collective, a weekend coffee shop and ice cream bar that opened its doors in July. It’s here where students such as Antonio Ramirez can learn what it means to be a part of a community. 
“I’m learning how to manage my money, how to make coffee, how to run a business, how to profit, and how to communicate with people and share the idea of Riverside,” the Provine High School sophomore said.

Ramirez said that while many of his classmates don’t have jobs, he enjoys being able to spend his time working with a group of teenagers that have become his friends. Riverside Collective runs a student entrepreneurship program and currently has eight teens on staff. Ramirez said that he hopes through Riverside Collective, their work can change the narrative of the dwindling landscape of south Jackson.
“People say Jackson barely has anything in it,” Ramirez said. “I feel kind of bad about people saying that about Jackson. I want Jackson to be a city where people can have fun.”
Riverside Collective, co-founded by Vilas Annavarapu, was a project three years in the making. The nonprofit chose south Jackson for its location inside the abandoned Regions Bank because Annavarapu saw it as a place of untapped potential.

“We wanted to do economic development work in a place where a lot of people aren’t doing economic development work, and in fact, stores are leaving,” Annavarapu said.
He points to the recent departures of Burger King and Dollar General stores nearby. 
“People are really nervous to open up businesses in that part of town, and we believe there’s economic opportunity there,” Annavarapu said. “It’s really important that west Jackson, south Jackson have really nice things and good things and places for the community.”
Annavarapu said that as a former middle school teacher, he noticed some of his students found it challenging to work as a team. He wanted to create a place where young people can learn the value of working together while making a fair wage. Most of the workers there are students from Provine High School, and they’re paid $22-an-hour. 
“ I realized so many of our young people have not had the opportunity, nor have they been given the skills to understand how to work in a team and how to work in a team in a way that feels really good,” Annavarapu said.

Now, he’s hoping that spirit of creativity could lend itself to a fully fleshed out community calendar of events and classes, similar to the Briarwood Arts Center in northeast Jackson.
“What I hope Riverside opens up for young people is their imaginative potential. What can we create and what can we build that’s not already there? And how can that be a good thing?” Annavarapu said.
He hopes the impacts of Riverside Collective can be felt in tangible ways, like the number of people that they serve and the students who participate in the program. But he also wants there to be internal transformations for everyone who comes in contact with their initiative.
“ I think on the more intangible side, it’s when young people come into our program and when they leave it, do they leave feeling more confident and prepared to take on the world and are more attentive to the world around them?” Annavarapu said.

This story was originally reported by Amanda Becker and Barbara Rodriguez of The 19th. Meet Amanda and Barbara and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Republican President Donald Trump’s continued power grab in the nation’s capital, and his threat to expand his militarized takeover to other Democratic-led cities, is setting up a high-stakes showdown over the country’s democracy that pits him prominently against a familiar political foe: Black women.
On August 11, Trump declared that crime in the District of Columbia was “out of control,” despite violent crime being at a 30-year low, and directed Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Black woman, to hand over control of the city’s police force. Trump then attempted to oust the city’s police commissioner, a Black woman, and replace her with a White man, before backing down after the city threatened legal action. Now, his Justice Department is investigating the accuracy of the reported crime statistics, which the agency touted in a still-available press release earlier this year.
“Mayor Bowser better get her act straight or she won’t be mayor very long because we’ll take it over with the federal government and run it like it’s supposed to be run,” Trump said from the Oval Office on Friday, calling the city a “crime-infested rat hole.”
Earlier this summer, Trump deployed Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to protests over his administration’s immigration raids — the first time in 60 years that a president had taken such action without a governor’s request. Los Angeles is led by Mayor Karen Bass, another Black woman, who confronted the uninvited federal agents in a high-profile exchange at a city park.

Using the District of Columbia as a template, even though 79 percent of its residents oppose Trump’s actions, according to a Washington Post/Schar School poll, the president has, citing crime, threatened to send federal law enforcement back into Los Angeles, and to Baltimore, Chicago, Oakland and New York — all cities led by Democratic Black mayors, including Barbara Lee in Oakland.
And the power struggle between the administration, its allies and Black women is not limited to mayors. Texas state Rep. Nicole Collier said she was held as a “political prisoner” in the state Capitol overnight this week due to Democrats’ opposition to a Trump-ordered redistricting plan aimed at shoring up U.S. House control in the midterms. Trump, who has lobbed escalating complaints at the Federal Reserve for not lowering interest rates, on Wednesday called for the resignation not of its chair, Jerome Powell, a White man, but its governor, Linda Cook, after his housing finance agency chair launched an investigation into her personal mortgages.

While Trump’s retribution is neither currently nor historically limited to Black women, or to women or people of color more broadly, and is directed at anyone who opposes him, including one-time supporters, there are twin realities colliding when it comes to Black women political leaders, said Sydney Carr-Glenn, a political scientist at the College of the Holy Cross. Black women have in recent years reached new levels of political power and are the electoral group that most opposes the president. It’s converging at an “interesting time,” Carr-Glenn said, given the “simultaneous penalty that Black women face in this country on account of being both Black and women.”
“We have seen Black women really ascending to these roles of political prominence in recent years in ways we haven’t seen before,” said Carr-Glenn, who studies race, ethnicity and politics. She cited big-city mayors like Bowser, Bass and Lee, along with high-profile Trump critic U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett; Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman in the role; and former Vice President Kamala Harris, whose South Asian, Black and gender identities drew related attacks from Trump as the two competed to lead the country in the 2024 elections.
“Black women have certainly been breaking these barriers but it’s also come at a really interesting time in our American government, and our democracy, when we are seeing this rise in authoritarianism,” Carr-Glenn added. “And it presents different challenges for Black women who are trying to really push back against what we’ve seen.”
For Harris, her identities as a Black, South Asian woman meant enduring and sometimes having to respond to attacks based on her race and gender during the 2024 campaign. Trump amplified suggestions that Harris traded sex to get ahead in her career and questioned whether she was actually Black, suggesting she was deploying her racial identity for political benefit. In the closing weeks of the race, high-profile Trump supporter and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson likened Trump to a dad who was going to spank Harris because she was a “bad little girl.” Then-Trump ally Elon Musk’s super PAC cut an ad that called Harris a “big ol’ c-word,” before eventually saying the “c” stood for communist.
Though Harris’ presidential bid was historic, becoming the first Black woman to be nominated by a major party, she ultimately failed to be elected as the country’s top executive. No Black woman has been elected governor of a state yet either, noted Jamil Scott, an assistant professor at Georgetown University who has written about the political power of Black women mayors.
“So where is the next place to let the backlash flow? It’s in cities with very visible executives that are Black women,” she said. “This is in many ways a political warning, a political message, to say to these Black women and other Black mayors and other women of color mayors, ‘Your leadership can be challenged, too.’”

Victoria Woodards, the mayor of Tacoma, Washington, and a board of trustees member for the African American Mayors Association, said Black women mayors are resilient despite the realities they face in a job that requires balancing community needs with external pressures from state and federal governments.
“These are women who, despite all of the things that have been in their way or barriers that have come to them, they are still fighting the fight. They are still getting up every day and going to city hall,” she said. “They are still doing the jobs, because that’s what’s required of us.”
Wendy Via is co-founder and CEO of Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, an organization that tracks how online discourse shapes the potential for political violence. Via said the president’s actions against the mayors and their jurisdictions are “part of the authoritarian playbook” to try to crush political opposition. She noted that demonizing them creates an “enemy” that can later be used to justify military action and formal policy that removes rights.
“I do not think it is an accident that the mayors he’s gone after have been Black women, because another trait of authoritarianism is demonizing communities that have a history of being marginalized,” Via said. “When you can send in the troops and it’s a Black woman leader on the receiving end, then it’s not such a big deal to send in the troops — because they’re already the enemy, and they must not be capable of managing their city.”
The manner in which Trump insults Black women political leaders frequently calls into question their ability and aptitude to do their jobs.
The president just this week repeated a demand that Crockett, the Dallas-area representative who uses her post on the House Oversight Committee to hold the administration accountable, take an intelligence test. He also put quotation marks around the word congresswoman in a move to delegitimize Crockett’s stature and demeaned the progressive group of mostly women House members of color known as the Squad.
Crockett responded in a fundraising email that “Donald Trump just cannot stop thinking about me. He’s insulted me, challenged me to an IQ test — but now, he’s finally said something I agree with.” She then linked to a social media post in which the president wrote: “Jasmine Crockett is the future of the Democrat party!”

Black women have also faced physical restraint and even arrest for opposing the president’s actions.
Rep. LaMonica McIver of New Jersey is the first sitting member of Congress to be prosecuted by the Trump administration. She was indicted on three counts of “forcibly impeding” law enforcement during a confrontation earlier this summer outside an ICE facility. She pleaded not guilty, and in a recent court filing argued that her prosecution showed “unconstitutional differential treatment” because the Trump administration dropped cases against defendants facing the same charges over their actions during the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. When McIver denounced as racist Trump’s characterization of his militarized incursion into the District of Columbia as “liberation day,” a White House spokesman called her an “unserious person.”
In Texas, Collier spent the night in the Capitol alone after she refused a GOP-mandated law enforcement escort to monitor her whereabouts ahead of a vote on the Trump-requested congressional redistricting map, which had previously prompted Democrats to delay the vote by leaving the state, and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to order their arrests.

Scott said the president may be miscalculating how leaders like Bass and Bowser will respond to his attempts to seize their power — partly because of their own years of experience in politics, and partly because of how the information ecosystem is shaped now.

Stumpe rejected arguments by the Missouri branch of the National Education Association that the flow of funds should be stopped in order to prevent unauthorized spending of state funds that can’t be “clawed back.”
But he didn’t outright deny the teachers union’s case, also turning down the state’s motion to dismiss Monday.
Still, Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who is in his final days in office before stepping into a federal position as co-deputy director of the FBI, labeled the ruling a “victory.”
“Parents, not unions, not bureaucrats, know what’s best for their kids,” he said in a press release. “This case is about freedom and opportunity, and today’s ruling is a huge step toward securing both.”
At the center of the case is the MOScholars program, which until the infusion of general revenue landed last month funded private-school scholarships through a tax credit program.
The lawsuit challenges the shift from a program dependent on donations  — which taxpayers are able to receive back as a tax credit equal to 100% of their contribution — to a state-sponsored voucher program.
Both sides met in circuit court last Thursday for the first in-person hearing of what will likely be a months-long legal battle. MNEA’s attorney Loretta Haggard argued that the appropriation lacks authority from state statute.
“You can’t just turn on a hose of $51 million in general revenue and force it through the tax credit framework,” she said. “There are gaps in that framework.”
But the attorney general’s office and intervenors from Indiana-based advocacy group EdChoice argued the legislature’s authority in the budget process was sufficient.
“Just because (the budget bill) funds a program set up by other statutes does not make a new appropriation unlawful—new funding is a common, necessary, and entirely unsurprising
feature of general-revenue bills,” Bailey’s office wrote in a filing submitted Aug. 15.
The digital case record does not include Stumpe’s reasoning for the two denials Monday.
MNEA President Rebeka McIntosh shared her concerns about the unhampered flow of tax dollars to private schools in a statement.
“Politicians think they’ve won, but Missouri NEA’s 45,000 educators know better. We’ll prove in court what rural Missouri already knows: when you kill the school, you kill the town,” she said. “These vouchers violate our constitution and hurt our kids.”
The case does not yet have a trial date.

Today, a split-jury verdict would mean a mistrial and possibly Gray’s freedom. But back then, in Louisiana, it resulted in a life sentence for the 19-year-old from Tunica, a rural community nestled on the banks of the Mississippi River.
Gray, who has always maintained his innocence, spent the next four decades in the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. During that time he lost everything, he said. From behind bars, he learned that his mother, who for a time was a guard at the prison where he was being held, had dementia and died in 2020. Prison officials refused to allow him to attend her funeral.

That same year the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that nonunanimous jury verdicts, legal in only Louisiana and Oregon, were unconstitutional and based on an inherently racist law designed to uphold white supremacy.
Going forward, there would be no more Lloyd Grays.
But in fact, there are more than 1,000 people in Louisiana like Gray, convicted by split juries and still imprisoned, according to the Promise of Justice Initiative, a New Orleans-based nonprofit focused on criminal justice reform. Although the Supreme Court says cases like theirs are unconstitutional going forward, it left the decision about what to do with those convicted long ago to the states. And Louisiana alone says they should stay behind bars.
Two years after the U.S. Supreme Court decision, the Louisiana Supreme Court declined to grant new trials for those prisoners, acquiescing to local prosecutors who feared that retrying hundreds of decades-old cases would tie up state courts. The conservative state Legislature, meanwhile, has repeatedly rejected bills that would have required a reexamination of their cases.
That left one very narrow path for Gray and others like him, mostly Black men, to have their cases revisited. If they could credibly argue that their convictions were secured illegally — if there was race-based discrimination in the case, for example — they could strike a plea deal with a prosecutor, securing their release. But a new state law, passed last year at the urging of Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, limited local prosecutors’ ability to broker such deals, cutting off the last remaining avenue of relief for those imprisoned by nonunanimous juries.

The key problem, legal experts say, is that the Supreme Court did not make its 2020 ruling retroactive as it did in Montgomery v. Louisiana, a 2016 case in which the justices found that life sentences without parole for juveniles should be banned going forward as well as for those already convicted.
What’s more, in a separate decision in 2021, the court ruled that its 2020 opinion did not apply to older cases, like Gray’s, that had already gone through the regular state appeals process. However, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote for the court’s majority, Oregon and Louisiana were still free to offer retroactive relief on their own.
In contrast to Louisiana, Oregon’s Supreme Court vacated every split-jury conviction in the state, after which prosecutors offered plea deals with reduced sentences to the majority of those prisoners convicted by nonunanimous juries. Verite News and ProPublica estimated about 760 prisoners were convicted by nonunanimous juries based on a 2018 list provided by the Oregon Department of Justice of people who had filed lawsuits claiming their convictions were unconstitutional.
“There are a lot of injustices in our legal system we can’t fix. And yet, here is this issue that is so clear and obvious that it’s on all of us to do the right thing,” said Aliza Kaplan, a professor at Lewis & Clark Law School in Portland, Oregon, who fought for years to end the state’s split-jury system.
“When I look at Louisiana, it’s really heartbreaking.”

The Landry administration did not respond to requests for comment.
Zach Daniels, executive director of the Louisiana District Attorneys Association, said the group, which backed Landry’s law, has attempted to reach a compromise with criminal justice reformers who want all past split-jury verdicts overturned. This included an alternative that would give those convicted by nonunanimous juries the opportunity to apply for parole instead of having their cases either vacated or reexamined. But some lawmakers and criminal justice reform advocates rejected that option because they did not view the opportunity to be heard by a special parole committee appointed by Landry, as the plan called for, a compromise for people imprisoned unconstitutionally.
Gray’s case for freedom is particularly strong, his attorneys said, because there is good evidence that racial animus led to his conviction. They discovered last year that the two jurors who had voted to acquit were Black — a fact that doesn’t appear in the court records. And that someone had drawn a swastika on the upper right hand corner of the original district attorney’s case file.
In addition, the lone surviving family member of the victim told the district attorney’s office he is “fully supportive” of Gray’s release. He could not be reached for comment.
The New Orleans District Attorney’s Office had been in discussions with Gray’s legal team about a potential deal to secure his release before Landry’s 2023 election. But the governor’s new law constraining prosecutors from making such deals could ensure that Gray spends the remainder of his days in Angola. His current case before the court will next be considered Tuesday at Orleans Parish Criminal District Court, where a judge will decide whether Landry’s law applies in Gray’s case.
“When you’re sent to prison with a life sentence, they send you here to die,” said Gray, now 65, through his attorney because the prison rejected requests from Verite News and ProPublica to interview him directly. “After 45 years, I’m no closer to freedom than the day I walked into this place.”
‘Jim Crow juries’
Louisiana began allowing nonunanimous verdicts — or “Jim Crow juries,” as they are sometimes called here — in response to the 14th Amendment, which ensured that Black citizens, including formerly enslaved people, had equal protection under the law. This included, among other things, the right to serve on juries. Until then, Louisiana had required a unanimous vote for criminal convictions. But state lawmakers did not want to give a single Black juror the power to undermine the will of 11 white people.
During an 1898 constitutional convention, Louisiana’s elected officials lowered the threshold for a criminal conviction from 12 votes to nine (and increased it to 10 in 1973). One committee chairman was cited in the Supreme Court ruling against the practice saying that the provision was meant to “establish the supremacy of the white race.”
In 1934, Oregon followed suit, becoming the only other state to ever approve the use of split-jury verdicts. (Oregon passed its law following public outrage that a Jewish man was found guilty of manslaughter rather than murder in the high-profile death of a Protestant man.)
The jury’s decision at Gray’s trial in December 1980 unfolded as Louisiana legislators had envisioned nearly a century ago.
After initially charging Gray with aggravated rape, prosecutors offered him a deal, according to Gray and his attorneys. If he pleaded guilty to a lesser offense, he would receive a 10-year sentence. But Gray rejected the offer, never wavering in his claims of innocence. The district attorney’s office said there is no record of a proposed plea deal.
Gray and Dianna Knockum, the woman who accused him of rape, each testified on a single day, providing wildly divergent versions of what happened on a Wednesday night six months earlier. Gray, 19 at the time, and Knockum, 33, knew each other from frequenting a bar called Club Hollywood in the Hoffman Triangle neighborhood of New Orleans. Gray claimed they got into a fight outside the bar over $15 Knockum owed him. When she refused to pay, Gray said he hit her twice in the face, at which point a mutual friend separated them and brought him back into the club.
Knockum claimed Gray was angry after she rejected his advances. She said he followed her as she left the bar then hit her with a hard object on the back of the head. Knockum said she regained consciousness in an abandoned building where Gray raped her.
At trial, prosecutors noted that Knockum identified Gray as her attacker, and that doctors found bruises on her head. Gray’s defense team focused on the lack of physical evidence or witnesses tying him to the crime, and that Knockum’s injuries didn’t indicate she was raped. DNA testing didn’t exist at the time, and the evidence was not saved for later examination.
After 54 minutes of deliberations, the jury returned with its verdict: The 10 white jurors voted guilty, and the two black jurors, Elizabeth Sensley and Audrey Kaywood, not guilty. Gray was sentenced to life without parole.
Knockum died more than 20 years ago, according to a 2024 court filing by New Orleans prosecutors.
Sensley and Kaywood provided statements to Gray’s attorneys last year in which they said the racial makeup of the jury likely contributed to his conviction. Sensley said there were plenty of Black people in the jury pool, yet only two were selected. The prosecution used its only jury selection strike to prevent a third Black person from serving. At the time, Black people made up 67% of the city’s population.
“I knew that my voice would not matter,” Sensley told an investigator with Gray’s legal team, recounting how she felt about being Black on the nearly all-white jury. “I cannot believe that Lloyd Gray is still in prison.”
  Elizabeth Sensley, a juror in Gray’s case, gave a statement to an investigator with Gray’s legal team recounting how she felt about being Black on the nearly all-white jury.
Kaywood told the investigator she had a “strong feeling” Gray might be innocent. “I wondered aloud to my husband, what if he didn’t do it. The case impacted me deeply,” she said. “I never wanted to serve on a jury again.”
Neither woman could be reached for comment.
Keeping Black people off juries was vital to prosecutors, as they were seen to be more “skeptical of the state,” according to a 2018 investigation by The New Orleans Advocate. In convictions with split-jury verdicts, Black jurors were 2.5 times more likely to dissent compared with white jurors, the report found. That’s why prosecutors used their strikes to remove prospective Black jurors at more than twice the rate as they did white jurors.
Gray’s legal team has noted that his conviction happened at a time of intense racial strife in New Orleans. Just a few years earlier, the Ku Klux Klan, led by David Duke, marched through the French Quarter to protest the city’s first Black mayor. The district attorney’s office was headed by Harry Connick Sr., whose 30-year tenure was stained by accusations of racial bias. During Connick’s time as district attorney, there were 32 cases of wrongful convictions, 27 of which involved prosecutorial misconduct, according to the National Registry of Exonerations. Of those wrongfully convicted, 97% were Black.
And yet Connick refused to crack down on his staff, drawing the ire of former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. As part of a wrongful-conviction case in which prosecutors hid blood evidence, Ginsburg said in a 2011 dissent that Connick had created a “tinderbox in Orleans Parish” where it was expected that prosecutors hide evidence from the defense. And when those violations occurred, she wrote, “Connick insisted there was no need to change anything, and opposed efforts to hold prosecutors accountable on the ground that doing so would make his job more difficult.” Five of the other eight justices disagreed with her.
After his conviction, Gray was sent to Angola, one of the most violent penitentiaries in the country at the time. The 19-year-old was frightened, but he wasn’t alone. A few years prior to his incarceration, his mother, Ora Gray, had taken a job as a guard at Angola. She worked the night shift in a watchtower that overlooked the same cell block that would briefly house her son.
Gray said he would wake up early every morning, sit by a window and look up into his mother’s tower, about 40 yards away. And every morning she would look down at him.
“I was sitting there to let her know that I was safe,” Gray said.
After about six weeks, Gray said he was transferred to another part of the prison. Gray assumed prison officials wanted to separate them, afraid his mother would hesitate to shoot if he tried to escape.
Ora Gray worked at Angola for more than three decades until she retired in 2012. She died eight years later. Lloyd Gray, wracked by guilt, said he should have cared for her in her final years and held her hand as she slipped away. Instead, he couldn’t even attend her funeral.
The system “was designed to put people of color in the situation I’m in,” he said.

A deal retracted
After nearly four decades in Angola, Gray had settled in as best he could. He held a mixture of jobs — tutor, office clerk, field hand, kitchen orderly — and tried to stay safe and out of trouble. But he told his lawyers he struggled to come to terms with where life had taken him.
Gray’s sister sent him a family picture, and he didn’t know who half the people were, especially the younger children. That was the hardest part, he said, contemplating everything that had been taken from him.
Gray’s prospects began to improve, however, in tandem with a growing sentiment that the criminal justice systems across the country were heavily weighted against poor and minority communities and needed to be reformed. A series of victories for this movement, on both the state and national levels, gave Gray hope, starting in 2018. That’s when 64% of Louisiana voters approved a constitutional amendment outlawing nonunanimous juries for any crime committed after Jan. 1, 2019.
Those who fought for the amendment focused their campaign on the damage such juries had done to the state’s minority communities: Black people make up 67% of the prison population but 80% of those convicted by split juries, according to a report from the Promise of Justice Initiative.
Split-jury verdicts also resulted in lengthier sentences. In Louisiana, 62% of all prisoners convicted by split juries are serving life sentences, like Gray, while only about 16% of the overall prison population is doing so, the report said.
That’s because the split-jury law created an incentive for prosecutors to hand down the most serious charges they could. Lesser crimes that carried shorter sentences were tried before a six-person jury that had to rule unanimously. Former prosecutor and state Sen. Dan Claitor said during a 2018 legislative hearing on nonunanimous juries that the numbers frequently led him to “up-charge” defendants “because it was easier for me to convict them with 10 out of 12 than it is six out of six.”
Louisiana’s voter referendum prohibiting nonunanimous juries was a significant victory, but it did little to address the plight of people like Gray who had already been convicted. And then, two years later, in Ramos v. Louisiana, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 6-3 vote that split-jury verdicts violated the Sixth Amendment’s guarantee of a fair trial.
In his majority opinion, Justice Neil Gorsuch, appointed to the court by President Donald Trump, wrote that the origin of split-jury verdicts could be “traced to the rise of the Ku Klux Klan and efforts to dilute the influence of racial and ethnic and religious minorities.” In Louisiana, he wrote, the point was “to ensure that African-American juror service would be meaningless.”
In the months that followed, the Promise of Justice Initiative filed appeals for 1,049 Louisiana prisoners convicted by split juries. Hundreds of those, including Gray’s, were filed in New Orleans, where a new district attorney, Jason Williams, had just been elected.

Williams took office in January 2021, one of a wave of progressive prosecutors across the country. He pledged to root out and reconsider potentially problematic cases involving wrongful convictions, excessive sentences or racial bias. He also took on split-jury verdicts.
Within days of being sworn in, Williams had established a civil rights division and hired Emily Maw, the former head of the Innocence Project New Orleans, to lead it. As of July 2024, the division had vacated or reduced the sentences of more than 350 men and women, 150 of whom were convicted by nonunanimous juries, according to the district attorney’s office.
In 2022, prosecutors with the unit proposed a potential deal to Gray’s attorneys: If he pleaded guilty to forcible rape, he would walk, according to Gray and his attorneys. The lesser charge carried a maximum sentence of 40 years; Gray had already served 41.
Such plea deals would soon prove to be the only shot people like Gray had at freedom. The same year Gray was offered a plea deal, the state’s highest court ruled in a 5-2 vote that the federal ban on nonunanimous juries was not retroactive, preventing more than 1,000 people convicted by split juries from having their day in court, according to estimates by the Promise of Justice Initiative.
The only Black member of the Louisiana Supreme Court, Justice Piper Griffin dissented, writing: “Such convictions were racially discriminatory in 1898. They were racially discriminatory in 1975. They remain racially discriminatory today.”
While he agreed with the majority that the state shouldn’t overturn all past split-jury verdicts, Justice James Genovese wrote in a partial dissent that prisoners who could demonstrate that their verdicts were “tainted by racial animus” should be “entitled to relief, regardless of the date of their conviction.” In particular, he said, new trials should be granted when it can be proven that a Black juror had voted to acquit the accused.
Louisiana’s rejection of retroactivity put a premium on the type of deals offered to Gray. But before his could be finalized and approved by the courts, it was upended in November 2023 by a massive political shift in Louisiana as Landry was elected governor.
Campaigning on a tough-on-crime platform, the former police officer and state attorney general vowed to accelerate executions, impose stiffer sentences and end the reign of “woke district attorneys” whom he accused of “playing a dangerous game of catch and release” with criminals.
Within his first few months in office, in March 2024, Landry signed Act 10, which prohibits district attorneys from waiving the two-year deadline for prisoners to challenge their convictions through post-conviction relief. Such a waiver is typically needed to revive decades-old cases like Gray’s.
It was set to go into effect Aug. 1, 2024.
Swastika on the case file
The clock was now ticking for Gray and his attorneys. Given the drastic change in the political climate, they believed they needed to uncover additional evidence that Gray’s prosecution was unjust to increase his chances of being released. And they needed to do so before Williams lost the ability to have missed deadlines waived.
They caught their first break the same month Landry signed Act 10 into law. That’s when they requested and received Gray’s original 1980 case file from the district attorney’s office, something they had never seen before.
Colin Reingold, Gray’s attorney from 2021 to 2024, said he skimmed the file, blowing past the cover page, looking for any facts that could help secure Gray’s release. He then recalled receiving a Slack message from an investigator on his team who was also scouring through the new documents: Wow, this swastika on the front cover is sure crazy, isn’t it?
“I was like, ‘What are you talking about?’ I didn’t see it at all,” Reingold said. “And then I immediately went to the DA file and pulled it up. And, I mean, it’s unmistakable.”
That someone with the district attorney’s office would doodle the Nazi symbol on the case file of a Black man accused of rape in the early 1980s raises significant concerns about the motivations of the prosecution, Reingold said.
“You always suspect that there are, in some cases, bad actors with beliefs that could taint the whole process,” Reingold said. “But you never think that you’re going to find it in black and white like that.”

The district attorney’s office does not dispute the swastika’s existence or that a staff member might have drawn it more than 40 years ago, according to a September filing by prosecutors. Assistant District Attorneys Jim Letten and William O’Hara prosecuted Gray’s case. O’Hara died in 2007. Letten, who would later serve as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana, did not respond to requests for comment.
“Our office acknowledges that a derogatory symbol appears on a microfilmed copy of Mr. Gray’s case file,” Keith Lampkin, a spokesman for the district attorney’s office, told Verite News and ProPublica. “There is no record indicating who drew the symbol or when it was drawn.”
The swastika was important to Gray’s claims of racial bias, but even more vital was the discovery two months later, in June 2024, that the two people who voted to acquit Gray were Black.
Erica Navalance, an attorney with the Promise of Justice Initiative who currently represents Gray, said these new pieces of evidence spoke directly to the two factors Genovese said in his partial dissent should trigger a new trial: racial bias and proof that a Black juror voted to acquit.
Armed with this information, Gray’s attorneys filed a new appeal the day before Act 10 went into effect. They knew that Williams was under increasing pressure from Landry to abandon his efforts to reinvestigate old cases but hoped this new evidence would convince his office to keep their word and free Gray.
Publicly, Williams refused to back down, telling his conservative opponents during a legislative hearing last September that he could not ignore the city’s long history of wrongfully convicting Black people.
“In the city of New Orleans, we’ve been so good at mass-producing defective convictions that I think it is incumbent that we make sure that we let these cases be heard,” Williams said.
Eleven days later, Williams’ office took an unexpected position in its response to Gray’s appeal. Its hands were tied by Act 10, it said, and it could no longer waive missed deadlines. As a result, Gray would have to serve out the remainder of his life sentence, prosecutors claimed.
The district attorney’s office has maintained this position despite Orleans Parish Criminal District Court Judge Robin Pittman stating in November as part of Gray’s case that its interpretation of Act 10 was wrong. As long as the appeal was filed before Aug. 1, Pittman said, it retained the ability to waive deadlines. Four months later, the state Supreme Court in Louisiana v. Taylor came to the same conclusion.
Navalance said she’d never before witnessed the state district attorney’s association rallying behind a law that would strip them of their own power.
“​​I thought our goal was to see justice done,” Navalance said. “I thought we all agreed that meant Lloyd Gray should come home 45 years after being convicted of a crime he didn’t commit.”

The district attorney’s office told Verite News and ProPublica that its response to Gray’s case simply reflects statutory changes. “It is now for the court to determine whether Mr. Gray’s application overcomes those procedural requirements,” Lampkin said.
Gray said the whiplash of events over the past several years — from believing he once had a shot at freedom to fearing the door might be permanently closed — have felt like a “mirage.”
“You see it,” he said, “but when you reach for it, it’s not really there.”

WILMINGTON — Wilmington City Council has taken the next step in addressing PFAS contamination in the city’s drinking water.
During the Thursday, Aug. 21 council meeting, council advanced an ordinance authorizing bonds for the Phase Three PFAS Removal Project, which will fund the design and construction of a new PFAS system and a transfer pump station.
The Finance and Economic Development Committee will review the PFAS ordinance, along with the broader package of bond measures, before it returns to the full council for a vote.

PFAS in Delaware
PFAS—often called “forever chemicals”- do not break down easily and can build up in the environment and human body. Wilmington is situated in the Christina River basin, an area with known contamination hotspots, including the Brandywine and Red Clay creeks.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is asking President Donald Trump for answers and a change of heart after his administration reneged on a declaration approving portions of a disaster relief package for northern Michigan following devastating ice storms in the spring.
Whitmer on Monday issued a letter to appeal that decision. The governor said although assistance for local municipalities was approved by the Trump administration, individual families, businesses and utilities have been denied relief in the form of federal funding.
“Many Northern Michiganders are still reeling from the impacts of the ice storm that devastated communities earlier this year,” Whitmer said in a statement. “Michigan families and businesses deserve the support they need to recover from these storms. That’s why I’m appealing [the administration’s] disaster aid denials. I’ll keep fighting like hell to deliver relief for our residents, local governments and utility providers.”
Trump on July 22 declared a major disaster for Alcona, Alpena, Antrim, Charlevoix, Cheboygan, Crawford, Emmet, Kalkaska, Mackinac, Montmorency, Oscoda, Otsego, Presque Isle, and the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians in response to a severe winter storm that occurred between March 28 and March 30.
The president’s declaration activated a number of Federal Emergency Management Agency public assistance programs, but on July 28, FEMA officials informed the governor’s office that it would be denying its request for activation as it related to public utility assistance, along with hazard mitigation grants and individual assistance for families.
Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II also issued a statement through Whitmer’s office, adding that the executive team was working hard to provide relief.

“Unfortunately, residents, business owners, and utilities aren’t getting what they need,” Gilchrist said. “We are appealing FEMA’s decision not to approve key parts of our request, and we’ll continue Standing Tall to help northern Michigan recover.” 
A bipartisan group of federal and statewide elected officials also joined in the governor’s call to greenlight the remaining portion of requested aid, including U.S. Sen. Gary Peters of Bloomfield Township, U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Holly, both Democrats, as well as U.S. Rep. Jack Bergman of Watersmeet and state Sen. John Damoose of Harbor Springs, both Republicans.
“Recovery will continue to be out of reach without these critical resources from FEMA, which is why I support Governor Whitmer’s appeal. Michiganders deserve better,” Peters said.
Slotkin echoed Peters and said FEMA needs to step up and do its part after Trump declared a major disaster for the area.
Bergman, a strong Republican supporter of Trump, added that Michigan families and communities were still left carrying the burden even months after the ice storms halted power and critical resources in March. The congressman said he strongly supported Whitmer’s appeal.
“This is about standing up for Northern Michiganders and ensuring we are not left behind,” Bergman said.
Damoose, a leading Republican in the Senate, said he personally experienced the devastation of the storms.
“I am also deeply troubled by the costs that our electrical co-ops have faced which total hundreds of millions of dollars,” Damoose said. “While we are all grateful for the federal support that has been approved, I very much support Governor Whitmer’s efforts to appeal the decision by the federal government to deny individual assistance and help to our utilities, who otherwise will have no choice but to pass those costs on to residents.”
The letter and appeal came within a 30-day window to appeal FEMA’s decision. Whitmer said she was providing the agency with updated data and what she believed was a compelling justification for why the programs were essential for long-term recovery in the region.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Reports of recent water and air conditioning outages at an immigration detention center in Aurora were among the concerns highlighted by Colorado’s four Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives in a letter to the Trump administration on Friday.
The letter followed a visit earlier this month to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Aurora by U.S. Reps. Diana DeGette of Denver, Joe Neguse of Lafayette, Jason Crow of Centennial and Brittany Pettersen of Lakewood.
Crow and Neguse are among a dozen House Democrats who have sued the Department of Homeland Security over a new ICE policy requiring lawmakers to obtain prior approval to conduct facility oversight visits. But despite providing advance notice of their Aug. 11 visit, the four Colorado Democrats said that ICE personnel accompanying them were unable to provide much of the information they asked for.

“They failed to answer many of our questions and repeatedly encouraged us to instead email ICE’s Office of Congressional Relations,” they wrote in their letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons. “The inevitable delays caused by routing our questions through OCR, rather than the ICE employee leading the oversight visit, prevent meaningful oversight from taking place in a timely manner.”
The letter includes four pages of questions about the Aurora facility, which is operated by private prison company The GEO Group. The facility has a total capacity of 1,532 detainees and has long been the target of criticism from activists over allegations of inhumane conditions and dehumanizing treatment.
Among the concerns highlighted by the Aug. 22 letter are reports of an air conditioning system within the detention center “not functioning for period of time in July.” Detainees in one of the facility’s housing pods were reportedly relocated as a result. The letter also mentions “reports on several occasions of water outages in the facility, including in July and August of this year.” Other issues raised include recent prohibitions on orientation programs previously conducted by legal aid groups, as well as increased signage and “repeated visits” from ICE staff pressuring detainees to “self-deport.”
The lawmakers also want more detailed demographic information about detainees in the facility, including their countries of origin, the number of detainees entering and leaving the facility on a weekly basis, and the percentage of detainees who have not been convicted of a violent crime.
Caroline Dias Goncalves, a 19-year-old Utah nursing student without a criminal record, was detained in the Aurora facility for 15 days earlier this year before being released on bond. She called her stay a “nightmare” and described having to eat soggy bread and being “treated better than others who didn’t speak English.”
Internal ICE planning documents obtained by The Washington Post indicate that up to three new immigration detention centers could be operational in Colorado by the end of the year. The lawmakers’ letter to DHS says that an ICE staffer told them that one of those potential facilities, in the town of Hudson, is “under contract with ICE.”
The lawmakers asked DHS to provide answers to their questions by Sept. 5.

Nicholas Bavas, a resident of Dallas County, is suing DraftKings Inc., a sports gambling website, and its subsidiary Crown IA Gaming, which is licensed by the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission to conduct sports wagering within the state.
Bavas claims DraftKings unfairly voided the bets he placed on the 2024 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am golf tournament as rain threatened to cut short play after 54 holes. Aware there was a good chance of the final round being canceled, and with DraftKings still accepting bets on the tournament’s outcome, bettors around the country, Bavas included, put their money on all of the competitors who were then in the lead.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
DraftKings has denied any wrongdoing in the matter and recently asserted 19 separate affirmative defenses in the case, including a claim that Bavas “knowingly accepted the risk that circumstances may arise related to the odds associated with any wager.”
The company argues that this risk was disclosed in the “house rues” to which Bavas agreed, including rules that expressly warn that errors may occur and DraftKings has the right to void wagers due to any such errors.
Attorneys for Bavas argue DraftKings applies a “dizzying array of interlocking sets of rules that may or may not govern each bet depending on the type of wager placed, the specific event, and the particular sport … However, when DraftKings makes an error or accepts a bet it should not have, or when unforeseen events occur that require an unanticipated large pay out by DraftKings, then it seems different rules apply.”
A trial in the case is scheduled for Sept. 28, 2026.
According to the lawsuit, Bavas placed five bets on the outcome of the Pebble Beach Pro-Am golf tournament in the late hours of Feb. 3 as historic rains and winds threatened to suspend all play.
Shortly after 10 p.m. on Feb. 3, 2024, Bavas allegedly placed a $100 bet, which DraftKings accepted. The bet was a “20 Picks” parlay, in which the bettor chooses multiple competitors who must place as designated for the bet to pay out. Bavas selected the leading competitor, Wyndham Clark, as the tournament winner, and his other picks for the top finishers aligned with their rankings at that moment.
At the time DraftKings accepted that bet, the lawsuit claims, DraftKings promised to pay Bavas $4,651,571 if every one of Bavas’ picks were correct.
At 10:18 p.m., Bavas wagered $25 on a different type of parlay in which he simply picked the top 20 finishers in no particular order, for a potential payout of $250,068.
At 11:22 p.m., Bavas placed a third bet, this time for $50, that otherwise was identical to the first bet. That bet had an alleged payout of $2,325,786.
At 11:59, he placed a fourth bet, identical to the first, for $100, with a $4,651,571 payout.
Two minutes later, at 12:01 a.m. he placed a fifth bet, for $50, identical to his third bet, with a $2,325,786 payout.
Later in the day on Feb. 4, 2024, PGA Tour referees continually delayed the scheduled start of the final round of tournament play due to rain and wind.  At 9:15 p.m. that evening, the PGA Tour’s rules committees announced there would be no play the following day and so the tournament results would be considered final through the conclusion of the 54 holes already played — which, Bavas’ lawsuit claims, resulted in all five of his bets being winners, for a total potential payout of $14.2 million.
However, the lawsuit alleges, DraftKings “unilaterally voided” all five of his bets and refunded the wagered amounts, citing rules that say “futures bets” placed after the last shot of what is later determined to be the final round are voided.
Bavas’ lawsuit alleges the cited rule doesn’t appear to apply to bets on multiple players, as was the case with Bavas’ parlay wagers.
“Had Bavas wanted to place a bet on only the single individual ‘player’ who would ‘win the trophy’ and become the ‘tournament winner,’ he would have done so,” the lawsuit claims, arguing that even if DraftKings could “void” the portions of bets 1 through 4 that selected the tournament winner as Wyndham Clark, the odds should have been recalculated to reflect the remaining selections.
The lawsuit seeks damages for breach of contract and violations of consumer-protection laws.
Bavas’ attorney, Ben Lynch of Clive, said it’s worth noting that had Bavas bet on other golfers to win or place in a rain-shortened tournament, DraftKings would not have allowed him to cancel his bet after the fact and claim a refund.
“If he had lost the bet and said, ‘I want my money back because I didn’t think the weather was going to cancel things,’ DraftKings would have kept his money,” Lynch said. “The rules that DraftKings had in place at the time of the tournament did not allow them to void the bets. They changed the rules after this tournament.”
Bavas wasn’t the only person who guessed that weather would result in a rain-shortened pro-am. DraftKings sparked outrage on social media when it retroactively voided all bets placed after the close of play on Feb. 3, 2024.

A museum dedicated to Latino history will someday take its place alongside other Smithsonian Institution buildings in Washington, D.C.
Groundbreaking is likely still years in the future.
The National Museum of the American Latino has deep connections to Kansas City, a fact that helped draw national staff to the area in early August for community events.
Discussions were wide-ranging.
People spoke about painful memories of discrimination, like the segregated schools that once existed for Mexican children, and other challenges.
Yet deep pride was on full display for the accomplishments of local heroes in business, education and the arts. Attendees praised the patriotism of Latino veterans. They expressed a strong belief in the nation’s opportunities, long embraced by immigrants.
“We’re writing our own story so that others can see how we fit into the American experience,” said Ramon Murguía, a Harvard-educated lawyer, trustee of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and Kansas City area philanthropic leader often cited for his role in helping to raise millions of dollars in scholarships for college-bound area youth.
Museum proponents are keenly aware of the need to continue building bipartisan support to weather current culture wars, including President Donald Trump’s recent decision to vet some exhibits and museums of the Smithsonian Institution.
Shortly after the museum staff left Kansas City, the Latino museum found itself in the White House crosshairs on Aug. 21, flagged several times in a listing of Smithsonian exhibits and messaging criticized as woke or anti-American.
Murguía sees the development of the museum as a marker of respect.
He wants it to honor the contributions of Latinos in building the wealth of the nation, often through their strenuous labor working on railroads, in packing houses and increasingly as an engine of entrepreneurship.
The museum can also counter the false impression that Latinos are primarily recent immigrants, he said.
“We are instrumental to the development of this country,” Murguía said.
Jorge Zamanillo, the Latino museum’s founding director, joined Murguía in an Aug. 8 fireside chat at Kansas City’s Union Station.
People assume that the better-known heroes will be represented at historical institutions, Zamanillo said. But he said the essence of any museum, the guiding narratives, is made up of individual, very personal stories.
“How do we illuminate those local stories so that they resonate at the national level?” Zamanillo said.
The morning event, dubbed Cafecito con Jorge, was attended by a wide range of business and civic leaders, including the Mexican Consul Soileh Padilla Mayer and the director and CEO of the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Julián Zugazagoitia.
The mammoth nature of the project loomed over the conversation.
The challenge is to fairly and accurately curate artifacts and exhibitions to tell the stories of the nation’s 64 million Latinos, who can trace their diverse cultures and histories to countries around the world, encompassing every race.
That history goes back 500 years, before the nation’s founding, and must include indigenous people and the narratives of U.S. territories, such as Puerto Rico.
 Latino history is American history

A guiding principle of the decades-long quest to establish the museum is that Latino history is American history.
The National Museum of the American Latino was authorized by Congress in 2020 and signed into law by Trump during his first term.
Still, it has a long way to go before construction can begin.
Supporters plan to continue nurturing the strong bipartisan support the project has long enjoyed — some of it through the work of Kansas City-area leaders.
The most recent hurdle is Trump’s efforts to influence how American history is presented in government-funded museums.
A White House letter released Aug. 21 was titled “President Trump Is Right About The Smithsonian.”
An animation video about the diversity of disabled Latinos was listed for including “a disabled, plus-sized actress” and an “ambulatory wheelchair user” who “educates on their identity being Latinx, LGBTQ+, and disabled.”
It also criticized messaging about the Mexican-American War framed as “the North American invasion” that was “unprovoked and motivated by pro-slavery politicians.”
Trump also backed budget cuts to eliminate dedicated funds for a standalone Latino museum, possibly relegating it to being a center within the Smithsonian’s network of 21 museums.
The change has drawn bipartisan pushback, with groups representing both Democrats and Republicans continuing to press for a separate museum for Latinos.
In recent years, progress has been made to establish two new Smithsonian museums — one for the American Latino and another American Women’s History Museum.
The politicization of the Smithsonian’s holdings and messaging has made some aspects of the work tough in recent months, Zamanillo acknowledged.
“We need to make sure that we’re not a part of that,” Zamanillo said, “and make sure our stories are elevated and we have strong support.”
Museum staff spent several days in the Kansas City area meeting with teachers, civic leaders and community members.
Next steps will be to continue gathering stories, begin collecting artifacts, cataloging oral histories and shaping themes from the feedback.
Building interest is also deeply tied to fundraising. Small donations under $30 can be a part of charter member status.
A similar focus helped draw broad support for the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016.
Black veterans of the Civil War first proposed an African American museum in 1915. Congress approved construction of a memorial in 1929, but with the stipulation that private funds needed to be used. It took until 2003 before the museum was established as part of the Smithsonian by Congress.
In 2022, the Molina Family Latino Gallery opened within the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History. The gallery is a 4,500-square-foot space.
The far larger Latino museum is projected to cost more than $1 billion, partially based on what it cost to build the African American museum, Zamanillo said.
Half of that money will need to be raised through corporate grants, foundations and individual donors. Nearly $72 million has been raised in the last three years, Zamanillo said.
The other half can come through appropriations, he said.
Nearly 30 locations on and off the National Mall were researched as a possible location for the museum, Zamanillo said. Congressional approval is necessary to place the building on National Park Service property.
A preferred proposal would see it built in the Tidal Basin area, which is part of the National Mall and Memorial Parks.
 Nurturing bipartisan support for Latino history

Shortly after taking office, Trump issued an executive order dubbed Restoring Truth in American History.
The intention of the order was to “eliminate improper, divisive or anti-American ideology from the Smithsonian and its museums, education and research centers, and the National Zoo.”
Follow-up actions such as an Aug. 12 letter ordering a review of Smithsonian holdings, have drawn sharp criticism from archivists, historians and free-speech experts.
Many see it as an attempt to reframe the nation’s history to make it more palatable to Trump’s interpretation of patriotism and an appropriate framing for retelling the nation’s history ahead of the country’s 250th anniversary.
The fear of some is that significant events of American history will be downplayed or eliminated, such as civil rights struggles and periods of deep racial division.
Differing opinions on how history is displayed are endemic to curating.
For the nation’s Latinos, criticism has come in the past from conservative views that were displeased by an emphasis on socialism and portrayals of the community as victims.
Still, the Latino museum, even when it was a concept, has long enjoyed bipartisan support.
CiCi Rojas is board chair of the Friends of the National Museum of the American Latino, formed in 2005 to build support for the museum.
Rojas is president and co-founder of Tico Productions and Tico Sports, a multimedia marketing agency and a provider of Spanish language broadcasts of professional sports teams, including the Kansas City Chiefs and many other NFL teams.
“The campaign has always been rooted in bipartisanship,” Rojas said.
Rojas traces that support through the history of the museum.
In 2003, legislation to authorize a commission to study the feasibility of a Latino museum was introduced by then-U.S. Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Florida Republican, and Xavier Becerra, a California Democrat.
President George W. Bush signed the law creating the 23-member commission.
President Barack Obama was in office when the commission’s 136-page report was finalized in 2011.
Trump, during his first term, signed the National Museum of the American Latino Act, which authorized a new museum of the Smithsonian.
More recent examples of bipartisan support came in the form of letters to congressional appropriations committees.
In June, the Democrat-led Congressional Hispanic Caucus rejected a “scaled down” Latino center instead of a brick-and-mortar permanent Smithsonian building on the National Mall.
“Latinos make up nearly 20% of the U.S. population and have shaped every facet of our national story — from military service and labor rights to music, science, and art,” the letter reads. “A permanent, brick-and-mortar institution is the only appropriate way to recognize this legacy.”
The Republican-led Congressional Hispanic Conference letter also strongly urged funding for the separate museum, saying anything less is “unacceptable.”
The conference letter also called for proactive steps to ensure the Latino museum “remains unbiased.”
“This museum was authorized through the leadership of President Trump during his first term; now, under his renewed leadership, we have the opportunity to finish the job and deliver on this historic investment that will educate and inspire Americans for generations to come,” the conference letter said.
Combined, the bipartisan messaging is emblematic of the wide support the museum has long garnered, Rojas said.
“This idea to present a more complete story of U.S. history transcends politics and ideologies,” Rojas said. “We remain committed to seeing it through to fruition.”

(File photo from Getty Images)It may still be the dog days of August, but lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about December.
Specifically, I’ve been reflecting on one scene from the holiday classic “National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation.”
Toward the end of the movie, the final descent into chaos for the Griswold family Christmas occurs when Clark Griswold learns that his boss secretly decided to replace the annual employee Christmas bonus check with a year-long membership in the Jelly of the Month Club.
While Clark’s cousin memorably described that membership as the “gift that keeps on giving,” the ensuing meltdown from Clark is relatable to anyone that has ever received less than what was expected or promised — a situation far too many educators are navigating across South Carolina as schools return to session.
Back-to-school has been phenomenal in numerous classrooms statewide, including mine.
Like many of my teaching colleagues, I am blessed to have a remarkable school leadership team that worked diligently to ensure I had the resources and support necessary for a successful start to the year.
For a smaller, but not insignificant, number of teachers, the experience has been closer to the disappointment of the unfulfilled Griswold bonus check.
Expectations entering the year were elevated after the Legislature unanimously passed — and the governor signed — the Educator Assistance Act, a transformative piece of legislation to improve educator working conditions.
Among other things, the law provides teachers two “self-directed” work days to prepare for the arrival of students. Another provision requires schools to inform teachers of their “tentative assignment” no later than 14 days prior to the first day of classes.
The July 1, 2025, effective date of the new law admittedly created a tight window for implementation. However, according to a recent survey of Palmetto State Teachers Association members, roughly 10% of teachers statewide did not receive the required notice and approximately 1 in 5 did not receive the two start-of-year work days.
Policy implementation falling short of its promise has played out in similar fashion for other recently signed pro-educator laws.
For example, a 2022 law requires that elementary teachers receive at least 30 minutes of daily “unencumbered” time to address basic needs like eating and going to the restroom.
PSTA survey data to start this school year shows progress toward consistent implementation of the law, but instances persist across the state of non-compliance, or of compliance that falls well short of the spirit of the law (i.e. identifying the 30 minutes prior to student arrival as the required time).
Failures of policy implementation, which most directly impact affected teachers, should matter to anyone who cares about the caliber of educational opportunities and outcomes in our state.
Far too many students continue to attend schools with vacant teaching positions, and while policy actions like increased salaries are making a positive difference, research indicates that personnel is as important — if not more important — than policy in reducing teacher turnover.
A recent report from SC TEACHER found school and district leadership plays an outsized role when teachers decide to leave their schools.
For the 2023-24 school year, 37% of teacher departures were the result of teachers leaving their school, not the profession, a decision SC TEACHER attributes in part to a “lack (of) resources like administrative support.” Further research found “administrative support” as having “the strongest positive association with (teacher) job satisfaction.”
The work of SC TEACHER strongly indicates quality school leadership is likely the most important influence on teacher recruitment and retention. Other research consistently shows a quality classroom teacher to be the number one in-school influence on student achievement, making strong school leadership central to helping every student reach their full academic potential.
School and district leaders can take positive steps in this area through their own initiative by prioritizing educator wellness and support.
I have worked with and for numerous school administrators that have demonstrated how a “whatever-it-takes” approach to educator support can help teachers thrive, even in the face of poor policies.
South Carolina can expand the number of these educator-elevating school leaders through thoughtful policy actions.
Part of that work has to focus on leadership preparation, a process that the Department of Education is streamlining and strengthening through actions such as an in-progress update to the requirements for administrative certification.
Policymakers — and school personnel — also must find ways to reduce and eliminate non-essential demands on administrator time and energy in order to free school leaders to focus on working with and supporting educators and students.
One of the most accomplished school leaders in our state recently shared with me his frustration at not being able to do what he considers his core function — getting into classrooms to support the work of teachers and students — due to the deluge of bureaucratic paperwork and processes that keep him confined to his office.
After the Christmas bonus fiasco, Clark Griswold emphatically reminded his family that they were “all in this together.”
Elevating educator working conditions in South Carolina requires a similar all-hands-on-deck commitment.
But in this instance, the payoff in improved student outcomes truly is the gift that will keep on giving well into the future.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/frustrated-elementary-teacher-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-08-25 10:56:31.133920

Sandoval-Moshenberg, told the crowd. The crowd shouted “Shame!”Sandoval-Moshenberg added that the ICE officials would not answer questions about where Abrego Garcia would be detained. “The only reason that they've chosen to take him into detention is to punish him,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said outside the office.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement to States Newsroom that “ICE law enforcement arrested Kilmar Abrego Garcia and are processing him for deportation.”DHS said that ICE has placed Abrego Garcia in removal proceedings to Uganda, which has agreed to accept deportees from the United States.Abrego Garcia’s attorneys quickly filed a habeas corpus petition suit in a Maryland district court, where Judge Paula Xinis, who also ordered the Trump administration to return Abrego Garica after his wrongful deportation, has barred immigration officials from removing Abrego Garcia from the United States until 4 p.m. Eastern Wednesday. A habeas corpus petition allows immigrants to challenge their detention.Sandoval-Moshenberg said Abrego Garcia would accept refugee status that has been offered by Costa Rica’s government, but would not plead guilty to the charges. ‘I am free and have been reunited with my family’As Abrego Garcia walked into his ICE check-in with his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, he was greeted by cheers from hundreds of protesters. In Spanish, Abrego Garcia thanked those who attended.“I always want you to remember that today, I can say with pride, that I am free and have been reunited with my family,” he said. Immigrant rights activists from the advocacy group CASA shielded the family and the attorneys as they entered the field office.

Over the weekend, attorneys for Abrego Garcia’s criminal case in Nashville said in court filings that the Trump administration is trying to force the Maryland man to plead guilty to human smuggling charges by promising to remove him to Costa Rica if he does so, and threatening to deport him to Uganda if he refuses. Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty and was released Friday to await trial in January on charges he took part in a long-running conspiracy to smuggle immigrants without legal status across the United States. His attorneys received a letter from ICE that informed them of his pending deportation to Uganda and instructed him to report to the ICE facility in Baltimore for a check-in. Sandoval-Moshenberg said that Monday’s check-in with ICE was supposed to be an interview but ""clearly that was false.”Sandoval-Moshenberg said the new lawsuit was filed early Monday in the District Court for the District of Maryland challenging Abrego Garcia’s potential removal to the East African country, or any third country, while his immigration case is pending. “The fact that they're holding Costa Rica as a carrot and using Uganda as a stick to try to coerce him to plead guilty to a crime is such clear evidence that they're weaponizing the immigration system in a matter that is completely unconstitutional,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said. Trump mass deportations in spotlightThe Supreme Court in April ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia, who was unlawfully deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador, his home country.  An immigration judge had granted him removal protections in 2019 because it was likely he would face violence if returned. The case has put the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation tactics in the national spotlight as well as the White House’s clash with the judicial branch as the president aims to carry out his plans of mass deportation. On Friday, Abrego Garcia’s attorneys moved to dismiss the case against him because of the coordination from Homeland Security and the Justice Department to force a guilty plea from him. “There can be only one interpretation of these events,” the lawyers wrote. “The (Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security) and ICE are using their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego (Garcia) to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat.”Another judge in Maryland had earlier ruled that ICE must give Abrego Garcia 72 hours of notice before removing him to a third country.  Maryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who traveled to El Salvador to meet with Abrego Garcia while he was detained there, criticized the move by the Trump administration to re-deport him to Uganda. “The federal courts and public outcry forced the Administration to bring Ábrego García back to Maryland, but Trump’s cronies continue to lie about the facts in his case and they are engaged in a malicious abuse of power as they threaten to deport him to Uganda – to block his chance to defend himself against the new charges they brought,” he said in a Sunday statement. “As I told Kilmar and his wife Jennifer, we will stay in this fight for justice and due process because if his rights are denied, the rights of everyone else are put at risk.”

Maryland Democratic Rep. Glenn Ivey, who represents the district where Abrego Garcia’s family lives, attended Monday’s rally. He slammed the Trump administration for moving to again deport Abrego Garcia.“This started with a mistake,” he said. “They knew it was illegal. Instead of acknowledging it and bringing him back, they said, ‘We can’t bring him back.’ They lied.”The Trump administration repeatedly stated in court that because Abrego Garica was in El Salvador, he was no longer in U.S. custody and could not be brought back despite court orders.Wrongly deported in MarchAbrego Garcia was wrongly deported in March and returned to the U.S. in June to face the charges filed by the Justice Department in May.While Abrego Garica was at the notorious prison in El Salvador known as El Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, he detailed how he was beaten and psychologically tortured.Because of his 2019 deportation protections, the Trump administration either had to challenge the withholding of removal or deport Abrego Garcia to a third country that would accept him. His attorneys in the Tennessee case attached the agreement with the government of Costa Rica to accept Abrego Garcia’s removal in Saturday court filings. “The Government of Costa Rica intends to provide refugee status or residency to Mr. Abrego Garcia upon his transfer to Costa Rica,” according to the agreement. “The Government of Costa Rica assures the Government of the United States of America that, consistent with that lawful immigration status and Costa Rican law, it does not intend to detain Mr. Abrego Garcia upon his arrival in Costa Rica.”In that filing, the Trump administration late Thursday agreed to remove Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica if he remained in custody until Monday, pleaded guilty to the DOJ charges and served the sentence imposed.Selah Torralba, an advocacy manager for the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition, said at Monday’s rally outside the ICE facility that she pushed for Abrego Garcia’s release while he was detained in Tennessee.“After spending close to three months brutalized in a place that he should never have been sent to begin with, and another three months imprisoned in a state that is not his own, Kilmar was joyfully reunited with his family and children this weekend,” she said. “But it is impossible to celebrate that joy without acknowledging the cruel reality that our communities have known for far too long.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-08-25 10:56:31.133920

(Photo courtesy of Bellows for Maine)Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who is running for governor in 2026 as a Democrat, announced Monday that, if elected, she would introduce a bill to grant full tribal sovereignty to the Wabanaki Nations on day one.
This commitment comes after Gov. Janet Mills has so far rejected sweeping reform of that sort, instead opting to usher through piecemeal changes. This year, Mils vetoed the latest proposal after it passed the Legislature with bipartisan support. The bill  would have prevented the state from being able to seize tribal land for public use without consultation.  
Unlike the other 570 federally-recognized tribes in the U.S., the Wabanaki Nations — the Houlton Band of Maliseet, Mi’kmaq, Passamaquoddy and Penobscot — are treated more like municipalities than sovereign nations because of the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act. 
Tribal leaders have said that their tribes signed the Settlement Act to get fair compensation for stolen lands, not to give up the level of sovereignty that has been interpreted by the state and courts to date. 
“I’ve told the Chiefs, and I’m proud to say it publicly: it is long past time that we pass a tribal sovereignty bill in Maine and fulfill our legal obligations to the Wabanaki people,” Bellows said in a statement Monday. “When elected, I’ll work with the chiefs to draft legislation that they would be happy with and will introduce it as a governor’s bill on day one. This issue is not partisan and I hope that all of my opponents will join me in making this commitment.”
While Bellows is the first 2026 gubernatorial candidate to announce she’d make this aim a priority on day one, some other candidates are known champions of tribal sovereignty. 
Along with Bellows, Sen. Rick Bennett, a former Republican who left the party when launching his independent bid for governor, and former Senate President Troy Jackson, who is running for governor as a Democrat, have been recognized as tribal champions by the Wabanaki Alliance, a coalition formed to push for state recognition of tribal sovereignty, for their support of legislation toward that aim. 
Hannah Pingree, who most recently served as head of Mills’ Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, has commented publicly that she’d take a different approach to tribal sovereignty than Mills, instead pledging to work “more aggressively” on how the state collaborates with the Wabanaki Nations.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas House Speaker Dan Hawkins said the 2026 Legislature would strive to slash $200 million from the state government’s budget and seek to reduce expenditures on the Medicaid program delivering health care to low-income adults and children.
Hawkins, a Wichita Republican who has served 13 years in the Legislature, said during an interview at an American Legislative Exchange Council conference in Indianapolis that he was proud the 2025 Legislature took the lead in crafting the current state budget. Ahead of the 2025 session, a Republican-controlled committee of the House and Senate developed its own budget bill rather than wait for Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s recommendation, as traditionally presented to lawmakers in January.
Despite Republicans in the House and Senate operating with partisan supermajorities since Kelly’s election in 2018, Hawkins was critical in the interview of what he calculated to be a 60% rise in spending during Kelly’s seven years as governor.
In the past legislative session, Hawkins said, the House and Senate whittled down the state budget for 2025-2026 to more than $200 million below the amount it approved for 2024-2025.
“That first $200 million is probably the easy one to cut,” Hawkins said during the ALEC interview. “It starts getting harder every year after that. I think we’ll come in next year and we’ll probably cut about $200 million out of the budget.”
He said the Legislature’s decision to consolidate its grip on the budget process at the Capitol resulted in a bill that spent less than the amount sought by Kelly.
“The governor still says that we spend too much, but we cut $43 million,” Hawkins told his ALEC audience.
In response to an inquiry, Hawkins’ staff clarified the actual year-to-year cut by the Legislature was $38 million below spending proposed by Kelly. The Legislature did vote for $43 million in deletions, but some were vetoed by the governor. The Legislature chose not to override all of Kelly’s line-item vetoes. That left the overall cut at $38 million — not $43 million.
“Governor Kelly has always prioritized responsible fiscal management, and the results speak for themselves: fully funded schools, record-breaking economic development and historic investments in the state water plan,” said Will Lawrence, the governor’s chief of staff. “Speaker Hawkins can play with the numbers all he wants, but the reality is the financial path he advocates for is eating through the state’s ending balance and threatening to undo all the progress Kansas has made in the last seven years.”
Lawrence said cutting Medicaid would strain the state’s rural health system and endanger 443,000 Kansans who participate in the health program. Kelly has spent years advocating for expansion of eligibility for Medicaid in Kansas.
“Unserious, misinformed proposals like these are not what Kansans deserve, and I suggest Speaker Hawkins talk to Kansans about their priorities, not conservative think tank staffers,” Lawrence said.

Other perspectives
Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes and House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard, who lead Democrats in the Legislature, offered perspectives on Hawkins’ interview with Lars Dalseide, ALEC’s director of policy advancement and media relations.
Sykes said GOP legislative leadership’s overhaul of the budget process for the 2025 session served “to advance their priorities without regard for bipartisanship or public input.”
Democrats, for example, objected to the GOP-led Legislature’s deletion from the governor’s budget of $62 million for special education in public schools. Also cut was $10 million for the Kansas Blueprint for Literacy, a program to develop reading instructional skills among licensed teachers and college students preparing to become educators.
A core objective of Republican legislators has been to advance tax cuts most beneficial to wealthy Kansans, Sykes said.
“Fiscal responsibility is just a talking point to Republicans,” Sykes said. “Time and time again, they say they want to dig deeper into the budget, but the reality is they want to give away big tax breaks to their donors on the backs of working Kansans. Senate Democrats will continue to stand for true fiscal stability and not just partisan talking points.”
The Legislature is controlled by Republican supermajorities in the 125-member House and 40-member Senate. The two-thirds partisan advantage has meant the GOP could override any veto by Kelly. In the House, Republicans hold an 88-37 edge. The margin stands at 31-9 in the Senate.

The Medicaid issue
Hawkins, who is seeking the Republican Party’s 2026 nomination for state insurance commissioner, said the Legislature should strive during the upcoming session in Topeka to reduce spending on Medicaid.
He said there were opportunities for the Legislature to restrict expenditures by getting rid of inefficiencies.
“Just like we’ve seen on the federal level, Medicaid has lots of opportunity,” Hawkins said. “I think that when we really start looking, we’ll find some duplicative efforts.”
Woodard, who has urged the Legislature to broaden eligibility for Medicaid to more lower-income adults, said the House speaker’s plan to reduce health services for children, pregnant women, people with disabilities and the elderly was misguided.
“At a time when Kansans are struggling to make ends meet, Republicans are threatening to further cut Medicaid at the expense of our most vulnerable Kansans,” he said.
Sen. Patrick Schmidt, a Topeka Democrat who served on the Senate’s government efficiency committee, said attempts to undermine Medicaid in the quest for efficiencies jeopardized the well-being of thousands of adults and children in Kansas. Claims of widespread inefficiency within Medicaid have been exaggerated, he said.
“When they say those words, they’re just lying,” he said. “Medicaid helps people get back to work.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4100235-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-25 10:56:31.133920

(John Moore/Getty Images)Summer heat is bearing down on U.S. prisons, where temperatures in uncooled cells can climb well into the triple digits.
Facing growing pressure from advocacy groups, lawsuits and climate projections that show hotter days ahead, some state prison systems are moving to install air conditioning and expand cooling measures — though many facilities remain years away from significant upgrades.
But in other states, such efforts have stalled or failed. That may lead to more lawsuits in the future, experts say, even as judges may raise the bar for such cases.
An emphasis on being “tough on crime” and prioritizing other public safety measures may have contributed to less attention on prison conditions in some states. In others, slowing revenue growth and pressure to rein in corrections spending could be making new investments a harder sell.
At least two states this year, Virginia and Texas, considered legislation addressing excessive heat in prisons but neither measure became law. The Texas bill would have required the state Department of Criminal Justice to purchase and install climate control systems in all of its facilities by the end of 2032. About two-thirds of the state’s correctional facilities have only partial or no air conditioning.
The measure passed the House but did not advance in the Senate before the legislature adjourned in June.
In Virginia, lawmakers approved a bill that would have required the state corrections department to install heat and air conditioning in its prisons and to ensure cell temperatures not exceed 80 degrees. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed it, citing the cost of installation and operational burdens. Youngkin also wrote that existing state corrections data “does not substantiate the claims of extreme temperatures or health risks.”
But in Delaware, the fiscal year 2026 capital budget approved last month includes $2 million in funding to install air conditioning at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center.
These changes mark the latest actions in a long-running debate over how correctional systems respond to rising summer temperatures — an issue that affects both incarcerated people and staff. Some of the policy debates and facility updates this year follow years of advocacy and litigation over the health, safety and operational challenges posed by heat in correctional settings.
The problem of excessive heat in prisons has persisted for decades and has unfolded alongside other challenges, including chronic understaffing and overcrowding. In some cases, these problems have led to extended facility lockdowns, even during the summer months.
“There are people working in prisons and they have the right to work in climates that are comfortable,” said Nancy La Vigne, a criminal justice researcher and dean of the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University. “When they’re not, there’s retention issues, and it’s hard to replace staff. And when you don’t replace staff, then you have challenges in maintaining the safety and security of the facility.”
In New York, for example, correctional officers staged a three-week strike earlier this year and many didn’t return to work. Some facilities now are operating with 30%-60% fewer guards than needed, resulting in some incarcerated people getting only an hour or two outside of their cells each day.
A 2023 study published in the peer-reviewed PLOS One journal found that mortality in state and private prisons rose during periods of extreme heat, with deaths increasing 3.5% on extreme heat days and up to 7.4% during three-day heat waves. Between 2001 and 2019, nearly 13,000 people died in prison during the summer months, almost half of them in the South, though the study did not determine how many of those deaths were directly attributable to heat.
Climate change is fueling longer, more intense periods of extreme heat. Exposure to extreme heat can worsen conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and asthma, and has also been linked to worsening mental health and higher suicide rates among incarcerated people.
“Average temperatures are rising, and you’re going to have more and more states around the country where incarcerated people are held in conditions that are not livable because they’re too hot,” said Sharon Dolovich, a law professor and director of the Prison Law and Policy Program at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Some upgrades
At least 44 states lack universal air conditioning within their prison facilities, even in regions known for sweltering summer temperatures, according to a 2022 USA Today analysis. A recent Reuters investigation also found that nearly half of state prisons across 29 states have partial or no air conditioning in housing units.
But some states are investing millions to update their prison facilities.
In North Carolina, corrections officials are working toward their goal of installing air conditioning in all 54 state prisons by 2026. To date, 33 facilities are fully air-conditioned, 17 are partially air-conditioned, and four have no air conditioning, according to its dashboard.
In California, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, which operates 31 adult prisons, has spent $246 million in the past five years on cooling improvements at five prisons, according to a department spokesperson.
Lawmakers this year also approved funding for the Air Cooling Pilot Program at three facilities, with $17.6 million allocated for fiscal years 2025-26 and $20 million for fiscal years 2026-27. It will evaluate the effectiveness of two alternatives prior to a statewide plan to address high indoor temperatures across the California prison system.
State prisons turn to extended lockdowns amid staffing shortages, overcrowding

The Texas Department of Criminal Justice, as of Aug. 1, is building 12,827 “cool beds,” or prison cells in air-conditioned units, and is in the process of procuring an additional 7,162, according to its dashboard.
Texas is one of the states most closely associated with heat-related deaths in prison. A 2022 study estimated that, on average, 14 deaths per year in Texas prisons are associated with heat. And a Texas Tribune analysis found that at least 41 incarcerated people died during a record-breaking heat wave in 2023.
In March, a federal judge ruled the extreme heat in Texas prisons is “plainly unconstitutional,” but declined to order immediate air conditioning, saying the work could not be completed within the court order’s 90-day window and temporary systems might delay a permanent fix.
‘More miserable’
Sweltering summer heat can turn prisons into pressure cookers. People inside already may have health conditions, limited access to cooling, or take medications that make it harder for their bodies to handle the heat. And research suggests that high temperatures can heighten irritability and aggression, sometimes fueling more conflicts between incarcerated people or with staff.
“It makes you more miserable. … If you to the point of even thinking about suicide, that’s just going to add to it,” said Ronald McKeithen, who spent 37 years incarcerated in Alabama prisons and is now the director of second chances at the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice. McKeithen recalls feeling “on edge” due to tension among other incarcerated people on hot days.
At the Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin, Devin Skrzypchak said the heat worsens his bladder condition, and he often can’t get the incontinence briefs he needs. The heat forces him to drink more water, and on days when ice isn’t available, he’s left drenched in sweat.
“At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating,” Skrzypchak wrote in a message to Stateline through the facility’s messaging platform.
D’Angelo Lee Komanekin — who has spent about 25 years in and out of different Wisconsin corrections facilities — said prison architecture plays a major role in why temperatures inside climb so high.
“The planet is getting hotter and hotter,” said Komanekin, who relies on a small plastic fan to stay cool. Komanekin also is incarcerated at the Oshkosh Correctional Institution. “They’re doing nothing about the architecture. Some institutions’ windows open, some don’t, but most of the doors have steel doors with trap doors.”
Older prison designs that rely heavily on steel and concrete building materials often trap heat, making it difficult to keep temperatures down in the summer. Aging facilities also are less likely to be equipped for the installation of central air conditioning.
Some state prison systems, including Alabama’s and Wisconsin’s, are adding air-conditioning or air-tempering systems to new prison construction and major renovation projects.
Future legal battles
Legal experts say the issue of excessive heat in prisons is likely to become more pressing as climate change drives longer and hotter summers.
Extreme heat in correctional facilities has already been the subject of litigation in dozens of states, with plaintiffs arguing that high temperatures constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Court rulings in these cases have varied, but some experts say even more lawsuits are likely if facilities do not adapt.
“The conditions are going to worsen. [Incarcerated people are] going to be looking for every possible avenue for assistance they can,” Dolovich, the UCLA law professor, told Stateline.
Prison abuse, deaths and escapes prompt calls for more oversight

One of the latest cases comes from Missouri, where the nonprofit law firm MacArthur Justice Center filed a class-action lawsuit in May on behalf of six incarcerated people at Algoa Correctional Center.
The lawsuit alleges that the conditions violate their constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment. It seeks to require the Missouri Department of Corrections to work with experts to develop a heat mitigation plan that keeps housing unit temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees. If the department cannot meet that standard, the plaintiffs are asking for the release of three of the incarcerated people who have less than a year remaining on their sentences.
Lawsuits such as the Missouri case often focus on claims that extreme heat worsens existing medical problems. To proceed, they must meet two legal requirements: proving the heat poses a serious health or safety risk, and showing prison officials knew about the danger but failed to address it, according to Dolovich, whose work has focused on the Eighth Amendment and prison conditions.
Courts may also raise the bar for proving such claims if judges echo decisions in cases with similar Eight Amendment arguments related to the death penalty and homelessness, Dolovich said. Judges have shifted, she said, toward a “superadding terror, pain and disgrace” standard under the Eighth Amendment — a higher threshold requiring proof that conditions were created with the intent to cause unnecessary suffering.
Dolovich added that some recent court decisions have provided only narrow remedies, such as ordering ice and fans instead of installing air conditioning.
“Prison officials have a moral and a constitutional responsibility to respond to changing conditions. In this case, it means air conditioning. … Anything less than that, to me, is indefensible.” she said.

I’m CalMatters reporter Mikhail Zinshteyn, and I’m subbing for Lynn La today.
Bills to regulate artificial intelligence tools in the workplace must clear a legislative hurdle that frequently fells expensive or politically dicey legislation.As Khari Johnson reports for CalMatters, more than a half-dozen AI-themed bills are on the suspense file in the Legislature. For them to ultimately head to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk, they must first withstand the scrutiny of the all-powerful committees on appropriations in the Assembly and Senate through an opaque process.
A key measure, Senate Bill 7, would require employers to give workers a heads up of 30 days before they use AI-backed tools to decide on matters such as compensation, hiring, firing and promotions. Workers would have the right to appeal those AI-powered decisions. Employers would not be permitted to use AI to make employee predictions based on their immigration status, psychological fate and other factors. An appropriations committee analysis said that the state would spend around $600,000 annually making sure private businesses comply.Another, Assembly Bill 1018, would give people 30 days to appeal the decisions of automated systems about employment, education, housing, health care, financial services, and parts of the criminal justice system. Costs to state agencies to comply with the bill would reach hundreds of millions of dollars, an appropriations committee analysis said. The bill’s author said she found that finding surprising.Nearly 80 groups and businesses, including hospitals, oppose AB 1018.

Veena Dubal, a researcher and critic of AI said California lawmakers should still pass these bills: “As much as Gov. Newsom wants to juxtapose himself against Donald Trump and California wants to be a sort of savior to the rest of the nation in this moment of extreme right authoritarian actions,” she said, “it’s really important that the state not continue to concede to big tech companies who are very much in bed with the president.”

DEI bans versus private donations

Private scholarships meant for Black students or other marginalized groups generally must adhere to their goal of helping people from those backgrounds, even in the face of the Trump administration’s efforts to target programs with a racial or ethnic focus.
That’s according to a 10-page advisory published Friday by California Attorney General Rob Bonta and nine other attorneys general. 

From a statement released with the letter: “The coalition issued the guidance in response to the Trump administration’s continued and deliberate efforts to rollback equity-centered programs and support systems designed to uplift historically marginalized groups.”

The letter contends that the arguments in the 2023 Supreme Court ruling banning race-based affirmative action “do not apply, or are of limited relevance, to privately funded trusts and charitable entities.” 
Trustees executing a donor’s scholarship have a legal obligation to honor the intent of the donor. If an existing law challenges a university’s ability to carry out that scholarship, the campus could consider transferring the award to an institution that can. 
Campuses or scholarship trustees could also slightly change the method of targeting the intended community by basing eligibility on geography, language spoken, students’ ability to overcome adversity given their background and other factors. (The Justice Department wrote in July that such proxies are “unlawful” at campuses.)
The state attorneys general say in their letter that they and the courts have a role in determining whether the intent of the private scholarship can be altered. 



 A new effort to save NIH grants at UCLA

On Tuesday lawyers for researchers at the University of California will attempt to persuade a federal judge in California to save National Institutes of Health grants at UCLA from being defunded.The stakes are high: Last week the U.S. Supreme Court opened the door for those grants to again be terminated, overturning lower court rulings. That decision encompasses hundreds of grants worth around $800 million across the country, including in California. Meanwhile, the Trump administration suspended 500 National Institutes of Health grants at UCLA late last month.
But lawyers for the UC researchers have succeeded in restoring some funding. In June, Rita Lin, the judge overseeing Tuesday’s hearing, ordered the National Science Foundation to restore 114 grants to UC professors across the system. Lawyers for the researchers also successfully argued in early August that Lin’s preliminary injunction applies to the 300 National Science Foundation grants the Trump administration suspended at UCLA.Now those lawyers are trying to argue that Lin’s June order should apply to the suspended health science grants and Tuesday’s oral hearing is the first step toward that possible outcome. Lawyers for the Trump administration plan to argue against the move.

Details of services
A memorial service will be held at the Cathedral Church of Saint Paul, 2 Cherry Street, Burlington, Vt., on October 11, 2025, at 2 p.m. For those in attendance, we encourage you to wear clothing in the bright blues and greens and purples that Debby loved.
Arrangements are in the care of Ready Funeral and Cremation Services. To send online condolences, please visit cremationsocietycc.com.

Deborah Butterfield Galbraith, of Shelburne, Vt., died in her residence at Wake Robin on August 16, 2025. Born in the Germantown section of Philadelphia, Penn., in 1939 to Right Reverend Harvey Dean Butterfield and Carolyn Whitney Butterfield, she moved with her parents and older brother, Whit, back to her parents’ home state of Vermont when her father was appointed to the Episcopal parish in Rutland. She finished high school in Burlington, Vt., where her father was made dean of Saint Paul’s Episcopal Church (now Cathedral) and then elected as the sixth bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Vermont, while her mother served the community of Burlington through organizations such as the Lund Home.
Deborah met her beloved husband, Peter Dugald Galbraith, when they were students at Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva, N.Y. They were married at Rock Point in Vermont in 1961. After a stint living in Queens, N.Y., they returned to Burlington, Vt., before spending four years in Philadelphia, Penn. Through the course of their marriage, they made homes for their family in Vermont, Pennsylvania, western New York and Connecticut, with their compass always pointing to a return to their cherished Vermont.
Debby Galbraith (Nana) is survived by her husband and their three children, Gretchen, Michael and Kevin, and by her treasured children-in-law and grandchildren. Gretchen and her spouse Peter Anderson’s children include Alexander Romero Galbraith, Chris Anderson, and Danni Anderson and their husband, Aaron. Michael and his wife Marthe Galbraith’s children are Marlowe and Willoughby Galbraith. Kevin and his wife Elizabeth Bracken’s children are Brooks, Sasha and Vivienne Galbraith. Deborah is also survived by her dear brother, Whitney Butterfield; his wife, Joyce; their children, Chris, Steve, David and Andrea; their spouses and children; and by cousins in the Butterfield and Whitney branches of her family.
In the 1970s, Deborah decided to follow her dream of becoming a nurse, earning her degree at the University of Vermont and holding positions at Mercy Hospital in Buffalo, N.Y., and Hartford Hospital in Connecticut. While she was reluctantly pulled into administrative roles, her calling was for working directly with patients; she especially loved working with mothers and their newborns. Deborah and Peter returned to Vermont in the early 1990s, when Peter took up the role of State Epidemiologist. Deborah served as nurse for the Lund residential program before retiring. In retirement, she worked extensively with successive waves of refugees to Chittenden County, beginning with the young Sudanese men who arrived in the early 2000s, and made a deep impact on so many Vermonters. Her retirement years also included deep engagement with the Cathedral Church of Saint Paul community and choir; the 125-year-old Fortnightly book club to which her mother and aunt had belonged; knitting colorful hats and socks; adventures in camping, hiking and kayaking with her extended family; and entertaining and traveling to see her grandchildren.
Debby’s family is deeply grateful for the care, professionalism and empathy of the staff at Wake Robin and Bayada Hospice team. In honor of her loving, empathetic and more than slightly impish spirit, the family encourages you to plan an adventure with loved ones (preferably including good food) and love each other fiercely. Please consider donations to an organization that supports refugees or maternal and child health or to Rock Point Commons in lieu of flowers.

Michael Barnes
Michael Barnes is a former member of the Albany City Council.


Re: “Why building more homes near transit will transform lives across California“
As a former city council member, much of the commentary surrounding Senate Bill 79 can be exasperating. SB 79 seems to be based on little more than drawing circles around transit stops. This is not planning.
The Legislature already requires local jurisdictions to plan and zone for far more housing through the Regional Housing Needs Assessment, or RHNA (pronounced ree-nah). Along with state reviewers, California’s 540 local jurisdictions have spent countless dollars on RHNA over the years.
SB 79 throws a wrench into the process.
The goal of upzoning should be to shape development so that taller apartments are built alongtransit corridors. This increase in density creates more foot traffic on the street, allowing shops and restaurants to thrive. It also increases the number of commuters who can easily be served by transit.
Too much upzoning, like that proposed by SB 79, will allow developers to spread out buildings over a wide area, randomly dotting the landscape with expensive apartment towers. This does nothing to bring about the benefits of urban density.
Both chairs of the Senate Housing Committee, Democrat Aisha Wahab and Republican Kelly Seyarto, have consistently voted against SB 79. Other legislators should follow their example.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/051019_Light-Rail-Train_BANG_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-25 08:57:05.708059

Several bills in the California Legislature would regulate how companies use AI to make employment decisions such as compensation, hiring, firing, or promotions, but they may be in jeopardy because of their associated costs.


Committees in both houses of the California Legislature will decide this week whether more than half a dozen bills that seek to protect people from AI will move on to final votes. 
One closely watched bill before the Assembly appropriations committee, Senate Bill 7, would require employers to give workers 30 days notice before they use AI to make decisions related to employment such as compensation, hiring, firing, or promotions. It would also give workers the right to appeal decisions made by AI and prevent employers from making predictions about a worker related to their immigration status, ancestral history, health, or psychological state.
A recent audit of algorithmic management tools sold to companies suggests that many use AI to determine pay,  a trend that started among gig workers nearly a decade ago that researchers say is now becoming widespread. Tests have found that AI that sifts through resumes can disqualify or downgrade a job applicant for arbitrary reasons like race or sex or because they’re wearing glasses. Inferences based on brain data, which can reveal a person’s health or the words or images they form in their mind, would also be prohibited under the legislation, which will be considered in a hearing scheduled for Friday, Aug. 29.
SB 7 is one of a trio of bills supported by the California Federation of Labor Unions, AFL-CIO, this year that attempt to regulate automated systems in the workplace. The federation represents more than two million workers statewide and made more than $2.1 million in political donations to Assembly and Senate members last year, according to the CalMatters Digital Democracy database. 
The other two bills, Assembly Bill 1331 and AB 1221 both involve regulating workplace surveillance. 
Federation president Lorena Gonzalez told CalMatters that employers shouldn’t be allowed to predict if you’re pregnant or what you think about your employer or boss and use that information against you.“We have to set up guardrails against every kind of surveillance and AI tool to ensure that workers have the privacy and respect and autonomy that they deserve,” said Gonzalez, who continues to work with labor unions in other states to prevent AI from harming frontline workers.
A race to use AI?
Sen. Jerry McNerney, the bill’s author, said there seems to be a race to use AI to displace workers or squeeze more efficiency out of them. 
The Stockton Democrat told the audience at a CalMatters event last month in San Francisco that “there’s tremendous opportunity for productivity, for making people more comfortable and safe, but your imagination can run wild with what can go wrong here.”
In response to questions about criticism that SB 7 will drive costs up, McNerney told CalMatters in a statement that he plans to introduce amendments that will substantially reduce the cost of implementing the bill, including the elimination of a process for workers to appeal decisions made by AI, a major point of contention for business groups like the California Chamber of Commerce.
SB 7 is one of a number of bills on what is known as the suspense calendar. Each year, hundreds of bills with a price tag above $50,000 are added to the calendar. Appropriation committees in the Assembly and Senate then have the power to designate some bills as too expensive or otherwise use cost to justify holding or effectively killing the legislation. Roughly two out of three bills make it from the suspense calendar to a final vote on the floor of the California Assembly or Senate, but the fact that this process happens with little debate and out of public view has led some to call it undemocratic and corrupt.
Making sure private companies comply with SB 7 could cost the state $600,000 or more, according to an assembly appropriations committee staff analysis released last week. But the cost for the state’s own agencies to comply is unknown, because the state doesn’t know how many automated employment systems it uses. Earlier this year the California Department of Technology allowed state agencies to self report use of  high-risk automated systems like those used in employment. Nearly 200 state agencies reported no use of such technology despite the fact that state agencies are currently using or have used high risk automated systems in the past.
Cost barrier 
The cost of compliance or enforcement has stalled AI employment regulation before. Last month, the California Privacy Protection Agency bowed to pressure by lawmakers, business groups, and Governor Newsom and voted to weaken its own automated decisionmaking technology rules.
In the other chamber of the California Legislature, the California Senate Appropriations Committee is preparing to decide the fate of another bill, Assembly Bill 1018, which would require testing before use of automated systems that make consequential decisions about employment, education, housing, health care, financial services, and parts of the criminal justice system. That bill would give people the right to appeal an automated decision within 30 days. An analysis by committee staff found that if the bill passes it could cost local agencies, state agencies, and the state judiciary branch hundreds of millions of dollars.
In a statement shared with CalMatters, Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan said she has no plan to make amendments to the draft bill but that she’s committed to bringing down costs wherever it makes sense to do so. 
“I will admit to being surprised by the Senate Appropriations estimates, considering CalMatters’ prior reporting that automated decision-making systems use was not widespread at the state level. So I’m working to better understand the cost estimates so I can respond to them appropriately,” she said.
Last year a similar version of the bill was pulled by Bauer-Kahan, a Democrat from San Ramon, after amendments limited its provisions to assessing employment. That bill attracted opposition from big tech companies but also a range of nearly 100 companies including Blue Shield of California, dating app company Bumble, biotech company Genentech, and pharmaceutical company Pfizer.
Nearly 80 businesses or groups oppose the bill, including the California Hospital Association and major health care providers like Kaiser Permanente. The advocacy group California Life Sciences argues that passage could lead providers to pass on higher costs to patients, while the California Credit Union League argues that compliance with the bill will slow innovation, an outcome that led Governor Newsom to veto a major piece of AI legislation last year.
Both bills were authored by California lawmakers with extensive histories of regulating AI. McNerney previously served as co-chair of an AI subcommittee in Congress. As chair of the assembly privacy and consumer protection committee, Bauer-Kahan is one of the most powerful regulators of AI in California, and was one of the first lawmakers nationwide who attempted to enshrine the Biden administration’s AI Bill of Rights into state law.
Partly because of the price tag for businesses that deploy AI, the California Privacy Protection Agency acted against the wishes of unions, digital rights, and privacy groups and voted last month to weaken its own draft rules to regulate how businesses use automated decisionmaking technology. Conversely, the California Civil Rights Department finalized rules to protect workers from automated discrimination during recruitment, hiring, and promotion processes. Those rules go into effect in October. The principle that people deserve the right to know when AI makes an important decision about their lives and to appeal if they think AI got it wrong were popularized by Biden’s AI Bill of Rights.
Survey reveals concerns
A survey of 1,400 California adults released this week by TechEquity, a supporter of AB 1018, found that more people are concerned than excited about AI; that nearly six in 10 believe the benefits of AI will accrue to the wealthy instead of the middle class; and that 70 percent want the government to adopt laws to protect people from harm.
Peter Leroe-Muñoz, general counsel for the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, a business organization with members like Apple, Google, and Microsoft, said the group supports responsible AI innovation. Still, he added, the costs of audits, training, staffing, disclosures, data retention, and potential lawsuits may ultimately undermine a lot of the services that businesses provide today at a reasonable cost.
“That becomes an additional financial burden in this more uncertain time that really becomes a drag on innovation, a higher cost not only for businesses and consumers but counties and other local municipal governments,” he said.
Passing bills that force employees to notify workers if they use AI to determine things like compensation is a critical first step, said Veena Dubal, a coauthor of the study released last week and an outspoken critic of AI that harms workers to enrich tech companies. Because people don’t know this tech is in use today, she hopes that notifying people increases public knowledge, and that leads to a ban of algorithms that determine how much people get paid.
To those who say the cost of implementing these bills is too high, she warns that algorithms are already influencing how much money people make, and that cost gets passed down to taxpayers. Algorithms can also locate union organizers, automate discrimination, or terminate people who managers decide they don’t like.
“These all have extraneous costs on society, extraordinary costs,” she said. “Workers, voters, taxpayers, we should all have a say in the kind of world that these companies are creating with the disproportionate power that they hold.”
If these bills don’t pass, Dubal said, it’s a signal that AI regulation has stalled in California. 
“As much as Gov. Newsom wants to juxtapose himself against Donald Trump and California wants to be a sort of savior to the rest of the nation in this moment of extreme right authoritarian actions,” Dubal said, “it’s really important that the state not continue to concede to big tech companies who are very much in bed with the president.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Capitol-Assembly-File-MG-23-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-25 08:57:05.708059

A New Mexico Environment Department air quality monitoring station in Carlsbad recorded ozone levels that could lead to the region being declared an ozone nonattainment zone by the EPA. The air pollution comes from oil and gas operations in the area. (Photo by Jerry Redfern / Capital & Main)A recent report on oil and gas production in the San Juan Basin in northwest New Mexico projects mixed futures for the fossil fuel industry over the coming 30 years. The report, commissioned by the Bureau of Land Management’s field office in Farmington, also says that up to 1,200 new oil and gas wells could be drilled in the region over that time frame. The report’s production numbers are a far cry from recent peaks, and well below the expectations of earlier reports for the region.
The Bureau released the “Reasonably Foreseeable Development Scenario” in mid-July for New Mexico’s second, smaller oil and gas basin. (The Permian Basin, in the opposite, southeast corner of the state, is both New Mexico’s and the nation’s largest.) The base outlook for the two fuels differ, with natural gas production continuing its current, years-long decline, while oil production rises slightly over the next 20 years before tanking.
Both scenarios are based on current production levels, and the report does not predict dramatic increases, mainly because there isn’t much left to produce.

This story originally appeared on Capital & Main.

 
“Analysis indicates the past major gas plays are mostly depleted … Any recent activity and projected future work are considered maintenance of existing resources,” the report reads.
Even so, up to 500 new gas wells could be drilled over the next 30 years, mostly on land just west of the Jicarilla Apache Nation Indian Reservation along New Mexico’s border with Colorado. But that gas will not stop the overall production decline in the region, according to the report.
Allison Sandoval, a spokesperson for the Bureau of Land Management, said that “Reasonably Foreseeable Development Scenario” reports are not mandatory, but are usually issued on a 20-year cycle. The last version was in 2018, meaning this year’s edition came much sooner than is customary. The 2018 report took into account advances in horizontal drilling — also known as fracking — that spiked in preceding years and weren’t factored into an earlier 2001 iteration. Fracking changed how wells were drilled, increased the number drilled on a single site and dramatically increased how much oil and gas could be produced from a single well.
Though only seven years apart, the 2025 report differs sharply from the earlier version in terms of expected well drilling. The older report predicted 3,200 new oil and gas wells in the Bureau’s Farmington Division area over 30 years in its baseline scenario. Records from the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division, which tracks all oil and gas development across the state, show 319 wells drilled from 2018 to the present. Adding that number to the latest report’s expected 1,200 new wells brings the total to 1,519 wells, less than half the number predicted seven years ago.
The 2025 report also notes that actual gas production in the previous seven years was nearly twice what was predicted in the 2018 report, and produced water was massively larger, with 5 million barrels projected but 172 million barrels actually produced. Produced water is a growing problem in New Mexico, spurring clashes between well operators and local residents over what to do with the briny and often chemically toxic waste water.
The bureau contracted Thomas Engler, a professor of natural gas and petroleum engineering at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in Socorro, New Mexico, to compile the report, and he said it is the result of a year’s work.
Engler said there is a possibility for gas production to quickly increase in the short term. “Many factors must align for this to occur, but it does illustrate the strength of the basin remains in gas production,” he said. For such an increase to happen, gas prices would have to rise sharply and producers would have to drill a lot of wells in a short timeframe. Natural gas prices have fallen since President Donald Trump began his second term, however, after rising under President Joe Biden. Gas prices were historically low during Trump’s first term as well.
“The increase in oil production predicted in this report is minor,” Engler said. An uptick in drilling in the so-called checkerboard region of federal, private and Navajo trust land just north of Chaco Culture National Park could add 700 new wells and provide slow growth over the next two decades. The report sees “declining oil production from all other sources.”
Engler said, “This is not surprising as the San Juan Basin has always been known more as a gas-bearing basin than oil.”
The report says the new oil production near Chaco Park would be “infill” that targets spaces between current wells rather than new development on untouched acreage. That detail is important because the park and much of the surrounding landscape is sacred to the Navajo and other surrounding Native American tribes.
Current New Mexico gubernatorial candidate Deb Haaland, a member of the neighboring Laguna Pueblo tribe, instituted a ban on oil or gas development within a 10-mile buffer zone around the park in 2023 when she was secretary of the Department of the Interior. Many Navajo own land in the surrounding checkerboard region and receive royalties from oil and gas produced on their property. That has led to protesters converging on the highly contentious location in the past, with local Navajo people both strongly for and against the buffer zone or any industrial development in the area.
For years, Mario Atencio(who is Diné, as the Navajo call themselves) has led efforts against further oil and gas development on tribal lands around Chaco Park. His family has land near the park, and in 2019, an accident at a neighboring well dumped 1,400 barrels of fracking chemicals and crude oil into a stream that runs across their property. “The entire landscape is a highly sacred place and is where the Diné, as a people, emerged spiritually, culturally and socially,” he said.
“The decades of development have left a legacy of toxic waste,” Atencio said. “These waste streams, like the spilling of the toxic oil drilling aqueous waste on my family’s lands, will have long-term impacts on the health and wellness of current and future generations.”
This legacy is a reflection of “how settler-colonialism transforms landscapes from sacred motherscapes to industrialized wastelands,” he said.
Mike Eisenfeld, energy and climate program manager for the San Juan Citizens Alliance, a regional environmental watchdog group, said the report reflects “a very poor future for oil and gas in this area.” Eisenfeld, who lives in Farmington, has argued for years that the oil and gas industry in the region was destined for decline and that local governments and the Bureau of Land Management should plan for that change.
Missi Courrier, president and CEO of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, the state’s largest industry group, noted the state’s overall energy dominance and said, “Markets change, industries evolve, and operators respond constantly to those changing demands. The report offers a point of reference, but it’s not a definitive roadmap.”
Sandoval, the Bureau of Land Management spokesperson, said this latest report was launched after the Farmington field office scrapped an update to a long-range Resource Management Plan in December 2023 that had been 10 years in the works. That plan would have directed how the Farmington district office planned and managed oil and gas development on lands under its control. Scrapping that plan left both environmental and industry groups confused and angry with the bureau after years of public hearings, comments and legal wrangling — all of which was thrown out the window.
“It’s incumbent on the BLM to figure out what they’re doing,” Eisenfeld said. After years of promoting fossil fuel development in the area, it appears that the regional focus of the Bureau of Land Management will be shifting — but without the Resource Management Plan, it’s not clear how. “I would argue they are in a reclamation mode,” he said, and he thinks the big question will become, “How do you reclaim the landscape” after more than a century of fossil fuel development?
Atencio offered a curt assessment.
“Drilling in a landscape that already has leased over 90% of reasonably saleable fluid and gas minerals is an incredibly dumb investment idea,” he said. “The big multinational operators have all pulled up stakes in the San Juan Basin. They are smart and this new [‘Reasonably Foreseeable Development Scenario’] is clear that the San Juan Basin, as a carbon energy sacrifice zone, is coming to an end.”

Catherine Cortez Masto. (Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)An estimated 131,000 Nevadans could lose food and nutrition benefits under the recently-passed “One Big Beautiful Bill,” leaving struggling food banks to cover the growing need. 
President Trump’s tax and spending bill made significant changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), including shifting more of the cost burden to states while also changing eligibility requirements for beneficiaries.
Those changes have left the state with a projected $19 million budget shortfall for the program next year. The state is already $244,000 short this year after the bill required states to pay for immediate access to a federal income verification system that was previously free to use. 
“Instead of giving more resources to the states so they can shoulder that burden, it actually takes resources away from states. While states figure out how to close that gap, organizations like Three Square are left with really too much uncertainty, and that is the problem,” said Nevada Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto during an event at Three Square of Southern Nevada Friday.
The food bank has experienced an 8% year-over-year increase in food assistance requests, with a more substantial rise observed in the past month.
Beth Martino, president and CEO of Three Square, said while the food bank is working to meet that demand it can not replace the assistance SNAP provides families. 
“SNAP is the most effective hunger relief program that we have in Nevada and around the country. The work that Three Square does to put food on people’s table is incredibly important, but for every meal that three square distributes, SNAP provides nine,” Martino said. 
Every month SNAP provides food assistance to around 505,000 Nevadans — 15.5% of the total population. Nevada has one of the highest participation rates in the nation, but those who need the benefits may soon be pushed out.
Under the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” the federal government is also expanding work requirements to qualify for SNAP assistance. Able-bodied adults ages 18-64 (previously 18-54) must now work or participate in job training for 80 hours each month. 
Several groups that were previously exempt from those work requirements are no longer exempt, including parents with children 14 and older, veterans, those who have aged out of foster care, people experiencing homelessness, and those living in areas with limited job openings. 
“This law makes devastating cuts to food assistance across the country, and right here in Nevada,” Cortez Masto said, noting that nationwide “it could lead to 40 million Americans, including 16 million children, 8 million seniors, and 1.2 million veterans across our country losing access to food.” 
Cortez Masto emphasized that fewer children in Nevada will be automatically eligible for free school meals as families lose SNAP and Medicaid benefits under the Republican tax and spending bill.
“These changes to SNAP could make thousands of Nevada kids ineligible for free school lunches that they rely on during the school year,” she said. 
The Just One Project in Nevada works with state officials and nonprofits to help people maintain their SNAP benefits through case management. Brooke Neubauer, CEO of The Just One Project, said they served more than 300,000 clients in 2024 and expect to serve more. 
“The enrollment is going to become more challenging and the reenrollment process is going to be more challenging with the new requirements,” Neubauer said. “We are ready to create programs to help support these people.”
Another major impact of the law is a change in how much states would need to pay to maintain the program depending on error rates. 
The federal government previously covered all of a state’s SNAP benefits. But the new law requires states with an error rate — the percentage of benefits that are over or underpaid — at or above 6 percent to cover between 5% and 15% of total benefit costs starting in 2028.
Nevada’s error rate currently sits at around 7%. If that error rate continued into 2028, Nevada would be penalized by having to pay 5% of benefit costs, which would be equivalent to $55 million annually, according to past data. 
“It’s just unfair, and it’s cruel. At a time when food insecurity in our state is on the rise, groceries are increasingly unaffordable, and it’s harder and harder to make ends meet, what we should be focusing on is how to ensure that our hard work for families and their kids have everything they need, and we shouldn’t be taking things away from them now,” Cortez Masto said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSC07581-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-25 08:57:05.708059

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah lawmakers are eyeing more policy changes to further regulate renewable energy producers in the state, starting by disincentivizing the presence of solar farms in fields that could be “productive,” and adding a requirement to contribute to the communities that surround them.
It’s a theme the industry saw in the last legislative session. Legislators and developers had tense exchanges over a substantial conservation tax on private solar and wind generation facilities. Additionally, a bill that would reduce solar plants’ eligibility for state incentives ended up dying on the Senate floor because of lack of time, but next year it is expected to get fast tracked.
St. George Republican Rep. Colin Jack’s bill draft on solar power plants made big changes from its original idea — which established permitting requirements for location, size, setbacks, noise and visual appearance — that for clean energy advocates, was too strict. Now the bill mostly focuses on which renewable energy developments won’t have state-sponsored tax credits — those on “prime farmland.”

“(Farmers and ranchers) came to me and expressed a concern that in their counties they were seeing prime crop land and grazing land being covered up with big fields of solar panels,” Jack said at a Thursday interim meeting. “And they were saying there’s lots of land in this county that can’t grow anything. Why don’t we put the solar panels over there and not over here, where there’s cropland?”
The first version of the bill had issues, Jack said, because the state isn’t able to limit uses on private property. But, lawmakers could still limit state incentives for what the Natural Resources Conservation Service’s soil survey considers to be productive cropland. 
The Public Utilities, Energy, and Technology Interim Committee voted 9-5 to adopt the bill as a committee bill, meaning it could be fast-tracked in the legislative process in 2026.
In the meantime, clean energy experts still worry the proposal would have negative effects on the state’s quest to multiply its energy production.
“At a time when strengthening domestic energy production is critical to both national security and economic growth, we should be expanding access to affordable, homegrown power, not hindering it,” Logan Mitchell, energy analyst at Utah Clean Energy said in a statement. “This bill would limit opportunities for Utah farmers to diversify their income through long-term lease payments for energy development.”
Next session, Sen. Derrin Owens, R-Fountain Green, is sponsoring another bill requiring energy producers to give back to Utah communities, he said during the interim meeting. 
“Using our airshed and sending 99% of the power to California, and we get 100% of whatever pollution is there,” he said, “…those days have to be over.”
The role of renewables
Owens referred to his proposal after presentations from the Interwest Energy Alliance, a renewable energy advocate organization, and the Utah Association of Counties on the role of sources like solar and wind in the state. The groups then argued that the social benefits of the solar farms are seen mostly at the local level because of how the state’s tax code is written.
Lincoln Shurtz, a lobbyist for the Utah Association of Counties, said that any energy project that’s not a regulated utility in the state is assessed for taxes at the local level, not through the centrally assessed tax process. 



Let us know what you think...


 


Under the state law, counties, cities and districts won’t benefit from new growth on the developments’ tangible investment, like new solar arrays and equipment put in the land, unless they are put in a “community reinvestment area.” 
With that designation, counties are able to sign community benefit agreements with solar developers, calculating their new growth and tracing a path for reinvesting the revenue in communities.
“In many circumstances, that’s how we’re putting in the infrastructure within the counties or the cities, whether that be transportation infrastructure within our counties, without having to raise taxes,” Shurtz said. “In many circumstances, that’s how we’re paying for the police department or the fire department or the EMS services within our communities.”
But, Republicans in the committee remained skeptical, arguing that solar power plants take larger footprints of land than other energy producers.
“There is an environmental impact to placing them and where we place them,” Sen. Scott Sandall, R-Tremonton, said. “They’re better on rooftops. They’re better on places where we’re already industrialized, in my opinion.”
But, mostly, Sandall said he’d be cautious about whether solar projects will be sustainable once tax credits go away in a couple of years. According to a study by Lazard, a financial firm, they will.
“Even with the tax credits going away for wind and solar, wind, solar storage continue to be amongst the most cost competitive resources on the market today,” Rikki Seguin, executive director at Interwest Energy Alliance said.
Renewables are often cheaper than conventional resources, Seguin said in her presentation to the committee. Without federal tax credits that expire in 2027 and state incentives that stop in 2028, the price of new solar and wind builds would be competitive with new gas generation. And sometimes bringing a new renewable development may be cheaper than operating an existing thermal facility. 
“I’m not telling you to turn off a thermal facility. That’s not my presentation here today,” she said. “It is just to say if you need more power, which is what I think we’re all saying we need, you can build renewables very affordably on your system and help keep costs low and stable.”

Harris said the department will be reviewing all of its programs to ensure they are in line with the administration’s expectations. 
“We’re going to review everything we do here to make sure that we’re compliant with all the current executive orders and expectations,” he said.
According to al.com, the White House’s concerns lie mostly in the Office of Minority Affairs within the Governor’s Office. The Office of Minority Affairs was created by the Legislature in 2016 to advise the governor of issues impacting minorities in the state.  
Sen. Chris Elliott, R-Josephine, told al.com that during a recent meeting between Alabama state lawmakers and White House officials, officials raised concerns about what was described as “undisclosed language” in ADPH documents.
The Office of Minority Affairs referred comments to Gov. Kay Ivey’s office on Friday afternoon. Ivey’s communication director Gina Maiola said in a statement Friday afternoon that the administration is working with the White House to ensure compliance.
“While the Alabama Department of Public Health is not part of the Ivey Administration, we have already sought information on the office in question and are prepared to address it,” Maiola wrote. Maiola did not answer questions about the Office of Minority Affairs.
U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Alabama, said in an interview Wednesday after speaking to the Association of County Commissions of Alabama (ACCA) that he did not know of any specific violations.
“We’re addressing more of it on a federal level, and I’ve heard that President Trump is holding money back from people that are not complying to his objective … I hope that doesn’t happen to us in the state where we lose money because we’re not complying,” Tuberville said. “I don’t know whether it’s in business or whether it’s in state government, or whether it’s in universities, but they all have to comply.”
The Trump administration also reprimanded some colleges and universities for noncompliance with DEI in March. The “dear colleague letter” included that the University of Alabama at Birmingham was guilty of race-based segregation.

(Photo: Tesla)Elon Musk, who says he hopes to make Tesla robotaxis available to half of America by year’s end, is soliciting job applicants to test his driverless cars on the streets of Southern Nevada. An advertisement on the company’s website seeks a “Data Collection Supervisor, Autopilot (Night Shift)” in Henderson. 
The person hired for the position would “accelerate our vehicle-level testing” and manage “a team of vehicle operators.” 
Battered by lagging sales, a tumble in stock prices, and fallout over his political activity, Musk is out to expand his fleet of autonomous taxis to a handful of metropolitan areas, including Houston, TX; Miami, FL; and New York City, according to the job listings. 
“We’re getting the regulatory permission to launch in the Bay Area, Nevada, Arizona, and a number of, and Florida. and a number of other places,” Musk said last month, according to a transcript of Tesla’s second quarter earnings call. “So as we get the approvals and we prove our safety, then we’ll be launching autonomous ride-hailing in most of the country. And I think we’ll probably have autonomous ride hailing in probably half the population of the U.S. by the end of the year. That’s at least our goal, subject to regulatory approvals.”
Despite the assertion, Tesla has filed no applications in California to operate driverless taxis, though it’s launched a scaled-down, human-operated version akin to a standard taxi in San Franscisco.  
The Current was unable to locate any applications filed by Tesla with the Nevada Dept. of Motor Vehicles, which issues permits to autonomous vehicle companies to test and operate their services. However, a spokesperson for the DMV told Bloomberg that discussions regarding robotaxis took place in July among Gov. Joe Lombardo’s office, the DMV, and Tesla. 
Lombardo did not respond to requests for comment. 
Tesla would also require approval from the Nevada Transportation Authority to operate as an autonomous vehicle network company. 
Robotaxis on the Las Vegas Strip would solidify what some suggest is an effort by Musk, the world’s richest man, to put local cab and rideshare companies out of business. The Current reported earlier this month that a subsidiary of Musk’s Boring Company, which is building a labyrinth of tunnels beneath the Strip, is seeking a permit to operate a human-driven taxi and special event transportation service. 
Musk seeks to bring Vegas Loop’s tunneled Teslas to surface as taxis 

Jonathan Schwartz, director of Yellow Checker Star Transportation, Southern Nevada’s largest cab company, says he’s not confident his drivers and their passengers would be safe sharing streets with driverless Teslas. 
Nevada law, he noted, “is extremely permissive to automation. The only avenue to change it would be at the next legislative session, if they amended the current legislation.”
In 2011, Nevada became the first state to allow the testing and operation of self-driving technology on highways. In 2013, the law was amended to require a human operator be along for the ride. 
Lawmakers removed that requirement in 2017, permitting operation without a human operator in vehicles capable of “achieving a minimal risk condition upon a failure of its automated driving system,” meaning the vehicle can safely come to a stop. 
A bill introduced this year by Las Vegas Democratic state Sen. James Ohrenschall sought to address safety concerns by requiring a human operator in vehicles with eight or more passengers, and in some autonomous commercial vehicles on highways. The measure died in committee. 
Currently, Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet, which is the parent company of Google, is the big fish in the driverless taxi lane. The service has operated in a number of cities since 2017, and is testing its cars in Southern Nevada. Zoox, Amazon’s contender in the driverless taxi space, recently began ferrying passengers on the Strip. 
A field of its own
Full self-driving (FSD) is the “future of transport” according to Tesla. But it remains an elusive concept today, despite Tesla’s efforts to bill its vehicles as self-driving. 
“Cars and trucks that drive us — instead of us driving them — may offer transformative safety opportunities at their maturity,” says the website of the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA). “At this time, even the highest level of driving automation available to consumers requires the full engagement and undivided attention of drivers.”
Tesla faces lawsuits from regulators, shareholders, and litigants alleging injury or death at the hands of Tesla FSD technology. 
Last week, a judge ordered Tesla to face a certified class action suit from California drivers who said Musk misled them about the self-driving capabilities of his company’s electric vehicles. 
U.S. District Judge Rita Lin said the question of whether Tesla lacked sensors to achieve high-level autonomy plus its inability to “demonstrate a long-distance autonomous drive with any of its vehicles” justified lawsuits by two groups of motorists who bought its Full Self-Driving package.
The California Department of Motor Vehicles is suing Tesla for false advertising, claiming the company misled consumers about the capabilities or its technology. The DMV is asking an administrative judge to halt manufacturing and sales of Autopilot (which features some automated driving features) and FSD Teslas in California for at least 30 days 
During a hearing in July, Tesla attorney Matthew Benedetto asserted the company has never tried to conceal the fact that its vehicles cannot drive themselves. 
“Cars with Full Self-Driving capabilities are currently not capable of driving themselves,” Benedetto said.
Following a test rollout of Tesla’s robotaxi in Austin, Texas this summer, shareholders filed a federal lawsuit alleging the company misled them about its autonomous driving software. 
“That test showed the vehicles speeding, braking suddenly, driving over a curb, entering the wrong lane, and dropping off passengers in the middle of multilane roads,” Reuters reported. 
The Dawn Project, which seeks to “identify and call out the software that puts humanity at risk and to demand that defective and insecure software be replaced,” conducted a demonstration in June that revealed what organizers say are critical safety defects in Tesla’s Full Self-Driving software, including repeatedly running down child-size mannequins and blowing past a school bus with its lights on. 
‘As wrong 10 years ago as it is today’ 
The federal government regulates autonomous vehicles to a degree, but leaves much of the process to states. NHTSA has issued voluntary guidelines for automated driving systems (ADS) for all automakers, but without compliance requirements. 
In 2021, the federal government required that automakers provide safety reports for their ADS vehicles. Out of 392 crashes reported by 11 automakers and one supplier from June 2021 through May 15, 2022, some 273 accidents involved Teslas. Honda was second with 90 reported accidents, followed by Subaru at 10 and Ford Motor with five. 
NHTSA launched a probe last year into Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system following reports of crashes in low-visibility conditions, including one involving the death of a pedestrian. The investigation covers about 2.4 million Tesla models from 2016 through 2024.
Tesla contends its Autopilot technology “is 10x safer than the average U.S. driver.” 
Attorney Donald Slavik counters that Teslas employing Autopilot “are no safer than manual driving.” Slavik, who represents individuals injured or killed in crashes involving autonomous vehicles, says Tesla’s accident data is not an apples to apples comparison with data collected by other automakers. 
“Tesla counts an accident when an airbag in a vehicle is deployed, and they count how many million of miles are between each of those events,” Slavik says, while its comparison data for other autos counts accident reports. An airbag deployed in only one in six of those accidents, meaning Tesla is potentially counting only a fraction of its crashes. 
“The worst cases are where someone has operated a Tesla on Autopilot, relied on its reported safety and superiority over driving manually, and they end up hitting another car or hitting a pedestrian, resulting in their injury or death,” he says. 
Earlier this month, a Miami jury awarded $242.6 million in the case of a man who was critically injured and his girlfriend killed when their parked car was hit by a Tesla operating on Autopilot. The vehicle blew through a stop sign at more than 60 miles an hour before hitting the car.
Attorneys for the plaintiffs argued that Tesla falsely claimed its Autopilot system has the ability to stop without the help of drivers. 
“What Musk has been saying about this technology was as wrong 10 years ago as it is today,” plaintiff’s attorney Brett Schreiber said following the verdict. “The Tesla car is a good car. It’s the Autopilot that will kill you.”
Tesla blamed the driver of the car, who blew through a stop sign as he searched for his dropped cell phone. The jury found the driver, who settled a suit separately, was also responsible. 
Slavik had a similar case in which a man who was putting his trash cans on the street was hit by a Tesla on Autopilot. The man suffered spinal cord and brain injuries, and eventually died as a result, Slavik says.
Tesla has defied safety measures adopted and adhered to by other automakers with autonomous driving features. 
Slavik points to differences between Tesla and manufacturers with features similar to Tesla’s Autopilot, such as Ford Blue Cruise, or General Motors Super Cruise. Ford and GM limit the operation of the technology to roads that have been “mapped, checked and double-checked to ensure that they’re safe to use.” 
Tesla, by contrast, does not engage in geofencing, the process of confining the use of driverless software to certain areas. “Tesla allows you to use Autopilot anywhere, anytime,” Slavik says. 
Another difference is that Tesla ensures drivers are paying attention through the presence of a hand on the steering wheel, while Ford and GM, through a dashboard-mounted camera, require that drivers keep an eye on the road. 
“Tesla didn’t do that,” said Slavik, adding that newer-model Teslas equipped with a camera will continue to drive, even with tape placed over the lens.  
The National HighwayTraffic Safety Administration provides Voluntary Safety Self-Assessments from two dozen automatic driving manufacturers. Tesla is not one of them. 
Slavik attributes the lack of consistency among automakers to the “present administration that doesn’t want to deal with this.” 
In January, the NHTSA opened an investigation into Tesla’s self-driving systems. Months later, 
Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) took its chainsaw to NHTSA, and fired a disproportionate number of employees on the agency’s vehicle automation safety team, according to news reports. 
Look, Ma. No hands! 
A survey of U.S. drivers found in February that 13% would trust riding in self-driving vehicles – up from 9% a year earlier – while six out of 10 drivers report being afraid to ride in an autonomous vehicle. Enhancing vehicle safety remains a priority over the development of self-driving technology, U.S. drivers said. 
Clark County Commission Chairman Tick Segerblom declined to say on the record whether he is confident Tesla’s robotaxis would be a safe addition to traffic on the pedestrian-laden Las Vegas Strip. 
Commissioner Marilyn Kirkpatrick, who served with Segerblom in the Nevada Assembly when both voted in 2011 for legislation to allow autonomous vehicles, says she’s unaware of Tesla’s plan for robotaxis in Southern Nevada and knows of no meetings between Tesla and Clark County. 
Taxi company executive Schwartz is hoping for a change in the law before robotaxis hit the Strip.  
“It’s something that we’re concerned with. It’s just a matter of whether or not legislators take it up,” he said. “The unfortunate thing is things like this only change when there’s some sort of tragedy.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Image-8-22-25-at-4.06 PM-1024x642.jpeg,,,2025-08-25 08:57:05.708059

The size of the universe. Quantum mechanics.
And the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles getting compliments.
But criminal justice reform advocates say Hal Nash, the newly appointed chair of the board, has shown more openness to parole applicants than the prior regime, which treated those seeking early release as fuel for Alabama’s pitiless punishment machine.

“You have a decent board that is going to be fair, that is going to be united. They are not going to be pitted against each other in their decision- making,” Nichelle Cunningham, a paralegal working with the ACLU of Alabama on parole issues, said recently. “If your loved one is denied, I personally feel there is something that is lacking in that file.”
We need to go to the Tree of Doubt and shake a few caveats onto this picture. Nash is getting settled in. The board is adopting new parole guidelines more punitive than many criminal justice groups support. And the Alabama Legislature is allergic to anything smacking of restraint or compassion.
Still, it’s a good sign that the board is taking individual reform seriously. It means they’re taking public safety in Alabama seriously.
Giving inmates access to parole doesn’t mean coddling criminals. It encourages reform, through training or rehabilitation programs. Which incentivizes good behavior and creates a safer environment for the incarcerated and those who work in prisons. And, maybe, reduces the brutalization of inmates alleged in lawsuit after lawsuit.
It’s not clear, though, that most Alabama legislators understand this. The House and Senate mostly shrugged as parole rates plummeted between 2019 and 2023. The board’s aversion to early release discouraged inmates from enrolling in rehabilitation programs. That killed hope. Which only encouraged violence.
But getting tough on parole cut crime, right? Not really.
In 2014, Alabama’s homicide rate was 8.1 per 100,000, according to the CDC. In 2023, it was 14.8 per 100,000 — down from a peak in 2021 but still one of the highest in the nation.
Parole didn’t do that. It was poverty. And a lot of guns.
But we’ve done little about those two things. Because when legislators talk about crime, they’re usually talking about something else.
Take a legislative package that the Alabama Legislature passed earlier this year. Supporters said it would improve public safety.
But the closer you looked, the more the bills in the package looked like a series of gifts to law enforcement. The centerpiece, HB 202, made it easier for police officers to claim immunity protections, and harder for victims of excessive force to pursue justice.
Describing the bill in her State of the State address in February, Gov. Kay Ivey said it was aimed at allowing officers to do their jobs “without fear of Monday morning quarterbacking in the courts.” Another bill, which did not pass, would have offered scholarships to dependents of law enforcement officers. There was even a proposal to have the state take over police departments that were struggling to fill police vacancies.
It’s good to see Alabama officials trying to keep police officers on the job. The Legislature last decade was astonishingly tolerant of a yearslong state trooper shortage. No doubt the Blue feel Backed.
But that does little to address crime in our state.
The only bill in this year’s package that addressed the issue was SB 116, sponsored by Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road. The legislation makes it a state crime to use Glock switches, which turn handguns into effective automatic weapons. That’s a start.
But it underlines one of the problems with how we approach public safety. “Crime” bills are usually wrapping for something that has little to do with reducing crime. We increase legal punishments that don’t prevent lawbreaking but let politicians beat their chests. And bills that threaten public safety — like effectively ending concealed carry permits — get pushed through to make the gun lobby happy.
Making parole nearly impossible didn’t make the state safer. It sure didn’t reduce violence or overcrowding in our correctional facilities.
To be fair, a few lawmakers raised their voices against this tough-on-crime cosplay. But for most, signaling a hatred of criminals was more important than doing something effective. Even when that was bad for prisons and useless for safety.
Nash and the parole board are doing their jobs. Giving a fair hearing to parole applicants is the floor. My concern is with the Legislature. Alabama officials love to make theatrical displays of toughness that preclude and, in some cases, block proven methods of improving public safety. If they feel the need to address the issue in 2026 or 2027, the board’s sudden embrace of rationality will be a big target.
So I wish Nash the best with his new approach. And I hope he doesn’t get hamstrung by Alabama politicians who put preening ahead of policy.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_7336-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-25 08:57:05.708059

VESTAVIA HILLS — On Friday evening, a group of protesters gathered at a busy intersection in Liberty Park near the corporate campus of Drummond Company Inc., an Alabama-based coal producer. Their message was clear, painted and printed on signs bearing the green, red and black of the Palestinian flag: “Drummond Fuels Genocide.”
Chris Izor, one of the protesters, said that he and others present wanted to call attention to coal shipments to Israel from Drummond’s Colombian subsidiary, Drummond Ltd., that may violate Colombian law. An August 2024 decree by Colombia’s government ordered the halt of coal shipments to Israel in the wake of the ongoing Israeli occupation of Gaza.
Months before, in May 2024, Colombian President Gustavo Petro had formally announced the end of diplomatic ties with Israel, which he has said is committing genocide through its actions in Gaza.

Despite the presidential decree, some shipments of coal continued to leave Colombia bound for Israel, according to local reports and the Colombian government.
At the protest in Vestavia Hills, Izor said that it’s important for Alabamians to know if a company that calls their state home may be complicit in fueling war.
“As members of the community, we feel some responsibility to make sure that companies based in our state aren’t endorsing, supporting, funding or fueling human rights abuses abroad,” Izor told Inside Climate News. “We have a responsibility, particularly in a place that is the heart of the civil rights movement, to call it out and to be part of the movement in opposition to that.”
In a statement posted to its website, Drummond Ltd. said that its shipments comply with Colombian law.
“Coal exports to Israel have been done in conformity with the authorization that the National Government gave,” the July 17 statement said. “Drummond presented the required documentation to a committee comprised of the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Tourism; the National Mining Agency, and the National Tax and Customs Directorate (DIAN), as required in Article 3 of Decree 1047 of 2024 issued by the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Tourism.”
In a speech posted online by Colombian state-owned news network Radio Nacional de Colombia on July 21, Petro singled out Drummond and Glencore, a Switzerland-based coal producer, for potentially violating the presidential decree, according to a translation of the speech provided by the outlet.
“We are witnessing a genocide. Today there is a genocide that no one can support,” Petro said, according to the translation. “And that is why we will not export coal to Israel; the exporting companies Drummond and Glencore, under investigation, cannot bring in more coal to make bombs in Israel.”
Days later, on July 24, Petro posted on social media alleging that another coal shipment had left for Israel. The Colombian Navy would be ordered to blockade further exports, according to Petro.
“Not a single ton of coal should leave Colombia for Israel,” Petro wrote. “We are not complicit in genocide.”
Petro has also asked the government to begin a sanctions process to penalize Drummond and Glencore, another coal producer, according to reports.
As of 2024, Israel imported more than 50 percent of its coal from Colombia, according to numbers from the American Journal for Transportation cited by the Associated Press. In 2022, Drummond wrote in a press release that it was the top exporter of Colombian coal for the sixth year in a row. Israel was the fifth-largest recipient of the company’s Colombian exports at just under 9 percent.

Izor, a member of Birmingham Democratic Socialists of America, said that while some passersby in Liberty Park—a community developed in partnership with Drummond Company—weren’t necessarily happy to see the protesters, they received a largely positive response.
“We’ve had people bring us cookies. We’ve had people hollering ‘Free Palestine’ out their windows,” he said. “And we don’t always have to be in places that make us comfortable anyway. Ending the genocide is what’s important.”
Izor said that even if Drummond’s Colombian subsidiary was complying with the letter of the law—through a loophole, for example—he would still hope the company would cease its exports for moral reasons.
“They shouldn’t be shipping coal to the state of Israel in the first place, given Israel’s persistent human rights record,” he said. “Drummond should at least feel some minor amount of responsibility not to power this illegal occupation.”
Izor said that the exportation and burning of coal on its own is detrimental to human health, even outside of the Israel-Gaza context.
“In a sense, there is no good coal company,” he said. “There is no good fossil fuel company. But here, in this case, we feel a specific obligation to stand up for Palestine.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Gustavo-Petro-from-Aug-25-2025-story-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-25 08:57:05.708059

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)President Trump mobilized the D.C. National Guard under the guise of restoring security in the nation’s capital — despite D.C.’s crime rate being at a 30-year low. What began as a deployment of 800 D.C. National Guard troops has grown to encompass 2,091 as of this writing, as Republican governors send hundreds more.
Trump hasn’t just complained about alleged crime in the district — he’s placed a target on people experiencing poverty and homelessness. Claiming that we’re “getting rid of the slums,” Trump has called on troops and police to forcibly remove unhoused people from the city.
Federal law prohibits deploying the military on U.S. soil, except under certain extraordinary circumstances. Trump is currently facing legal challenges over his 60-day deployment of troops in Los Angeles earlier this year under equally unfounded claims about violence and risk — and against the wishes of the troops themselves.
Now he’s ordering soldiers into our streets for the fourth time as president to viciously target some of the most vulnerable members of our society — despite abundant evidence that prosecuting homelessness only makes it worse.
The cost of this cruel power grab is borne by taxpayers like you and me.
Previous reporting found that National Guard deployments cost the U.S. government $530 per Guard member, per day. So the price tag of deploying 2,091 troops to D.C. is well over $1 million per day — and the number of troops will likely continue to grow. And with no deadline for the D.C. deployment, those costs could add up for months or even years.
This militarized spending comes at the expense of federal programs — like public housing — that actually do prevent crime and improve health and education outcomes.
Using those figures and other publicly available data, I calculated that the daily cost of operating public housing for all 5,616 people who are unhoused in D.C. on any given night is one-quarter the daily expense of deploying the National Guard. If the Guard remains deployed for three months, it would cost more than operating public housing for the entire unhoused population in D.C. for an entire year. 
That’s also true in the states whose GOP governors are voluntarily sending National Guard troops to the capital. Across those six states — Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Ohio, South Carolina, West Virginia — some 30,000 people are unhoused. The daily cost of operating safe shelter for all 30,000 would be less than one day of the D.C. occupation.
In fact, it’s true in almost every state, I learned.
The daily expense of deploying troops to D.C. is more than four times the daily cost of operating public housing for Georgia’s unhoused population, five times for Nevada’s unhoused population, and 15 times for all unhoused people in Wisconsin.
If you want numbers for your own city, county, state, or congressional district, you can use the National Priorities Project’s trade off calculator at NationalPriorities.org to learn more about what taxpayers in your area are paying towards militarism — and the services we could be enjoying instead.
Trump’s decision to hyper-militarize our streets is transpiring on the heels of the MAGA budget bill, which cuts food and medical services for millions across the country to further enrich billionaires and war profiteers.
Deploying troops in our nation’s capital, rather than investing in what makes communities safe and prosperous, is yet another attempt to scapegoat struggling people — especially communities of color — to advance a draconian agenda in service of billionaires, war profiteers, and white supremacy.
Government spending on straightforward solutions that help poor and working-class people faces constant political backlash. But providing affordable housing to end homelessness in D.C. would be far cheaper than deploying troops — and would do far more to improve the city’s security.

Four Delaware hotels have been recognized among the best in the country for sleep quality, according to a new national study that evaluated Tripadvisor review data with a focus on one key — and often overlooked — factor: how well guests sleep.
The analysis, conducted by sleep research site SleepJunkie, examined thousands of traveler reviews to identify the top 200 hotels across the U.S. where guests consistently praised sleep-related experiences.
These included everything from mattress comfort and room temperature to noise levels and overall nighttime tranquility.

Topping the list for Delaware was the Boardwalk Plaza Hotel in Rehoboth Beach, which ranked #38 nationally.
The Victorian-style, oceanfront property was praised for its combination of comfort and cleanliness.
Other Delaware hotels recognized for superior sleep quality include:

Seaside Inn, Fenwick Island — Ranked #61, guests highlighted its cozy beds and laid-back vibe.
Hotel Blue, Lewes — At #75, this boutique coastal hotel drew praise for its modern amenities and restful ambiance.
Hyatt Place Dewey Beach, Dewey Beach — Ranking #155, this bayside stay earned accolades for its plush bedding.

The study’s top honors nationally went to Skytop Lodge in the Poconos, Pennsylvania, followed by The Historic Cavalier Hotel in Virginia Beach, and Omni Mount Washington Resort & Spa in New Hampshire.
According to SleepJunkie spokesperson Kristina Hindes, the findings reveal a shift in what travelers value most.
“We often focus on pools, spas, and breakfast buffets – but when it comes to how guests actually rate their stay, sleep quality quietly wins,”  Hindes said. “These hotels prove that a great mattress, a quiet room, and the right atmosphere can turn a good trip into an unforgettable one.”
An accompanying infographic released by SleepJunkie highlights all 200 hotels recognized in the rankings, which include properties across beach destinations, mountain retreats, and bustling cities.

(Stock.adobe.com by snowing12)While traditional schools prepare for fall, homeschool families celebrate the return of quiet  libraries, midday museum visits and uncrowded playgrounds. Across the U.S. — especially in  Maryland — homeschooling is no longer a last resort but an intentional, affirming educational  choice.
The excitement goes beyond flexible schedules; it reflects a deeper shift in how, where and why children learn.
In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted traditional schooling, sparking a surge in  homeschooling across all demographics. What began as a temporary fix has become a lasting  trend. By the 2023–24 school year, more than 40,000 Maryland students — 4.65% of the K–12  population—were homeschooled, according to the Maryland State Department of Education.  That’s well above the 2.6% pre-pandemic rate and even the 4% peak during the pandemic. Local umbrella groups, co-ops and enrichment programs continue to report steady interest, signaling a  long-term shift.
Maryland regulates homeschooling under COMAR 13A.10.01. Parents must submit a Notice of  Intent, teach required subjects, and undergo twice-yearly portfolio reviews. Families can either  be supervised by their local school district or join an approved umbrella program, often affiliated with religious or private schools. While Maryland offers flexibility in curriculum and scheduling,  it also imposes limits: homeschooled students cannot participate in public school sports,  extracurriculars or classes.

Recently, a viral Facebook post raised concerns about changes to Maryland’s homeschool laws. Parents responded by sending letters to the Department of Education’s Regulatory Review, citing  worries about state-approved curricula, parent degree requirements, home visits and mandatory  testing. In reality, the state was simply gathering feedback to ensure regulations remain clear and  workable. Input was welcomed from all stakeholders through Aug. 15.
Families choose homeschooling for many reasons: individualized instruction, safety concerns,  flexible pacing or a desire for more family time. Maryland’s strong homeschool associations and  umbrella schools help ease the transition, offering structure without sacrificing freedom. For  some, homeschooling addresses gaps in traditional education, allowing parents to integrate  cultural, religious or academic values into daily learning. Museums, nature centers, and libraries  across the state now offer specialized daytime programs, enriching the homeschool experience.
One of the most notable trends — both nationally and in Maryland — is the rise of homeschooling  among African American families. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Black students nationwide represent about 8.5% of homeschoolers as of 2025 — a significant increase from prepandemic levels as of 2025. For many, it’s a way to build an education that reflects Black  history, culture and identity — areas often overlooked in traditional curricula. Parents speak of  reclaiming education and creating systems that affirm their children’s worth and potential.
Some critics question whether homeschooling limits access to higher education. In fact, homeschool graduates are increasingly welcomed by colleges and universities, including those in Maryland. Admissions offices recognize their independence, adaptability and self-direction.
Institutions like the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, the University of Maryland, College Park, and Morgan State University actively recruit homeschool applicants. Many students also take advantage of dual-enrollment programs, earning college credit while finishing high school.
Of course, homeschooling comes with challenges. Portfolio reviews can be stressful, and families lose access to publicly funded extracurriculars, placing the burden on parents. Equity concerns persist, as homeschooling often requires a flexible work schedule, making it less accessible to lower-income families. Still, the continued growth of homeschooling suggests that  many families find the benefits outweigh the barriers. Maryland’s homeschool community is building support systems — from co-ops to regional teaching groups — that help families thrive.
As classrooms reopen and yellow buses roll out each fall, thousands of Maryland families choose a different path. For them, “back to school” means morning lessons at the kitchen table, afternoons exploring history at local museums, or science classes in state parks. For many Black  families, it’s also a powerful act of reclaiming education — stepping outside a system that has too often underserved them and creating new spaces for their children to flourish.
Homeschooling in Maryland is no longer a fringe choice. It’s a vibrant, resilient, and diverse  movement — one that continues to redefine what education can look like when families take the  lead.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/AdobeStock_163318377-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-25 07:56:30.241176

The legacy of Vincent Chin has recently been commemorated in a street sign bearing his name on the corner of Cass Avenue and Peterboro Street in Detroit’s historic Chinatown.
I was glad to see it. Watching the 1987 documentary “Who Killed Vincent Chin?” and learning about his life and Asian American activism changed my life.
I was 18 and taking my first Asian American studies class at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The film made me realize two things: Asian Americans are targets of racial violence, and Asian Americans across the ethnic spectrum could join together to fight for civil rights. This led to my passion for social justice.
I’m proud to now be a professor of Asian American studies and critical race theory who teaches my students about Vincent Chin.
So who was Chin, and why did his death catalyze an Asian American civil rights movement?

 A fatal brawl

Chin, an Oak Park resident, was 27 years old on the night of his bachelor party, June 19, 1982. He got into a fight with two white men – Ronald Ebens, a Chrysler car plant supervisor, and Michael Nitz, an unemployed autoworker and Ebens’ stepson.
According to Racine Colwell, a dancer at the Fancy Pants Club in the Detroit area, Ebens shouted, “It’s because of you little motherf–kers that we’re out of work.” Detroit in the early 1980s was in an automotive slump. People blamed Japanese auto imports and the Japanese people, in general, for the economic downturn. The assailants didn’t seem to understand or care that Chin was actually Chinese.
After the fight between Chin and Nitz and Ebens, Chin and his friends ran out of the club. Ebens and Nitz ran after them, with Nitz grabbing a baseball bat from his car. When they found Chin outside a McDonald’s on Woodward Avenue, Nitz held Chin while Ebens beat his body and head with the bat. They were stopped by two off-duty police officers who had been inside the fast-food restaurant.
After the attack, Jimmy Choi, a member of the bachelor party, cradled Chin in his arms. He said that Chin’s last words were “It’s not fair.” Chin died four days later.
Ebens and Nitz were charged with second-degree murder, but their lawyers pleaded the charge down to manslaughter. At the end of the trial, Judge Charles Kaufman fined them US$3,000 each and sentenced each to three years’ probation, explaining: “These weren’t the kind of people you send to prison. … You don’t make the punishment fit the crime. You make the punishment fit the criminal.”
 Asian Americans organize for legal justice

The sentencing enraged Chin’s friends, family and the greater Chinese and Asian American community of Detroit.
Activists of various Asian ethnicities and their non-Asian allies created American Citizens for Justice, an organization that pressured the Justice Department to investigate the violation of Chin’s civil rights and to see Ebens and Nitz imprisoned for Chin’s murder. Lily Chin, Vincent’s mother, was a key advocate in the pursuit of justice for her son, showing up to rallies and interviews to remind people of Vincent’s death for nearly a decade.
While there were other moments, such as the anti-eviction fight for the I-Hotel in San Francisco, that brought Asian Americans of all ethnicities together to fight for civil rights, Chin’s murder sparked a broad awareness. Asian Americans realized that what happened to Chin could happen to them.
American Citizens for Justice held press conferences and gained support from local African American activists in Michigan and national Black leaders like Jesse Jackson, whose presence helped bring more attention to the Chin tragedy.
Activists were successful in forcing the FBI to open an investigation. The resulting 1984 federal trial was the first time the Justice Department had argued that the civil rights of an Asian American person had been violated. Nitz was found not guilty on two counts. Ebens was found guilty and sentenced to 25 years in prison. However, a 1986 federal appeals court ruling overturned the conviction, freeing Ebens.
A civil suit filed against Ebens and Nitz on behalf of Lily Chin was settled out of court in 1987. Nitz agreed to pay $50,000 and Ebens $1.5 million – the projected income that Chin would have made had he lived.
Nitz fulfilled his debt, but Ebens made only a few payments. By 1987, Ebens had been unemployed for five years. He stopped making payments after he moved to Nevada. Estimates in 2016 place Ebens’ debt to the Chin estate at over $8 million, including accumulated interest.

Chin’s death had a profound impact on the criminal justice system in Michigan and nationally. Michigan made it harder to plead down murder charges to manslaughter and required prosecutors to be present at sentencings to face victims. Nationally, victim impact statements are now commonplace. Victims and their families now have more of a voice in the justice system.
Chin’s death spurred Pan-Asian American activism across the U.S., leading to the eventual founding of organizations like Asian Americans Advancing Justice in 1991 and Stop Asian American Pacific Islander Hate in 2020. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Stop AAPI Hate recorded violence against Asians happening in the U.S. and educated people about anti-Asian racism.
Today, Asian Americans fight for social justice through organizations like these and 18 Million Rising, a group that advocates for racial justice for Asian Americans and all marginalized people.
This is the lasting legacy of Vincent Chin.

Wes Moore heated up over the weekend. (Trump from a White House screengrab; Moore photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The war of words between President Donald Trump and Gov. Wes Moore heated up Sunday as Trump threatened to send federal troops to Baltimore and hinted that he might try to take back funding to replace the Francis Scott Key Bridge.
The comments came in a social media post late Sunday morning, three days after Moore blasted Trump’s criticism of crime in Baltimore and other big cities, telling the president that “if you are not willing to walk our communities, keep our name out of your mouth.”
They also came as Moore was appearing on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” where the governor called Trump’s decision to deploy National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., unconstitutional and “deeply disrespectful” to the local government and residents.
Trump responded to Moore’s “rather nasty and provocative” statements with a lengthy post that repeated his claims about “out of control, crime ridden” Baltimore, and said he “would much prefer that he clean up this Crime disaster before I go there for a ‘walk.'”
“But if Wes Moore needs help … I will send in the ‘troops,’ which is being done in nearby DC, and quickly clean up the Crime,” Trump’s post said.
Trump ended his missive by noting that “I gave Wes Moore a lot of money to fix his demolished bridge. I will now have to rethink that decision???” an apparent reference to a congressionally approved commitment to fully fund replacement for the Key Bridge after it was destroyed in a crash with a container ship last year.
‘Keep our names out of your mouth’: Moore defends Baltimore against Trump at Pimlico event

The response from Maryland officials was swift and unsparing, led by Moore who in a post on X said he “can get you a golf cart, if that makes things easier” for “President Bone Spurs” — an apparent references to Trump’s draft deferments for having bone spurs — who would rather spout “more lies about  the progress we’re making on public safety in Maryland” than walk the streets.
On “Face the Nation,” Moore said the president’s use of National Guard and other federal forces in the District — and his threat to repeat the action in other large cities — is “purely performative, without actually focusing on these communities.”
“The reason I have asked the president to come and join us is that he seems to enjoy being in this blissful ignorance, these tropes, these 1980 scare tactics,” Moore said on the show. “While the president spends his time from the Oval Office, making jabs and attacks at us, there are people actually on the ground doing the work, who know what brings down crime, but it’s falling on deaf ears with the president of the United States.”
In a social media post after Moore’s comments Thursday, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said violent crime in the city was at 50-year lows, and while the city welcomed federal investment to continue driving down crime, it was “not interested” in a deployment of troops that would “erode residents’ rights” to stage a photo op.
Other Democrats quickly joined in, with Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) calling Trump’s threat to deploy troops a distraction from other issues.
“Trump is now threatening to extend his drastic overreach by using the U.S. military against Americans — we are not interested in his distractions away from his disastrous policies that have cut health care, raised the cost of insurance, and the cost of living for all of us,” Alsobrooks said in a statement released by her office Sunday.
Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) criticized “Trump’s desire to play dictator with our military on American soil” as well as his “unlawful threats to claw back federal funding that Congress explicitly approved” for the Key Bridge.
“While there’s more we can do together, Trump’s threats to invade our cities are not the answer – and are sad attempts to distract from his failures to actually put forward solutions to these and other issues facing our communities, like the rising cost of living,” Van Hollen said in a statement. “Instead of politicizing our great City of Baltimore, which Trump knows nothing about, he should just button it up while federal, state, and local law enforcement do their important work.”
It is not clear what authority Trump would have to “rethink” funding Congress approved for the Key Bridge. But he and his Cabinet have not been hesitant to cut other previously approved programs and let the courts figure it out.
But Moore warned that any such cuts would face a fight.
“We worked across the aisle to secure funding to rebuild this iconic bridge, an action that is written into law because of the leaders who put politics aside to make Baltimore whole again,” Moore said in a statement released by his office Sunday. “President Trump’s attack threatens this bipartisan agreement that is a win for port workers, truckers, small businesses, service members, and working families throughout Maryland and across America. Any threats to this funding will cause irrevocable damage to the national economy and to the entire State of Maryland.”

The Milford Museum’s American History Series continues next month with a deep dive into one of the most pivotal elections in U.S. history.
On Saturday, September 13 at 1 p.m., historian and educator Lew Miller will present “The Presidential Election of 1912: Theodore Roosevelt and the Rise of the Bull Moose Party” at the Milford Public Library.
The talk will explore the dramatic four-way race that reshaped the American political landscape, focusing primarily on the rivalry between former President Theodore Roosevelt, running under the newly formed Progressive “Bull Moose” Party, and Democrat Woodrow Wilson, then the governor of New Jersey.
Often considered the first “modern” presidential election, the 1912 contest introduced primary elections in several states and addressed issues that still resonate today—tariffs, immigration, inflation, and inequality.

The results of that election helped define the ideological direction of both major political parties for the next century: Republicans moved toward conservatism, while Democrats embraced a more liberal platform.
Presenter Lew Miller brings more than four decades of experience in public education.
He taught U.S. and world history before becoming an administrator and later serving as Director of Instruction for the Caesar Rodney School District.
In retirement, he continues to stay active in education through consulting and legal research.
The program is part of a monthly series sponsored by the Milford Museum, highlighting local, state, and national history.
Events are held the second Saturday of each month at the Milford Public Library, located at 11 S.E. Front Street.

(Provided by Meta)Funding from Facebook is helping to pay for a $100 million solar project in central South Carolina that otherwise would have cost power companies too much to build.
Power companies expect to ink similar deals on future solar projects in the state, particularly as construction delays and tariffs drive up prices and Congress rolls back federal tax credits incentivizing these projects, according to Cole Price, executive vice president of member services at Central Electric Power Cooperative.
Similar to how angel investors helped Facebook get started, the social media platform and other tech companies are filling a similar role for the solar industry.
Facebook’s parent company, Meta, signed a contract last week with solar developer Silicon Ranch, of Nashville, and Columbia-based Central Electric Cooperative for the 100 megawatt project.
The companies’ agreement with Meta comes a year after the social media giant announced it was building a massive, energy-intensive data center near Aiken to keep its online operations humming.
Data centers gobble up energy. Should SC block them from getting special deals?

“We’re grateful to Central for supporting our energy goals in South Carolina and thrilled to expand our relationship with Silicon Ranch, who shares our commitment to have a positive impact in the communities where we locate,” Head of Global Energy at Meta Urvi Parekh said in a statement.
‘If not for Meta’
Silicon Ranch will finance, build, own and operate the new solar project. They’ll hook into state owned power-company Santee Cooper’s grid, which in turn will deliver the power to all 19 rural electric cooperatives across South Carolina.
That includes Aiken Electric Cooperative, which serves Meta’s $800 million data center under construction in Graniteville’s Sage Mill Industrial Park.
“This announcement is another step forward for this transformative project,” said Gary Stooksbury, CEO of the Aiken cooperative.
Meta will purchase the so-called renewable energy credits associated with the project as the social media company works toward its goal of carbon neutrality.
Once electricity enters the grid, it is impossible to know where each megawatt comes from — power from solar, gas, wind and coal become jumbled together in the power lines that zigzag across the state. So these credits, which companies sell separately and in addition to the actual energy that shows up on customers’ monthly power bills, allow their purchaser to claim ownership of the underlying social and environmental benefits of clean energy.
Developers put the money generated from the sale of those credits toward purchasing land and building the solar array, which in this case will be located some 50 miles east of Meta’s data center. Through this deal, Meta is buying down the solar project’s cost of construction, making it financially feasible.

“If not for Meta, this renewable resource would not make sense,” said state Sen. Russell Ott, D-St. Matthews, who confirmed the solar project would be located near the small town of Cordova, just outside Orangeburg.
Silicon Ranch declined to disclose the exact size and location of the solar project beyond saying it will follow industry standards. That puts its footprint somewhere between 800 and 1,000 acres.
The company is expected to receive property tax breaks for the project but details of that deal were not immediately available. Orangeburg County officials did not respond to messages from the SC Daily Gazette.
Both the solar array and the data center are expected to be completed in 2027.
Rural solar concerns
This marks Silicon Ranch’s fourth renewable energy venture with Central Electric and its 18th deal with Meta totaling $22.5 billion across four states. It’s Meta’s first in the Palmetto State.
“I’m hoping this is a good deal for everyone,” Ott said. “We need to make sure any solar project built does not inflate bills for the rest of customers.”
Elsewhere in South Carolina, Silicon Ranch is developing a 200-megawatt solar farm on 2,000 acres in inland Georgetown County’s Lambertown community.
SC’s state-owned utility enacts higher rates for data centers, large users

That project, similar to other larger solar developments in rural areas across the country, has faced opposition from nearby residents. About 150 people signed a petition in 2022 opposing the project, citing loss of agriculture and timber land, loss of wildlife habitat and aesthetic impacts on the rural landscape.
Utility-scale solar accounted for more than 1,500 megawatts of power in South Carolina as of July 31, 2024, according to data from the state’s utility watchdog. The agency does not measure how much acreage solar projects take up in the state.
Ott said, luckily, Orangeburg County has an ordinance in place with rules for how solar projects can be built. For those counties that don’t have rules, legislators set them at the state level to address these concerns as part of a massive energy package passed in May.
Those rules require, for any project that takes up 13 or more acres, that solar panels be positioned 50 feet from the road and 200 feet from any homes, churches or schools. Trees and vegetation must be planted that will grow at least two feet higher than the tallest solar panel. Developers must also put up six-foot-high fences.
“I’m not opposed to solar but I want to make sure it is done the right way,” Ott said of the rules.
Silicon Ranch, according to its announcement, will plant pasture grasses and flowering plants beneficial to bees and other pollinators under and around its solar array.

Rising costs and expiring credits
Officials in Georgetown County also dinged Silicon Ranch for construction delays that put that project more than a year behind schedule. The company cited permitting issues, as well as supply delays that have plagued solar companies nationwide.
According to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, developers across the U.S. pushed back 19% of planned projects in 2023, a slight improvement over the 23% of projects delayed the year before.
With those delays have come slightly higher prices. Solar cost about $1,600 per killowatt to construct in 2022, a 1.7% increase compared to a year prior, according to federal data.
Meanwhile, the GOP megalaw signed by President Donald Trump last month ends tax credits for wind and solar projects years earlier than planned under Biden’s hallmark clean energy package of 2022.
The program offered a 30% federal tax credit tax on investments. It also included separate credits based on the amount of energy produced – 3 cents per kilowatt hour.
Under changes in the “big, beautiful” law, those projects must be up and running by the end of 2027 to qualify.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Meta-Aiken-Data-Center_Aerial_2-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-25 07:56:30.241176
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-25 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,What are baby bonds? Here’s what to know about the CT program,P.R. Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/25/ct-baby-bonds-wealth-inequality/,CT's baby bonds programs provides eligible children on HUSKY with money in a publicly funded tax-free account. Here's what to know.,"In 2021, Connecticut moved into the national spotlight with an ambitious new policy: giving babies on Medicaid $3,200 in a publicly funded tax-free account, with the state treasurer’s office holding the money in a trust until a child turns 18.
The money, state officials argued, could help children from low-income households gain an economic foothold as they come of age, giving them money that can help with a down payment on a home, fund a business or cover college expenses. And because of racial disparities in poverty in the state, the money could also help narrow Connecticut’s racial wealth gap. 
After a political back and forth over funding that delayed its launch, the Connecticut program — the first state version of a longstanding economist-backed proposal known as “baby bonds” — fully came online in July 2023. The state estimates that roughly 16,000 eligible babies will be born each year.  
Since then, baby bonds have gained increased attention across the country. Nearly a dozen pilots are active in a handful of states. And after years of failing to enact a federal baby bonds proposal long championed by U.S. Sen. Cory Booker and U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, a conservative twist on the concept known as “Trump Accounts” was passed by Congress last month. 
The shift has pushed Connecticut to the front of a growing movement, one that aims to address generational wealth, child poverty and racial inequality.
Here’s what to know about the history of Connecticut’s baby bonds program, who is eligible and how the program works. 
Why did Connecticut start baby bonds? 
Former Connecticut Treasurer Shawn Wooden has said that the goal behind Connecticut’s baby bonds program is to help close the state’s large racial wealth gap. 
That focus, according to baby bonds proponents, ensures that the most disadvantaged children in the state are able to get a leg up. A 2024 report from the advocacy group Connecticut Voices for Children found that the state is dealing with persistent racial wealth and income gaps, with the median Black and Hispanic households earning $0.63 and $0.61 respectively for every dollar the median white household makes in the state. 
The report adds that the gaps are likely contributing to recent increases in child poverty in Connecticut, which has returned to pre-pandemic levels by some estimates. 
“If we do not address wealth inequality, we hurt our economy. It’s as simple as that,” Wooden said in 2021. 
By investing in the state’s poorest children, baby bonds aim to help level the playing field by giving newborns with births covered by HUSKY, which is Connecticut’s Medicaid program, a cash investment that they can use once they turn 18. The state also hopes that the investment, which can only be accessed by Connecticut residents, will encourage families and young recipients to stay in the state. 
Connecticut’s baby bonds program officially started in 2023 after the state created the Connecticut Baby Bonds Trust. The trust has been funded with roughly $400 million from a state reserve fund, allowing it to cover 12 years of investments.
Who is eligible for baby bonds?
In Connecticut, not every baby born in the state is eligible for baby bonds. Rather, the program focuses on children born into HUSKY-covered households, some of the lowest income households in the state. In 2025, children in a family of four making less than $64,622 are eligible for HUSKY. The eligibility limit increases to $84,555 for a family of four with a pregnant individual in the household.
Under Connecticut’s program, a family doesn’t need to apply for baby bonds. If a household is enrolled in HUSKY at the time of a child’s birth then the child is automatically enrolled in the state’s baby bonds program and receives the initial $3,200 deposit. 
Eligible recipients must also be born on or after July 1, 2023 to receive any money. A child who only meets one of the above criteria would not be eligible for the state’s baby bonds program. 
An eligible birth is all that is needed to receive an account. If a child leaves HUSKY as they grow older they would still receive a baby bonds account if they were eligible and enrolled when they were born. 
Having a baby bonds account will not affect eligibility for other public benefits programs in the state. 
How do baby bonds work?
The state treasurer’s office will manage the accounts until a recipient comes of age. 
A baby bonds account cannot be touched by an eligible recipient until they are between the ages of 18 and 30. Before withdrawing money, a recipient must complete a state-approved financial literacy course and will need to prove Connecticut residency. Recipients are then able to spend money on a series of approved “asset-building” expenses, including a home down payment, starting a business or investing in education or retirement. 
According to the state treasurer’s office, the money invested into a baby bonds account is expected to grow from the $3,200 deposit  to somewhere between $10,000 and $24,000 by the time the account can be accessed. More information on how to file a baby bonds claim will be released in the future as the first eligible recipients get closer to adulthood. 
My child qualifies for the baby bonds program. How do I get information?
According to the state treasurer’s website, families with a baby bonds eligible newborn will receive information about the state program in hospital birthing packets. State Treasurer Erick Russell explained that his office is also still building out numerous outreach programs, including its already-active CT Baby Bonds Ambassador initiative, to help communities learn about the baby bonds program. 
Families who want to stay up to date on what is happening with baby bonds are encouraged to sign up for updates with the treasurer’s office. Families with a baby bonds-eligible child are also encouraged to keep their contact and address information current with the Connecticut Department of Social Services. 
How are Trump Accounts different? 
In July, President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law. The tax and spending law also includes a measure creating “Trump Accounts,” a $1,000 savings account created for every child with a social security number born between 2025 and 2028. 
While the federal Trump Accounts seem similar to baby bonds, proponents of the latter argue that the new federal program, which does not account for wealth disparities or target lower income households in any way, will likely prove ineffective at addressing wealth gaps. In fact, because families will be allowed to contribute additional money to the accounts (something that the Connecticut program does not allow), it is possible that the accounts could actually widen wealth disparities.
“It’s important to note that baby bonds are really about addressing wealth inequality,” Russell said last month. “And that is not what the Trump accounts are designed to do.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_3028-1024x939.jpg,,,2025-08-25 07:56:30.241176

,New Jersey Monitor,2025-08-25 11:05:19+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,Minimal savings achieved by NJ law allowing sick inmates to die at home,Dana DiFilippo,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/08/25/minimal-savings-achieved-by-nj-law-allowing-sick-inmates-to-die-at-home/,"Five years after lawmakers passed a compassionate release law, few have seen release and little savings have been achieved, records show.","Five years after lawmakers passed a compassionate release law, few have seen release and little savings have been achieved, records show. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)When New Jersey lawmakers passed a law in 2020 meant to free more gravely ill people from prison so they could die at home, they also ordered state corrections officials to reinvest any savings into programs that aid reentry and reduce recidivism.
Five years later, officials have yet to do so.
Seven seriously ill people have been freed from state prisons since 2021 under the compassionate release law, cutting a combined 1,849 days off their sentences and saving the system, by the Department of Corrections’ own estimate, $71,585. But that money remains in departmental coffers, unspent.
“Why are they holding on to the money?” asked Chino Ortiz, co-founder of the Returning Citizens Support Group. “If I had $71,000 and it was unrestricted, I would use it to help people with housing, because housing is a big issue, you know, getting people into stable, affordable housing.”
Christopher Greeder, a department spokesman, said officials do plan to spend the savings on recidivism reduction programs for women, but he did not answer questions about what programs and when the money would be spent. Legislators in 2020 directed department officials to set such savings aside in a designated “Corrections Rehabilitation and Crime Prevention Fund.” Greeder said the money is there, but spokesman Daniel Sperrazza declined to provide financial statements for the fund.
The unspent savings are just one way the 2020 law has not worked the way legislators intended.
The law replaced a 1997 medical release statute under which hardly anyone got released. But the newer law has not had much more success, averaging just over one person a year freed.
That makes little sense to prison reformers, who say health care costs soar as the prison population grays while recidivism risks fall as people age.
“Continuing to incarcerate very elderly people means that the public is throwing many millions of dollars every single year at a system that pays officers’ salaries to monitor people who do not pose a public safety risk, while investing in health care that is negligent and doesn’t actually provide that person their constitutionally guaranteed care,” said Wanda Bertram of the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit that does research on the criminal justice system. “It’s a total mess.”

Department officials placed blame on judges, who ultimately decide whether to free the people the department deems eligible. Thirty-six people met eligibility requirements in the past five years, but judges did not approve 26 of them for release (another three await court decisions), according to departmental data. To be eligible, a person must have a terminal illness or be permanently physically incapacitated by a medical condition they didn’t have when sentenced and that requires 24-hour care.
Despite the low numbers, the department supports compassionate release, Greeder said.
“People over the age of 55 make up a growing share of the prison population,” he said. “At the same time, more individuals are living with serious and complex medical conditions, need long-term care, or meet the medical criteria for compassionate release. Caring for these individuals is costly over time, which makes it important to have policies that reflect compassion while using resources wisely.”
 Questionable calculations?

Prison costs have climbed steadily in recent years, with the annual cost per incarcerated person in the current fiscal year projected to be $74,152, according to budget documents. That’s up from about $50,000 per person five years ago.
By that math, freeing seven people would save the system over a half-million dollars a year.
But the $71,585 officials instead calculated as savings is a far cry from the “significant amounts of money in medical costs” state lawmakers in 2020 predicted the compassionate release law would save.

 
 

The 2020 law required the department to report annually to the Legislature on compassionate release savings. The New Jersey Monitor obtained those reports through public records requests.


They show that in tallying compassionate release savings, corrections officials omitted fixed costs, like staff salaries, fuel and utilities, maintenance, and other things unaffected by minor fluctuations in the prison population. Without fixed costs, the cost savings of reducing the prison population by one person was just $3,975 a year, or almost $11 a day, in the 2024 fiscal year, officials wrote in their most recent report to legislators.


Department officials also used the average health care cost for all incarcerated people to assess the health care savings of those freed on compassionate release, even though incarcerated people in dire health typically require specialized care that can balloon those costs. For the 2024 fiscal year, the average health care cost per person was $10,405 a year, or $28 a day, according to the reports.


Surraya Johnson, director of the criminal justice reform program at the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice, questioned the department’s savings calculations. The seriously ill and incapacitated people who would be eligible for compassionate release require much more and costlier care than the average incarcerated person, she noted.


“We would anticipate the number being substantially higher than the $71,000 number. And we would expect that those funds would have been reinvested back into helping folks reintegrate into (the) community,” Johnson said. “The lack of transparency about where these funds are going is very troubling.”


Whatever the true savings, $71,585 could do a lot to ease reentry for people leaving prison, Ortiz said. Since 2017, his group has covered the costs of housing, transportation, job uniforms, food, medication, and more to help former inmates in Essex, Union, Passaic, and Hudson counties, he said. The group’s most recent 990 tax filing shows its 2023 annual budget was less than $22,000, but it recently received almost $700,000 in public funding and foundation grants to expand its work, Ortiz said.

 Obstacles to compassionate release
While New Jersey could save more if more people were freed on compassionate release, it’s tough to quantify exactly how many eligible people remain behind bars or have been rejected as ineligible.
To get compassionate release, incarcerated people must be medically evaluated by prison health care providers and be granted a certificate of eligibility from the department. Superior Court judges then decide whether to grant their release.
Corrections officials did not respond to the New Jersey Monitor’s questions on how many people have applied for consideration. The department also denied a public records request for those applications, citing health privacy restrictions.
Peter McAleer, a courts spokesman, said the court system does not track compassionate release cases.
Almost 1,100 people now incarcerated in New Jersey state prisons are 60 or older, departmental data shows.

New Jersey isn’t alone in its low compassionate release numbers.
Most states rarely use it, limit it to situations of impending death and dire health, and have adopted laws and processes “so complex and nontransparent that even prison management does not know how to use it,” said Julie B. Cramer, a former UCLA law professor and author of a paper on compassionate release published last year in the Alabama Law Review.
Confusion about New Jersey’s law has resulted in several court challenges, driving the state Supreme Court to step in as the ultimate arbiter. Justices have clarified what permanent physical incapacitation means, allowed judges to deny compassionate release to eligible applicants in “extraordinary cases” such as crimes against the government, and decreed that eligible applicants convicted of especially “heinous cruelty” can be barred too.
New Jersey’s law doesn’t contain such categorical bars, and Cramer rejects them too.
“It comes back to what you think jail is for. If you think it’s for retribution, you probably believe those people should die in prison. But if you think it’s for rehabilitation, you should be for eventual release, no matter what,” Cramer said. “It shouldn’t matter, really, if it was murder, because the idea is we’re sending you to this place where you’re going to get rehabilitated.”
 Following the feds’ lead
In 2018, federal lawmakers passed the First Step Act, which expanded compassionate release by allowing people to bypass the Bureau of Prisons and apply directly to judges for release.
In 2023, policymakers amended the law to expand it further, allowing judges to release people for “extraordinary and compelling” reasons, which could include unusually long sentences or law changes that created disparities between the sentence imposed and what would be imposed today.
The changes boosted federal compassionate release figures from roughly 21 people each year before the 2018 law to thousands since its passage, Cramer said.
States could see similar gains if they follow federal lawmakers’ lead by removing corrections and parole officials as the gatekeepers of compassionate release, expanding eligibility beyond people who are permanently incapacitated or dying, and rejecting categorical bars, Cramer said.
Most elderly people in prison are serving life sentences for serious crimes, so excluding lifers or people convicted of certain offenses from compassionate release “hamstrings” the law and ensures the number of people freed will remain low, Bertram agreed.
“That’s just a backdoor way of rolling the law back entirely,” Bertram said.
Transparency is key to improving the law’s implementation to ensure it works the way lawmakers intended, said Mary Price, senior counsel at FAMM. The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit advocates for expanding compassionate release and gave New Jersey a grade of C+ in 2022 for its policies on the issue.
“If you’re only getting out one or two people a year, that’s certainly not what was intended,” Price said. “So I would hope that lawmakers and agency personnel who are responsible for these programs are taking a hard look at what’s not working here.”

This commentary is by Habib Meiloud of central Vermont.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Habib Meiloud: A response regarding H.310.","I recently read Mark Treinkman’s letter to the editor, “Clearing up misconceptions about H.310,” as a response to my own, titled “Do not support bill H.310.” I would like to clear up some misconceptions about my critique of the bill.
First, the notion that bill H.310 does not mention Israel is incorrect. While it never says it outright, it does allude to it. For example, it includes in the definition of antisemitic harassment with “negative negative references to Jewish customs or the right to self-determination in the Jewish people’s ancestral and indigenous homeland.” The first part on customs is understandable, and I support it wholeheartedly as someone with Jewish ancestors. However, the mention of self-determination is not a protection against antisemitism but rather anti-Zionism. 
A part of the “ancestral homeland” of the Jewish people — as mentioned in the bill — is where the Palestinians, both in the West Bank and Gaza, are currently residing, their homes blown away and then re-settled. 
I worry that any critique of Israeli settlements in both parts of Palestine will be seen as a “negative reference” to the aforementioned “self-determination” in the ancestral homeland. Perhaps the bill is not malicious, but it is vague and lacks enough nuance that it opens the door for infringement on such a contentious issue. 
From my own anecdotal experience, even without this bill, one has to be very careful in how one critiques Israel to a degree that is unique among political discourse. I have no issue bolstering protections against Jewish students against antisemitism; that is what is right. Nobody should suffer attacks against parts of their identity. However, the notion of the Jewish people having the right to self-determination in their “ancestral and indigenous homeland” is inherently political. Instead of stomping out those critiques in schools, we should steer towards teaching our youth to have the maturity to critique ideas instead of people. 
Those skills will stop hate; ambiguous legislation will not.

Brionna Aho, communications director for Ferguson, said Fathi is using accrued and unpaid leave for the six-month sabbatical. Aho did not respond to questions about whether Fathi requested the lengthy break or if she is expected to return for the 2026 legislative session.
Fathi did not return phone calls or texts requesting comment.
In an email, Ferguson said Fathi has been “a crucial member of my team” since 2019. She previously served as Ferguson’s policy director when he was attorney general.
“After six years and a particularly intense legislative session, in which she took on more than one full-time job, she’s taking a break,” he said. “I’m happy to support her. I appreciate our talented legislative and policy teams, who are already hard at work ensuring we’ll be prepared for the next legislative session.”
Deputy Policy Director Kenneth Martin has been appointed interim policy director.
Fathi, named to the governor’s executive leadership team on Nov. 7, oversaw a 20-person staff responsible for developing policy initiatives in support of Ferguson’s agenda. There are four deputy policy directors and 16 advisers who interact with lawmakers, local and state agency officials, and constituents in crafting and deploying policies.
Her lengthy resume of public service includes working for King County, the Seattle Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs and as a legislative aide to former Seattle City Council member Mike O’Brien, according to online biographies. In 2013, Fathi made The Stranger’s list of Smartest People in Seattle Politics. 
Exits of multiple high-ranking members of Ferguson’s administration have marked the governor’s first eight months in office.
Legislative Director Joyce Bruce, who also worked in the attorney general’s office under Ferguson, resigned in March, not long after her deputy, Shawn Lewis, had quit. That left the first-term Democratic governor without a legislative team in the critical final stages of the session, as lawmakers finalized the budget and ironed wrinkles out of major legislation.
Also in March, Mike Webb, Ferguson’s chief strategy officer and most trusted adviser, resigned amid complaints that he fomented a toxic workplace.
He left less than a week after Bruce’s departure. She worked under Webb’s direction in the governor’s office, and before that in the Office of the Attorney General. Several lawmakers, most of them women, voiced concerns privately at that time that Webb’s management style may have contributed to Bruce’s decision to leave. 
Aho did not respond to questions about whether the circumstances surrounding Webb contributed to Fathi’s decision to take extended leave.
In May, Ferguson hired Debbie Driver as his new legislative director. Driver served as a transportation policy adviser to former Gov. Jay Inslee, and also worked previously as the Washington State Department of Transportation legislative relations director.
The governor also appointed Shane Esquibel as chief of staff. Esquibel had served as chief operations officer since Ferguson took office.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2883-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-25 07:56:30.241176

(Courtesy photo)Saturday, June 14, 2025 was another busy day for 47-year-old Kevin McKelvey. The Indianapolis father of three was a professor, poet, writer, activist and farmer engaged in the community “in ways writ large and in smaller ways, too,” said friend and colleague Barney Haney. 
He was the kind of person “who wanted to give you his tomato plants.”
But at ten minutes past noon, as McKelvey was driving his 12-year-old son home from martial arts practice north along Meridian Street near 64th, his Honda Fit was hit head on by the speeding driver of a stolen Kia Sportage SUV. The suspect, Alexander Mitchell, had been weaving in and out of Meridian Street traffic trying to elude a southbound pursuit by Carmel police before he crossed the centerline in front of McKelvey’s Fit.










A pursuit should not begin, nor should it be continued, when the need for immediate apprehension is very low and the totality of risk (from the chase) to public safety is very high


– Carmel Police Department pursuit policy


McKelvey’s car spun out on the rain-slick road and hit another southbound car, driven by Guilia Carloni. All four victims survived the crash with what seemed like non-fatal injuries. But McKelvey had hit his head so hard he couldn’t recall where he was, what had happened or his phone number and insurance information, according to the Indianapolis police report.
In the days following the crash, McKelvey told friends he was grateful to be alive. In a June 26 text to one friend, he wrote, “I was just thinking a couple days ago that I’m lucky I didn’t break a femur. Onward!” 
Three days later, on June 29, he complained to his wife of severe headaches. By the time emergency crews responded, he was dead. Clots in his veins had traveled to the pulmonary arteries of both lungs and blocked the flow of blood. The Marion County Coroner’s office ruled the car accident as McKelvey’s cause of death.
Carmel Police won’t release information on the accident or the identity of the officer or officers involved while an investigation continues, the city’s corporate counsel’s office wrote in an email. But the noon-hour high-speed pursuit into Indianapolis on a rainy Saturday may have violated more than a few statewide and Carmel police guidelines.
“A pursuit should not begin, nor should it be continued, when the need for immediate apprehension is very low and the totality of risk (from the chase) to public safety is very high,” says Carmel’s 18-page pursuit policy, which was no longer available on the city’s website on Aug. 15. Officers in Carmel are also instructed to give “special consideration” to traffic congestion, time of day, road conditions and the officer’s familiarity with the surrounding neighborhood. In 2016, Indiana repealed a state law that classified carjacking as a violent felony.
Court records show that Mitchell, a 24-year-old Carmel resident, had a history of drug possession, drug dealing and traffic violations but no arrests for violent crimes. He was facing charges of narcotics dealing stemming from a November 2023 arrest and had failed to show up for a March 2025 court hearing. After the accident, he was charged with resisting law enforcement, criminal recklessness, reckless driving, unlawful carrying of a gun and driving with a suspended license. Whether Mitchell showed his gun prior to the chase is not addressed in the court records. The case is pending in Marion Superior Court.
Alarming Hoosier statistics
Indiana has a long history of police chases ending in deaths, and despite stricter police guidelines on when the risk of a pursuit is justified, the problem still exists. 
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), at least 86 people — bystanders, suspects and law enforcement officers — died as the result of high-speed police chases in Indiana from 1993 through 2003. An Indianapolis Star investigation found that, in only about 3% of those cases, the suspect faced violent felony charges after the chase while the most frequent charge was resisting arrest, which grew out of the chase itself.
Starting in 2023, Indiana legislators set a statewide minimum safety standard for high-speed police chases. To justify a pursuit, police must consider the potential danger if the suspect isn’t apprehended immediately, the violation the suspect is accused of, and the imminent danger to the public as well as the time of day, traffic conditions and visibility and the officer’s familiarity with surroundings and population density. 
  A portion of the state’s guidance on minimum standards for law enforcement vehicle pursuits.
But the most recent data available from the NHTSA show that in 2023 alone Indiana recorded 18 fatalities caused by police chases, ranking 10th nationwide and tying with Ohio, which has almost 5 million more people. Nationally, 470 people were killed during pursuits in 2023.
That same year, following a spike in chase fatalities during the pandemic, The Police Executive Research Forum, a national advisory council on policing standards, recommended prohibiting pursuits unless a violent crime has been committed or the suspect poses an immediate threat to the public.
“It’s about the sanctity of life and balancing the risk to everyone,” Chuck Wexler, executive director of PERF, told Associated Press at the time. “Police officers die in pursuits. Suspects die in pursuits and even citizens can be injured or die.” 
Efforts to restrict police pursuits were part of the reforms many police departments introduced following the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests. Some jurisdictions are now loosening their pursuit policies again as police complain the laws handcuff them in apprehending criminals and protecting communities. 
In 2021, Washington State’s Democratic legislature passed one of the most restrictive pursuit laws in the country, permitting police chases only when an officer has “probable cause” — the higher standard of evidence needed to make an arrest or search — that a suspect committed a violent crime, a sex offense, was driving intoxicated or fleeing arrest. Three years later, a ballot initiative financed by wealthy conservatives overturned that law and allowed police chases for “reasonable suspicion” — the lower standard used for brief stops and questioning — that a crime of any kind was committed. 
“Smart” police departments limit chases to violent criminal suspects or those who present an imminent danger to the public, said Geoffrey Alpert, a University of South Carolina criminology professor who has conducted research on high-risk police activities for the past 30 years. “What do we know about this (suspect)? Did he rape a woman? Did he kill someone? Did he shoot someone at Walmart? For crimes like that, we as the public understand our risk level will be increased because we do really want to apprehend those people. Now you still have to balance that risk. For example, even if you have a serious violent crime, are you going to chase someone to a grade school at 3 o’ clock in the afternoon when school’s letting out?”
But even the strictest pursuit guidelines are meaningless without adequate training, supervision and accountability for police officers, Alpert said. “We see from time to time officers just either not making good decisions, or getting carried away, or both. That’s why you have training. That’s why you have policies and supervision. And when you see someone (violating policies), you really want to make sure that it doesn’t happen again. There has to be a very serious and comprehensive investigation into how that happened.”
McKelvey’s legacy
A July 11 memorial tribute to McKelvey drew a standing-room-only crowd of about 500 family, friends and students that overflowed The Tube Factory art gallery and spilled outside onto the patio. McKelvey was a professor of English at the University of Indianapolis, founder of the student-run Etchings Press, a board member of the Central Indiana Land Trust, and cofounder of UIndy’s Master of Arts in Social Practice program, a graduate degree focused on using artistic practices to address social issues and engage with communities. 
McKelvey also started the UIndy Gardens to grow fresh vegetables on campus for easing local food deserts and volunteered for Second Story, a youth writing program at Big Car, a community art and design collaborative. He regularly delivered his homegrown tomato or pepper plants to dozens of his gardening friends.

“I don’t think he spent a lot of time sleeping or resting,” said Jim Walker, executive director of Big Car. “Kevin was always busy. He loved life and was just full of energy. He was doing a million things, but he was wanting to do a million more things.”
McKelvey was beloved among his students, said Molly Martin, chair of UIndy’s English department. “He was an excellent individual mentor. He knew when to push. He knew how to guide. He knew how to get the best out of students. And because he was so good at that, a lot of students really built relationships with him.” 
At the end of her tribute, McKelvey’s wife, Lakshmi Hasanadka, told the memorial gathering at Big Car: “Call your representatives, use Kevin’s name. Tell them to make sure that no one else’s father will end up the same way.” 
Hasanadka declined comment for this story through her attorney, Bill Winingham, who said he is in process of filing a lawsuit in the case.
State Sen. Fady Qaddoura. D-Indianapolis, said in an email he is considering the introduction of a number of new legislative restrictions on police pursuits, including pre-approval from a district supervisor in the case of non-violent suspects or those not posing an immediate public threat, as well as continual evaluation of all guidelines throughout the chase.
“I will be working with state and local law enforcement agencies to ensure these reforms are practical and effective,” the statement said.

Rural residents will be hardest hit by looming health insurance premium increases, according to a new report. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)A combination of Trump administration policies will make health care coverage more expensive for people who purchase plans from health insurance marketplaces — and rural residents will be hit the hardest, according to a new analysis.
Researchers from the Century Foundation say Trump administration policies — especially its refusal to ask Congress to extend Biden-era tax credits that are set to expire at the end of this year — will boost out-of-pocket premiums by 93% in the 32 states that allow the federal government to operate their Affordable Care Act insurance marketplaces. New rules and tariffs will have a smaller impact.
Rural county residents in those states will see an increase of 107%, while residents of urban counties will pay 89% more, according to the analysis by the Century Foundation, a left-leaning research nonprofit.
Insurers participating in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces are proposing a median premium increase of 18% for 2026 — the biggest jump since 2018 and 11 points more than the growth from 2024 to this year. That bump would come on top of the increase resulting from the expiration of the tax credits and the other policy changes.
About 2.8 million people who are enrolled in marketplace plans in the 32 states live in rural counties, including 776,000 adults between the ages of 55 to 64 and more than 223,000 children, according to the Century Foundation.
“Rural residents tend to be older. They may be more likely to have chronic illness at the same time,” said Jeanne Lambrew, director of health care reform at the foundation. “It costs more, both because they have somewhat greater needs and less access to health care.”

The researchers calculated that average annual premiums for rural residents will increase by $760 — 28% more than the expected average increase for urban residents. States where rural enrollees are expected to see the highest cost increases are Wyoming ($1,943), Alaska ($1,835), and Illinois ($1,700).
Many of the states with a large number of rural residents have chosen not to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, meaning many people who earn between 100% and 138% of the federal poverty level, between $15,650 and $21,597 for an individual, get their coverage from an insurance marketplace, Lambrew said.
Of the seven states where 10% or more of rural residents are enrolled in marketplace plans (Alabama, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Wyoming), only two — Nebraska and North Carolina — have expanded Medicaid.
State officials in Pennsylvania recently advised residents who use the marketplace that they should closely examine the plans that are available.
“This year, even more than previous years, Pennsylvanians should consider shopping around to find the best plans to meet their individual needs, at a price that makes sense for their current financial situation,” Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner Michael Humphreys said in a statement released at the beginning of this month.
Lambrew said the increases will force many people to forgo insurance altogether.
“It’s harmful for those individuals in terms of their own health and life expectancy. It’s harmful for our providers, because they’re now dealing with people who are sicker and in the wrong settings, and it’s kind of expensive for our society,” Lambrew said.
“We know health insurance matters, so having these large potential increases on uninsured Americans is distressing.”

Authorities in the West African nation threw him in prison because of his sexual orientation, he said. After his release, he feared that if he stayed in the country, he would be killed.
B., who is now 39 and who asked that he be identified only by his initial because he still has family in Cameroon, arrived in the United States with practically nothing. Since he was granted asylum last year, he has been able to use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, to help him get by.
But now most refugees and asylees, who entered the country legally, including B., are no longer eligible for food stamps. The change is part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the giant federal domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4.
“I think it’s unfair. I understand that there are some people who abuse the system,” B. told Stateline. “There are also people who are in need. And cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.”
SNAP, which is funded by the federal government but administered by the states, helps families and individuals with lower incomes supplement their grocery budgets. The program serves an average of 42 million people a month.

Supporters of the change note that refugees and asylees can get permits to work, and that they have other sources of support.
“It’s not like they have been dropped off in this country with no support system,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration rules.
“They have sponsoring organizations that are helping them get settled and they have work authorization. So they really should be moving forward towards self-sufficiency with support right out of the starting gate. And they should be moving ahead to obtain green cards,” she added, referring to the cards that signify permanent residency.
Vaughan cited a federal grant program that reimburses states and nonprofit organizations for financial aid and health care coverage they provide to refugees.
But critics argue that asylees and refugees, who are extensively vetted and have a legitimate path to citizenship, can wait years for a green card, which entitles them to a wider array of benefits.
They also say community organizations that provide aid to asylees and refugees are stretched thin. Without food stamps, they say, many refugees and their families would not have enough to eat.




Cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.


– B., a Cameroonian asylee



“SNAP is an incredibly fundamental program for this population that comes to the United States, really, with very little, if anything,” said Nicolas Palazzo, a policy counsel at the global humanitarian and refugee advocacy organization HIAS. “These are people who literally had to flee — many times overnight — with nothing, but, you know, a pair of clothes in a backpack.”
Palazzo also said SNAP is not a “handout” to refugees or asylees. Rather, he said, it’s a “smart and moral investment” that protects all communities and strengthens the economy, offering people a foundation for self-sufficiency.
“Stripping critical food assistance forces refugees and asylees into the shadows of informal work, labor exploitation and hunger that weakens our workforce and denigrates our moral obligations,” Palazzo said.
‘Nowhere else to go’ 
B. said he applied immediately for asylum when he arrived in the U.S. in 2016, but that he had to wait months for a work permit. He survived by doing odd jobs, such as cleaning homes and delivering food, and got by on very little. It wasn’t until late 2024, when he finally won his asylum case, that he was eligible to get any public benefits, including food stamps.
Eligibility for food stamps came at a critical time for B., as a car accident had prevented him from making food deliveries.
“While not having income, it was very helpful,” B. said. “I’m somebody who if I can work, I will work. The only reason I went over there to ask is because I had nowhere else to go.”
According to a November 2024 report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, a total of 60,050 people were newly admitted to the United States as refugees in 2023, many from unstable countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria and Afghanistan.
In 2023, the nation received at least 747,000 applications for people seeking asylum from countries including Venezuela, Cuba and Colombia, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration research group. It’s a tremendous increase from the 68,000 applications received in 2013.
The new domestic policy law specifies that food stamps are still available to Cubans and Haitians who might be refugees and asylees.

As of July 2025, more than 2.2 million immigrants in the U.S. are awaiting asylum hearings or decisions after formally applying for asylum, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, an organization at Syracuse University that tracks immigration cases.
“Getting through the system was difficult,” B. said. “I had to find money. I had to find an attorney who would help me apply for my asylum case. The asylum case itself took a long time.
“I still know people who have been here for more than 10 years and never had an interview.”
‘Already stretched’ 
According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, half of all admitted refugees in 2023 were resettled across just 10 states: Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan and Washington.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 41,000 people in the state are getting SNAP benefits while not being lawful permanent residents. She says that group includes refugees and asylees.
“The concerning part there is that these are individuals who were … lawfully admitted to the country, have previously been eligible for SNAP when they need it, and now, simply because of their status, will no longer be able to receive SNAP benefits,” Guinn told Stateline. “There’s nothing we’re going to be able to do to make them eligible.”
Another change under the new law is that for the first time, states will have to pay for a portion of their food stamp programs. States will have to cover between 5% and 15% of their SNAP costs beginning in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they dole out benefits to people eligible for the program.
Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, pointed out that states that want to continue to provide SNAP benefits to refugees and asylees are free to do so — as long as they pay for it.
“If New York state doesn’t want to cut these people off, they can continue to give them something like food stamps. They just have to do it with New York state money right now,” Rector said.

But Guinn said that will be difficult. New York does offer asylum-seekers a variable amount of monthly cash assistance through its Safety Net Assistance Program, but typically recipients must be working.
In Texas, officials at the state’s health and human services agency said that as of last month, roughly 24,600 of the state’s 3.5 million SNAP recipients were refugees or asylees. A spokesperson for Maryland’s human services agency wrote in an email that the state’s SNAP program last year supported more than 10,000 refugees and asylees.
The California Department of Social Services could not provide the number of refugees and asylees receiving food stamps, but projected that a total of 74,000 noncitizens — including lawfully permanent residents, refugees and asylees — would lose eligibility under the new law.
Sherri Laigle, the director of social services at HIAS, said food banks will not be able to make up for refugees’ and asylees’ loss of SNAP benefits.
“They’re already stretched, and now we’re going to see tens of thousands of people also needing to continue to rely on these programs. Of course, there’s limited access to them. You have to have transportation. You have to be able to get there.”
B. said he would apply for food stamps again if he could, because he’s earning too little income to get by.
“There are people who are in need. I think ignoring that — it’s not human.”

Tara Peters, R-Rolla, speaks during Missouri House floor debate in May. (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications)One of the most-watched bills approved by Missouri lawmakers this year put the state back in control of the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department.
The police takeover provisions made the bill one of the most controversial of the session, and sparked a lawsuit, set for trial Nov. 5. But tucked inside, and noticed only by those watching closely, the bill also includes bipartisan provisions ending the practice of seizing assets from incarcerated people that are unrelated to their crimes.
Known as the Missouri Incarceration Reimbursement Act, the law was passed in 1988, when any idea intended to make life harder for criminals received a favorable hearing. Now, the law is viewed as a violation of property rights and a barrier to a law-abiding life.
“We need to pay our debts to society,” state Rep. Tara Peters, a Rolla Republican, said in an interview with The Independent. “Those who have paid their debt to society should have every opportunity to have a fresh start and to get out on the right foot when it comes time to go back into society.”
Peters sponsored a bill with the repeal, as did state Sen. Stephen Webber, a Columbia Democrat. It was added to the St. Louis police takeover bill to persuade Democrats in the Senate to end a filibuster.
Once enacted, it is one of two bills that will allow people under the control of the state to keep assets they would use when released. The other stops the state from taking foster children’s Social Security benefits to cover the cost of foster care.
The incarceration reimbursement law was intended to take money from inmates to cover the cost of maintaining them in prison. The most recovered over the past five years is $523,000 in fiscal 2024, while the cost of operating the Department of Corrections is greater than $1 billion.
In the fiscal year that ended June 30, efforts to enforce the act brought in only $136,000.
“People who are incarcerated by the state should not have to pay like it’s a hotel or an Airbnb,” said Amy Malinowski, director of the Missouri office of the MacArthur Justice Center. “It’s a prison. It’s the state’s responsibility to maintain those prisons, not the people who are detained there.”
Missouri has laws allowing prosecutors to seize assets gained in a criminal enterprise, and the courts can enforce restitution for stolen or damaged property as part of a sentence. The incarceration reimbursement act allows the attorney general to seek other assets, such as a family inheritance or proceeds from the sale of a house, that are unrelated to the crime.
State Rep. Brad Christ, a Republican from St. Louis County, sponsored the St. Louis police bill and chaired a committee where Peters’ bill was discussed in February. It was an easy decision to accept Democratic requests to include the repeal, he said in an interview.
“Democrats support it from a criminal justice aspect and a number of Republicans supported this, too, because it’s just basic property rights,” Christ said.
Missouri’s prisons hold about 24,000 people. In any given year, about 11,000 will be released on parole or because they have completed their sentence. The goal of prison is to punish and to prepare inmates to live within society’s rules, Christ said.
The seized money can be an important part of avoiding a return to prison, he said.
“Whatever it may be, whether it’s two grand, 20 grand or 200 grand,” Christ said, “to knock someone down a peg while they are in prison, I thought, was a little unjust after their sentence has been fulfilled.”
Under the law, people sentenced to state prison are required to make a statement of their assets when they arrive in custody and, on release, allow the department to garnish their wages for five years.
The attorney general can file a lawsuit to seize any assets found or received by the incarcerated person. 
With the repeal, the Department of Corrections is no longer requiring the statement of assets on entry, agency spokeswoman Karen Pojmann said in an email. But any current garnishments will be stopped only if the person making the payments petitions the courts to end them, she said.
At the House hearing in February, St. Louis attorney Bevis Schock, who has represented clients in civil litigation against the department, said he has won judgments that the attorney general then tried to seize. 
Schock said he believes the law is unconstitutional and expected a court would rule that way in the future. But he still urged lawmakers to act.
“I hate criminals,” Schock said. “I don’t want to help them all. I want them to go to jail, but a criminal’s property should be as sacred as the property of a non-criminal.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tara-Peters-050525-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-08-25 07:56:30.241176

The organization chose to prioritize weatherization and heat pump installation partially due to the state’s climate goals, said Director of Workforce Development Kim Rupe Lennox.

Maeve Fairfax is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
Vermonters are learning how to weatherize homes and install heat pumps for free through Vermont Adult Learning’s Energyworks programs. 
Weatherizing houses saves the average Vermont household $1,000 per year, “which might be the differential of whether they can stay in that home,” said David Justice, Associate Director at Vermont Adult Learning. 
Vermont Adult Learning partners with a state program to help income-eligible Vermonters weatherize their homes. The organization intends to grow the green workforce, improve the lives of vulnerable Vermonters and help the state reach its climate emission reduction goals.
Low-income and unemployed Vermonters are recruited to participate in trainings, said Justice. 
“So we’re actually training people that live in poverty to learn weatherization and work for a company that weatherizes homes for people living in poverty,” he said. 
The organization chose to prioritize weatherization and heat pump installation partially due to the state’s climate goals, said Director of Workforce Development Kim Rupe Lennox. To hit the Global Warming Solutions Act 2030 targets, Vermont needs to weatherize 120,000 homes between 2020 and 2030. Energyworks was created to aid this effort while supporting vulnerable residents, Rupe Lennox said.  
The trainings are usually two weeks long and free, with stipends available to participants. The schedule is jam-packed and about half of the training is hands-on: at least one week of technical training and opportunities for participants to test their skills, said Justice. 
Crucial certifications — like CPR/First aid, OSHA 10 workplace safety and gender equity training — are offered to participants. EPA 608, a certification required for jobs involving refrigerants, is available to participants during heat pump installation trainings. Job readiness skills, like resume and cover letter writing and career planning, are incorporated as well, said Justice. 
The location and timing of the trainings are chosen carefully, and Vermont Adult Learning works with employers ahead of time to try to run programs in regions where there will soon be job openings, said Justice. 
Participants must be 16 or older, and the organization aims to recruit people interested in full-time employment, said Justice. Participants come from many backgrounds: some have just graduated high school, some have worked desk jobs and want to pivot to working with their hands, and some are trying to get back into the workforce, said Rupe Lennox. 
Josh Jakab took a heat pump installation training in Rutland last March. He had worked in construction and as a restaurant manager but was looking to work in a different trade. 
Jakab heard about the training through social media. He didn’t have his heart set on heat pump installation but decided it was worth a shot — especially because there was a stipend offered. 
During the training, he workshopped his resume and afterwards applied to multiple different jobs. He settled on an Electrical Apprenticeship Program at Omega Electric, a four-year program that offers a mixture of classes and hands-on experience, Jakab said.
Though he wound up in a different trade, Jakab thought having the OSHA 10 certification was helpful in getting his job. He thought the Energyworks training showed employers he had initiative, too. 
“I think the class at least… showed I wanted to learn something and could do something other than the bare minimum of showing up to work every day,” he said.
Some Energyworks participants are New Americans. Vermont Adult Learning has programming for English Language Learners, and this demographic of students has increased over 80% in the past 2-3 years, according to Justice. Now, over a third of all current students are learning English, he said. 
Many refugees who wind up in Vermont have experience in the trades but struggle to find employment because they don’t speak English, said Justice. 
Dana Sehovic, English Language Learner Instructor for Workforce Development, holds classes in advance of trainings, teaching participants English words related to their trade. This can help New Americans get better paying jobs, “and do something that they really love and are passionate about at the same time,” said Rupe Lennox.
These jobs usually start at $22 per hour with benefits, Justice said. The profession is tough because workers are out in the elements all year. But many take pride in doing a job that others would be unwilling to take on, and helping people stay in their homes, Justice said. 
Participants arrive with vastly different levels of experience, said Justice. Some need more instruction before they are ready to work, and are often directed to longer-term training programs. Others are ready to start entry-level jobs immediately and are usually referred to an employer partner willing to hire past participants. Some have the skills but can’t work because of other challenges in their lives, said Justice.
“A lot of our participants are in poverty and some of them are in unstable housing,” said Justice. 
Part of the organization’s role is “working with them to think about other services in the community that might be available to support them, and also what their plan B, C, D is should transportation or childcare fall through,” he said. 
After each training, participants fill out a survey. The feedback is usually positive. 
“A lot of times it was like, ‘Hey, I didn’t even know that I could do this. And here I am, walking away with the skillsets that I need and feeling really confident to enter the workforce within this sector,’” Rupe Lennox said.

(Photo courtesy of Revolution Wind)Revolution Wind, Rhode Island’s first large-scale offshore wind project, was put on ice by the Trump administration Friday, which ordered developers to immediately stop construction.
The project is already 80% completed, with 45 of its 65 turbines in the water off Block Island’s coastline, Orsted, the Danish co-development company, said in a statement Friday night.
Since President Donald Trump took office in January, renewable energy, including offshore wind, has come under threat, with major setbacks and cancellations in federal approvals for new and ongoing projects. But Revolution Wind had stayed afloat, having already secured the last of its necessary state and federal permits two years ago. As recently as April, developers expected a 2026 completion date, after which it would begin power to Rhode Island and Connecticut. The 704 megawatt nameplate capacity, 400 megawatts of which was under contract for purchase by Rhode Island, would provide enough electricity to power 350,000 homes across both states.
Matthew Giacona, the acting director for the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which oversees federal permitting for offshore wind projects, cited Trump’s Jan. 20 memo indefinitely pausing federal reviews on offshore wind as the reason why the administration was stopping construction on Revolution Wind.
“In particular, BOEM is seeking to address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States and prevention of interference with reasonable uses of exclusive economic zone, the high seas, and the territorial seas,” Giacona wrote in the letter to Orsted.
Orsted in a statement Friday night confirmed it was complying with the federal stop-work order while “evaluating all options” to proceed with construction.
“This includes engagement with relevant permitting agencies for any necessary clarification or resolution as well as through potential legal proceedings, with the aim being to proceed with continued project construction towards [a commercial operation date] in the second half of 2026,” the company said in a statement.
The company also noted the financial implications of the halt to construction. Like wind farm developers nationwide, Orsted has seen project costs rise amid supply chain slowdowns and inflationary price hikes. As part of its second-quarter earnings released on Aug. 11, Orsted announced it was seeking $9.4 billion from shareholders to help pay for another offshore wind project planned off the New York coastline amid “hostility” from the Trump administration.
Meaghan Wims, a spokesperson for Orsted, declined to comment beyond the company’s statement.

‘Unwarranted, unacceptable, and bizarre’
The abrupt halt to construction prompted a wave of criticism from state and federal officials, who emphasized the project’s critical role in meeting state environmental mandates under the 2021 Act on Climate law, along with economic and energy affordability concerns.
“The Trump administration’s stop-work order on Revolution Wind undermines efforts to expand our energy supply, lower costs for families and businesses, and strengthen regional reliability,” Gov. Dan McKee said in a statement Saturday. “This action puts hundreds of union jobs at risk by halting a project that is 80% complete—just steps away from powering more than 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut. At a time when we should be moving forward with solutions for energy, jobs, and affordability, the Trump administration is choosing delay and disruption. We are working with our partners in Connecticut to pursue every avenue to reverse this decision. Revolution Wind is key to Rhode Island’s economic development, energy security, and long-term affordability for our residents.”
Without the project, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha warned the state’s requirement to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 was “dead in the water.”
“With the significant investments made in this project already and its obvious benefit to our economy and climate, the Trump Administration’s attempt to halt it can only be characterized as bizarre,” Neronha said in a statement. “Along with our neighboring states, we are evaluating our avenues to reverse it.”
Rhode Island’s federal delegation blasted the Trump administration, calling the order “unwarranted and unacceptable” in a joint statement.
The U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management did not immediately respond to questions regarding the timing of its notice, issued over eight months after the executive order it cites.
Two days earlier, on Aug. 20, attorneys for a Rhode Island nonprofit representing local fishermen asked federal regulators to suspend work on three area offshore wind farms — Revolution Wind, SouthCoast Wind and South Fork Wind — citing violations of federal safety and environmental protections. Parts of the petition were shared with Rhode Island Current.
Marisa Desautel, a partner at Desautel Browning Law, which submitted the petition on behalf of East Farm Commercial Fisheries Center, said she received an email response that the petition was received, but no further communication.
The fishing community has been at odds with offshore wind developers for years, railing against alleged threats to their livelihood and safety. In Rhode Island, the disputes have taken center state in reviews by the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council, which gets a say in federal offshore wind projects within 30 miles of the state’s coastline. The CRMC has ultimately approved every offshore project to come before it, including Revolution Wind, though it has sought to set up guardrails and financial compensation for fishermen.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)By Rayman Solomon, Robert Williams, and John Farmer
The New Jersey Supreme Court has yet to grant the request from petitioners in the case known as In Re Malinowski to review the Appellate Division decision adverse to them. As longtime and respectful students of the court, we would be surprised if it did not. At a time when democracy is being eroded throughout our country, the court has the opportunity to reaffirm the New Jersey Constitution’s strong commitment to freedom of association and voter choice — both bedrocks of democracy.
The Malinowski case, arising from an election several years ago but still raising an issue that is important and continuing, challenges New Jersey’s 20th-century prohibition on the plural nomination of candidates by inter-party coalitions. In such a system, jointly nominated candidates appear on the line of any nominating party and votes cast for them on any line are counted in their total support against rivals. Such ballot-line “fusion” — the 19th-century term for plural nomination — was once universal in the United States and is still practiced in Connecticut and New York. In New Jersey and across the land in the 19th century, it helped underwrite minor-party efforts to abolish slavery and, later, improve working conditions.
Ballot-line fusion is the distinctive American way to permit more diversity in our election system. One might think of it as the American version of proportional representation. It accepts our deeply unrepresentative single-member district system, with “winners” generally decided by plurality and “taking all” of representation within that. Our current system discourages minor parties and the citizens who might support them by forcing them into a difficult, if not impossibly unfair, choice. From the point of view of such citizens, a vote for a third-party candidate will almost certainly be “wasted,” since the candidate typically has no chance at winning a plurality. Worse still, it might “spoil” the election by denying their next-best candidate a victory and elevating someone they really oppose.
Still, accepting these severe constraints on their growth, minor parties have often flourished under ballot-line fusion because it allows their supporters to vote for their values without wasting their votes or electing someone who is less favored by these voters. This obtains on both the left and the right: FDR depended on fusion votes from the American Labor Party to carry New York State in 1940, and 40 years later, Ronald Reagan needed the votes from the New York Conservatives to get over the finish line there. But in New Jersey, as in almost all other states, the major parties banned fusion voting more than a century ago in order to consolidate their control. Regardless of one’s political sympathies, fusion allows and even encourages third parties to play a constructive and meaningful role in American politics, and our country would be better for its reinstatement.
The Appellate Division opinion on which the Malinowski petitioners seek New Jersey Supreme Court review was a disappointingly confused one. That court acknowledged the irrelevance of the widely criticized U.S. Supreme Court opinion in Timmons v. Twin Cities New Party, which had held that the U.S. Constitution did not bar state prohibitions of the practice of cross-endorsements by political parties. That decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, deferring to the states, is not binding on state courts interpreting their own state constitutions. Yet, the Appellate Division committed the same type of error as the court in Timmons. Without any evidence whatsoever from the New Jersey secretary of state, and contrary to the vast evidence from actual experience that the Malinowski plaintiffs supplied in their several-hundred-page record, the appellate court accepted the secretary of state’s claims that adopting ballot-line fusion would generate pervasive voter confusion, inspire fraud, and otherwise undermine “public confidence” in the present system.
What is most striking today, in rereading the Timmons 6-3 decision — authored by then-Chief Justice Rehnquist, with a blistering dissent from Justice Stevens — was the majority’s confidence in how well our two-party system serves the country. Today, 80% of voters say they want more than just two choices, but they must be meaningful choices. The hyper-partisan polarization of the two-party duopoly has led us to the effective collapse of any legislative or judicial check on the threats to democracy brought about by an unprecedented and seemingly limitless expansion of executive power.
Throughout our history, ballot-line fusion has been a modest but potent tool for injecting new ideas and new leaders into our politics. It pushes back against the hyperpartisan politics that define our era as it incentivizes major parties to form coalitions with minor ones. We can’t know if the New Jersey Moderate Party will end up building a voting base big enough to force the major parties to bargain, but they should surely have the right to try.
History looks fondly on the pre-Civil War era parties — Liberty, Free Soil, Anti-Nebraska, and others — that forced the Whigs and even some Democrats to stop ignoring slavery. Eventually, the Republican Party emerged from the roots planted by these minor, fusion parties. Fusion is indeed as American as apple pie, and its recovery would be very good for this nation’s soul.
We look forward to the New Jersey Supreme Court’s consideration of the history and promise of fusion voting presented in the Malinowski case. The wisdom of the New Jersey Constitution’s emphasis on the preeminence of freedom of association and free expression of voters, parties, and candidates would once again place New Jersey in the forefront of a critical opportunity to advance and strengthen American democracy.

(Getty Images)In just a few days, I’ll move into an affordable independent-living neighborhood for seniors in Valparaiso. I was on a waiting list for three years.
Waiting is a roller coaster. At first, you dream, plan, and purge belongings with a purpose. But as the months tick by, the excitement fades. You stop packing. The goal feels out of reach. You start wondering if maybe it’s easier to stay put and try to manage a large property — even if it’s more than you can handle.
Analysis finds that Indiana’s housing affordability gap is growing

There is enough to deal with as one ages, but for many, independence is everything. I was fortunate to be physically able to live in my home, but many seniors struggle. A neighbor I know sleeps on his first floor couch because he can no longer climb stairs. And while you’d think downsizing would save money, today it often means higher costs, fewer options, and more stress.
As focused as I was on my own dilemma, I knew I was not alone. As a new member of the Social Justice Committee at Christ Lutheran Church, we worked with eight area congregations under the direction of We Make Indiana, an organization that supports people of faith and conscience to create change. We did our own research, met with local officials, and brainstormed ways of tackling the crisis. We then began to plan a large public meeting to talk about solutions to the housing crisis and invite our local leaders to lead. Our focus was “Housing for All” – seniors, first-time home owners, renters who need to be close to their jobs, and the growing homeless population in Porter County.
On a Saturday in May, the Porter County Housing Assembly drew a crowd of close to 200 area residents. We shared personal stories, reviewed data, and examined decades of policies that shaped today’s shortage. One story that stuck with me came from a single mother and professional who, despite her career and working two, three or four jobs, bounced between friends’ couches because rent in Valparaiso was out of reach.
When we asked members of the Valparaiso City Council and the mayor’s staff — they committed to work with us to reform local zoning laws and other barriers that get in the way of building more housing. Three months later the mayor is hiring a firm to completely redo the city’s zoning laws, something that has been talked about for decades. This is a critical first step, and we’re excited to help shape the new zoning ordinance to allow for more multi-family units, legalize accessory dwelling units in more places, and make the process to build easier, faster, and less expensive.

We have put the ball in play in Valparaiso. But Valparaiso can’t solve this crisis alone. Housing advocates across the state have called for a commission for the state legislature to address the housing crisis. Gov. Mike Braun has neither dismissed nor approved the proposal. What’s clear is that state and local policymakers need to act together, and now. Montana and Texas — both conservative states — have taken bold action. Why not Indiana?
This fall, teams from each congregation in our coalition are holding meetings to educate neighbors and encourage them to join the effort to modernize our zoning laws. It’s exciting to work toward a change that will benefit other Hoosiers who, like me, have struggled to find a place to live.
We are in this together. Change is possible. We know what’s possible when communities organize. Now we need our state leaders to prioritize building more housing so “all Hoosiers have a place to call home.”

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle) Companies seeking to partner with the state of Indiana must affirm that they don’t have any diversity, equity or inclusive practices “that treat people differently on the basis of race and sex when recruiting, hiring, promoting and conducting other employment activities.” 
The policy took effect July 1 and is part of a push to eliminate “discriminatory” DEI practices, Attorney General Todd Rokita said in a news release last week. 
Braun report identifies 350 examples of DEI in state government

Rokita’s office is charged with reviewing and approving all state contracts while enforcing the False Claims Act. The additional anti-DEI certification action is undertaken “in coordination” with Gov. Mike Braun and the Indiana Department of Administration.
Also last week, the state abruptly cancelled its 2025 Business Conference and B2Bloom Expo. The 17th annual gathering, hosted by the Indiana Department of Administration’s Division of Supplier Diversity, showcased opportunities for underrepresented companies to contract with state government. 
The agency declined to share why the October conference was cancelled, only saying, “Further details will be shared when they become available.”
 More on AG

In the release, Rokita said DEI “is often used as a cover for policies that violate state and/or federal civil rights laws.”
“No one gets a free pass for unlawful discrimination just because they claim to have good intentions,” Rokita said. “Treating people differently in the workplace or at school based on race and sex is a destructive practice and illegal. We will continue to enforce the law against higher education institutions and working to eliminate this terrible Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion known as DEI nonsense.” 
State contracts will still have language prohibiting racial discrimination.
But contractors could experience consequences under the state’s False Claims Act if found to have DEI programs violating Indiana or federal civil rights laws.
The anti-DEI language in new contracts says the contractor “does not and shall not operate any programs or engage in any practices promoting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), or other similar goals, that violate Indiana or Federal Civil Rights Laws by treating a person differently on the basis of race or sex, such as by considering race or sex when making recruitment,
hiring, disciplinary, promotion, or employment decisions; requiring employees to participate in training or educational programs that employ racial or sex stereotypes; or attempting to achieve racial or sex balancing in the Contractor’s workforce.”
Following a January executive order, executive branch state agencies cannot use state funds or resources to support DEI “positions, departments, activities, procedures or programs if they grant preferential treatment based upon one person’s particular race.”
Instead, Braun has pivoted to “MEI,” or merit, excellence and innovation.
 The cancelled business conference

The Division of Supplier Diversity has sought to “promote, monitor and enforce” certification standards for minority and women-owned small businesses since 1983, and added veteran-owned small businesses in 2018. A February presentation describes the mission of the 13-person department as “provid(ing) equal opportunity” to those businesses in the state’s procurement and contracting process.”

Between July 2021, and May 2025, there were 326 foster children in Idaho who would have received federal Social Security payments either because of a death of a parent or disability, but the state used nearly $2.3 million of those benefits to offset the cost of their care. 
That may begin to change for those with survivor’s benefits starting next year after a recent directive issued by Idaho Health and Welfare Director Alex Adams. 
“Children in foster care deserve the ability to have the same opportunities and privileges afforded to every other child in our state, including receiving funds that they are federally entitled to for their own benefit, not the state’s,” Adams wrote in a May 21 “director’s bulletin.” 
 National foster care advocate noticed Idaho policy amid HHS nomination 

Adams recently caught the attention of one national foster youth advocate amid his nomination hearing for a federal post at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and by association, this new policy that he quietly enacted.

Amy Harfeld, national policy director at the Children’s Advocacy Institute, has been campaigning for years in states across the nation to change what had been a widespread practice of the state accepting Social Security survivors’ and disability benefits on behalf of the child to use for their care. 
Harfeld, an attorney, has engaged in multiple lawsuits and testified in around 25 states to try and get this policy changed. 
“Most states have not done this by themselves,” she said, “and so that really does distinguish (Adams) here, and it’s exciting that it distinguishes the state at this moment where he is going to have such a big stage and authority and capacity to make changes like this.” 
Adams’ nomination by President Donald Trump narrowly advanced out of the Senate Finance Committee July 31, and if nominated, he will oversee the nation’s Administration for Children and Families. 
A 2021 report from NPR and the Marshall Project found that at least 49 states and Washington, D.C., had been collecting this money intended for foster youth and using it for their care. Under federal law, those Social Security benefits are considered the children’s property, but it is legal for states to be a financial representative for children. 
Harfeld said that over the past four years, 32 states have taken action to change this policy. 
“It’s just a colossal failure of accountability and transparency within both agencies and … and also between federal and state agencies.” Harfeld said. “We’re just really grateful that this has been exposed now.” 
Harfeld said that the language in federal regulations and guidelines regarding survivor’s benefits for foster youth “leaves just enough gray area” that states can collect the benefits without outright violating any laws. 
She said the Administration for Children and Families — which Adams would oversee if his nomination is confirmed — could mitigate this by updating its guidance language that clearly states how the money should not be used.

Adams’ directed the agency to change this practice for youth with survivor’s benefits by July 1, 2026. The new policy will be to only use the funds for “unmet needs,” and to conserve the remaining benefits for the “child’s future needs.”

The new policy only addresses survivor’s benefits and not disability benefits. Health and Welfare spokesperson AJ McWhorter said in an email to the Idaho Capital Sun the agency is “taking a phased approach to this issue.” 
If the child is over the age of 12, using the money to meet their needs must be done in consultation with that child. When serving as a foster child’s financial representative, agency staff would be directed to explore opportunities to deposit their money in a special needs trust, a fund for those with disabilities, or other types of trusts or savings accounts that would not limit the child’s access to public benefits. 
“The Department shall not use the child’s funds to offset state funds by simply covering items that are otherwise covered for other children in foster care who do not have Social Security Survivor’s benefits,” the bulletin said. 
The money would be released to the Social Security Administration to return to the child once they left custody.  
McWhorter said the agency opted to change the policy because, “IDHW recognizes the importance of empowering foster youth to succeed. We always look for ways to strengthen youth and support independence for youth exiting the foster care system.”
“Safeguarding these funds increases their financial stability for when they exit foster care,” McWhorter said, “ which is essential to addressing basic needs.”

Authorities in the West African nation threw him in prison because of his sexual orientation, he said. After his release, he feared that if he stayed in the country, he would be killed.
B., who is now 39 and who asked that he be identified only by his initial because he still has family in Cameroon, arrived in the United States with practically nothing. Since he was granted asylum last year, he has been able to use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, to help him get by.
But now most refugees and asylees, who entered the country legally, including B., are no longer eligible for food stamps. The change is part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the giant federal domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4.
“I think it’s unfair. I understand that there are some people who abuse the system,” B. told Stateline. “There are also people who are in need. And cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.”
SNAP, which is funded by the federal government but administered by the states, helps families and individuals with lower incomes supplement their grocery budgets. The program serves an average of 42 million people a month.
Supporters of the change note that refugees and asylees can get permits to work, and that they have other sources of support.
“It’s not like they have been dropped off in this country with no support system,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration rules.
“They have sponsoring organizations that are helping them get settled and they have work authorization. So they really should be moving forward towards self-sufficiency with support right out of the starting gate. And they should be moving ahead to obtain green cards,” she added, referring to the cards that signify permanent residency.
Vaughan cited a federal grant program that reimburses states and nonprofit organizations for financial aid and health care coverage they provide to refugees.
But critics argue that asylees and refugees, who are extensively vetted and have a legitimate path to citizenship, can wait years for a green card, which entitles them to a wider array of benefits.
They also say community organizations that provide aid to asylees and refugees are stretched thin. Without food stamps, they say, many refugees and their families would not have enough to eat.
“SNAP is an incredibly fundamental program for this population that comes to the United States, really, with very little, if anything,” said Nicolas Palazzo, a policy counsel at the global humanitarian and refugee advocacy organization HIAS. “These are people who literally had to flee — many times overnight — with nothing, but, you know, a pair of clothes in a backpack.”
Palazzo also said SNAP is not a “handout” to refugees or asylees. Rather, he said, it’s a “smart and moral investment” that protects all communities and strengthens the economy, offering people a foundation for self-sufficiency.
“Stripping critical food assistance forces refugees and asylees into the shadows of informal work, labor exploitation and hunger that weakens our workforce and denigrates our moral obligations,” Palazzo said.
 ‘Nowhere else to go’

B. said he applied immediately for asylum when he arrived in the U.S. in 2016, but that he had to wait months for a work permit. He survived by doing odd jobs, such as cleaning homes and delivering food, and got by on very little. It wasn’t until late 2024, when he finally won his asylum case, that he was eligible to get any public benefits, including food stamps.
Eligibility for food stamps came at a critical time for B., as a car accident had prevented him from making food deliveries.
“While not having income, it was very helpful,” B. said. “I’m somebody who if I can work, I will work. The only reason I went over there to ask is because I had nowhere else to go.”
According to a November 2024 report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, a total of 60,050 people were newly admitted to the United States as refugees in 2023, many from unstable countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria and Afghanistan.
In 2023, the nation received at least 747,000 applications for people seeking asylum from countries including Venezuela, Cuba and Colombia, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration research group. It’s a tremendous increase from the 68,000 applications received in 2013.
The new domestic policy law specifies that food stamps are still available to Cubans and Haitians who might be refugees and asylees.
As of July 2025, more than 2.2 million immigrants in the U.S. are awaiting asylum hearings or decisions after formally applying for asylum, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, an organization at Syracuse University that tracks immigration cases.
“Getting through the system was difficult,” B. said. “I had to find money. I had to find an attorney who would help me apply for my asylum case. The asylum case itself took a long time.
“I still know people who have been here for more than 10 years and never had an interview.”
 ‘Already stretched’

According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, half of all admitted refugees in 2023 were resettled across just 10 states: Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan and Washington.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 41,000 people in the state are getting SNAP benefits while not being lawful permanent residents. She says that group includes refugees and asylees.
“The concerning part there is that these are individuals who were … lawfully admitted to the country, have previously been eligible for SNAP when they need it, and now, simply because of their status, will no longer be able to receive SNAP benefits,” Guinn told Stateline. “There’s nothing we’re going to be able to do to make them eligible.”
Another change under the new law is that for the first time, states will have to pay for a portion of their food stamp programs. States will have to cover between 5% and 15% of their SNAP costs beginning in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they dole out benefits to people eligible for the program.
Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, pointed out that states that want to continue to provide SNAP benefits to refugees and asylees are free to do so — as long as they pay for it.
“If New York state doesn’t want to cut these people off, they can continue to give them something like food stamps. They just have to do it with New York state money right now,” Rector said.
But Guinn said that will be difficult. New York does offer asylum-seekers a variable amount of monthly cash assistance through its Safety Net Assistance Program, but typically recipients must be working.
In Texas, officials at the state’s health and human services agency said that as of last month, roughly 24,600 of the state’s 3.5 million SNAP recipients were refugees or asylees. A spokesperson for Maryland’s human services agency wrote in an email that the state’s SNAP program last year supported more than 10,000 refugees and asylees.
The California Department of Social Services could not provide the number of refugees and asylees receiving food stamps, but projected that a total of 74,000 noncitizens — including lawfully permanent residents, refugees and asylees — would lose eligibility under the new law.
Sherri Laigle, the director of social services at HIAS, said food banks will not be able to make up for refugees’ and asylees’ loss of SNAP benefits.
“They’re already stretched, and now we’re going to see tens of thousands of people also needing to continue to rely on these programs. Of course, there’s limited access to them. You have to have transportation. You have to be able to get there.”
B. said he would apply for food stamps again if he could, because he’s earning too little income to get by.
“There are people who are in need. I think ignoring that — it’s not human.”

Kevin Stitt greets supporters during the State of the State Address on Feb. 3, 2025. (Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)With some of the harebrained ideas that get tossed around every year, there’s understandably a joke bandied about in political circles that Oklahomans are safer when their legislators are not in session.
And, I’d say that joke has generally rung true — until now. 
Suddenly we’ve found ourselves smack dab in the middle of an episode of “Republicans Gone Wild,” and I find myself missing the checks and balances provided by the third branch of government — the Legislature. 
While Oklahoma’s episode doesn’t feature scantily clad women (though we’ve sadly had allegations of that too this interim), it does highlight what appears to be a very disturbing trend of executive branch leaders demonstrating a propensity for scheming behind the scenes to circumvent the will of 149 elected leaders. They’ve astutely — and disappointingly — capitalized on the power vacuum that began in May at the close of the four-month legislative session.
Thus far, we’ve seen state Superintendent Ryan Walters insisting on an unfunded mandate that districts should provide free or reduced-price lunches — without legislative input or funding. And he has singlehandedly announced plans to eliminate statewide standardized testing despite state and federal law requiring those assessments. 
Then we have Gov. Kevin Stitt who supported a decision by the Oklahoma Highway Patrol to stop patrolling some of our busiest highways and interstates in urban areas, affecting law enforcement coverage for at least a third of the state. The Republican has also issued an executive order to end the state’s recommendation of fluoride in public water supplies and gotten permission from the feds to change the items that lower income people can purchase with food stamps.
And if that wasn’t enough, we’ve found out Attorney General Gentner Drummond has apparently plotted with the Trump administration to overhaul a state law that gives immigrants without permanent legal status in the U.S. access to in-state tuition and financial aid benefits to Oklahoma colleges and universities.
I can’t decide if Stitt, Walters and Drummond – statewide elected officials – are just completely incompetent and unable to plan, or if they’re signaling to Oklahomans that they don’t respect the decisions local voters made in selecting the state representatives and senators who represent their communities’ interests. These are the people in state government who are closest to the voter.
I’ll be the first in line to buy an oceanfront condo in the middle of the Sahara Desert if you can convince me these men didn’t already have these stunts planned and weren’t biding their time to launch these missiles on the unsuspecting public and suddenly powerless legislators.
I struggle to accept the seemingly autocratic style of government we’ve been forced to endure in the past few months, because this is not how good government should work. Our system of government has three branches — executive, legislative and judicial — for a reason. These branches are supposed to serve as a check and balance to make sure that policy priorities are being properly vetted.
I know the 2026 election season is already upon us. Drummond is running for governor and Walters is believed to be eying the same post. Stitt cannot run again due to term limits. But there’s no excuse for this behavior. Oklahomans deserve better than publicity stunts.
I suspect Drummond, as our state’s top attorney, knew that we had a law on the books that is written in such a way that it allowed immigrants who may not be citizens to receive financial aid like other students who graduated from Oklahoma high schools. But instead of working with lawmakers during the 2025 legislative session to address it, he enthusiastically announced he supported the Trump administration’s decision to sue us. We don’t need a legal representative who positions us for failure.
Walters, meanwhile, had an opportunity to set his priorities heading into the 2025 session. He didn’t publicly advocate for free lunches and the elimination of standardized testing until after the final gavel fell. He, of all people, should have understood that both policies require legislative input and funding. He either doesn’t understand how the process works or he apparently thinks the public isn’t smart and he can score political points at the Legislature’s expense.
And then we’ve got Stitt. He’s allowing an unelected bureaucrat to singlehandedly overhaul decades of Oklahoma Highway Patrol protocols without legislative input. I find it difficult to believe that the Highway Patrol didn’t know during the session that they planned to stop patrolling some of the busiest interstates and were planning to force local governments to pick up the slack. But if they didn’t know that, then I question Stitt’s appointment decision. Stitt could have easily told his agency head to hold off on the patrol shifts until February when lawmakers are back in session.
He didn’t do that.
Oklahomans deserve leadership from the officials we’ve elected to serve in our executive branch. It boggles the mind that none of these men are demonstrating any iota of that by refusing to work with lawmakers to advance key policy overhauls.
But by sitting at home twiddling their thumbs, legislators on both sides of the aisle are signaling that they’re willing to be doormats.
If they were really bothered by this rise in autocratic decision making, they could come back into special session and swat down these public ploys.
That would send a clear message that this is not acceptable.
Because there’s no way that few people at the highest echelons of state government know what’s best for Oklahomans living in all corners of this state.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps/Utah News Dispatch)Election officials turned over at the highest rate in at least a quarter century during the last presidential election, according to new research from the Bipartisan Policy Center.
An analysis of shifts in election officials published Tuesday found nearly 41% of election officials administering the 2024 election were different than those in 2020. Turnover has accelerated over the past two decades, rising from about 28% in 2004 to 40.9% last year.
The growing percentage of departing election officials comes after years of challenges. They navigated the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as well as harassment and false conspiracy theories surrounding stolen elections that persist today.
The analysis released by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based group that seeks to foster policy cooperation across party lines, represents an updated version of a report that previously examined turnover from 2004 to 2022. The new research, which extends the data through 2024, shows the turnover rate continued to climb.
The change means that, over time, election officials have less experience. The research found that the share of chief local election officials with six or more years in their role has dropped from 60% in 2006 to 47% in 2024.
But last year, 60% of election officials had previously overseen the administration of a presidential election in their jurisdiction.
“Despite increasing turnover and loss of experience, the majority of chief election officials still have experience running at least one presidential election cycle,” the analysis said. “This is important because presidential elections typically see the highest turnout and are the most visible elections administered.”
The analysis found that over the long term, election official turnover rates have been rising gradually in small jurisdictions, defined as areas with fewer than 100,000 voting-age residents. But large jurisdictions have experienced a more sudden jump in turnover.
Small jurisdictions had a 27% turnover rate in 2004 that had risen to 40% in 2024. But large jurisdictions enjoyed a turnover rate as low as 31% in 2018 before climbing rapidly to nearly 46% last year.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — In a crowded coworking space on Lincoln’s Y Street this month, 1st Congressional District Democrats gathered to meet their man running against Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Flood. 
Congressional candidate Eric Moyer told attendees at his kickoff event that he wants to create a spark. 
Nebraska Democrats hope he’s onto something. They want the backlash to the second Trump administration to help them make gains in 2026, as national Democrats attempt to emerge from the political wilderness and address a weaker national brand than President Donald Trump or Republicans.

“Nebraska is special,” Moyer told the crowd. “I believe Nebraska can lead this nation into a better future.” 
The good news for Democrats: Recent polling shows the party holds a slight lead in the head-to-head matchup for the generic congressional ballot, which means likely voters told pollsters they would pick a random Democrat over a random Republican. And Democrats nationwide are more energized than Republicans about next year’s elections.
Nebraska Democratic Party Chair Jane Kleeb, who is also a vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, says a successful 2026 starts with winning the 2nd District U.S. House race in the Omaha area. It continues with registering at least 10,000 more Democrats in the state. And the party wants to make gains in the state Legislature, where Democrats and a handful of legislative moderates have a tenuous hold on the ability to filibuster — needing 17 seats or 17 votes to stop controversial legislation. 
Kleeb would like the party to win a statewide race again, too, and it’s been done before. Democrats held both U.S. Senate seats and the Governor’s Mansion as recently as the late 1990s. Democrats have said they have a potential candidate considering a race against Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, a Republican.
“The momentum is here,” Kleeb told the Examiner. “The fundraising is going to be there. We have to prove that we can now win this big [2nd District] seat.” 
For Democrats, this may sound like a familiar tune. But the status quo in the 2nd District has changed. Omaha now has a Democratic mayor for the first time in more than a decade, and Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon announced in June that he is not running for reelection in 2026. 
Democrats have seen growth in city elections in Omaha and Lincoln, and they continue winning down-ballot races in a state where registered Republicans outnumber them roughly 2 to 1. The Nebraska Republican Party, in recent years, has focused more attention on lower-profile races in response.
News of Bacon not running has Democrats lining up to run next year in a competitive district where the party’s nominees have lost by single digits four straight times. The loss on incumbent advantage has local and national political experts viewing the 2nd District as a possible pickup opportunity for the party.
The Democrats’ crowded field includes State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades, newcomer Denise Powell and Navy veteran Kishla Askins.

Some Democrats and pundits discuss this year’s city election as a hint of a possible blue tide for the state’s second-largest party to capitalize on, although a handful of observers acknowledge that the fundamentals of the Omaha area’s slightly right-leaning swing district haven’t changed.
Nationally, the Nebraska midterms are emerging as critical for the party attempting to retake the House. Locally, next year could determine whether the Legislature continues its drift toward a more combative brand of Republicanism and away from George Norris’ nonpartisan tradition. 
The question of whether Nebraska Democrats can seize the moment looms over the next 14 months. 
Recent history isn’t on the Democrats’ side. The party has tried for years to win the House seat and come up short. The one exception was 2014, when State Sen. Brad Ashford of Omaha, a former Republican, upset GOP U.S. Rep. Lee Terry for a term. Bacon beat Ashford in 2016. Ashford was the last Democrat in the state’s federal delegation. 
In the statehouse, Democrats have lost some ground. The GOP won 33 of 49 seats in 2022, the number needed to break a filibuster in the officially nonpartisan Legislature. Republicans maintained that supermajority in 2024.
“A test for the party” 
The 2nd District is the state’s most politically divided and diverse, with all of urban Douglas and rural Saunders Counties, and a slice of suburban western Sarpy County. 
Douglas County Democratic Party Chair C.J. King said he considers Bacon’s retirement “handwriting on the wall.” He sees the momentum is shifting.
National and state GOP strategists acknowledge that an open-seat 2nd District race is winnable for Democrats, but they emphasize that Republicans can win with the “right candidate and the right messaging.” 
Bacon, during his retirement announcement in June, warned Republicans not to get dragged to the right in the primary, because they won’t be able to “win the general.” He told reporters that “in this District, you’ve got to win swing voters.” 
Bacon has been credited for striking that balance with a conservative voting record, an emphasis on national security, support for federal spending on local priorities and a willingness to sometimes criticize President Donald Trump.
This has helped Bacon fend off Democratic challengers. Last year, Bacon beat former State Sen. Tony Vargas by less than two percentage points. GOP strategists have emphasized the importance of Republicans of winning nearly 50% of the vote in Douglas County, as well as securing a good chunk of independent voters. They see it as a path to victory.
Bacon, while he hasn’t won a majority of Douglas County voters, has never won less than 48% of the vote there. The GOP also points to five Republicans having won municipal races in the county since 2018. 
“This seat is tougher without Bacon, but he’s not special,” a House Republican strategist said in June. “It can be done.”

Zach Bannon, a National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman, said the party is confident it can keep Nebraska’s 2nd District red as Democrats “pile into a clown bus of a messy and expensive primary.”
“Nebraskans know Republicans are the party of common sense that delivers real results,” Bannon said. 
The GOP primary race for NE-02 includes two Republicans, Omaha City Council Vice President Brinker Harding and former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha.
When the GOP majority in the Legislature redrew Nebraska’s congressional maps in 2021, it did so in a way that shored up 2nd District Republicans by swapping some Democratic-voting residents in suburban Sarpy County with more reliably Republican-leaning residents of rural Saunders County. The district has more registered Republicans than Democrats, according to the latest data from the Secretary of State’s office.
Paul Landow, a retired University of Nebraska at Omaha political scientist, said if turnout is “exceptionally high and if the party unites behind a “strong candidate,” the Democrats could win the 2nd District, but it won’t be easy. 
“It’s still a Republican lean district, even on a good day,” Landow said. 
King, of the Douglas County Democrats, said the party has strong candidates and a key motivating factor on its side for 2026 — fear. 
“There’s an unfortunate thing in politics … fear and hate seem to be the motivating factors,” King said. “There’s a lot of fear that the Democrats need to get off their butts and do something, or else it can only get worse.” 
National Democratic strategists are prioritizing the 2nd District and leaving nothing to chance. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Madison Andrus said Democrats would “spend the next [14] months earning every single vote.” Kleeb called winning the congressional race “a test for the state party.”
National and state Democrats are banking on the current political climate surrounding Trump’s budget and tax bill that passed earlier this summer, which polling indicates is unpopular among Americans. Kleeb said the party can capitalize statewide on people’s frustrations with Trump. 
The balance of the Statehouse 
The Nebraska GOP and its legislative candidates have built a narrow supermajority in the statehouse when the party’s members stick together on controversial votes, which isn’t always the case.
Democrats and progressive-leaning nonpartisans hold 16 seats, meaning they must convince at least one Republican to filibuster legislation they find objectionable, a tactic the Unicameral minority has long used to stall or kill legislation lacking consensus. 
In theory, Republicans could pass the majority party’s agenda without crossing the aisle, but some Republicans have sided with the minority on controversial issues including defeating the push to switch the state’s presidential elections to winner-take-all.
Both parties are jockeying to gain seats in Lincoln. The stakes are real: Republicans can strengthen their majority to the point that a handful of moderate conservatives would hold less sway, essentially neutering the filibuster. 
Democrats are attempting to end the supermajority and restore the filibuster’s original strength, seeking more negotiating power on legislation. Party officials say they aim to gain two seats.

“That’s going to be difficult, no question,” Kleeb said. “But there’s a seat in Gretna … there’s a couple of seats still in Douglas County that we think are on the table. I think there is a path.”
The Legislature could prove a pivotal point in the Democratic primary for Congress, too, in the 2nd District. Omaha’s John Cavanaugh would potentially have to vacate his seat if voters send him to Washington, allowing Pillen, a Republican, to appoint his successor. 
State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha, a progressive nonpartisan who regularly votes with Democrats, recently said that is part of why she is watching the Democratic primary closely. Hunt said losing any more seats could widen the door for “extremist policies that hurt working people” and “target vulnerable communities.”
“My hope is that we don’t lose that last line of defense,” Hunt said. 
 Why is there no Democrat in the Senate race?  

Kleeb, in an interview with the Examiner, reaffirmed the party’s alliance with populist candidate Dan Osborn against GOP U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts. She repeated her belief that “a coalition of Dems, Indys, and Republicans can beat Ricketts and break up the one-party rule.” 
However, party officials say that is not an official endorsement. Republicans have used the alliance to try painting Osborn, a registered nonpartisan, as a Democrat. Osborn has said he would caucus with neither party in the Senate, and he has described the challenges of being labeled a Democrat in a red state like Nebraska.
ActBlue, a fundraising tool often used by Democrats, recently changed its rules to include independent candidates on a “case-by-case” basis, according to Axios. The Ricketts campaign has pointed out Osborn’s use of ActBlue. Some other nonpartisan and independent candidates in different states have avoided using the fundraising tool to keep from being associated with the Democratic Party.

Osborn, who in 2024 ran a closer-than-expected bid against U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb, is trying again against Ricketts. That’s part of why Republicans are attacking Osborn sooner this time. 
Osborn’s bid comes as Democrats are trying to repair their relationship with the working class. Trump has made gains with blue-collar voters and voters of color. Some working-class Americans have warned Democrats not to expect frustration with Trump to be enough to swing them. 
Kleeb said the Democratic Party needs to respect voters from all classes and be comfortable talking to them. She says Democrats must appeal to voters who hang out in dive bars and wine bars. 
“That’s how we’re going to be successful,” Kleeb said. “I think this cycle we’re on that path.” 
Landow, the retired UNO professor, said Democratic aspirations of winning beyond the 2nd District and legislative races aren’t impossible, because “nothing’s impossible.” But he said they might not be “realistic.”
“There are just too many Republicans in those other districts and statewide,” Landow said. “For a Democrat to pull it off anywhere but Omaha would be some sort of amazing occurrence.”
But don’t tell the Lincoln-area Democrats who turned out with high spirits for Moyer’s kickoff event. As one attendee said, Democrats “at least have to try.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Ryan Strnad of Mukwonogo knows he might be a “polarizing” candidate for governor, but he says it could work in his favor. A beer vendor for over 25 years, Strnad works three jobs, has never served in elected office and has broad political positions: he’s pro-labor, opposed COVID-19 restrictions, supports allowing access to abortion and is pro-cop.
The retirement of Gov. Tony Evers has made the 2026 race the first since 2010 to open a lane for anyone from either party to get in without having to challenge a popular incumbent. Most of the Democrats preparing for or considering a run for Wisconsin’s top executive office are current or former elected officials.
Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez was the first Democrat to announce a bid to succeed Evers. Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, who also once served in the state Assembly, has announced plans to run; Sen. Kelda Roys, Attorney General Josh Kaul, former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes and state Rep. Francesca Hong are all potential Democratic contestants.
On the Republican side, Whitefish Bay manufacturer Bill Berrien is so far the only candidate officially running who hasn’t held elected office before — something that he is using to compare himself to President Donald Trump and as an argument for his candidacy.
Strnad, who officially launched his campaign last week, tells the Wisconsin Examiner that even his mom told him that he should “run for something smaller.” He sees the governor’s office as the place where he could have the most influence, however. 
“It’s a job I would love to have… I love state politics more than anything else,” Strnad says. “I would have a unique say of things. I can propose the budget. I can make some executive orders. And I can also sign and veto bills.”
For his campaign kick-off, in which he made good on his 2023 vow to run, Strnad stood at Mitchell Boulevard Park across the street from American Family Field where he has worked as a beer vendor for over 35 years. 
Strnad says that he’s not making “hands over fist” as a vendor, but it helps him afford his expenses. He also works two other jobs including third shift at a factory (he won’t say where)  and at a dry cleaning business.
He also loves the environment of the stadium. “Just walk into that ballpark and… being in the sun when the roof’s open or dealing with the fans… and listening to the music and going along with the crowd,” Strnad says. “Being part of the experience, that’s half of it right there.”
  ““We do enough to support the environment anyway,” Beer vendor Ryan Strnad said. “Go to a store, get yourself one of these.”(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)
This will be Strnad’s first time running for office as a Democrat. As a Republican he ran unsuccessfully for the state Assembly in 2000 while living near the south shore in Milwaukee County. He sayst he switched parties because his labor beliefs align better with Democrats: He was introduced to unions when he started working as a beer vendor in 1998, after previously working as a stadium food vendor.
“There was no union with the food vendors,” Strnad says. “I had some real good union stewards who introduced me to the job, and I experienced how labor works.” Seeing the money being made at the stadium has made him want to ensure that employees benefit enough, too. 
In 2017, Strnad started “Drinks in Seats” — a political action committee and lobbying group to advocate on behalf of drink vendors — in part because the stadium’s management was  trying to grow the number of places where beer was sold on the premises, and he was concerned about the competition vendors would face. His group hasn’t been registered to lobby since the 2023-24 legislative session. 
In his campaign, Strnad says he would focus on labor issues, including repealing Act 10, which restricted the collective bargaining rights of most public sector employees, and getting rid of “right to work” policies, which make it illegal to require employees to join a union or pay dues as a condition of employment. He also wants to make it harder for employers to fire employees.
“Workers are doing their employers a favor by choosing to go and work for them and stay with them. It really hurts a lot when you go and tell an employee that they’re no longer working there,” Strnad said at his announcement press conference. 
Strnad said he would seek more bipartisanship as governor. He’s bothered that politics has “become a lot of us against them,” he said. 
He told reporters that he would be “trying to garner some support from the right as well” as Democrats. He was critical of Democrats’ supporting COVID-19 restrictions, which he blamed for Democrats’  struggle to win support from working class voters. 
“I cannot think of another Democrat who was vocal about coronavirus restrictions,” Strnad said. “I was rather vocal about how it was not fair to us to lose our jobs or work because of coronavirus restrictions.”
On abortion, Strnad said “any pregnant mother to be or mother who wants an abortion can have an abortion.” When it comes to the environment, he was critical of activists who are trying to to shut down oil and gas pipelines. “We do enough to support the environment anyway,” he said, and the fight against pipelines  is “costing people’s jobs.” 
Strnad lifted up a recycling bin. “Go to a store, get yourself one of these,” he said. “Just buy yourself one of these, $15 at your local hardware store, start recycling — Boom! You’re helping the environment right there.” 
Strnad also emphasizes his support for law enforcement and firearms,  including Wisconsin’s concealed carry law. 
“I back the police and I want to make it that every block in this country is a livable one,” Strnad tells the Examiner. 
While not a traditional candidate, Strnad says he hopes people are able to see themselves in him. “He’s one of us” is one of his campaign slogans. 
“I’m doing three jobs. I live in a rented apartment. I know what it’s like, you know, to be where they’re at,” Strnad says. “It’s been really now more than ever that decisions made at the Legislature, especially from a governor or especially from a president, have a direct impact on the everyday person’s life, especially those in the working class and the middle class.”

(Courtesy of Mark Cohen)LINCOLN — Lemoyne resident Mark Cohen has launched an exploratory committee to consider an independent bid for Nebraska’s 3rd Congressional District against U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith in the 2026 midterms.
The state’s 3rd Congressional District includes central and western Nebraska and much of the state’s northeastern and southeastern edges. It’s one of the nation’s most conservative congressional districts by political party registration advantage and voting record.  
Smith, who was first elected to Congress in 2006, already faces a Republican primary challenger, former U.S. Border Patrol agent David Huebner.  Democrat Becky Stille is also running for the Democratic nomination.  
“I love my country, and I’m fed up with a two-party system that forces voters to choose between extremists,” Cohen said in a statement.
The former Air Force Judge Advocate and karate instructor, said he was a Democrat until three years ago but left because he got “tired of people in big cities trying to set policy for rural areas on issues like firearms” and said, “Some Democratic leaders have largely abandoned moderates, because extremists and interest groups dominate the agenda and the funding.”

Cohen’s campaign website states that he supports responsible gun rights, legalizing and regulating marijuana, and preserving the earth’s habitability. He also wants to “require paper ballots in every election,” as “electronic voting machines scare” him, and says he believes in regulated capitalism. He also says today’s Republicans “are not conservatives.” 
“They call themselves fiscal conservatives, but they cut taxes for the rich and balloon the deficit for our children … They say they believe in limited government yet want to regulate almost everything at the federal level now that they’re in power.”
Smith campaign spokesman Chris Peterson said Smith’s “conservative record reflects the priorities” of the 3rd District.
“Congressman Adrian Smith is a proven and trusted conservative fighting for Nebraskans alongside President Trump to secure the border and stop illegal immigration,” he said.
Cohen’s possible bid comes as former Omaha labor leader Dan Osborn is running his second U.S. Senate bid as a nonpartisan candidate — this time against Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts.  Populism, the political approach of appealing to ordinary people by saying their concerns have been ignored by the financial and political elites, is a driving force in modern politics. 
Cohen said the state’s 3rd District voters know “not all Democrats are socialists and not all Republicans are fascists.”
“They yearn for a plain-speaking populist … a Harry Truman,” Cohen said.

(Stock photo by Master via Getty Images)A Tennessee department head is hopeful that new guidance for a federal program supporting the growth of electric vehicle charging networks may ultimately allow the state to proceed with $21 million in contracts that have been frozen since February.
The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program (NEVI) allocated $88 million to Tennessee over five years to fund EV charger installation along major interstates and Hwy. 64, which runs from Memphis to Pelham roughly along Tennessee’s southern border. The Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) awarded $21 million of the funding to 10 applicants in January 2024 to install 30 new charging locations, each with ports to charge several vehicles, but the contracts were not executed before the federal program’s pause.
Those contracts would complement the state’s own EV charging infrastructure grant program, part of an overall push to support EV adoption. Tennessee’s EV manufacturing industry has grown over the last several years – often supported by state incentives to bring hundreds of jobs to rural communities – giving the state an economic interest in the vehicles’ success. Ford’s new BlueOval City facility in rural West Tennessee recently delayed mass production of its full-size electric truck until 2028 as the company refocuses on the production of cheaper, smaller models in Kentucky.
The $5 billion NEVI program has officially been on ice since February 2025, when the U.S. Federal Highway Administration officially suspended funding to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order to pause federal grants supporting electric vehicles and clean energy. 
Multiple states have challenged the Trump administration’s ability to freeze the funds in federal court. Tennessee is not among them.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy recently released interim guidance for the program intending to “streamline applications, provide states with more flexibility, and slash red tape,” according to the federal transportation department.
States can reapply for funding under the new requirements over the next 30 days.
Tennessee program makes progress on EV chargers while frozen federal projects languish

Tennessee Department of Transportation Director Beth Emmons said the department is reviewing the new guidance and updated requirements and “hopes to have a path forward with this program by the time the guidelines become official.”
The program’s deployment has been slow. Less than 400 charging ports funded under NEVI are complete and open for use, according to a dashboard maintained by EV States Clearinghouse. The federal government allocated $3.3 billion to states for fiscal years 2022 through 2025. Of the 38 states that have issued awards under previously approved plans (which must now be resubmitted), 16 states have at least one operational station. States have awarded a total $544 million.
The revised guidance went into effect on Aug. 13, and the Federal Highway Administration is accepting comments on the rule changes through Aug. 27.
“If Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let’s cut the waste and do it right,” Duffy said in a statement released Aug. 11. “The Biden-Buttigieg Administration failed to deliver EV chargers despite their promises … While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress’ will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently.”
Changes include scrapping language regarding serving “rural, underserved, and disadvantaged communities,” “equitable distribution,” and opportunities for minority- and women-owned small businesses. The guidance also removes requirements for states to “address consumer protections, emergency evacuation plans, environmental siting, resilience and terrain considerations.”
Charging industry coalition welcomes changes, nonprofit says new requirements are another stall tactic
Charge Ahead Partnership, a coalition supporting a nationwide EV charging network, welcomed the new guidance.
Slow uptake by states in NEVI’s first three years was due to “requirements within the original guidance that slowed down deployment,” according to a coalition statement released Aug. 13.
“The ultimate goal of the NEVI program is to expand the nation’s EV charging infrastructure, and these updated guidelines will make that outcome more likely,” Charge Ahead Partnership Executive Director Jay Smith said. “A streamlined NEVI program will make it easier for the mom-and-pop gas station on the corner, along with national retail chains, to offer EV charging.”
The coalition is particularly optimistic about guidance encouraging states to prioritize applicants who will serve as the site host and charging provider, a move they say will cut down on time that would otherwise be spent searching for a site, and allow for simpler accountability.
The Sierra Club, one of several nonprofit groups that have joined legal challenges against the funding freeze, contends that the new guidance is “unnecessary” and serves only to further delay EV charging buildout as states reapply for funds.
“It’s ironic that this guidance was sold as cutting red tape, yet all it has accomplished is more than half a year of needless delay,” Sierra Club Clean Transportation for All Director Katherine Garcia stated in a news release.
“While the Trump administration has moved away from anti-EV rhetoric in this guidance in response to federal litigation filed by over a dozen states, Sierra Club, and other nonprofit organizations, it is still illegally withholding billions Congress dedicated to EV charging.”
Separate state program continues charger rollout
In the meantime, Tennessee’s separately funded Fast Charge TN program has supported EV charger installation in a 400-mile loop connecting Nashville, Knoxville, Cookeville and Chattanooga.
The state program is powered by money from the Volkswagen Diesel Settlement Environmental Mitigation Trust, electricity revenues from TVA and cost share from grant recipients. It aims to position an EV charger every 50 miles along Tennessee interstates and highways. 
Under Fast Charge TN’s first round, 35 charging sites are operational and 18 more are under development.
The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, which oversees the Fast Charge TN program, announced on Friday that it will extend its application period for the second round of funding through Sept. 19 at 4 p.m.
This round will prioritize charging locations in areas that the department anticipates will not be served by the NEVI program.

(Photo: Getty Images)The Lawrence County Board of Education agreed Thursday to revise a controversial attendance policy that discounted doctors’ notes as a valid excuse for a child missing school.
The policy, adopted in June, drew national headlines and pushback from local parents who protested against rules that spelled out escalating consequences if their child missed school for illness or other reasons – consequences that included expedited referrals to court for truancy proceedings.
“We have listened to the community and we have made some adjustments to the attendance policies,” John Daniel, board chairman, told a standing-room-only crowd that turned out for the often contentious meeting.
The board voted to separate its chronic absenteeism policy from its truancy policy, differentiating the consequences parents and students may face for missed school days.
Lawrence County school district will no longer excuse students with a doctor’s note

The new truancy policy continues to refer parents and students to court after eight absences, but will allow for excused absences for illness, including notes from a doctor. 
In Tennessee, truancy referrals to courts typically do not begin until a child has 18 unexcused school absences. 
All school absences could still trigger interventions under a separate chronic absenteeism policy designed to address the growing number of habitually absent students that schools across the nation have been seeing since the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions could include conversations with school officials, counseling and in-home education services.
The original policy shared by the district of about 7,000 students spelled out consequences for families after a child was absent for three days and noted children would be referred to truancy court after eight days even with doctors’ notes attesting to a child’s illness during their absence.
The policy prompted outrage. On Thursday night, the board was presented with a petition with nearly 3,000 signatures calling for the policy’s revocation. Parents on Thursday took turns for nearly 45 minutes during the public comment portion of the board meeting lambasting the policy as government overreach that undermined the judgement of parents and doctors.

(Photo: John Partipilo)I hear from many Tennesseans concerned about the Trump administration’s effort to wind the clock back on equality, tangling with universities over hiring programs and the teaching of America’s brutal history of slavery, and stripping LGBTQ+ military service members of their ranks. 
Most recently, President Donald Trump took on the Smithsonian Institution, the world’s largest grouping of museums, education and research centers, most clustered around the National Mall in Washington, Dwh.C. The Smithsonian is truly one of the country’s treasures. 
On Tuesday, Trump blasted the Smithsonian for exhibits noting “how bad slavery was.” This came amid news that six states, four of which were part of the Confederacy, sent National Guard troops to Washington as part of Trump’s takeover of the capital city. 
The Trump administration’s efforts to rewind history and whitewash the ordeals of Black Americans reek of a pattern or racism, but we have similar efforts to drag us into the past at a much more local level — with the help of the Tennessee General Assembly. 
  This seal of Williamson County, Tennessee, features a Confederate battle flag draped over a cannon. No American flag appears on the seal.
Williamson County is now in the sixth year of an effort to remove the Confederate flag from the county seal and has been stymied by state lawmakers, who created a new law to ensure the flag of traitors continues to represent Tennessee’s most affluent county. 
Franklin, the county seat, was the site of one of the Civil War’s bloodiest battles. On Nov. 30, 1864, six Confederate generals were killed in the Battle of Franklin and according to the American Battlefield Trust, the scale of the Confederate charge rivaling that of Pickett’s Charge at the Battle of Gettysburg. 
As Civil War battles go, it was a big deal. 
And yet, Tennessee in its 229 year history as a state was part of the Confederacy for only four years. The Confederate battle flag was added to the Williamson County seal in 1968, which was arguably the height of the Civil Rights Movement, a time more than 100 years after the Civil War ended at which Black Americans were still fighting for desegregated facilities and rights equal to those of white Americans. 
I talked with Eric Jacobson, CEO and Chief Historian for the Battle of Franklin Trust. Jacobson’s job is to tell the story of the Franklin battle, the people who were part of it — including enslaved people — and to be a steward for the battlefield properties that draw historians and visitors from around the world. 
“It was put on the seal of this county in 1968, and it was done with as much intent as Georgia putting it on their state flag in 1956 or South Carolina running the flag up at the state capitol in 1961.”
Thus in 2020, a group of residents expressed their concern about having a symbol of the Confederacy represent the county so prominently. 
Confederate group seeks to restrain Williamson County from removing flag from county seal

The group began to jump hoops in the process to get the battle flag removed from the seal. A task force was created and recommended to the Williamson County Commission the seal be changed. The county commission voted to uphold the recommendation, moving to the next step: gaining approval for the flag’s removal from the Tennessee Historical Commission. 
The Historical Commission’s mission is to “care for the proper marking and preservation of battlefields, houses, and other places celebrated in the history of the state.” Fifteen members, all appointed by the governor, voted unanimously in 2022 to allow the flag’s removal, ruling that a seal did not qualify as a memorial to be protected by the Tennessee Heritage Protection Act. 
With that, all should have been well, and the flag should have been stripped from the Williamson County seal and cast into the dustbin of history. 
After years of litigation with the Sons of Confederate Veterans — a Columbia, Tennessee group that has historically promoted white supremacy and been linked with white extremist organizations — the county finally won the case in 2025. But state lawmakers intervened, putting their collective thumb on the scale for the Confederate supporters. 
Sen. Janice Bowling, a Tullahoma Republican, and Rep. Dave Wright, a Knox County Republican, sponsored a measure to override the state Historical Commission. The new law specifically states “the definition of a ‘memorial,’ for purposes of Tennessee heritage protection, an official governmental seal of a city or county government that contains imagery representative of any historic conflict, historic entity, historic event, historic figure, or historic organization.” 
The bill passed 70-24 in the House and 27-6 in the Senate. No Democrats voted for the measure, which Gov. Bill Lee — a Williamson County native — signed into law. 
So the Confederate flag, a symbol of treason and of traitors, remains on the Williamson County seal, a giant public middle finger, a distorted Jim Crow law, not only to Black Tennesseans to but to every Tennessean, regardless of race, for whom the truth of the nation’s savage and disgraceful history is important.

He’ll make public appearances on occasion, but the accolades – and there are plenty of those — come from others who have worked with him. Eric Brocksome, who heads the foundation’s wellness program, offers insights about Minor.
“He is the heartbeat of the wildland community,” Brocksome says. “None of this would happen without his vision, kindness and awareness of the community. He has been the primary fundraiser and a quiet presence for the entirety of the foundation’s existence. No one can duplicate his energy, love and understanding of what the needs are in the wildland community. He is often the first call from the federal government and contractors when there is an incident. They all have his cell phone number.”
There’s nothing lightweight about what the foundation does. It is, as Minor describes on the foundation’s website, a resource for comfort and stability for firefighters injured or killed in the line of duty.
“For nearly 30 years, we’ve had the honor of standing with wildland firefighters and their families through some of the hardest days of their lives,” Minor says. “We’ve sat in living rooms after a loss, visited hospital rooms after injuries, and spoken with individuals and families carrying the invisible weight of this work. These moments have shaped not just the mission of the Wildland Fighter Foundation – they’ve shaped me.”
According to Brocksome, Minor reacts “quickly and humbly” when there are injuries or death. Help includes buying groceries, taking care of daily needs, or making housing payments if necessary.
“Our job is to support the families and fill the gaps that agencies are not able to fill,” Brocksome said.
The wildland firefighting community is reeling after a tragic ambush in Coeur d’Alene on June 29, where two firefighters were killed in the line of duty and a third was gravely injured. The attack, which occurred during a routine response, has sent shockwaves through fire crews across the region and beyond. The Wildland Firefighter Foundation stepped in to offer support. Minor personally contacted the appropriate agencies as soon as news broke and has remained in communication with those on the ground.
The Wildland Firefighter Foundation will honor the two firefighters at its Boise headquarters when the time is appropriate. This recognition is a solemn tradition for the foundation, which has long served as a source of comfort and solidarity for the wildland fire service.
The wildland foundation goes beyond Idaho’s borders. The foundation’s reach has gone to places such as Canada and Australia – wherever a tragedy occurs.
“When a wildland firefighter is lost, and the foundation is contacted for assistance, the weight of that support, is carried almost exclusively by our executive director,” Brocksome says. “He’s attended more funerals than anyone would ever want in a lifetime.”

Two years ago, the foundation added a wellness program to the mix. Brocksome, who has 15 years of experience in mental health and personal development, was hired for the position. Wildland fighters are a unique breed. Brocksome says there are roughly 30,000 men and women wildland fighters of the nation’s 1.3 million firefighters.
“It’s an interesting personality type that is willing to work six to eight months straight, on 14-day rolls, and only two or three days for a break,” Brocksome says. “They eat together and sleep in the dirt, basically next to each other. There’s chronic stress and the nutrition is suspect – sometimes when they are on the road, it amounts to a hotdog at a gas station. The jokes get old, and the nerves get frayed. They are sacrificing barbecues, holidays, kids’ birthdays and all the stuff we take for granted, as part of our existence.”
Firefighters thrive on the adrenalin rush that comes with battling blazes, but there is a downside away from the action. Suicide and divorce rates are high. Alcohol and substance abuse are common problems in the wildland community.
“Mental health is a big concern for the firefighters,” Brocksome says.
And where would we be without them? These are men and women who put their lives on the line to fight the most vicious of natural disasters. These warriors are true American heroes.
More recently under Burk Minor’s direction and for almost 30 years, the Wildland Firefighter Foundation has been on the front lines to ensure that these heroes are well served.

Facing growing pressure from advocacy groups, lawsuits and climate projections that show hotter days ahead, some state prison systems are moving to install air conditioning and expand cooling measures — though many facilities remain years away from significant upgrades.
But in other states, such efforts have stalled or failed. That may lead to more lawsuits in the future, experts say, even as judges may raise the bar for such cases.
An emphasis on being “tough on crime” and prioritizing other public safety measures may have contributed to less attention on prison conditions in some states. In others, slowing revenue growth and pressure to rein in corrections spending could be making new investments a harder sell.
At least two states this year, Virginia and Texas, considered legislation addressing excessive heat in prisons but neither measure became law. The Texas bill would have required the state Department of Criminal Justice to purchase and install climate control systems in all of its facilities by the end of 2032. About two-thirds of the state’s correctional facilities have only partial or no air conditioning.
The measure passed the House but did not advance in the Senate before the legislature adjourned in June.

In Virginia, lawmakers approved a bill that would have required the state corrections department to install heat and air conditioning in its prisons and to ensure cell temperatures not exceed 80 degrees. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed it, citing the cost of installation and operational burdens. Youngkin also wrote that existing state corrections data “does not substantiate the claims of extreme temperatures or health risks.”
But in Delaware, the fiscal year 2026 capital budget approved last month includes $2 million in funding to install air conditioning at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center.
These changes mark the latest actions in a long-running debate over how correctional systems respond to rising summer temperatures — an issue that affects both incarcerated people and staff. Some of the policy debates and facility updates this year follow years of advocacy and litigation over the health, safety and operational challenges posed by heat in correctional settings.

The problem of excessive heat in prisons has persisted for decades and has unfolded alongside other challenges, including chronic understaffing and overcrowding. In some cases, these problems have led to extended facility lockdowns, even during the summer months.
“There are people working in prisons and they have the right to work in climates that are comfortable,” said Nancy La Vigne, a criminal justice researcher and dean of the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University. “When they’re not, there’s retention issues, and it’s hard to replace staff. And when you don’t replace staff, then you have challenges in maintaining the safety and security of the facility.”
In New York, for example, correctional officers staged a three-week strike earlier this year and many didn’t return to work. Some facilities now are operating with 30%-60% fewer guards than needed, resulting in some incarcerated people getting only an hour or two outside of their cells each day.
A 2023 study published in the peer-reviewed PLOS One journal found that mortality in state and private prisons rose during periods of extreme heat, with deaths increasing 3.5% on extreme heat days and up to 7.4% during three-day heat waves. Between 2001 and 2019, nearly 13,000 people died in prison during the summer months, almost half of them in the South, though the study did not determine how many of those deaths were directly attributable to heat.
Climate change is fueling longer, more intense periods of extreme heat. Exposure to extreme heat can worsen conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and asthma, and has also been linked to worsening mental health and higher suicide rates among incarcerated people.
“Average temperatures are rising, and you’re going to have more and more states around the country where incarcerated people are held in conditions that are not livable because they’re too hot,” said Sharon Dolovich, a law professor and director of the Prison Law and Policy Program at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Some upgrades
At least 44 states lack universal air conditioning within their prison facilities, even in regions known for sweltering summer temperatures, according to a 2022 USA Today analysis. A recent Reuters investigation also found that nearly half of state prisons across 29 states have partial or no air conditioning in housing units.
But some states are investing millions to update their prison facilities.
In North Carolina, corrections officials are working toward their goal of installing air conditioning in all 54 state prisons by 2026. To date, 33 facilities are fully air-conditioned, 17 are partially air-conditioned, and four have no air conditioning, according to its dashboard.
In California, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, which operates 31 adult prisons, has spent $246 million in the past five years on cooling improvements at five prisons, according to a department spokesperson.
Lawmakers this year also approved funding for the Air Cooling Pilot Program at three facilities, with $17.6 million allocated for fiscal years 2025-26 and $20 million for fiscal years 2026-27. It will evaluate the effectiveness of two alternatives prior to a statewide plan to address high indoor temperatures across the California prison system.

The Texas Department of Criminal Justice, as of Aug. 1, is building 12,827 “cool beds,” or prison cells in air-conditioned units, and is in the process of procuring an additional 7,162, according to its dashboard.
Texas is one of the states most closely associated with heat-related deaths in prison. A 2022 study estimated that, on average, 14 deaths per year in Texas prisons are associated with heat. And a Texas Tribune analysis found that at least 41 incarcerated people died during a record-breaking heat wave in 2023.
In March, a federal judge ruled the extreme heat in Texas prisons is “plainly unconstitutional,” but declined to order immediate air conditioning, saying the work could not be completed within the court order’s 90-day window and temporary systems might delay a permanent fix.
‘More miserable’
Sweltering summer heat can turn prisons into pressure cookers. People inside already may have health conditions, limited access to cooling, or take medications that make it harder for their bodies to handle the heat. And research suggests that high temperatures can heighten irritability and aggression, sometimes fueling more conflicts between incarcerated people or with staff.
“It makes you more miserable. … If you to the point of even thinking about suicide, that’s just going to add to it,” said Ronald McKeithen, who spent 37 years incarcerated in Alabama prisons and is now the director of second chances at the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice. McKeithen recalls feeling “on edge” due to tension among other incarcerated people on hot days.
At the Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin, Devin Skrzypchak said the heat worsens his bladder condition, and he often can’t get the incontinence briefs he needs. The heat forces him to drink more water, and on days when ice isn’t available, he’s left drenched in sweat.
“At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating,” Skrzypchak wrote in a message to Stateline through the facility’s messaging platform.










At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating.


– Devin Skrzypchak, incarceraed at Oshkosh Correctional Institution


D’Angelo Lee Komanekin — who has spent about 25 years in and out of different Wisconsin corrections facilities — said prison architecture plays a major role in why temperatures inside climb so high.
“The planet is getting hotter and hotter,” said Komanekin, who relies on a small plastic fan to stay cool. Komanekin also is incarcerated at the Oshkosh Correctional Institution. “They’re doing nothing about the architecture. Some institutions’ windows open, some don’t, but most of the doors have steel doors with trap doors.”
Older prison designs that rely heavily on steel and concrete building materials often trap heat, making it difficult to keep temperatures down in the summer. Aging facilities also are less likely to be equipped for the installation of central air conditioning.
Some state prison systems, including Alabama’s and Wisconsin’s, are adding air-conditioning or air-tempering systems to new prison construction and major renovation projects.
Future legal battles
Legal experts say the issue of excessive heat in prisons is likely to become more pressing as climate change drives longer and hotter summers.
Extreme heat in correctional facilities has already been the subject of litigation in dozens of states, with plaintiffs arguing that high temperatures constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Court rulings in these cases have varied, but some experts say even more lawsuits are likely if facilities do not adapt.
“The conditions are going to worsen. [Incarcerated people are] going to be looking for every possible avenue for assistance they can,” Dolovich, the UCLA law professor, told Stateline.

One of the latest cases comes from Missouri, where the nonprofit law firm MacArthur Justice Center filed a class-action lawsuit in May on behalf of six incarcerated people at Algoa Correctional Center.
The lawsuit alleges that the conditions violate their constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment. It seeks to require the Missouri Department of Corrections to work with experts to develop a heat mitigation plan that keeps housing unit temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees. If the department cannot meet that standard, the plaintiffs are asking for the release of three of the incarcerated people who have less than a year remaining on their sentences.
Lawsuits such as the Missouri case often focus on claims that extreme heat worsens existing medical problems. To proceed, they must meet two legal requirements: proving the heat poses a serious health or safety risk, and showing prison officials knew about the danger but failed to address it, according to Dolovich, whose work has focused on the Eighth Amendment and prison conditions.
Courts may also raise the bar for proving such claims if judges echo decisions in cases with similar Eight Amendment arguments related to the death penalty and homelessness, Dolovich said. Judges have shifted, she said, toward a “superadding terror, pain and disgrace” standard under the Eighth Amendment — a higher threshold requiring proof that conditions were created with the intent to cause unnecessary suffering.
Dolovich added that some recent court decisions have provided only narrow remedies, such as ordering ice and fans instead of installing air conditioning.
“Prison officials have a moral and a constitutional responsibility to respond to changing conditions. In this case, it means air conditioning. … Anything less than that, to me, is indefensible.” she said.

  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Now that the Wisconsin budget has called for closing the aging Green Bay Correctional Institution, lawmakers, the governor’s office and the Department of Corrections are having to grapple with how to carry it out. 
“For the first time in ever, we finally have agreements in the Legislature and with the executive branch on how to move forward,” said state Rep. David Steffen (R-Howard) after an Allouez village board meeting last week.
There are unresolved details that will need time to work out, Steffen said, but “we’re moving in the right direction.”
Steffen, state Rep. Ben Franklin (R-De Pere) and state Sen. Jamie Wall (D-Green Bay) spoke to the village board Aug. 19 about plans to close the prison, located in the village adjacent to the city of Green Bay. Gov Tony Evers and DOC Secretary Jared Hoy were invited to the meeting but were unable to come, Allouez Village Board President Jim Rafter said. 
The 2025-27 Wisconsin budget includes money for preliminary plans to  revamp Wisconsin’s prison system and close the Green Bay prison. But what Evers originally proposed and what the document looked like when it reached his desk were far apart.
Pushing for a deadline
Evers originally called for $325 million for a series of projects that would enable the state to close the Green Bay prison in 2029 and transform Waupun Correctional Institution. 
What the Legislature passed — largely written by the GOP majority on the powerful Joint Finance Committee — includes $15 million for prison system construction planning related to the corrections department’s realignment, including closing the Green Bay prison.

When he signed the budget July 3, Evers vetoed the 2029 closing  deadline, arguing in his veto message that the Legislature had rejected his own plan for closing the prison, which also aimed for closure in 2029. The Legislature, he wrote, provided “virtually no real, meaningful or concrete plan” in place of his. 
Republican lawmakers criticized Evers’ veto.  In a statement the day that the budget was signed, Steffen said that “only in government would four and a half years be too short of a deadline to finalize the closure of a crumbling building.” 
Republican lawmakers want to restore the deadline. Franklin said at last week’s meeting that he will introduce a bill in the fall to set a closing deadline and wants it to be Dec. 31, 2029. The bill should specify that the deadline could only be extended with approval from the Legislature, he said. 
Wall gave less weight to the impact of  setting a deadline. He pointed to Lincoln Hills, which houses male juvenile offenders. The facility has remained open for years after the original deadline to close it, Wall said, because the Legislature did not take the steps needed to meet that target date.
He also expressed concern that people might leave because of a deadline “that may or may not become real,” exacerbating ongoing staffing problems in the system. 
While the shortage of correctional officers improved after pay increased, vacancies have started rising again. The DOC and prisons across the country have experienced staffing troubles, which can lead to more restrictive conditions for incarcerated people. 
Vacancy rates published by the DOC for correctional officers and sergeant positions in adult prisons climbed to 35% in August 2023. The vacancy rate declined to about 11% in fall 2024, but it has since increased to 17%. At Green Bay and Waupun, it’s over 25%.  
“Historically speaking, from the time that I started there to the time that I left… if 10 new people would start at one point, usually half would quit,” former Green Bay corrections officer Jeff Hoffman told the Examiner last year. “Because they didn’t want to work in that environment.” 
Differences over prison system planning
Franklin said his proposed deadline bill will more specifically state how the $15 million will be spent.
Wall said the DOC is already developing a plan for spending the money, which will go through the state building commission. The plan is to direct the money to the  kind of facility changes that Evers proposed originally, he said.  
Franklin said Republicans will have to be flexible in adopting some of Evers’ proposals to restructure juvenile centers and medium and maximum security adult prisons. He said he doesn’t think everything will be adopted as Evers originally proposed, however. 
Franklin said he also wants to set milestone dates, for actions such as transfers of incarcerated people, which would provide “a barometer of where we’re at” ahead of the closing deadline. 
He said he also wants quarterly progress reports to the Joint Finance Committee.
Steffen said the committee and the Legislature should have the opportunity to see and understand plans and ask questions more than once and have time to deal thoughtfully with the situation instead of “in a pressure cooker budget environment.” 
Wall cautioned against moving too slowly, however. DOC has some projects that could go up for approval early in 2026, he said.
“And time is not necessarily on our side here when it comes to the state budget,” Wall said, noting that if the economy softens, that could affect the state budget.  
According to the Wisconsin Policy Forum, the state could be facing a more difficult budget in 2027 than it has seen in recent years, with recently approved spending and tax cuts using up most of the surplus.
Speaking to reporters after the Allouez meeting, Steffen said that “we are generally in agreement on what to do with the buildings, the expansions at the other facilities and the closure” at Green Bay. 
But he said there will be incarcerated people who need somewhere to go. Republicans and Democrats differ on whether to expand the earned release program — releasing some people before their sentence is completed — or “find the space within the system” to move them, Steffen said. He raised the possibility of having local jails take in prisoners, a tactic the Department of Corrections has used to reduce overcrowding. 
Funding remains uncertain, Steffen added. 
Aging prison system
A 2020 draft report on the Department of Corrections’ website includes information about problems created by the infrastructure inside the aging prisons in Green Bay and Waupun. 
“There are a lot of issues with running facilities that are that old,” Hoy said in April about the Green Bay facility. “We shouldn’t be running prisons in that manner in 2025… We want to do more with our population than what those facilities can afford us to do.”
Prison reform advocates hold vigils outside the prison. Wisconsin Department of Corrections data shows that on average, prisoners at GBCI spend an average of 48.5 days in disciplinary separation, where an incarcerated person may be sent for committing a violation — the most of any prison listed.
While lawmakers push to close the Green Bay prison, it’s unclear what will become of Waupun, the state’s oldest prison, which has attracted scrutiny for a string of prisoner deaths, a lockdown and living conditions. 
The governor’s proposal in February aimed to close the prison temporarily and convert it to a medium-security institution and “vocational village” emphasizing job training and readiness at an  estimated cost of $245.3 million. The provision did not pass the Legislature. 
While Allouez’s Rafter wants to close the Green Bay prison, Waupun mayor Rohn Bishop has called for keeping Waupun Correctional Institution open. 
Bishop has pointed to the economic impact on Waupun and to the city’s history and heritage. In a column in December, he said the city donated the land to bring the prison there, generations of people in Waupun have worked at the prison and local churches have had outreach to incarcerated people.

(Photo by Sam Foree)UnitedHealth Group’s multibillion-dollar pharmacy benefit manager, Optum Rx, is suing five Kentucky counties in an attempt to force them out of national opioid litigation against the company.
Pharmacy benefit managers, often called PBMs, act as middlemen that negotiate prescription drug prices between drug companies, insurance plans, and pharmacies. Some lawyers and advocates say PBMs helped fuel the overdose crisis by failing to restrict the flow of opioid prescriptions.
As governments begin exploring potential lawsuits against PBMs — a step that could represent the next wave in opioid-related litigation — Optum Rx is attempting to shut down those efforts, in some cases before they even fully take shape.
In June, Optum Rx sued Anderson, Boyd, Christian, Nicholas, and Oldham counties in Kentucky for allegedly making decisions about participating in the new wave of national opioid lawsuits behind closed doors, violating Kentucky’s open meetings law. Optum Rx is asking courts to effectively force those counties to make their decisions again, this time in open meetings, potentially with the hope that some won’t bother because of the administrative burden. The result could be fewer claims against the company and possibly less money for it to pay in a future settlement.
But legal experts call Optum’s case “hypertechnical” and “frivolous,” and addiction recovery advocates say it could set a dangerous precedent for companies to evade accountability for their role in fueling the overdose crisis.
Christine Minhee, an attorney, a national expert on opioid litigation, and founder of OpioidSettlementTracker.com, said Optum’s suit reminded her of an adage among lawyers: “If the facts are on your side, pound the facts. If the law is on your side, pound the law. If neither is on your side, pound the table.”
“Right now, what we’re seeing is it pounding the table,” Minhee said of Optum Rx. The company is “desperately” trying “to find some kind of foothold” to get cases against it thrown out.
Minhee said these suits fit a pattern of Optum Rx using thin arguments to try to delay or evade opioid litigation nationwide.

Last year, Optum Rx, along with another PBM, asked a judge to throw out an opioid lawsuit filed by Los Angeles County, claiming during a December hearing that the county hadn’t shown harm. The judge appeared skeptical of the claims and ultimately rejected the companies’ request.
In April, the same companies tried to oust a federal judge overseeing national opioid litigation, claiming he was biased. Their argument was based partly on a Florida lawyer’s having said the judge was “plaintiff-oriented.” Their attempt failed.
Now, Optum Rx is working to keep five Kentucky counties out of that same sweeping opioid litigation.
That national legal undertaking began more than seven years ago, as jurisdictions saw overdose deaths climb. Many people who had become addicted to prescription painkillers were cut off by their doctors, and some transitioned to using deadlier heroin or fentanyl. Health care and public safety costs skyrocketed. Thousands of cities, counties, and states began suing health care companies for allegedly creating a public nuisance by aggressively marketing prescription painkillers and negligently distributing them.
Those cases were lassoed together into the giant multidistrict litigation, which has resulted in massive settlements. The first few waves of settlements involved opioid manufacturers, distributors, and retail pharmacies, with companies such as Johnson & Johnson, CVS, and Walgreens agreeing to pay state and local governments billions of dollars. The money is meant to be used for addiction treatment and prevention services — though its rollout has been controversial.
To add a new round of companies as defendants, jurisdictions must undertake a multistep process, said Peter Mougey, a Florida-based attorney who represents many local governments in the massive national litigation. The five Kentucky counties in question were in the early stages of that process, only having asked the judge to amend their complaint, he said. They hadn’t added Optum Rx yet.
If Optum Rx’s suits are successful, those counties would have the option of redoing the initial steps of the process in a public meeting, then continuing to add Optum Rx as a defendant, Mougey explained. The company may hope that some counties won’t undertake the extra administrative effort.
Optum Rx’s “goal is clearly just to wear down and tire out these small counties,” Mougey said. “They’re trying to have a chilling effect on the litigation.”
It’s not clear why Optum Rx targeted those five counties out of the many localities undertaking the process to add the company as a defendant. The Kentucky counties range from having fewer than 8,000 residents (Nicholas) to more than 70,000 (Christian). One is among the richest in Kentucky (Oldham), while others are poorer. Boyd County, in Appalachia, is one of the hardest hit, with a recent overdose rate twice the state average.
Optum Rx, in its filing against Boyd County, which was similar to claims against the other counties, said local authorities had taken official legal action by asking the judge to make a change in its case. The suit said such action must be done in a public meeting and that the county did not hold one.
Optum spokesperson Isaac Sorensen told KFF Health News that the company’s argument is not about “a technicality.”
It is “an important legal requirement designed to ensure accountability and transparency before a county takes legal action,” said the statement Sorensen provided. “We have found many counties ignored this requirement, alongside their duty to preserve relevant evidence, and Optum Rx will defend against these improper legal actions.”
The five Kentucky counties disagree with these assertions, according to court records. As of late July, all five had filed motions to dismiss Optum Rx’s claim.
Boyd County, like the others, argued in its motion to dismiss that asking a judge to amend its complaint was a routine, procedural step that did not require a public meeting. Optum Rx jumped the gun, the county argued, filing a case before any final action had been taken.
“No amended complaint has been filed. No new defendant, OptumRx included, has been added. No new lawsuit has been initiated,” Boyd County’s response said.
The county also pointed out that it held an open meeting in 2017 that kicked off its involvement in the national litigation and authorized future amendments to that litigation.
Hearings on the counties’ motions to dismiss Optum Rx’s suits are set for late August and early September, according to court records.
These cases are shaping up to be a Goliath-versus-David legal action. Although Oldham County is the wealthiest of the Kentucky counties that Optum Rx sued, its most recent budget is less than 0.1% of Optum Rx’s annual revenue, which the company reported as exceeding $133 billion in 2024.
Oldham County Attorney D. Berry Baxter told KFF Health News he’d seen the impact of the opioid epidemic as a prosecutor working on a growing number of drug-related cases over the years. Now, as settlement money is arriving from other companies, it has funded increased addiction treatment in local jails. More settlement money from additional companies could expand such services, Baxter said.
If Optum Rx succeeds in kicking Kentucky counties out of the national litigation, it would set “a really horrific precedent” for other PBMs and health care companies to do something similar, said Tara Hyde, CEO of the statewide nonprofit People Advocating Recovery.
Hyde said she’s been in recovery for more than a decade from an addiction that began with prescription painkillers for a broken leg. She wants to see PBMs and other companies held accountable and made to change their processes to prevent future crises.
Despite a recent decrease in overdose deaths nationwide, Hyde said people in her state, their families, and the economy are still hurting.
“Recovery doesn’t just happen overnight,” she said. “Without these dollars that have been a direct result of people being misled, mistreated, and taken advantage of, we will still be detrimentally impacted.”

(Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)Border crossings for personal vehicles into North Dakota from Canada were down about 30% for the first half of this year compared to 2024 — a trend that could stem from the U.S. executive branch’s policy and rhetoric.
The North Dakota Department of Commerce estimates that Canadian visitors spent roughly $14.4 million less in the first six months of 2025 than they did over the same time period last year. The department monitors border crossing numbers from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
“We are obviously watching the Canadian travel patterns and are concerned,” said Sara Otte Coleman, the director of the agency’s Marketing and Tourism Division.
Relations between the U.S. and Canada have been under stress since President Donald Trump took office. For one, the Trump administration currently has a 35% tariff on most imports from Canada. Canadian leaders have also expressed offense at certain comments made by Trump officials — like the president’s suggestion that Canada become the 51st state.
This has led some Canadians to boycott U.S. goods and travel. 
Tourism industry research supports the notion that U.S. politics are a leading reason for the decline in Canadian visitors, Otte Coleman said. She pointed to a July survey that asked 1,000 Canadian adults how they feel about traveling to the U.S.

In the poll, conducted by consulting firm Longwoods International, 63% of respondents said policy and politics have made them less likely to visit. Of those, 80% reported that America’s tariffs and economic policy was part of their reluctance to travel, and 71% said rhetoric by U.S. leaders had created a “less welcoming environment” and a “greater uncertainty around cross-border travel.”
Department of Commerce data from April to June shows in-state hotel occupancy and visits to Theodore Roosevelt National Park are also down compared to 2024 and 2023.
Fred Walker is the global marketing manager for the Tourism Division. He said travel from European countries is either flat or up, but travel from Canada is a different story. 
“We’re down quite a bit there,” he said. 
He said some of that is based on misperceptions or misinformation, such as a bogus photo of tanks along the U.S.-Canada border that some people took as legitimate. 
“But what we’re hearing is, people still want to come and see us,” Walker said. “Politics and policies change but the people here in North Dakota are who they were two years ago or 10 years ago.”
Fewer Canadians ordered tickets to the North Dakota State Fair this year even though the fair welcomed a record number of visitors overall, according to general manager Craig Rudland. The North Dakota State Fair in Minot had roughly 1,100 ticket orders from Canada this year compared to about 1,500 in 2024, Rudland said.
Rudland cautioned that these numbers are only rough estimates, however. 
He said the state fair has a dedicated base of Canadian patrons. He said most of his friends north of the border don’t seem to be letting national news sway decisions to visit.
The executive director of Visit Grand Forks, the city’s convention and visitors bureau, declined an interview request about Canadian tourism. The Minot convention and visitors bureau did not return a request for comment.

The International Peace Garden, a botanical garden that straddles North Dakota and Manitoba near the Dunseith port of entry, this month held a handshake across the border in a display of enduring friendship between the two nations. 
Americans and Canadians lined up on both sides of the border — which is marked in the middle of the garden — to greet one another and mingle.
Tim Chapman, the garden’s CEO, told the North Dakota Monitor previously that the event was intended to bring residents of U.S. and Canada together in spite of the ongoing friction between their leaders.
Between 300 and 400 people showed up for the event, according to International Peace Garden staff. 
Velma Schmidt, a retired nurse from Winnipeg, was among the group of Canadian visitors to the International Peace Garden earlier this month.
“I try to come here at least once every year,” she said.

Schmidt said the tension between the U.S. and Canada has made trips across the border more nerve-wracking, but that the positive memories and connections she makes while traveling are worth it. She said she was apprehensive ahead of her vacation to Washington, D.C., and New York earlier this year, for instance, but had a great time and met a lot of friendly people.
Janet Dickson, who lives in a Manitoba town near the border, said during the event that she appreciated the opportunity to set aside national politics and have ordinary, face-to-face conversations as neighbors.
“We’re normal people,” she said.

We showed up in droves to urge the Legislature to continue including free school meals in the fiscal year 2026 School Aid budget. We greeted members of the House and Senate with paper lunch bags filled with stories from across the state about the benefits of providing school meals for all students. 
These stories included “thank yous” from multiple perspectives: kids who come from families with low incomes shared that with free school meals, they can attend school without going hungry; administrators wrote stories about how giving all kids access to the same food has created a more inclusive environment in their schools; middle-class families expressed relief that their grocery bills are lower during the school year in a time when prices continue to rise. 
We know these stories are true because we have seen them play out since Michigan’s School Meals program was introduced in the 2024 state budget. More kids are eating breakfast (31% increase) and lunch (25% increase) at school, and families are saving an estimated $850 per student each school year on grocery bills. I spoke with a rising senior at a local high school who said that he appreciates the shift he has seen at his school since all students had access to free meals.
“I remember back in elementary school there used to be a stigma around kids getting free school lunch. It created a divide and class system that’s now completely gone.” 
Upon hearing the news that school lunches for all students might not be provided next school year, he responded with an emphatic groan, resounding “no,” and “I can’t pack my own lunch again!”

Since our day at the Capitol, little progress has been made on the state budgets, but school meals for all has remained a hot topic in advocacy circles and in budget negotiations. Both the governor and the Senate included funding for school meals in their budgets, but the House eliminated the line item for school meals in its budget.  
While budget negotiations drag on, teachers are beginning to set up their classrooms and families are tackling the back-to-school lists. On the other hand, school administrators are beginning to question whether or not funding for certain programs will be included in the state education budget. 
Just down the road from the Capitol, a school district announced that it will be ending its school meals for all program due to the budget uncertainty. Other districts are warning families that unless the state budget provides funds for school meals, they will end the program when funds run out at the end of September. The Michigan Department of Education and the State Superintendent are encouraging schools to continue providing school meals for all students, even if funding is not included in the final budget. 
The importance of providing school meals in the 2026 state budget is even more critical after the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Due to tax changes in the bill, an estimated 18 million students could lose access to free school meals nationwide. Cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will cost about 74,000 Michiganders their benefits, and cuts to Medicaid puts health care coverage for more than 500,000 people at risk. 
Times are about to get tougher for many Michigan families who will be forced to decide whether to get prescriptions filled or pay utilities. Food insecurity will grow. Students will be less healthy and more hungry, making attending and succeeding in school more difficult. If putting breakfast and lunch in front of our children at school everyday supports their health and educational attainment (leading to higher outcomes later in life), putting universal school meals in the state budget is a win for all of us. 
At the League, we love to remind people that the budget is a reflection of our state’s priorities. Let’s make sure that kids don’t go hungry, schools continue to be inclusive, and families aren’t forced to bear the cost of legislative inaction. 
School meals for all students is just one line item in question without a passed budget, though. Funding for literacy programs, mental health services, resources for English-language learners and more are all up in the air as the Legislature continues to negotiate on the K-12 budget. We will be watching the budget closely and keeping you up to date at www.mlpp.org.

Think about what the Statue of Liberty has symbolized and the message it has blasted to the world for centuries.
Immigrants from countries all across the world, near and far, have come here looking for a better life, and in doing so have poured their time and talent to help build America and make it what it has come to be.
Whether they came by force or free.
Whether they were duly compensated and able to build a life for their families and future generations or they had no choice but to build those opportunities for others.
Sadly, those same immigrants who have help build this country and made myriad contributions are no longer welcome. They stand to have their American experiences and contributions marginalized, even erased.
The political and morally corrupt actions — militarizing ICE to deport both legal and undocumented immigrants, dismantling Black history, equal rights, voting rights — of the Trump administration are deliberate efforts to rewrite America’s history and to dictate a racially and economically homogenized future identity.
All of this rather than focusing on immigration reform and implementing sensible immigration policies that embrace what has been a key component of the fabric that is America.
Given the treatment of immigrants coming to this country today, seeking a better life and opportunities.
Given those who have spent decades making contributions to the many industries that sustain and advance every aspect of America’s economy, often working for minimal wages or less and often in retched conditions.
What does the Statue of Liberty mean today?
Hollow. Invisible.
What happened to the proud proclamation that America is this great melting pot, where there is opportunity to build a better life for anyone who dares to seize it?
But the hollow meaning of the Statue of Liberty is not the only crisis of identity we face.
What has happened to the power and function of the three branches of government that have been the bedrock of this democratic republic?
The shameless displays of impotence, cowardice and capitulation by any one of the three branches of government at any given time on any given issue have demonstrated the epitome of moral and ethical bankruptcy.
The executive branch, with the issuance of executive orders, have taken and enacted unprecedented powers — gutting and dismantling departments, defunding or freezing funds previously approved by Congress, usurping and dictating states’ rights — that have not been checked or challenged. Many violate the Constitution.
When it comes to the judicial branch of government, how are its responsibilities being carried out?
To continue unimpeded, the Trump Administration has launched a litany of legal actions and lawsuits seeking positive rulings in various jurisdictions, many of the cases  reaching the Supreme Court. The imbalanced Supreme Court has often ruled in the Trump administration’s favor.
What messages are being sent to the public about the court of last resort that has been counted on to be balanced, follow the strict letter of the laws as outlined in our Constitution?
Not much.
Then there is the legislative. The current Republican-dominated House and Senate have willingly subjugated their powers and abdicated their responsibilities to the will of the Trump administration.
Going along to get along whether it is in the best interest of the people who send them there or not.
Is this how a democratic republic is supposed to function? If not, then why is it happening?
The tentacles of this identity crisis, and the moral and ethical paucity that engulfs them, are only spreading.
They are reaching into the annals of American history by launching efforts to ferret out facts and truths about what the experiences have been, especially for Blacks. The historical records, books and artifacts are in danger of being purged to whitewash and recast what has really happened in building America.
Tentacles are being dispatched to change the processes of a voting system — eliminating mail-in voting, eliminating the voting machines and using only paper ballots, changing identification requirements — all methods that work, all in an effort to make it more difficult to cast a vote by those who may be elderly, disabled, or a member of minority groups.
Not to mention to make it easier to manipulate the final vote tally.
Tentacles to change America’s identity are also reaching into the tapestry of our rich culture when it comes to music and the arts in efforts to dismiss, marginalize, obliterate and delegitimize the grand contributions made by artists and musicians from every race and ethnic group that make up America. What is occurring at the Kennedy Center is the most obvious.
The tentacles reach even lower by removing portraits of presidents and putting them in some obscure place in the White House, the people’s house, away from prominent view as if that will erase that they have ever held the office.
These are just a few examples.
What are we, the people, to do amid this onslaught to change who America is and what she is all about, our should be about?
The real test is what we hold within us.
America’s identity ultimately resides within her people. Always has been. Always will be.
The crisis we face today is no different.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Americas-Identity-Crisis1-e-crow-1024x543.jpg,,,2025-08-25 06:57:07.184375

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)When California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled his plan to retaliate if Republican-led Texas redrew its congressional districts to favor the GOP, he affirmed his support for less partisan maps — and then promised to “meet fire with fire.”
“We’re doing it mindful that we want to model better behavior,” Newsom told reporters in Los Angeles earlier this month, nodding to the independent system his state currently uses to draw districts. “ … But we cannot unilaterally disarm. We can’t stand back and watch this democracy disappear.”
President Donald Trump’s call for Republicans to redraw U.S. House districts so the party can win more seats in the 2026 midterm elections — to gerrymander them — has triggered a redistricting frenzy this summer that also threatens to prompt moves by Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and New York, among others. Ohio was already set to redraw its lines, even before the current fracas.
The battle for partisan advantage is placing Democratic politicians, advocates of less partisan maps and others who support curbs on gerrymandering in an uncomfortable position, pitting their desire for change against fears that Trump will take advantage of their scruples to wring more GOP seats out of a handful of key states. Some say they accept that Democratic states need to respond, while others warn retaliation will only yield short-term gains.
The Texas House passed a new map on Wednesday, clearing the way for a final vote in the state Senate and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature. In California, lawmakers passed their own map on Thursday, setting up a statewide vote in November over the new districts.
Other states are now likely to follow, as Republicans and Democrats scramble for a political leg up.










I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard.


– David Daley, senior fellow at FairVote


But gerrymandering opponents say the current moment has the potential to produce new energy for their movement. More people are paying attention to gerrymandering, they say, and new polls show the public opposes the practice. The rush to redraw maps demonstrates the need for Congress to set national limits, they say.
“I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard,” said David Daley, an author of books on gerrymandering and a senior fellow at FairVote, a Maryland-based nonpartisan group that supports ranked choice voting and multimember House districts to end the practice. “We will never have reform if a handful of states can act on their own.”
At the same time, some gerrymandering opponents fear states will unravel hard-fought victories. They wonder whether temporary measures, such as California potentially setting aside the independent commission it uses to redraw maps, could become permanent.
 ‘An unprecedented time’

State legislatures exercise primary control over congressional redistricting in 39 states, according to All About Redistricting, a compendium of information on map-drawing hosted by Loyola Law School in California. While some states use other methods, only nine states rely on independent commissions, which typically limit participation by elected officials and are favored by many gerrymandering opponents.
Most states draw maps once a decade after the census, making the mid-decade maneuvers and counter-maneuvers highly unusual (six states currently have only one representative, eliminating the need to draw district lines). But just a few seats could determine who controls the U.S. House. Republicans currently hold 219 seats to Democrats’ 212, with four vacancies.
“We affirm that gerrymandering, both racial and political, disenfranchises voters,” Virginia Kase Solomón, president and CEO of Common Cause, an organization that has long advocated for changes to the redistricting process, said during a press call the day before Newsom’s announcement.
“But this is an unprecedented time of political upheaval,” she said. People don’t want to see a situation develop where maps are redrawn every two years, she added.
Texas House Republicans propose new congressional map to increase GOP seats
The new Texas map could ease the path for Republicans to win an additional five seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Texas lawmakers rapidly advanced the redraw this week once Democratic state lawmakers returned to the state. They had traveled to other states to deny Texas House leaders the quorum required to approve the map, but returned after Newsom outlined California’s response.
Gerrymandering typically involves “packing” and “cracking.” “Packing” refers to the concentration of opposition party voters in a small number of districts to reduce competition elsewhere. “Cracking” means diluting the voting power of the opposing party’s supporters across many districts.
Texas Republicans have been frank that they are pursuing the redraw for partisan advantage. But they emphasize that no prohibition exists, in Texas or nationally, against mid-decade redistricting and that a 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision cleared the way for states to draw maps for partisan purposes, removing the power of federal courts to police political gerrymandering.
The new maps give Republicans a chance of winning additional districts but doesn’t guarantee victories, they add.
“The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance,” Texas state Rep. Todd Hunter, a Republican who carried the bill in the Texas House, said during floor debate on Wednesday. He added a short time later: “According to the U.S. Supreme Court, you can use political performance, and that is what we’ve done.”
 Tricky terrain

As Texas moves forward and California prepares to respond, Common Cause illustrates the tricky terrain anti-gerrymandering advocates are now navigating.
The group, headquartered in Washington, D.C., fought to enact the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2008. But earlier this month, Common Cause declined to condemn California’s retaliation, saying it will judge the effort by whether the maps are a proportional response to gerrymanders in other states, whether the process includes meaningful public participation, and whether the maps expire and are replaced after the 2030 census through the state’s regular redistricting process, among other criteria.
Newsom’s proposal, the Election Rigging Response Act, will ask California voters in November to temporarily set aside the state’s redistricting commission and approve the new map drawn by the legislature. The commission would resume drawing maps following the census.
Why congressional redistricting is blowing up across the US this summer
Recent polling shows widespread public opposition to gerrymandering. A YouGov poll of 1,116 Americans conducted in early August found 69% believe it should be illegal to draw districts in a way that makes it harder for members of a particular political party to elect their preferred candidates. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The number of Americans who say gerrymandering is a big problem has jumped in recent years. In the YouGov poll, 75% of respondents said it is a major problem when districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party, up from 66% in a 2022 survey.
Some California Republicans have responded to Newsom’s proposal by defending the commission system. A group of Republicans sued in state court to block the plan, but the California Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a request to temporarily halt the effort.
 ‘Is this bad for reform?’

While members of the public might say they favor citizen-led commissions, they may not care deeply about the issue, said David Hopkins, a political science professor at Boston College who has written on polarization in American politics. He called gerrymandering a “classic process subject” that comes off as “inside baseball” to many people.
“The legislators in states that haven’t adopted commissions clearly don’t feel any particular political pressure to do so,” Hopkins said.
Some Republicans in states weighing a mid-decade gerrymander also discount the risk of a public backlash.

In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe may call a special session this fall to redraw the state’s map in hopes of gaining an additional GOP seat in the U.S. House. James Harris, a Missouri Republican consultant with close ties to GOP officials in the state, said he wasn’t concerned redistricting would create momentum to change the process.
Missouri voters in recent years have approved ballot measures favored by Democrats, including one in 2018 that empowered a nonpartisan demographer to draw state legislative districts, though not congressional districts. But Republicans led a successful campaign to convince voters to repeal the changes two years later.
Harris painted any new potential map as part of a national effort to help Trump — who received 58.5% of the vote in Missouri last November.
“I think the lens is wanting to make sure the president has a majority in Congress so he can actually govern for the last two years versus two years of investigations, gridlock,” Harris said.
Advocates of less partisan maps said lawmakers aren’t likely to surrender their own role in mapmaking. While some state courts may limit redistricting excesses, federal courts stopped policing partisan gerrymandering following the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision. And the high court may soon weaken the judiciary’s power to block race-based gerrymandering.
Samuel Wang, director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which supports eliminating partisan gerrymandering, said the “one good thing” about the redistricting battle is that it’s prompted voters to pay attention to an arcane and technical issue. That could be a positive in the long run, he said, “if people can keep a cool head.”
Wang has written online that any response to Texas should remain measured and proportionate. California offers Democrats the only clean option to strike back, Wang wrote. Five Democratic seats could be added by redrawing the state.
“Is this bad for reform? I mean, I’m torn,” Wang told Stateline. “Because on the other hand, Democrats have been, over the last few decades, vocal in their advocacy for voting rights in various forms and now that advocacy is in question because they find a need to fight fire with fire.”
“So I guess the way I would characterize it is if they can hold it in check and not do it in every single state and just engage in whatever they’re doing where it will make a difference,” he said, “then we might not lose all the progress that’s been made.”

The high court made the ruling last Tuesday in an appeal by a Crawford County man who sought homophobic Facebook posts by two Penncrest School Board members critical of a display of LGBTQ+ literature outside a high school library.
The justices voted to send the case back to Crawford County Court for further review, upholding a 2023 decision in Commonwealth Court.
But the 4-3 majority rejected a “new test” proposed by the Commonwealth Court to determine whether social media posts are public records. 
The Commonwealth Court instructed the county court to examine whether the social media accounts were public or private, whether the posts “prove, support, or evidence a transaction or activity of an agency,” and whether the posts constitute “actions of public officials in their official capacity.”
“Along these lines, we agree with the Commonwealth Court that in this case, the trial court was required, but failed, to consider a host of different factors when assessing whether the Facebook posts documented a transaction or activity “of an agency,” Justice Sallie Updyke Mundy wrote for the Supreme Court majority.
But it stressed a government record is narrowly defined as information that documents a transaction or activity of an agency and is created in connection with such business.
“Today, we reaffirm that this two-part inquiry is the only test to be utilized when determining whether disclosure of information, regardless of its form, is required under the statute,” Updyke Mundy wrote.
Melissa Melewsky, media law counsel for the Pennsylvania NewsMedia Association, said the Supreme Court’s decision preserves the status quo as far as the presumption that government records are public and the definition of a public record applying to social media posts. But it provides little clarity about what will happen in the case of the Penncrest School Board members. 
“It’s really hard to have a brightline test where there are no brightline facts,” Melewsky said. “But it’s important to understand that the agencies and the courts that are interpreting challenges start from the standpoint that the presumption of access applies until there’s a very good reason there shouldn’t be.”
Penncrest School District drew attention in 2023 when it passed controversial policies on library materials that amounted to a ban on LGBTQ+ books and banned transgender girls from competing on girls’ sports teams.

According to the Commonwealth Court’s opinion, in May 2021 a parent in the school district posted a photo of a Pride Month book display with the comment, “Hey Maplewood/PENNCREST parents … just a little pic of what is on display at Maplewood High School Library … I realize this makes me a hater, but I am totally ok with that label.”
School board member David Valesky and Board President Luigi DeFrancesco reposted the photo on their Facebook pages. Valesky added the comment, “This is on display at Maplewood High School. Besides the point of being totally evil, this is not what we need to be teaching kids. They aren’t at school to be brainwashed into thinking homosexuality is okay. Its [sic] actually being promoted to the point where it’s even ‘cool.’”
Thomas Cagle made a Right to Know request for the board members’ posts that was denied by the school district. But the Office of Open Records and a Crawford County judge ruled in Cagle’s favor, directing the school district to comply with his request for posts and comments “related to homosexuality and Penncrest School District, its officials, employees, or students, or its curriculum, physical [resources], or electronic resources.”
Noting that no Pennsylvania court has directly tackled the question of whether public officials’ personal social media posts can be considered public records, a Commonwealth Court panel reversed the decisions.
Cagle sought an appeal in the Supreme Court, which was granted, and the Pennsylvania NewsMedia Association, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, the Pennsylvania School Boards Association and the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania filed “friend of the court” briefs.
Cagle argued the Commonwealth Court’s proposed test was convoluted and improperly treated social media differently than other information subject to the Right to Know Law. He also argued the lower court’s imposition of a requirement that posts be made in an “official capacity” is not supported by the text of the law and created incentives for officials to evade the law by using private accounts to conduct public business.
The school district argued that what the board members said in the posts was not as important as “where it was said,” comparing the Facebook posts to discussing board policy with friends at a back yard barbecue.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)When California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled his plan to retaliate if Republican-led Texas redrew its congressional districts to favor the GOP, he affirmed his support for less partisan maps — and then promised to “meet fire with fire.”
“We’re doing it mindful that we want to model better behavior,” Newsom told reporters in Los Angeles earlier this month, nodding to the independent system his state currently uses to draw districts. “ … But we cannot unilaterally disarm. We can’t stand back and watch this democracy disappear.”
President Donald Trump’s call for Republicans to redraw U.S. House districts so the party can win more seats in the 2026 midterm elections — to gerrymander them — has triggered a redistricting frenzy this summer that also threatens to prompt moves by Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and New York, among others. Ohio was already set to redraw its lines, even before the current fracas.
The battle for partisan advantage is placing Democratic politicians, advocates of less partisan maps and others who support curbs on gerrymandering in an uncomfortable position, pitting their desire for change against fears that Trump will take advantage of their scruples to wring more GOP seats out of a handful of key states. Some say they accept that Democratic states need to respond, while others warn retaliation will only yield short-term gains.
The Texas House passed a new map on Wednesday, clearing the way for a final vote in the state Senate and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature. In California, lawmakers passed their own map on Thursday, setting up a statewide vote in November over the new districts.
Other states are now likely to follow, as Republicans and Democrats scramble for a political leg up.



I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard.


– David Daley, senior fellow at FairVote


But gerrymandering opponents say the current moment has the potential to produce new energy for their movement. More people are paying attention to gerrymandering, they say, and new polls show the public opposes the practice. The rush to redraw maps demonstrates the need for Congress to set national limits, they say.
“I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard,” said David Daley, an author of books on gerrymandering and a senior fellow at FairVote, a Maryland-based nonpartisan group that supports ranked choice voting and multimember House districts to end the practice. “We will never have reform if a handful of states can act on their own.”
At the same time, some gerrymandering opponents fear states will unravel hard-fought victories. They wonder whether temporary measures, such as California potentially setting aside the independent commission it uses to redraw maps, could become permanent.
‘An unprecedented time’
State legislatures exercise primary control over congressional redistricting in 39 states, according to All About Redistricting, a compendium of information on map-drawing hosted by Loyola Law School in California. While some states use other methods, only nine states rely on independent commissions, which typically limit participation by elected officials and are favored by many gerrymandering opponents.
Most states draw maps once a decade after the census, making the mid-decade maneuvers and counter-maneuvers highly unusual (six states currently have only one representative, eliminating the need to draw district lines). But just a few seats could determine who controls the U.S. House. Republicans currently hold 219 seats to Democrats’ 212, with four vacancies.
“We affirm that gerrymandering, both racial and political, disenfranchises voters,” Virginia Kase Solomón, president and CEO of Common Cause, an organization that has long advocated for changes to the redistricting process, said during a press call the day before Newsom’s announcement.
“But this is an unprecedented time of political upheaval,” she said. People don’t want to see a situation develop where maps are redrawn every two years, she added.
The new Texas map could ease the path for Republicans to win an additional five seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Texas lawmakers rapidly advanced the redraw this week once Democratic state lawmakers returned to the state. They had traveled to other states to deny Texas House leaders the quorum required to approve the map, but returned after Newsom outlined California’s response.
Gerrymandering typically involves “packing” and “cracking.” “Packing” refers to the concentration of opposition party voters in a small number of districts to reduce competition elsewhere. “Cracking” means diluting the voting power of the opposing party’s supporters across many districts.
Texas Republicans have been frank that they are pursuing the redraw for partisan advantage. But they emphasize that no prohibition exists, in Texas or nationally, against mid-decade redistricting and that a 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision cleared the way for states to draw maps for partisan purposes, removing the power of federal courts to police political gerrymandering.
The new maps give Republicans a chance of winning additional districts but doesn’t guarantee victories, they add.
“The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance,” Texas state Rep. Todd Hunter, a Republican who carried the bill in the Texas House, said during floor debate on Wednesday. He added a short time later: “According to the U.S. Supreme Court, you can use political performance, and that is what we’ve done.”
Tricky terrain
As Texas moves forward and California prepares to respond, Common Cause illustrates the tricky terrain anti-gerrymandering advocates are now navigating.
The group, headquartered in Washington, D.C., fought to enact the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2008. But earlier this month, Common Cause declined to condemn California’s retaliation, saying it will judge the effort by whether the maps are a proportional response to gerrymanders in other states, whether the process includes meaningful public participation, and whether the maps expire and are replaced after the 2030 census through the state’s regular redistricting process, among other criteria.
Newsom’s proposal, the Election Rigging Response Act, will ask California voters in November to temporarily set aside the state’s redistricting commission and approve the new map drawn by the legislature. The commission would resume drawing maps following the census.
Recent polling shows widespread public opposition to gerrymandering. A YouGov poll of 1,116 Americans conducted in early August found 69% believe it should be illegal to draw districts in a way that makes it harder for members of a particular political party to elect their preferred candidates. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The number of Americans who say gerrymandering is a big problem has jumped in recent years. In the YouGov poll, 75% of respondents said it is a major problem when districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party, up from 66% in a 2022 survey.
Some California Republicans have responded to Newsom’s proposal by defending the commission system. A group of Republicans sued in state court to block the plan, but the California Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a request to temporarily halt the effort.
‘Is this bad for reform?’
While members of the public might say they favor citizen-led commissions, they may not care deeply about the issue, said David Hopkins, a political science professor at Boston College who has written on polarization in American politics. He called gerrymandering a “classic process subject” that comes off as “inside baseball” to many people.
“The legislators in states that haven’t adopted commissions clearly don’t feel any particular political pressure to do so,” Hopkins said.
Some Republicans in states weighing a mid-decade gerrymander also discount the risk of a public backlash.
In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe may call a special session this fall to redraw the state’s map in hopes of gaining an additional GOP seat in the U.S. House. James Harris, a Missouri Republican consultant with close ties to GOP officials in the state, said he wasn’t concerned redistricting would create momentum to change the process.
Missouri voters in recent years have approved ballot measures favored by Democrats, including one in 2018 that empowered a nonpartisan demographer to draw state legislative districts, though not congressional districts. But Republicans led a successful campaign to convince voters to repeal the changes two years later.
Harris painted any new potential map as part of a national effort to help Trump — who received 58.5% of the vote in Missouri last November.
“I think the lens is wanting to make sure the president has a majority in Congress so he can actually govern for the last two years versus two years of investigations, gridlock,” Harris said.
Advocates of less partisan maps said lawmakers aren’t likely to surrender their own role in mapmaking. While some state courts may limit redistricting excesses, federal courts stopped policing partisan gerrymandering following the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision. And the high court may soon weaken the judiciary’s power to block race-based gerrymandering.
Samuel Wang, director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which supports eliminating partisan gerrymandering, said the “one good thing” about the redistricting battle is that it’s prompted voters to pay attention to an arcane and technical issue. That could be a positive in the long run, he said, “if people can keep a cool head.”
Wang has written online that any response to Texas should remain measured and proportionate. California offers Democrats the only clean option to strike back, Wang wrote. Five Democratic seats could be added by redrawing the state.
“Is this bad for reform? I mean, I’m torn,” Wang told Stateline. “Because on the other hand, Democrats have been, over the last few decades, vocal in their advocacy for voting rights in various forms and now that advocacy is in question because they find a need to fight fire with fire.”
“So I guess the way I would characterize it is if they can hold it in check and not do it in every single state and just engage in whatever they’re doing where it will make a difference,” he said, “then we might not lose all the progress that’s been made.”

The 26-year-old physician assistant laid the groundwork for her career as a teenager, starting clinical work hours at 18 in preparation for graduate school. She barreled through seven years of higher education with no breaks, landing a job with Brown University Health’s primary care offices in East Greenwich even before graduating from her master’s program in May 2024. 
The one element not entirely pre-planned: $180,000 in student loan debt.
“When I got out of school, there were so many programs for repayment, forgiveness,” Paquette said. “No one teaches you about them, or what they mean, or what to choose. It was overwhelming.”
Especially now that federal loan forgiveness is under threat amid new borrowing caps and other changes by President Donald Trump’s administration. Paquette remains optimistic that the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program will remain, allowing her to wipe away whatever debt she owes after 10 years. But if the program changes or ends, she knows she could be saddled with six-figure, high-interest loans.
But she won’t have to shoulder all the debt on her own. Paquette will receive $24,000 in refundable tax credits over the next four years toward her student loans as a recipient of the state’s Wavemaker Fellowship.
The 2015 program was started by former Gov. Gina Raimondo to reduce the “brain drain” in science, technology, engineering and math. It offers recent college graduates $1,000  to $6,000 a year — depending on education levels —  for up to four years to stay and work in the state. The program has since expanded to include health care workers and teachers. 
Paquette was one of 153 recent college graduates, 76 of whom work in health care, named to the latest round of Wavemaker fellows in June. The ninth Wavemaker cohort was awarded a combined $2.5 million over four years.
Rhode Island Commerce, which administers the program, opened a new round of applications on Aug. 18,  with an extra $500,000 earmark designated for primary care workers. The first-time carveout, approved by the Rhode Island General Assembly in 2024, seeks to ease the state’s primary care workforce shortage.
The price of persuasion
State officials lauded the half million-dollar earmark, which can help 20 to 40 doctors, nurse practitioners and physician assistants pay off debt. But will $24,000 in loan forgiveness be enough to persuade a medical school graduate with staggering debt to work in Rhode Island, when they could make more money elsewhere?
Not according to Dr. Michael Fine, former state health director who now serves as board president for the nationwide nonprofit, Primary Care for All Americans. 
“Anything is good,” Fine said of loan forgiveness programs. “But I think that it takes $50,000 to $75,000 a year to move the needle for a medical school graduate to stay here.”
Massachusetts, for example, offers up to $50,000 a year for two years to help health care professionals who work in the state repay their student loans. The $100,000 maximum a health care worker can receive to pay off student loans in Massachusetts is more than four times the $24,000 maximum Rhode Island offers — on top of higher base pay across state lines for the same job.
Even if someone opts to stay in Rhode Island for the four years of student loan tax credits, there’s still no guarantee they will remain after that, especially with higher reimbursement rates enticing them across state lines, Fine said.
Sen. Pam Lauria, a Barrington Democrat and nurse practitioner who sponsored the 2024 legislation to designate tax credits for primary care workers, shared some of Fine’s concerns.
“There’s no one magic bullet that’s going to keep someone here,” Lauria said. 
The Rhode Island General Assembly in its fiscal 2026 budget also added money to increase Medicaid reimbursement rates for primary care providers, while the state health insurance commissioner has directed commercial insurers to boost their repayment rates starting in January. 
Lauria and Fine are part of a 21-member legislative study panel tasked with exploring how a new, state medical school could help improve the workforce shortage — and at what cost. A draft report published in June suggested an eyepopping $225 million cost over 10 years to open a public medical school at the University of Rhode Island. A final report with more detailed analysis on how to set up a state medical school is expected to be completed and unveiled within the next few weeks, Lauria said. 
Scholarships vs. loan forgiveness
Lauria also sponsored legislation this year proposing a scholarship program for primary care students to pay for medical or graduate school, with a $1 million carveout for the year. The bill, and its House companion, failed to advance out of committee amid questions over implementation details.
Fine thinks scholarships are more effective than post-graduation loan forgiveness in helping create a workforce with community roots.
“Scholarships get us people long-term,” Fine said. “It’s a way for us to support kids or students who come from our communities, who might be first-generation students or not have the wherewithal to think of themselves as going to medical school.”










Anything is good. But I think that it takes $50,000 to $75,000 a year to move the needle for a medical school graduate to stay here.


– Dr. Michael Fine, former state health director, on the amount of state student loan support needed to attract and retain primary care workers 


The Wavemaker program does not require recipients to live in Rhode Island, although they must work for a Rhode Island company to receive the refundable tax credits. A majority of recipients live in Rhode Island — 86% of those who received tax credits from 2019 to 2021, according to an 2023 analysis by the Rhode Island Office of Revenue Analysis. The revenue analysis report, which has not been updated, concluded the tax incentive program generally paid for itself by generating more revenue and boosting employment, even if not all of the program recipients needed tax credits to stay and work in Rhode Island. 
The report also offered recommendations to improve data collection and reporting, as well as making it more equitable by potentially broadening the program to an automatic benefit rather than a competitive award. The report acknowledged this suggestion comes with a high cost to the state and would require more analysis.
Lawmakers have steadily increased funding for the Wavemaker program as its scope has widened. Health care workers, including those working in primary care were added in fiscal 2023, while teachers were able to qualify the following year. The extra $500,000 that the fiscal 2025 budget tacked on specifically for primary care workers adds up to a total of $4.1 million. The fiscal 2026 budget included an additional $2.6 million for the program, with no eligibility changes.
Administrative delays 
Turning policy into practice has been slow.
No tax credits were distributed in 2025 because Commerce needed time to develop regulations governing expanded eligibility for teachers, said Matt Touchette, a Commerce spokesperson. The 2025 cohort marks the first time educators were able to receive awards. 
The money set aside for primary care workers by lawmakers for fiscal 2025 has yet to be distributed because more time was needed to develop distribution and reporting regulations, Touchette said. While Wavemaker was available to health care workers starting in 2023, there was still no specific designation or tracking for primary care awardees.
The newly opened application round, which closes Oct. 13, will include the fiscal 2026 funding and carry over the $500,000 authorized for primary care workers a year ago. Commerce expects to announce awards to another 250 recent graduates this winter, Touchette said.
Touchette declined to comment on expected application numbers. Recent data suggests the program has seen a resurgence in popularity after the end of federal pandemic loan forgiveness and forbearance programs. Just over six in 10 applicants were accepted in the most recent round of funding, with 43% more applications than in 2022.




Paquette said she was “ecstatic” to receive an award, comforted by the financial boost.
“When we were doing rotations, I was a little disappointed at how much I loved internal medicine and family medicine,” Paquette said. “That’s not where the money is. You spend all this money on school, all this time, the hardest three years of my life, and your passion takes you to something that makes the least amount of money.”
Her starting salary is $120,000. The Wavemaker award covers two-thirds of her $9,000 annual loan payments for the next four years.
“I am going to be in really good shape starting out,”  she said.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)A combination of Trump administration policies will make health care coverage more expensive for people who purchase plans from health insurance marketplaces — and rural residents will be hit the hardest, according to a new analysis.
Researchers from the Century Foundation say Trump administration policies — especially its refusal to ask Congress to extend Biden-era tax credits that are set to expire at the end of this year — will boost out-of-pocket premiums by 93% in the 32 states that allow the federal government to operate their Affordable Care Act insurance marketplaces. New rules and tariffs will have a smaller impact.
Rural county residents in those states will see an increase of 107%, while residents of urban counties will pay 89% more, according to the analysis by the Century Foundation, a left-leaning research nonprofit.
Insurers participating in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces are proposing a median premium increase of 18% for 2026 — the biggest jump since 2018 and 11 points more than the growth from 2024 to this year. That bump would come on top of the increase resulting from the expiration of the tax credits and the other policy changes.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
About 2.8 million people who are enrolled in marketplace plans in the 32 states live in rural counties, including 776,000 adults between the ages of 55 to 64 and more than 223,000 children, according to the Century Foundation.
“Rural residents tend to be older. They may be more likely to have chronic illness at the same time,” said Jeanne Lambrew, director of health care reform at the foundation. “It costs more, both because they have somewhat greater needs and less access to health care.”
Millions will see rise in health insurance premiums if federal subsidies expire

The researchers calculated that average annual premiums for rural residents will increase by $760 — 28% more than the expected average increase for urban residents. States where rural enrollees are expected to see the highest cost increases are Wyoming ($1,943), Alaska ($1,835), and Illinois ($1,700).
Many of the states with a large number of rural residents have chosen not to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, meaning many people who earn between 100% and 138% of the federal poverty level, between $15,650 and $21,597 for an individual, get their coverage from an insurance marketplace, Lambrew said.
Of the seven states where 10% or more of rural residents are enrolled in marketplace plans (Alabama, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Wyoming), only two — Nebraska and North Carolina — have expanded Medicaid.
State officials in Pennsylvania recently advised residents who use the marketplace that they should closely examine the plans that are available.
“This year, even more than previous years, Pennsylvanians should consider shopping around to find the best plans to meet their individual needs, at a price that makes sense for their current financial situation,” Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner Michael Humphreys said in a statement released at the beginning of this month.

Lambrew said the increases will force many people to forgo insurance altogether.
“It’s harmful for those individuals in terms of their own health and life expectancy. It’s harmful for our providers, because they’re now dealing with people who are sicker and in the wrong settings, and it’s kind of expensive for our society,” Lambrew said.
“We know health insurance matters, so having these large potential increases on uninsured Americans is distressing.”

(Photo provided by LifeWise Academy)PEEWEE VALLEY— Students at an elementary school in Oldham County could be among the first to leave school for Bible lessons under a provision enacted by the Kentucky legislature earlier this year. 
The proposal has generated controversy among parents and community members as a citizens group calls for the board of education to reject the proposal from LifeWise Academy, a nonprofit that offers Bible-based classes to public school students around the country.
Chris Keith, a religion scholar and parent of Oldham County students, said the program’s curriculum doesn’t represent the full breadth of Christianity.
“I care a whole lot about this as a father — as a father who is also very interested in biblical studies,” he said. “I’m all for religion. I’m all for Christianity, I’m all for critical thinking. I’m all for public schools. I’m all for kids. I’m not for indoctrination,” Keith said last week during a meeting of the citizens group, Kentucky Citizens for Democracy. 
Earlier this year, the Republican-controlled General Assembly enacted Senate Bill 19 over Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto. The legislation initially required moments of silence at the start of school days. Toward the final days of the session, the House added a section to allow boards of education to permit moral instruction programs for students off campus and during school hours. The law also says parents or guardians must give permission for their students to participate in moral instruction. 
Headquartered in Ohio, LifeWise operates in 27 states and enrolls more than 44,000 students. The program “maintains a high view of the authority of Scripture and we align ourselves with historic, orthodox Christian beliefs as expressed in the Nicene Creed,” according to its Statement of Faith listed online. 
“We believe the storyline of Scripture that climaxes in the central gospel message, that Jesus Christ died for our sins and was raised from the dead,” the statement says. “We believe this gospel is true, essential and announces the way by which sinners are reconciled to God.”
The Heritage Foundation awarded LifeWise one of its Innovation Prizes earlier this year, which included a financial award. LifeWise reported in its most recent IRS filing that its revenue exceeded expenses by $17 million. The organization reported its revenue grew from $13.8 million to $35.3 million from 2023 to 2024.
Marshall County is the only active LifeWise program in Kentucky, with six schools in that district having the program this fall. LifeWise has been in the district since 2023. State law previously allowed school based decision making (SBDM) councils to decide if off-campus moral instruction programs could be offered to students.
The group has ambitious plans in Kentucky, following the change in state law. Cassie Allchorne, the program director of Oldham County’s LifeWise Academy, told the Lantern that LifeWise has about 45 planning teams that are forming or are fully formed across Kentucky’s 171 public school districts.

The Oldham County proposal is to have a one hour per week Bible-based moral character education program, starting at Locust Grove Elementary School for third to fifth grade students. Allchorne said LifeWise would be offered during related arts time, which also is when students can take music, physical education and art classes. 
The program would transport students to a nearby church or community center and off school property with parents’ permission. 
Allchorne said she became involved in LifeWise because she is a parent of three students at Locust Grove. LifeWise had sought approval to offer classes to Locust Grove students from the school council before the law was changed earlier this year. 
“I heard about this and thought it was amazing, and would love the opportunity to just be able to provide this for my kids and for other parents who wish to have this option for their kiddos too,” she said. 
LifeWise is “open to everyone, no matter what they believe, who they are,” Allchorne said. 
The curriculum is “designed to teach the main and plain things of the Bible” along with promoting positive character traits, like love, kindness and gratitude, as part of the lessons,” Allchorne said. 
Anyone can submit a request to review LifeWise’s curriculum for 48 hours on its website. The Kentucky Lantern’s review of the curriculum, which included lesson plans for elementary, middle grade and high school students, found lessons based on Bible stories and generating analysis and discussion of morals taught in those stories. The lessons typically had an activity for students and ended with a prayer. 
In a Year 3 lesson designed for elementary school students about Jesus’ baptism by John the Baptist, a suggested activity is to invite a local pastor to class to answer questions about baptisms. Another lesson in Year 3 centered around respect discusses Daniel’s obedience to God. It includes a lesson designed for older students to decide between two actions which would be the most biblical response in situations such as a parent telling a student that “church is a waste of my time” and the student should be at home to help instead or a teacher telling a student to stop talking about God at school “because it makes other students uncomfortable.”
Opposition and support
Kentucky Citizens for Democracy held a meeting of about 50 people at St. James Episcopal Church Aug. 19 to discuss concerns with LifeWise’s proposal. The group has been circulating a petition online that asks the board to reject LifeWise’s request. 
Michael Fox, a parent of Locust Grove Elementary students and a teacher, had learned of LifeWise’s proposal before the school council earlier this year and has since brought his concerns about the program to the Oldham County Board of Education. He argued that children who do not attend LifeWise could be affected by schedule changes, and that could affect a parents’ “say in how it affects my child’s education.”
“They specifically want this during the school day because they know they can have access to kids that’s unopposed,” Fox said.

Lutheran Pastor Richard Gianzero, who is also a parent of Oldham County students, told the group that LifeWise’s program tells students what to believe rather than putting them on a path of “embracing the unknown.” 
“What this group wants to do is bring in a very specific and explicit, a dogmatic approach to morals that legislate and tell our children and our families what is right and what is wrong, based upon an ideological framework that is authoritarian and appropriately described as being part of white Christian nationalism,” Gianzero said. 
Anita Davis, a member of the group and a former chief academic officer for Oldham County Schools, said the citizens group is not anti-religion but “pro-separation of church and state” and wants all children to feel safe, included and respected in schools. As a former educator, she also questioned if approval of the program could lead to issues with schools’ master schedules for all classes and bullying of students who do not go to the program. 
“Right now, it’s up in the air,” Davis said. “It’s a ‘may’ state, and we ‘may’ have it, or we ‘may not’ have it. We don’t know because we’re not sure where the board is on this.”
Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed a law earlier this year requiring school districts to create a religious instruction release time policy. The law had previously allowed school boards to decide policies around letting children attend religious instruction during the school day. The change in law paved the way for LifeWise to expand in Ohio. 
Kentucky’s law says boards of education “may provide an opportunity for pupils to attend moral instruction” if it chooses. 
Republican Sen. Lindsey Ticheror, who represents Oldham County and was a co-sponsor of the legislation this year, told the Lantern she views LifeWise as “a great program that’ll fall in line with Kentucky and Kentucky values.” When asked if she would be supportive of Kentucky changing its law to mirror Ohio’s mandatory policy requirement, Tichenor said she “would be supportive of it,” and added that precedent exists from a decades-long Supreme Court decision for students to leave school for moral instruction.
“When you’re teaching values of don’t lie, don’t steal, treat your neighbor as yourself, treat others as you want to be treated, the Golden Rule, why would that be a negative thing to try and teach students within our school day?” Tichenor said. “I don’t think it’s a bad thing at all.” 
The Oldham County Board of Education will meet Monday evening, but it will not vote on LifeWise’s proposal then, board Chair Carly Clem told the Lantern in an email seeking comment on the proposal. 
Clem added that the board has asked the Kentucky attorney general’s office for clarification on the amended state law and “are still discussing logistics on this new statute.”
According to documents received via an open records request submitted by the Lantern, Clem said LifeWise “is likely a wonderful program” in an Aug. 6 email responding to a parent who was supportive of the program. 
“As a Christian, I would love for my kids to have many opportunities to learn about the Bible,” Clem wrote.
However, Clem added that she has concerns surrounding the potential involvement of schools in LifeWise promotions to parents and students, such as whether LifeWise would be allowed to participate in school open houses for parents.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CY1A0275-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-25 05:56:35.430921

(Photo: NCDPI) The first test of the new school year rolls out on Monday as thousands of students wait anxiously for their designated school bus to pick them up and transport them to school on time. It’s such a routine event, few students or parents truly appreciate the carefully choreographed work that has happened behind the scenes leading up to the first run on the opening week.
The Wake County Public School System (WCPSS) has been working throughout the summer to recruit and fill its pipeline of bus driver candidates. North Carolina’s largest school district has 605 drivers ready to get behind the wheel for the opening of school, with 22 bus driver candidates who signed up for training as recently as early August.
Bob Snidemiller, senior director of transportation for WCPSS, said they are continuing to market the positions.
“We’re advertising via TV, radio, social media. We do have a dedicated HR recruitment person which I think has been very helpful in staying on top of those who make contact with us to become our candidates, who then attend class and become bus drivers,” Snidemiller said at a recent work session.
The extra recruitment push comes as state legislators passed a stopgap budget this summer that did not included raises for teachers, support staff, or state employees.
Wake County, working from the county budget, is offering every bus driver the opportunity to earn up to $4,000 a year in bonuses.

Drivers who ended the last school year in good standing and come back to Wake County for the beginning of this traditional calendar school year will see a $1,000 retention bonus in their September pay. The district is also offering drivers a $2,000 “perfect attendance” bonus that’s paid at $200 per month.
If that seems excessive, consider the plight the school district found itself in just two years ago.
The vacancy rate was so high that Wake County had to ask parents in the public schools to arrange for their own transportation for their children.
While some families were forced to get up earlier and drive their children to school or coordinate an impromptu neighborhood carpool, there’s little doubt the hiccup caused some students to miss classes or show up late.
This fall Wake County will be managing 564 bus routes with seven additional routes tacked on to support four new schools in the district.
That amounts to nearly 90,000 registered riders that the bus drivers are expected to get safely from their bus stop to school and back again. Snidemiller said about 70% of those students actually ride daily. Others may arrange alternate transportation if they are staying after the school day ends to participate in sports or extracurricular events.
Drivers on average make more than six runs per bus.

“We are using our buses very, very efficiently again this year. That means our buses will arrive at [more than] six campuses every morning and every afternoon. We have 159 riders on average assigned to each bus,” said Snidemiller.
The school district has also contracted with six vendors to transport a projected 3,600 students within the county who fall into the category of special needs, pre-K, or who are experiencing homelessness.
Keeping all those vehicles running is another issue unto itself.
All buses start the new school year having gone through a preventative maintenance program, with 95% of the fleet operable.
Snidemiller says it’s “typical” to have about five percent of the buses are in need of repair at any given time.
This year the county will be operating 15 propane buses in an on-going program to reduce fuel costs with a cleaner operating engine.
Wake County has a vacancy rate of 25% of fleet mechanics. Last year, the vacancy rate topped 30%.

“It’s slow, but at least it’s moving in the right direction,” Snidemiller told school board members last week.
The transportation director knows the metric most parents care about is safety – ensuring that their child is protected when they climb on that big yellow bus and find a seat.
Snidemiller says that’s one figure in which Wake County is ‘off the chart’ compared to other large school districts.
“We travel 13 million miles in our buses every year and we average 135,000 miles between accidents.” he said. “We wish it were more. We’re working for it to be more.”
This Monday, schools on the traditional calendar year begin with bus drivers playing a crucial role in helping  Wake County’s schools achieve a top goal: improving consistent attendance.
“We want every student to feel seen, challenged, and inspired. That has to start with students being in school every day, on time, and ready to learn,” said Superintendent Dr. Robert P. Taylor.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/SchoolBuses-1024x701.jpg,,,2025-08-25 05:56:35.430921

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Xcel Energy’s recent decision to close its coal power plants across the state by 2030 puts Colorado at an important crossroads. The closing of these power plants, most notably Comanche 3 in Pueblo, presents an opportunity to transition our state to cleaner energy.
However, Xcel is proposing to replace the electric power from their coal plants in part with new gas-fired plants and are contemplating nuclear energy, all detailed in Xcel’s Just Transition Plan. But, the plan needs approval from the Public Utilities Commission to move forward. This is the perfect moment to tell the PUC we need a clean-energy future instead of one stuck with expensive, dysfunctional and polluting power plants for decades to come.
Doing so will ensure our state’s long-term health and financial well-being, and it will prevent the worst effects of climate change.

Under Colorado law, Xcel’s plan must result in an 80% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from 2005 levels by 2030, and nuclear energy may be used on the way to achieving Colorado’s commitment to 100% clean energy by 2050. However, nuclear energy carries great administrative and environmental risk, and Xcel already operates over 20 natural gas plants in the state. Xcel deserves credit for expanding the use of renewable energy in their plan, but the best time to plan for 100% renewable, nuclear-free energy is now.
With rapid advances in technology and our understanding of Colorado’s renewable energy capacity, achieving a 100% renewable energy grid for Colorado is not a far-fetched goal. Modeling by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows that Colorado has the wind and solar potential to meet our current demand many times over. And wind and solar technology continues to improve, increasing in efficiency by 30% to 40% in the last 15 years alone. Geothermal energy is also on the horizon for Colorado. The Western Governors’ Geothermal Task Force estimates Colorado can produce significant geothermal power within a decade, and Geothermal Technologies Inc. estimates it could produce 400 megawatts of power from several known sites.
A common concern with a 100% renewable grid is the daily and seasonal variability of wind and solar generation. However, renewables can meet demand 24/7, every day of the year by ramping up storage capacity combined with more constant sources like geothermal. The storage capacity of batteries continues to dramatically improve, enabling renewable energy grids to smooth out variability and release surplus power when it’s needed most. Studies have shown the feasibility of a 100% renewable energy grid for Los Angeles, the U.S. and many other cities and countries around the world. In fact, seven countries have nearly reached 100% renewable grids already.
Moving to 100% renewable energy is not only possible for Colorado, but is the best path for our health and environment. Pollution from gas-fired power plants poses serious risks to the health of those living nearby, including from nitrogen oxides and other airborne toxins that can cause cancer and cardiovascular disease. Colorado, and the Front Range in particular, also suffers from poor air quality due to high levels of ozone. Unfortunately, a warming climate is only making our ozone problems more severe and frequent. 
Renewable energy is also the smart choice for Colorado’s economy. Numerous studies have shown that the development of wind and solar brings new jobs, especially if Colorado encourages more rooftop solar. The financial value of the public health benefits of using clean, renewable energy sources would also be sizable. Estimates for public health savings in Los Angeles, assuming a move toward 100% renewables, come in at $1.5 billion for a single year. Applied to Colorado’s population, that would be over $2 billion in savings per year. Finally, a timely transition to 100% renewable energy will help us avoid the worst climate-influenced disasters and their ever-mounting costs, such as the devastating Marshall Fire several years ago.
If we want to achieve this future of economic, health, and environmental benefits, there is no place for Xcel to build additional gas-fired plants or chase risky solutions like nuclear energy. We know that a transition to 100% renewable, nuclear-free energy is possible, so let’s advocate for it. We owe it to ourselves and the next generation of Coloradans to do so.

(Photo by the Virginia Mercury)Gov. Glenn Youngkin has ordered state police to investigate explosive allegations from a conservative blog that Fairfax County Public Schools officials helped multiple underage girls obtain abortions in 2021 — a probe whose findings may not surface before Election Day but could still sway voters in the court of public opinion. 
Virginia law requires minors to obtain either parental consent or a successful court petition to undergo the procedure. Such records are also exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. 
The Mercury asked the Fairfax County Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court whether any petitions were filed at all in 2021 and how many have been filed in subsequent years, which they did not provide.
Still, the possibility that a public school broke state law and bypassed parents’ consent rights is quickly becoming a political talking point for Republican candidates this year.
 ‘Gift that keeps on giving’

Against the backdrop of an ongoing effort to enshrine reproductive rights into Virginia’s constitution, Republican gubernatorial nominee Winsome Earle-Sears has seized on the allegations. 
At a recent campaign event in Chesterfield County, she welcomed the story’s circulation in the news cycle. 
“I don’t know if you also saw what’s happening in Northern Virginia — it’s just a gift that keeps on giving,” Earle-Sears said as the crowd laughed. 
It cheered after she added: “Parents. Still. Matter.”
Political analyst Bob Holsworth said the controversy echoes of Youngkin’s successful 2021 campaign, when allegations of a sexual assault in a Loudoun County school bathroom sparked national furor over transgender students’ use of restrooms. 
Investigations and legal proceedings extended well beyond the campaign, but by then “Parents for Youngkin” signs and “parents matter” chants had become staples of his rallies. Youngkin went on to win the governorship, and Republicans flipped the House of Delegates for a term.
“Interestingly, the target audience is not voters in Fairfax and Loudoun,” Holsworth said of the Democratic strongholds, “but Republicans elsewhere in the commonwealth.” 
The allegations first surfaced in WC Dispatch, an Ohio-based conservative blog run by independent investigative journalist Walter Curt Jr. His father, Walter Curt Sr., is a Youngkin appointee to the Virginia State Council of Higher Education and has donated thousands of dollars to both Youngkin and Earle-Sears. Curt Jr. told Virginia Scope that his familiar ties don’t affect his reporting. 
Holsworth suggested that GOP campaigns are aiming to “get these issues aired on Fox News so they can deliver a message across Virginia in a way that Democrats can’t.”
That’s  because the claim itself  — whether ultimately proven or false — is already enough to stoke concerns among some voters about public schools encroaching on parental rights. Defending parental oversight in K-12 education been a consistent Republican theme in Virginia politics.
If the allegation proves true, Earle-Sears has vowed accountability. 
“Your underage daughter can’t get an aspirin without your permission,” she wrote on X on Aug. 19. “Yet a Virginia school may have taken a young girl for an abortion, in secret, using your tax dollars. If true, it’s monstrous, and there will be consequences.”
 The legal wait-and-see

Pending the outcome of the state police investigation, any responsibility to prosecute would fall to Fairfax County Commonwealth’s Attorney Steve Descano, who has declined to comment. 
Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, noted that the timeline for an investigation is uncertain. While the number of people involved doesn’t appear large he said, the allegation dates back four years —a factor that could complicate evidence gathering and examination. 
Tobias added that Republicans could “make a lot of political hay of it” heading into the elections, especially since Fairfax’s commonwealth’s attorney has been a frequent target of Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares.  
Miyares, who is up for reelection this year, has long pushed for changes in state law that would allow the state to intervene in local prosecutions and has repeatedly attacked Descano as being too lenient. 
A potential prosecution arising from the Fairfax abortion allegation could even spill into the next gubernatorial term.  
Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger is also watching closely. Her campaign said in an email to The Mercury that she “will be monitoring the status of the Virginia State Police’s investigation and will support appropriate action to uphold Virginia law.” 
The campaign also highlighted Spanberger’s perspective as a mother of three young girls who attend public school, adding: “She believes that decisions about a child’s health and safety should always be made between them and their parents.”
 Fairfax vs. everyone else

Beyond the locality’s prosecutor, Fairfax County Public Schools has become a lightning rod for criticism from parents as well as state and federal leaders.
Among the most polarizing decisions: overhauling admissions at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology to promote greater diversity, and resisting statewide transgender policies that would have required schools to out transgender students or restrict pronoun use.
The division is also arranging a security detail for Superintendent Michelle Reid.
After the abortion allegations surfaced, Reid wrote to the school community that the conduct described “would be unacceptable” in the district. 
“I want to stress that at no time would the situation as described in these allegations be acceptable in Fairfax County Public Schools,” Reid said.
The school district has also stated that it will “fully cooperate” with the investigation but cannot comment further while it is ongoing. 
 Reproductive laws in campaigns

Beyond Earle-Sears’ bid for governor and the lieutenant governor and attorney general races, all 100 House of Delegates seats are up for election this year. 
Looming over those contests is an ongoing effort to enshrine reproductive rights — including abortion — into the state’s constitution. The measure must pass the legislature again next year before appearing on a statewide ballot for voter approval or rejection.
While every Republican in the General Assembly voted against the proposal this year, they first attempted to add language reflecting existing state law on minors’ access to abortion. Democrats rejected that effort, pointing out that a U.S. Supreme Court case also affirms parental consent under the 14th Amendment.  
Even so, the possibility that someone may have broken the law in Fairfax is “alarming,” said Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, who is carrying  the Senate version of the reproductive rights amendment.
“We should all be deeply concerned anytime anyone says they have been forced, misled or coerced into life-changing decisions about their reproductive health,” she said. 
While Boysko did not specifically address the amendment in her comments, she added that she is confident the investigation will “shed light on the facts of the case.”

Officials are ramping up research to determine how to best target the pests and provide vineyards with clear guidelines on when to spray pesticides.
The brightly colored insects can now be seen lazily flapping through much of the Piedmont and Shenandoah Valley. Hitchhikers from Asia, they first arrived in Virginia in 2018. 
Today, they are most commonly found near railways and other transportation routes. The state once tried quarantining infested counties and inspecting shipments for eggs to stop the spread,  but as the flies became more pervasive those measures were repealed in March of this year.

While not as devastating as some invasive insects, lanternflies feed on a wide range of plants. They are most devastating to grapevines and to the invasive tree of heaven plant. The pests have also shown to weaken some maple and black walnut trees, potentially leaving them vulnerable to further infestation.
“The term that we typically use in invasive species biology is cascading effects to refer to the idea that there are effects out in the ecosystem that we may not yet be aware of because the spotted lanternfly is so new, the research is so new. It’s still establishing in most places, but it has not reached its peak yet,” said Jules Amanita, the spotted lanternfly field supervisor at the Virginia Department of Agriculture.
Virginia’s $8 billion wine industry has been closely monitoring the presence of spotted lanternflies in vineyards. Doug Pfeiffer, a professor of Entomology at Virginia Tech, said that there is a proposal for the USDA to approve data-based guidelines of when growers should spray for the pests. But, he added, those efforts are on hold due to ongoing funding disputes in Washington, D.C. 
“In fact, sometimes they were a little too prepared, because I didn’t want them to spray the whole vineyard at the first sight of an individual insect. But they were so concerned with it,” Pfeiffer said. ”The problem is we don’t have a firm action threshold established.”
The spraying of pesticides also affects other insects, including those that prey on lanternflies or control other insects. Since the flies have no natural predators in the U.S., populations can quickly grow unchecked. 
“Insecticides will cause secondary past outbreaks. If they kill natural enemies, at least a pest that is being controlled naturally from their controls, and then they rise to pest status,” Pfeiffer said. “So that could be a problem on most crops. It’s especially problematic in vineyards, because one of the pests that can be induced to outbreak status are mealybugs, and they serve as the vectors or carriers of some grapevine viruses.”
Pfeiffer said he has not heard many reports of vine loss due to lanternflies, since vineyards have been preparing for years. Still, the cost of spraying, along with the risk of triggering new pest problems, weigh heavily on growers. 
Lanternflies frequently feed on the invasive tree of heaven, a plant introduced to the U.S.  centuries ago. After feeding, the flies develop a bitter taste that makes birds less likely to eat them, Pfeiffer explained.

“They can develop without the tree of heaven, but with a much lower success rate … So if we eliminate the tree of heaven, not only do they have more trouble developing, but once they reach adults, they could be better prey for birds,” Pfeiffer said.
Efforts are underway to reduce tree of heaven populations as part of controlling lanternflies. Researchers are also exploring the release of potential predators to combat the insects, though these species remain under quarantine.
Other states have turned to public campaigns encouraging residents to squash lanternflies on sight. While killing them won’t eradicate the pest, it can help slow their spread.
“If a spotted lanternfly is showing up somewhere that a member of the public is seeing it, it is far more likely to have that individual hitchhike with that person or somebody else and end up somewhere new,” Amanita said. “So even killing just one — if you’re killing it in a populated area — can make a significant difference. Additionally, crushing egg masses is a great thing that everybody can do.”

The flies lay their eggs in mid-September, a period that gives researchers insight into the size of each year’s generation. Pfeiffer said climate change could alter how long lanternflies feed on vulnerable grapevines and other plants.
“I think the impact will be that if the egg laying happens earlier and there’s signs that it is, then they may reach adult stage earlier and prolong the adult period when they’re doing their most severe feeding and egg laying,” Pfeiffer said.
Due to the spread of the flies, the Virginia Department of Agriculture is not able to provide treatments for individuals outside areas where the insects are being actively detected and transported to new regions. However, the agency does offer information on how residents can combat the pests themselves and how to  manage the tree of heaven.

[2026 Election Voter Guide: Check out who is running for governor, U.S. Senate, and more.]There will also be a significant amount of noise as these elections are likely to generate obscene levels of political spending, a trend we’ve seen year after year.
Campaigns are already ramping up with dozens of candidates vying to represent people in Maine, both in Augusta and Washington, D.C. 
More than anything, we want to make sure that voters have what they need to make informed decisions at the ballot box.
That means knowing who the candidates are, what issues and commitments they are running on, and who is funding their campaigns. That means knowing who will be on the ballot as an independent in November, or who will be running against each other in the June 6 Democratic and Republican party primaries first. 
So we’re launching our voter guide as a hub for trusted information, a way for voters to cut through the noise. It’ll evolve over the coming months as the campaigns progress, and we will continue to add information on the candidates’ policy positions, fundraising and more. We will also be rolling out a specific guide for this year’s November election, which will feature two weighty referendum questions: one to change the state’s election procedures and the other to implement a red flag law.
There are lots of sweeping and high-minded things one can say about the importance of the 2026 midterm elections, and plenty of time to say it. But for now, please utilize our guide, share it with your friends, and let us know what you think.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha added new rules to the proposed sale of Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital in an amended decision issued July 31. The sale — from private equity-backed Prospect Medical Holdings to the nonprofit Centurion Foundation — has been closely watched across the state. The updated terms reflect growing concern over the role of private equity in Rhode Island’s health care system. The new amendment includes several key conditions:

$50 million in capital investments over the next three years
Expanded monitoring and enforcement powers by the Attorney General’s office
Authority to appoint a receiver if financial instability emerges
Additional reporting and accountability requirements

The stakes are high. Both Roger Williams and Fatima serve as safety net hospitals for some of Rhode Island’s most underserved communities. Their former operator, Prospect Medical Holdings, has come under intense scrutiny — not just in Rhode Island, but nationwide — for the financial strain imposed on the hospitals it acquired. The company, backed by private equity, filed for bankruptcy in early 2025 while carrying about $6 billion in debt. At the same time, its investors reportedly extracted over $600 million in dividends, leaving hospitals with decaying infrastructure and unpaid vendors.
Save now, pay later: Roger Williams and Fatima hospital buyer faces ballooning debt service

Over the past decade, private equity firms have quietly acquired thousands of hospitals, nursing homes, and physician practices across the United States. The number of physician practices alone grew from 800 in 2012 to over 5,700 by 2021, according to UC Berkeley research.
Private equity operates with a distinctive model: acquire health care providers using debt, aggressively cut costs to boost profit margins, and exit the investment within a few years. That often means slashing staff, squeezing billing codes, and “optimizing” services — at a cost to patients.
The results are troubling. Researchers found that nursing homes owned by private equity  entities had a 10% increase in the short-term death rate of Medicare patients over a 12-year period — it means more than 20,000 additional deaths. The full study was published by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).
Another peer-reviewed study, published in JAMA, analyzed more than 4 million hospital stays and found that Medicare beneficiaries at private equity-owned hospitals experienced a 25% increase in hospital-acquired adverse events, including a 27% increase in falls and a 38% increase in bloodstream infections.










The stakes are high. Both Roger Williams and Fatima serve as safety net hospitals for some of Rhode Island’s most underserved communities. 


A researcher from Brown University analyzed over 226 million prices and found that private equity–affiliated primary care providers charged 7.8% more for the same office visits compared to independent practices. Hospital-affiliated primary care providers charged 10.7% more.
While private equity ownership of hospitals in Rhode Island remains low, the situation with nursing homes needs attention. According to the Private Equity Risk Index, 13.3% of nursing homes in the state are now private equity-controlled. This places Rhode Island among the top 10 states nationally for private equity penetration in elder care. The report notes that these facilities have an average Medicare quality rating of 2.5 (on a 1-5 scale) and an average of 5.5 substantiated complaints per facility between 2019 and 2022 — both worse than industry norms.
With Neronha’s latest decision, Rhode Island is pushing back — and setting a national example. The July 31 amendments mark a pivot away from private equity in health services and toward nonprofit governance. The updated conditions not only make the Centurion deal viable, but also ensure safeguards are in place to avoid another Prospect-style collapse.
Still, systemic questions remain. Should private equity be allowed to control critical health care infrastructure? What protections do patients have when ownership changes hands?
Private equity can bring capital, yes — but without public accountability, there’s no clear line between investment that heals and investment that harms.

(Photo courtesy of Aldine Independent School District)In a few short weeks, Aldine Independent School District in Texas will welcome a new cohort of ninth graders to the HEAL high school programs — one of the biggest career-technical education experiments underway in the state and just one of many that the Houston-area district is implementing to ensure its graduates are equipped with real-world skills.
Through a partnership with Memorial Hermann Health System — the largest health care provider in the Houston area — students pursue one of five pathways, identified for their resistance to automation and urgent local workforce needs: nursing, rehabilitation, pharmacy, imaging, and non-clinical administration.
In ninth and 10th grades, students participate in job-shadowing and practice their skills in simulation labs; starting in their junior year, students have access to paid health care internships and professional mentoring, among other work-based learning experiences. Students at HEAL, or the Health Education and Learning program at Nimitz High School, still take traditional academic courses to meet state graduation requirements, but they also enroll in specialized health care classes co-taught by Memorial Hermann employees.
Once the school is fully phased in over the next three years, it will serve approximately 760 students who will graduate with the skills and in many cases the certifications needed to move directly into high-demand health care jobs with family-sustaining wages.
“We’ve made a big push to re-leverage how we’re using CTE programs and industry-based certificates for kids that are in high-demand, high-wages career fields,” said Adrian Bustillos, the chief transformation officer at the district.
“The hospital system was telling us we have a shortage in these pathways and careers that we need to fill. Well, let’s work with our students sooner so we can get them in today. Give them access to their building, give them access to their training and to the experts in the field, and help cultivate future healthcare workers,” he said. “This is a game changer.”
The 58,000-student school district, where the vast majority of students are from low-income families, offers other workforce pathways focused on cybersecurity, energy, engineering and more — partnering with local businesses to offer students real-world experiences, industry certifications and dual credit opportunities.
Looking ahead, Bustillos says, Aldine is focused on how to make these options available for all students and on how to orchestrate a wholesale shift from a century-old learning model rooted in class time and passing exams to one that prioritizes skills gained.
“How do we find the other premier programs that are rooted in a model similar to this, that students want and the community needs, and that will help drive the market?,” Bustillos asked. “How can we leverage our thinking and drive it out to scale across the district with different pathways?”
Bustillos is far from the only district leader asking such questions these days. The slow recovery from the pandemic — along with the swift integration of artificial intelligence and a workforce that’s increasingly interested in skills and experiences over four-year degrees and pedigrees — has scrambled long-held assumptions of teaching and learning. Faced with a moment that’s forcing the education community to rethink what students should be able to do by the time they graduate, many are attempting to pivot away from test scores, GPAs and essays toward more tangible, employable skills.
Indeed, Aldine is part of a new cohort of two dozen school systems from across the country whose leaders are already pursuing this type of transformation. The Future of High School Network, launched this summer by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, aims to establish a “new architecture” for high schools across the country — one that sets ambitious goals for students, offers meaningful, rigorous and engaging learning experiences and uses improved tools to measure and accelerate student progress.
The network is part of a larger effort by Carnegie to redefine the so-called “Carnegie unit,” or what many know as the credit hour. Developed back in 1906, the unit defines the amount of time students need to spend in a course to earn credit toward a high school diploma. More than a century later, it still serves as the basis for calculating credits needed for graduation in many states and school districts. And while it once played an important role in standardizing a fragmented public education system, the time-based system, most agree, has outlived its usefulness.
“There is really broad scale recognition that the current design for the American high school isn’t meeting the needs of young people, isn’t meeting the needs of the economy and probably isn’t preparing young people effectively for participation in civic society,” says Timothy Knowles, president of the Carnegie Foundation. “You layer on top of that the intensity of the economic transition that the nation and the world is in, and it makes a very strong argument for this being an important moment for high school transformation.
“Lots of states are grappling with how you move away from time conflated with learning. The Carnegie unit was our creation, and it doesn’t really comport with what we now know about how young people learn,” he says. “Now is a critical moment of opportunity, not for tinkering around the edges with small elegant examples, but with more sustainable and scalable examples.”
The goal of the high school network is for members to collaborate on a framework that helps other districts modernize their outdated systems and expand competency-based high school models that accelerate student engagement, achievement and success in postsecondary education and work — whether that’s community college, medical school, a certificate program, the military or directly into the workforce.

The cohort is wildly diverse, both geographically and when it comes to the demographics of students the schools serve. It includes traditional public school districts like Aldine, Akron Public Schools in Ohio, Roanoke Public Schools in Virginia and New York City Public Schools; and it incorporates more innovative public and public charter systems like the Rural Alliance Zone in Indiana, and the Springfield Empowerment Zone in Massachusetts.
That wasn’t an accident. If the goal is to pursue high school transformation at scale, then the first step, Knowles says, is to prove that it works in states and districts that look like the rest of the country.
“What is it that Aldine is doing — particularly preparing young people for careers in healthcare — and how does that actually work in a way that would be useful for other systems across Texas, but also anywhere, and then elevating those lessons and building evidence.”
While the programs are unique and, in most cases, speak to the needs of the local workforce, the through-line is the same: an endeavor to equip students with more meaningful learning.

In Elizabeth City, North Carolina, students at the Northeast Academy for Aerospace and Advanced Technologies (NEAAT) choose between three science tracks: aviation, computer, and health. All high school courses are honors courses, and the majority of students also take classes at nearby Elizabeth City State University and the College of the Albemarle.
“We were dissatisfied with the opportunities our students had in the region, and decided it was time to do school differently,” says Andrew Harris, CEO of the academy. “We strive to graduate students who are ready for the real world, and that looks quite different than taking a bunch of multiple choice tests or sitting in rows or any of the things that we might have thought about from our own experiences. We try to make sure that students learn through experience.”
Roughly one in three students at NEAAT graduate with a two-year degree, and two out of three finish with at least one year of post-secondary coursework already completed. All students participate in local internships and are encouraged to earn 150 hours of volunteering in the community.
“If I’m going to have heart surgery, it’s important that the surgeon has passed the test,” he says. “But it’s a whole lot more important to me that he can actually perform the surgery and has a history of doing it. We’re trying to make sure our kids can match this sort of technical knowledge with real world experiences.”
Appetite for the academy’s model is overwhelming. What started with 120 students in eighth and ninth has grown a decade later into 760 students in fifth through 12th. If the school had the funding, Harris says, it would expand enrollment by another 500 to establish a pre-K through fourth grade. The school handles enrollment through a lottery system and receives nearly four applications for every open seat.
Carnegie is joined by several nonprofits and philanthropies to support the high school network’s efforts, including the XQ Institute, which has been pushing school leaders to rethink high school and embrace new models of teaching and learning for the last decade.
“We wake up every day thinking about how high school needs to change,” says Keith Dysarz, chief academic officer at XQ. “We have all this data that shows what we’re doing now isn’t preparing students for success when they leave high school.”
For Dysarz, the most important part of the effort isn’t simply dismantling the current model; it’s gathering data and evidence of what works to support the types of policy needed for scalable and sustainable change.
“There’s a lot of momentum in this work across the country right now, and this network is going to help us reimagine and envision new models for high school. We need these proof points, these examples that can turn into exemplars to really show that it’s possible.”

That medical debt relief is part of the program former Gov. Roy Cooper and the former head of the state Department of Health and Human Services announced last year that increases hospitals’  Medicaid payments in exchange for erasing debts amassed by people with lower incomes. 
Debt relief letters will go out in phases and continue into next year,  Julia Lerche, chief strategy officer and chief actuary for NC Medicaid said in an interview Friday.
The state Department of Health and Human Services is collecting information from hospitals on the numbers of people whose medical debts have been erased, along with total debt abolished, and will have a report in the next few months, she said. 
“We are really proud of the program,” Lerche said. “We know how much it means to so many people in North Carolina.”
Under the program, hospitals are forgiving Medicaid enrollees’ medical debts dating back to 2014. Former DHHS Secretary Kody Kinsley said last year that as people were signing up for expanded Medicaid, they talked about the heavy weight of old medical debts. 
Hospitals will erase medical debt dating back to 2014 for people who are not enrolled in Medicaid but whose incomes are at or below 350% of the federal poverty level or whose total debt is more than 5% of their yearly income. Hospitals also agreed to provide discounts to patients who meet income guidelines. 
Hospitals and Undue Medical Debt, a nonprofit that works to wipe out such debts, are looking at available income data to determine who is eligible to have their debts erased. 
As part of the program, hospitals had to agree to measures that would help people from going into debt in the first place, agree not sell to collectors the debts of people whose incomes are below 300% of the federal poverty level, or to report patients covered under the policy to credit reporting agencies. 
North Carolina has federal approval to run the program through June 2026, Lerche said.

(Photo by Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images)Republican support for in vitro fertilization, after surging in the wake of a 2024 Alabama Supreme Court decision that threatened the procedure, may be splintering as President Donald Trump retreats from his IVF promises and more far-right voices gain ground.
Earlier this year, conservatives in the Tennessee House staged an eleventh-hour skirmish over an IVF protection bill introduced by two of their Republican colleagues. The bill eventually passed, becoming one of the first in the nation to explicitly protect access to IVF. But some lawmakers who voted for it have signaled their willingness to revisit the issue.
In Georgia, a Republican-sponsored bill to codify the right to IVF into law sailed through the legislature, even as fellow conservative lawmakers introduced their own anti-abortion bill that opponents warned would undermine the IVF protections in the new law.
In statehouses around the nation, IVF has emerged as a dividing line running through the Republican Party. Particularly in states where abortion is banned, lawmakers who unite under the “pro-life” banner disagree over whether the popular treatment gives life or destroys it.
People who believe embryos are children oppose IVF because it can involve the discarding of some embryos, which they say is akin to abortion.
“The popularity of IVF creates a dilemma for Republican politicians who have had anti-choice organizations as a key part of their constituency for their whole careers,” said Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.
After the Alabama Supreme Court ruled last year that embryos are people, fertility clinics around the state temporarily halted their services, sparking nationwide outrage.
Republicans and Democrats rushed to pledge their support for fertility treatments such as IVF and announce their plans to protect it.
Conservatives push to declare fetuses as people, with far-reaching consequences

On the campaign trail last year, Trump promised to make insurers cover IVF so that it would be free for patients. After taking office, he signed an executive order giving White House officials 90 days to assemble a list of policy recommendations on protecting IVF access and reducing costs.
In March, he called himself “the fertilization president.”
But a week later, his administration eliminated the team of experts at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention responsible for tracking IVF outcomes across the United States. The team had, among other things, operated a database allowing consumers to look up an individual fertility clinic’s success rates. Earlier this month, The Washington Post reported that the White House doesn’t plan to require insurers to cover IVF services, though administration officials told the newspaper that IVF access remains a priority.
Meanwhile, conservative groups that oppose abortion have begun pushing an obscure alternative treatment for infertility called “restorative reproductive medicine,” or RRM. Advocates have urged the White House and federal and state legislators to back RRM, which is based on the idea that the underlying causes of infertility can be treated through lifestyle changes and improving a person’s overall health.
Arkansas recently became the first to pass a pro-RRM law. Others might follow suit in upcoming legislative sessions.
Cole Muzio, founder and president of the Georgia conservative Christian nonprofit Frontline Policy Council, said he doesn’t expect to see legislators try to ban IVF outright, despite preemptive efforts by legislators in his state and others to protect it.
“Republicans are intrinsically pro-family, and the idea of supporting those who want to have a family is a conservative, noble, positive thing,” he said.
“At the same time, IVF discards an overwhelming number of human lives. We’ve got a lot of work to do to educate people.”
IVF pushback grows louder
This spring, the Tennessee bill protecting IVF passed unanimously in the state Senate. But by the time it hit the House floor in April, many of its Republican supporters sat silently while a few of their GOP colleagues tried to derail it.
The bill’s sponsor, Republican state Rep. Iris Rudder, told the Tennessee Lookout that she hadn’t expected disagreement over the bill to “mushroom the way it did.”
It eventually passed. But 11 Tennessee House Republicans sent a letter to GOP Gov. Bill Lee urging him to veto it and calling it “a Trojan horse that could potentially undermine Tennessee’s strong and righteous stance on the protection of innocent human life.”
Lee signed it in April.
The following day, Tennessee Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson — who voted for the bill and said he supports IVF and contraceptives — told constituents during a legislative forum that he’d had “lots of conversations” about it and expects the legislature to revisit the issue again in the next session.
“I think we’ll be back next year to take another stab at it,” he said.
Potential threats to IVF push political novices into election-year advocacy

In Georgia, the state’s most powerful Republicans made a bill to codify the right to IVF a major priority this year. It was signed into law in May.
“Thanks to a lot of bipartisan support and hard work, Georgians who want to grow their families will never have to worry about whether or not they can access this vital treatment,” the bill’s sponsor, Republican state Rep. Lehman Franklin, posted to X after it passed through the legislature. Franklin and his wife conceived through IVF, a story he has shared publicly as he promoted the measure.
“At the end of the day, being pro-family means being pro-IVF,” he wrote.
Muzio, of the Frontline Policy Council, believes the IVF debate represents not so much a split in the Republican Party as it does a lack of education about what the treatment really means to people who believe human life begins as soon as an egg is fertilized.
“Hopefully you’ll see [legislation] put in place that either backs different fertility treatments that are more pro-life or guardrails put in place to restrict the discarding of human life for the purposes of IVF,” he said.
For conservatives who see IVF as akin to abortion, restorative reproductive medicine has emerged politically as an option for addressing infertility without explicitly supporting IVF, which remains overwhelmingly popular among Americans.
Out of obscurity
RRM was a relatively obscure idea until anti-abortion groups such as The Heritage Foundation began elevating it over the past year as an alternative to IVF. With RRM, a practitioner might help patients analyze their diet, chart their menstrual cycle to look for conditions that can impact fertility, or treat reproductive disorders like endometriosis or thyroid dysfunction.
Supporters argue that a more holistic approach is a better way to treat infertility, and that RRM methods are much less expensive than IVF, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars.
But RRM has been criticized in mainstream medical circles. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists calls RRM a “nonmedical approach” and an “unproven concept” that can delay time to pregnancy and expose patients to needless and painful surgical interventions, such as procedures to treat polycystic ovarian syndrome. It says the approach overwhelmingly puts the onus on women, ignoring that infertility causes are just as common in men.
Some experts worry that patients spending months or years on RRM treatments will lose precious time when IVF could have helped them get pregnant.
And OB-GYNs warn RRM is closely tied to the anti-abortion “personhood” movement, which attempts to grant fertilized eggs the same legal status as people — potentially leading to a loss of rights for pregnant patients and more severe restrictions on birth control and other reproductive health care.










They put their considerable resources into asking, ‘How do we blunt the momentum IVF is getting without saying we’re opposed to IVF?’


– Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine


Tipton, of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, believes RRM is more “ideology” than medical practice.
“[RRM] got legs thanks to the work of really influential right-wing and anti-choice groups,” he said. “They put their considerable resources into asking, ‘How do we blunt the momentum IVF is getting without saying we’re opposed to IVF?’”
But as RRM gains mainstream attention, it’s also found supporters in the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement promoted by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Some consumers remain skeptical of the fertility industry, where some clinics have ties to private equity firms and other large corporations.
In March, Arkansas Republican state Rep. Alyssa Brown told fellow legislators that RRM “prioritizes women’s health over the profits of Big Pharma and Big Fertility.”
First in the nation
Brown sponsored a first-of-its-kind bill in Arkansas — which passed in April and was signed into law — that requires state insurance companies to cover RRM treatments.
Brown promised during a hearing that it wouldn’t limit access to IVF. Arkansas was one of the earliest states, in 1991, to require insurance companies to cover IVF.
A similar bill with the same title, the RESTORE Act, was introduced in Congress again this year, after failing last year. It includes recommendations from The Heritage Foundation and the conservative, anti-abortion Ethics and Public Policy Center.
Arkansas’ new law also requires programs funded through Title X, which provides birth control and other reproductive care to low-income families, to use fertility awareness-based methods, mirroring a similar effort at the federal level. Under Kennedy, HHS has indicated plans to use Title X funding to open an “infertility training center.” Part of the center’s focus, according to its grant announcement, is to “educate on the root causes of infertility and the broad range of holistic infertility treatments” available to patients.
Meanwhile, state legislators around the country this year attempted to require health insurance to cover IVF, including in Montana, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia.
Nevada’s Democratic-controlled legislature passed a bill in June establishing the right to fertility treatments, including IVF, but it was swiftly vetoed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo.
In May, Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed a bill into law requiring a state insurance commission to consider coverage for procedures like IVF, a move that sets the stage for requiring health insurance companies to cover it. Before signing, Youngkin tried to insert a provision allowing private plans to opt out of coverage for religious or ethical beliefs, but the legislature rejected the change.
Although he signed the measure, Youngkin said his exemption idea needed to be taken up if the state eventually mandates coverage of fertility treatments.

(Roger Chesley/Virginia Mercury)Last spring, Virginia won big. After a rigorous and highly competitive application process, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced in April that our state would receive $156 million through its Solar for All program. 
That investment, led by Virginia Energy and backed by detailed oversight plans, was designed to help thousands of low-income families and disadvantaged communities across the Commonwealth lower their energy bills, breathe cleaner air, and enjoy the economic benefits of local, homegrown solar power.
Now, as we are developing Virginia’s implementation program, the EPA is pulling the plug. Terminating Virginia’s Solar for All program would be a costly mistake — and Virginia families and small businesses would be the ones left paying the hefty price.
Let’s be clear: Solar for All is a historic investment in energy affordability and economic development for vulnerable communities that need it most. These funds are earmarked exclusively for low-income, rural, and other disadvantaged communities — places where high utility bills already strain household budgets. The program’s design assures that every participating household saves at least 20% on their electricity costs, which translates to yearly savings. That’s money that could go toward groceries, rent, medicine or childcare.
Ending the program would rip the potential for savings away from the families who need them most. The timing could not be worse. Electricity rates in Virginia rose more than 3% from May 2024 to May 2025, and there’s no relief in sight. Surging demand from data centers and record-breaking heat waves are putting enormous pressure on our electric grid. Every month, more Virginians are opening utility bills that feel like a punch to the gut, and volatile natural gas prices make electricity bills unpredictable. Solar for All offers a powerful countermeasure, putting control back into the hands of consumers by generating power right where it’s used and reducing the strain on the grid.
The Trump administration has said it is committed to lowering energy costs for all Americans. If that’s true, there is no justification for eliminating funding for a program that does exactly that — especially one that is already well underway in our state and so many others. Virginia Energy has invested time, expertise, and resources into developing a program that meets strict federal oversight requirements. Partnerships have been formed. Early groundwork has been laid to ensure that every taxpayer dollar produces tangible benefits.
This is a blow to every Virginian who believes that public investments should produce real, measurable returns for the people who paid into them. Without Solar for All, low-income households and communities will remain locked into a cycle of rising utility bills, vulnerable to every market fluctuation and weather event that drives prices higher. Small businesses in rural and disadvantaged communities will have fewer tools to lower operating costs, making it harder for them to survive and thrive.
The stakes are too high to let this happen quietly, and energy affordability shouldn’t be a partisan issue. Virginia’s leaders should be united in opposition to this move. Whether you live in a rural or urban area — the Shenandoah Valley, the Tidewater region, Southwest Virginia, Northern Virginia or Richmond — you deserve access to reliable, affordable power.
Pulling the plug on Solar for All would shortchange Virginia’s families and communities, waste taxpayer dollars, and set back our state’s progress toward energy independence. The EPA should reconsider this misguided plan, and our elected officials must use every tool at their disposal to make sure these dollars stay where they belong: helping Virginians power their homes and businesses at a price they can afford.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio college students are navigating the ramifications of the state’s new higher education law that bans diversity efforts, prohibits faculty strikes, and regulates classroom discussion. 
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed Senate Bill 1 into law on March 28 after it quickly passed the House and Senate earlier this year. Ohio S.B. 1 went into effect nearly two months ago. 
S.B. 1 creates post-tenure reviews, puts diversity scholarships at risk, sets rules around classroom discussion, and creates a retrenchment provision that blocks unions from negotiating on tenure, among other things. The law affects Ohio’s public universities and community colleges.
Diversity centers across Ohio’s public universities have closed because of the new higher education law.
“I feel like it’s almost a grieving process where I know for a fact that the Pride Center is gone,” said Ohio University senior Audrey Ansel. “I know that that office space is empty — I helped empty it out — but it still just feels strange, and it’s not something I had ever imagined would happen.”

Ohio University sunsetted the Division of Diversity and Inclusion which included the Pride Center, the Women’s Center and the Multicultural Center. Ansel lost her job at the Pride Center when it closed and has been unable to find a different job on campus. 
“It is just frustrating having done all of that work and (having) put so much of myself into the Pride Center for three years,” Ansel said. “I will always be proud of that, but it’s hard when that physical representation of that work is gone.”
The Pride Center was a big reason Ansel chose to go to OU. 
“I don’t regret going to school here, and I’ll never regret going to school here. … But it feels like a betrayal,” she said.
OU’s Pride Center served not only the campus community, but also the city of Athens.  
“This (was) a hub for queer people in southern Ohio,” Ansel said. “I think that was something that was unique about the Pride Center, was that it wasn’t just exclusive to students, and I always appreciated that. … Community members are going to suffer without that resource.”
Kent State University’s LBGTQ+ Living-Learning Community was one of the main reasons Chloe Ripoli chose to go to Kent State, but it now no longer exists because of the new law.
“As someone who got to experience the LLC the last year that it was in place, knowing that no one else would have that experience was really heartbreaking to me,” said Ripoli, a 19-year-old sophomore.   
Ripoli was planning on going to the LGBTQ+ Center more this year, but is unable to do so since the new law closed the center. 
“I no longer have access to that safe space,” Ripoli said. 
Nica Delgado, a graduate student at Kent State, said she previously found solace at the E. Timothy Moore Student Multicultural Center during her undergraduate years at Kent State. 
“It gave me a community that I could lean on,” she said. “It also provided a space that I knew on campus was for me.”
The center closed after S.B. 1 took effect this summer. 
“It makes me fearful for the safety of students to not have that space that is for them,” Delgado said. 
Members of Youngstown State University’s chapter of the Ohio Education Association tried unsuccessfully to get a referendum on the Nov. 4 ballot to stop S.B. 1., but fell about 53,000 signatures short.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)It took just days after the July 6 apparent murder-suicide for the outrage and calls for investigations to begin.
Marisol Fuentes-Huaracha was killed outside a restaurant in Berlin by her estranged husband, Michael Gleason Jr., police say. Gleason took his own life shortly afterward. And soon after, lawmakers, largely Republican, criticized the courts’ decision to release Gleason on bail earlier this year despite his facing kidnapping and felonious sexual assault charges.
They directed that criticism in particular to the state’s short-lived magistrate system — which was created in January and will end in September after efforts by Gov. Kelly Ayotte — and one magistrate specifically, Stephanie Johnson, who was part of the decision to release Gleason on bail. 
But for those advocating for victims of domestic violence, this summer’s tragedy is not new. 
Four years ago, the state legal system was rocked by a similar tragedy, when a man shot a woman and then himself after a New Hampshire court had vacated a protective order filed by the woman against the man. That case inspired a comprehensive review of court domestic violence policies. But today, as attention again falls on the courts, critics say not enough changes have been made since that tragedy and review. 
“The fact that there were so many indicators that told us that something like this could happen — we believe there are solutions that should build on those indicators,” said Lyn Schollett, executive director of the New Hampshire Coalition against Domestic and Sexual Violence. 
Members of the judicial branch say the courts have made strides toward improving the experience of court for victims and training judges on how to approach domestic violence cases. 
“Our court staff are deeply dedicated to supporting victims of domestic violence,” said Jessica Humphrey, the domestic violence program manager for the judicial branch. “We are committed to handling these cases with the urgency, sensitivity, and care they deserve, ensuring that every individual feels heard, protected, and respected throughout the legal process.”
Ongoing calls for reform
Advocates say the 2021 case — like the 2025 case — could have been avoided. Weeks before Richard Lorman shot Lindsay Smith, a New Hampshire Circuit Court judge, Polly Hall, denied Smith’s request for an extended restraining order against Lorman. Smith pointed to written threats by Lorman to Smith that he would make her “pay” and would turn her “world upside down.” But Hall ruled that those threats did not rise to the level of danger that would justify a full protective order. 
Smith survived the shooting; Lorman died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. 
An internal judicial branch review in 2021 found that Hall had applied the law correctly. But the incident sparked backlash and prompted the formation of a 20-member task force of judges, attorneys, and community members. The mission: to review court procedures in domestic violence cases, assess current state laws, improve publication of judicial decisions around protective orders, boost access to attorneys to alleged victims and make applications for protective orders easier to file, and strengthen communication between actors. 
In March 2022, that task force issued a series of recommendations. It called for additional state funding for trainings on domestic violence, the publicization of decisions in domestic violence orders, assistance to victims attempting to get protective orders, an increase in staffing levels and legal help at crisis centers, and a review of the state’s existing anti-domestic violence laws. 
Schollett argues this year’s Berlin tragedy indicates not enough has been done. The murder of Fuentes-Huaracha was “foreseeable and preventable,” she said.
Last month, the judicial branch announced it was conducting an “internal branch review” of the decisions to release Gleason. It is not currently planning to conduct a comprehensive review similar to what was done in 2021.
The red flags in the lead-up to Fuentes-Huaracha’s murder included the seriousness of the aggravated felonious sexual assault charge and the fact that a second woman had filed a stalking restraining order against him days before the murder, Schollett said. 
Many of those conditions correlate with murders in domestic violence cases, she said. “This is a pattern,” Schollett said. “We know what the pattern is. We need to intervene and stop the pattern.”
Chief among the necessary reforms is an improvement in communication, Schollett argued. Law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, and courts should have shared some of the information at issue, Schollett said. She also argued the protocols being used by courts are outdated.
Even before facing a concrete domestic violence case, those actors should be working together to prepare how to approach pieces of the protest, Schollett said, from the initial arrest to the bail hearings to the potential trial itself. Knowing the risks of escalation is part of that.
“I think the big picture information issue is understanding the underlying crime, the progression of domestic violence and increasing lethality,” Schollett said.
The judicial branch includes protocols that seek to lay out some of the red flags judges should be aware of when setting bail. Those protocols include a list of the factors that should be considered, such as “threats of suicide, acute depression, history of violating protective orders, possessing deadly weapons in violation of an order, death threats, stalking, and cruelty to pets,” as well as others that include “escalation of physical or other forms of abuse,” “the victim’s attempt to flee,” and “the batterer’s access to the victim/family.” 
Planning is one piece of the response; information sharing is another. In the Berlin case, Fuentes-Huaracha had sought a domestic violence protective order, a civil proceeding. Gleason’s hearing releasing him on bail was a criminal proceeding. Those processes should be better aligned, Schollett argues. 
Schollett and the coalition say they want data transparency to hold judges accountable, too. Without having judge-specific data on how many bail requests are granted or denied in domestic violence cases, they can’t find patterns where certain judges may be less versed in the factors that might, she said. 
Meanwhile, the thought process behind judges’ decisions to grant or deny protective orders can be obscure; usually, judges do not issue written explanations at the first instance. A short written opinion is issued only if there is an appeal, and appeals are typically brought by the defendants, not victims, Schollett notes. That means the body of written opinions on protective orders consists primarily of cases in which alleged perpetrators believe they have a cause to appeal, Schollett said, meaning the jurisprudence may be skewed in favor of defendants. 
One change favored by victims’ advocates could require legislation. Schollett and the coalition have long argued that judges should interpret the definition of abuse more broadly than they currently do. Currently, abuse is defined in statute as “an ongoing pattern of behavior which reasonably causes or has caused the petitioner to fear for his or her safety or well-being.” 
Victims’ groups say fear for safety should include more than just physical safety, but should extend also to emotional trauma, coercive control, and other types of manipulation, such as using a victim’s pregnancy against her.
But the judicial branch has countered that courts cannot make those broader interpretations without either a state Supreme Court ruling endorsing it or a legislative change making that intent clear. 
“Our advocates do a wonderful job of supporting our victims, and the definition of abuse in our advocate world, in our domestic violence world, is very different than how our statute reads,” said Humphrey in an interview.
Judicial branch efforts
For their part, leaders in the judicial branch say they have taken the task force recommendations seriously and have made a number of changes.
The court system has updated the domestic violence protocols it issues to judges to guide them on how to make decisions in those cases, noted Judge Kimberly Chabot, a circuit court judge who serves on the judicial branch’s Committee on Domestic Violence, in an interview. 
Courts now offer victims more user-friendly features, such as online options to fill out forms for protective order applications as well as informational videos for how to do so, she said. Chabot pointed to a pilot program in the Salem Circuit Court, in which victims are afforded portable barriers to be able to fill out applications privately at a courthouse. 
And courts are attempting to create more collaborations between courts, crisis centers, victim advocates, law enforcement, and attorneys to address how to handle victims, Chabot added. 
For instance, new coordination between police departments allows a victim to go to a police department that is not in their jurisdiction and get assistance from the department that is in their jurisdiction. And court representatives in Manchester have regular meetings with crisis centers in the city to solicit ideas and feedback, she added, though she said it is harder to coordinate in counties that are less centralized. 
“It’s wonderful to be able to have a person to establish a point of contact for the crisis centers, to be able to meet them, understand what they do, understand what the courts do, build those relationships so we adequately and effectively understand the responsibilities of each and where the limitations are,” she said. 
Chabot noted that the judicial system has also instituted domestic violence-focused training sessions during staff development days for judges and other staff. Last November, for instance, featured a national expert on stalking to inform judges how to handle those cases. 
But Schollett argued those trainings are insufficient and that more should be held. “There are judges who when they don’t see a bruise, think it’s not abuse,” she said. 
Court officials say they are limited in the amount of information they can share between courts and between civil and criminal courts. And they say they do not have the capacity to publish the records of how many protective orders are issued by individual judges. 
“Our case management system doesn’t allow for that extra (information),” said Humphrey. “It’s not that we’re trying to keep it from the public. We don’t have that ability to be able to differentiate orders by judge through our case management system.”
Doing so would require an expensive overhaul of the digital filing system, which Humphrey argued is not necessarily the best use of funds. “I would rather see us dedicate money to transitioning to electronic records if we were going to put that much money into the system to use what we have and just expand upon it.” 
Above all, Chabot argued that the courts can only do so much. “The court is really the middle man,” she said. “…We are one piece to the puzzle.”
Increased political pressure
In the weeks after the July murder, much of the political fire was aimed at the magistrate system. But two Republican members of the Executive Council have also asked bigger questions of the court reminiscent of those after 2021.
At a public meeting in July, Councilors Joseph Kenney and John Stephen convened top state leaders to ask about reforms, including Attorney General John Formella, Department of Safety Commissioner Robert Quinn, and New Hampshire Supreme Court Chief Justice Gordon MacDonald. 
Councilors inquired into the level of coordination between civil and criminal courts and law enforcement, asking how the multiple applications for protective orders against Gleason had not factored into his bail hearing.
“I don’t know what failed here, why at this juncture, in our time, in this state, with … how efficient and innovative technology is, that we have gaps and we can’t communicate quickly in real time,” Stephen said.
Quinn pointed to the rollout of the J-One program, which is intended to allow better electronic information sharing about criminal records and incidents between police departments, and said he is hoping to get all New Hampshire police departments involved. 
MacDonald said the court was looking into that program, and others. 
“We’re here with full awareness of the gravity of the situation,” he said. “We’re here in the spirit of: If we can improve, we want to improve.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_5274-1024x566.jpg,,,2025-08-25 05:56:35.430921

Authorities in the West African nation threw him in prison because of his sexual orientation, he said. After his release, he feared that if he stayed in the country, he would be killed.
B., who is now 39 and who asked that he be identified only by his initial because he still has family in Cameroon, arrived in the United States with practically nothing. Since he was granted asylum last year, he has been able to use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, to help him get by.
But now most refugees and asylees, who entered the country legally, including B., are no longer eligible for food stamps. The change is part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the giant federal domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4.
“I think it’s unfair. I understand that there are some people who abuse the system,” B. told Stateline. “There are also people who are in need. And cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.”
SNAP, which is funded by the federal government but administered by the states, helps families and individuals with lower incomes supplement their grocery budgets. The program serves an average of 42 million people a month.
Supporters of the change note that refugees and asylees can get permits to work, and that they have other sources of support.
“It’s not like they have been dropped off in this country with no support system,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration rules.
“They have sponsoring organizations that are helping them get settled and they have work authorization. So they really should be moving forward towards self-sufficiency with support right out of the starting gate. And they should be moving ahead to obtain green cards,” she added, referring to the cards that signify permanent residency.
Vaughan cited a federal grant program that reimburses states and nonprofit organizations for financial aid and health care coverage they provide to refugees.
But critics argue that asylees and refugees, who are extensively vetted and have a legitimate path to citizenship, can wait years for a green card, which entitles them to a wider array of benefits.
They also say community organizations that provide aid to asylees and refugees are stretched thin. Without food stamps, they say, many refugees and their families would not have enough to eat.
“SNAP is an incredibly fundamental program for this population that comes to the United States, really, with very little, if anything,” said Nicolas Palazzo, a policy counsel at the global humanitarian and refugee advocacy organization HIAS. “These are people who literally had to flee — many times overnight — with nothing, but, you know, a pair of clothes in a backpack.”
Palazzo also said SNAP is not a “handout” to refugees or asylees. Rather, he said, it’s a “smart and moral investment” that protects all communities and strengthens the economy, offering people a foundation for self-sufficiency.
“Stripping critical food assistance forces refugees and asylees into the shadows of informal work, labor exploitation, and hunger that weakens our workforce and denigrates our moral obligations,” Palazzo said.
‘Nowhere else to go’
B. said he applied immediately for asylum when he arrived in the U.S. in 2016, but that he had to wait months for a work permit. He survived by doing odd jobs, such as cleaning homes and delivering food, and got by on very little. It wasn’t until late 2024, when he finally won his asylum case, that he was eligible to get any public benefits, including food stamps.
Eligibility for food stamps came at a critical time for B., as a car accident had prevented him from making food deliveries.
“While not having income, it was very helpful,” B. said. “I’m somebody who if I can work, I will work. The only reason I went over there to ask is because I had nowhere else to go.”
According to a November 2024 report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, a total of 60,050 people were newly admitted to the United States as refugees in 2023, many from unstable countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria and Afghanistan.
In 2023, the nation received at least 747,000 applications for people seeking asylum from countries including Venezuela, Cuba, and Colombia, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration research group. It’s a tremendous increase from the 68,000 applications received in 2013.
The new domestic policy law specifies that food stamps are still available to Cubans and Haitians who might be refugees and asylees.
As of July 2025, more than 2.2 million immigrants in the U.S. are awaiting asylum hearings or decisions after formally applying for asylum, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, an organization at Syracuse University that tracks immigration cases.
“Getting through the system was difficult,” B. said. “I had to find money. I had to find an attorney who would help me apply for my asylum case. The asylum case itself took a long time.
“I still know people who have been here for more than 10 years and never had an interview.”
‘Already stretched’
According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, half of all admitted refugees in 2023 were resettled across just 10 states: Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan, and Washington.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 41,000 people in the state are getting SNAP benefits while not being lawful permanent residents. She says that group includes refugees and asylees.
“The concerning part there is that these are individuals who were … lawfully admitted to the country, have previously been eligible for SNAP when they need it, and now, simply because of their status, will no longer be able to receive SNAP benefits,” Guinn told Stateline. “There’s nothing we’re going to be able to do to make them eligible.”
Another change under the new law is that for the first time, states will have to pay for a portion of their food stamp programs. States will have to cover between 5% and 15% of their SNAP costs beginning in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they dole out benefits to people eligible for the program.
Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, pointed out that states that want to continue to provide SNAP benefits to refugees and asylees are free to do so — as long as they pay for it.
“If New York state doesn’t want to cut these people off, they can continue to give them something like food stamps. They just have to do it with New York state money right now,” Rector said.
But Guinn said that will be difficult. New York does offer asylum-seekers a variable amount of monthly cash assistance through its Safety Net Assistance Program, but typically recipients must be working.
In Texas, officials at the state’s health and human services agency said that as of last month, roughly 24,600 of the state’s 3.5 million SNAP recipients were refugees or asylees. A spokesperson for Maryland’s human services agency wrote in an email that the state’s SNAP program last year supported more than 10,000 refugees and asylees.
The California Department of Social Services could not provide the number of refugees and asylees receiving food stamps, but projected that a total of 74,000 noncitizens — including lawfully permanent residents, refugees and asylees — would lose eligibility under the new law.
Sherri Laigle, the director of social services at HIAS, said food banks will not be able to make up for refugees’ and asylees’ loss of SNAP benefits.
“They’re already stretched, and now we’re going to see tens of thousands of people also needing to continue to rely on these programs. Of course, there’s limited access to them. You have to have transportation. You have to be able to get there.”
B. said he would apply for food stamps again if he could, because he’s earning too little income to get by.
“There are people who are in need. I think ignoring that — it’s not human.”

Meanwhile, prominent Republicans have proposed drawing even more skewed districts.
The redistricting process that starts next month in Ohio is different from the fights in Texas and other states, where Republicans have been reopening the process in years when the redrawing of voting districts isn’t required by law.
Because of a state process that has been filled with conflict and controversy since the 2020 U.S. Census was released, Ohio is required to redraw congressional districts this year.
 United front
Congressional maps were drawn and approved twice over the last five years by Ohio leaders, but neither of the maps received the bipartisan support the state constitution requires to allow the maps to be used for 10 years.
On top of that, both maps were deemed unconstitutional by the Ohio Supreme Court, though that didn’t stop Republican leaders from leaving the most recently approved map in place and using it for the last election cycle.
Democratic leaders in the state say they plan to keep their eyes forward and work toward the agreement that has so often eluded elected leaders in the redistricting process thus far.
“Obviously, my aspirational hope would be that we would enter into a process that was fair and that was reflective of the voting patterns of the people of the state of Ohio,” Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio told the Capital Journal.
At the same time, Antonio said she’s “pragmatic and a realist,” and she and her compatriot, House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, understand that the history of redistricting in Ohio has not brought about results that exactly matched the voting patterns, where Ohio currently stands at a ratio of 55% Republican and 45% Democrat.
As the makeup of the congressional representation of the state stands now, the map has a 66% Republican lean with 10 Republicans and five Democrats in the U.S. Congress.
“The reality is Ohio has been gerrymandered for a really long time, and the idea that we would even consider further gerrymandering a state that’s already one of the most gerrymandered maps in the country just adds insult to injury,” Isaacsohn said.

With the recent results of the presidential election in Ohio placing the state in a 55%-44% ratio, advocates and Democratic leaders say the numbers should be more like eight Republican Congress members and seven Democrats.
“Unfortunately, I don’t know that that’s what we’re facing,” Antonio said of the upcoming redistricting process. “My concern is that what we’re facing is another opportunity to gerrymander the districts.”
Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno suggested this summer that Republicans draw maps that would give them 12 of 15 seats, or 80% representation.
The Ohio Democratic Party as a whole is concerned as well, and preparing to fight through outreach to legislators, through public comments during the proceedings and even a new ballot measure to challenge the process if needed. A previous attempt to change the way redistricting is done in the state through a ballot measure failed in last year’s general election.
“We will fight, we will organize, we will make noise at every step of the process,” said Ohio Democratic Party chair Kathleen Clyde in a Thursday press call with Texas Democratic Party Chair Kendall Scudder. “We have options at the ballot, we have options in court.”
Texas has made national news with their recent redistricting battle, one in which Democrats left the state all together to keep Republicans from passing a map that was deemed very unfairly Republican-leaning.
Clyde and Scudder presented a unified front against Republican gerrymandering attempts, in what they say is a representation of the entire Democratic Party’s stance against unduly partisan maps that hinder attempts to keep voting districts competitive.
“What we have heard loud and clear since the 2024 elections is that Democrats are ready for a party that doesn’t just take punches, we throw them,” Scudder said.
Clyde is nonplussed by the numbers in the Ohio legislature, where Republicans hold a supermajority in both chambers. The redistricting process starts in that legislature, where the maps must be approved by a three-fifths majority to be able to proceed.
“Even with a minority status in the legislature, that is part of the process, minority support for the maps,” Clyde said. “We will be pursuing what the voters said they wanted, which is a map where fairness is a key piece of the process.”
  The path ahead
Antonio has had her fair share of experience with redistricting, having been co-chair of the Ohio Redistricting Commission last time around, and being a part of the only instance in which bipartisan support was put behind a set of maps, in that case, the last round of statehouse district maps.
While Antonio said that was a rare moment in which Republicans were motivated to “add additional voices of the people of the state of Ohio and move towards a more fair map,” she still acknowledges the legislative map was “the best of a worst-case scenario.”
To get bipartisan support this time around would take reflecting those voting patterns from the Donald Trump-Kamala Harris election.
“It would take having a fair representation of the patterns of the voting districts in Ohio, that’s what it would take,” Antonio said.
The Senate and House minority leaders said they have started discussions about the process, and are working to draw up contracts for consultants to help with the drawing of maps when the time comes.
Isaacsohn said he knows the redistricting process isn’t about the elected officials who are a part of it, but more about “the democracy we want to live in,” and the impacts the power of voting can have on issues like education, housing and senior services.
“We will stick to our core convictions,” Isaacsohn said.
They are prepared, as are leaders of the Ohio Democratic Party, to take the battle to the courts if needed, though the state supreme court’s current makeup of six conservative justices and a single liberal justice, doesn’t provide hope for their chances.
“There was a time when the expectation was that the supreme court in the state of Ohio used the measure of the law to look through that lens and make decisions,” Antonio said. “What we’re seeing now, the supreme court in the state of Ohio looks through the lens of partisan politics first.”
Still, the Senate’s leading Democrat said state Republicans have pledged that they will work to create a map that represents what’s best for the state of Ohio, and at the current moment, she is “open to accepting them at their word.”
“The biggest thing for all of us to consider is you go into everything with an open mind and you work from there,” Antonio said.
The Ohio General Assembly has until Sept. 30 to come up with a map that has the necessary bipartisan approval to be passed for 10 years. If it can’t come up with that agreement, the process moves to the Ohio Redistricting Commission, made up of a majority Republican elected leaders.
If bipartisan agreement isn’t gained there by Oct. 30, the process moves back to the legislature, where the maps can be approved by a simple majority. The deadline for that final attempt is Nov. 30.

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)President Donald Trump has cut more than 7,000 staffers from the Social Security Administration, sapping its ability to connect Americans in Ohio and elsewhere with their benefits, the Democratic commissioner who led the agency in 2024 said last Monday.
Under Trump, the administration isn’t reporting important metrics to members of Congress — and their offices are being flooded with complaints from constituents, Martin O’Malley, the former commissioner, said.
Asked about O’Malley’s statements, the offices of Ohio’s U.S. senators, Jon Husted and Bernie Moreno, both Republicans, didn’t respond.
The Social Security Administration, however, claimed it was delivering more timely, efficient service than the agency had under Trump’s predecessor, former President Joe Biden. However, the agency didn’t respond to questions about agency staffing or how long it’s taking for applicants to receive benefits after they initially apply.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
When Trump took office in January, he appointed the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, to look for ways to cut the federal workforce. On Feb. 27, the Social Security Administration announced “significant workforce reductions.” 
“Through these massive reorganizations, offices that perform functions not mandated by statute may be prioritized for reduction-in-force actions that could include abolishment of organizations and positions, directed reassignments, and reductions in staffing,” the agency told its employees. 
What resulted were layoffs, resignations, and retirements totaling 7,150. 
At 13%, it was by far the largest staffing cut in the agency’s history, the Center for American Progress reported in June.
“The last time the SSA had this few employees was 1967, when the agency served 480 beneficiaries for every staff member,” the report said. “In 2025, the agency would be attempting to serve 1,480 beneficiaries for every staff member.”
Computers have enabled each Social Security worker to serve more clients than she or he could 58 years ago, but in a virtual press conference, O’Malley said that after the cuts, the agency isn’t keeping up.
“Every member of Congress will tell you that — regardless of party — their phones have been exploding with additional numbers of people who have been calling their congressional representatives because they can’t get through to Social Security for the benefits that they’ve already earned,” he said. 
“Because of the speed and the depth of the cruelty of the staff cuts to Social Security — an agency that was already struggling to serve record numbers of new beneficiaries because of baby boomers — the staff was cut to a 50-year low. The continued, never-fail, every-monthly string of payments by Social Security is very much in jeopardy.”
The offices of Ohio’s U.S. senators, Moreno and Husted, didn’t respond when asked if they had been deluged with constituent complaints about getting their benefits, and what they were doing in response if they were.

For its part, the Social Security Administration said O’Malley’s claims aren’t true. It didn’t address staffing cuts, but said that service had actually improved.
“SSA’s dedicated workforce is delivering a significantly improved customer experience for the American people, despite unfounded claims being made by former SSA officials,” a spokesperson said in an email.
“Under Commissioner (Frank J.) Bisignano’s leadership, there has been a transformation at SSA that all Americans can be proud of: the average speed of answer for the National 800 Number has dropped from 30 minutes last year to 8 minutes in July 2025; average field office wait times have decreased by 30%; and the SSA website now enables Americans with 24/7 access and management of their benefits after the elimination of 29 hours of previously scheduled weekly downtime.”
But O’Malley, the former Democratic governor of Maryland, claimed that under its current management, the Social Security Administration is no longer reporting some metrics to Congress and manipulating others to gaslight the public.
“It’s not so much what they’re cherry picking and posting, it’s what they’re not sharing,” he said when asked what numbers the public can follow to monitor performance. “I’d like to direct you to things to look at, but they don’t share those things. The place has become like the hermit kingdom — only the happy story gets told.”
For example, he said, claimant representatives around the country are telling him “that they’re now seeing a six-month to 18-month waiting period between when an allowance is granted — say in the case of a disability — to when that person received their first benefit check.” 
The Social Security Administration didn’t respond directly when asked how long the average waiting period is to receive benefits.
O’Malley added that members of Congress haven’t been receiving the same weekly performance reports from the agency they had gotten in the past. 
He said that it also isn’t reporting its “performance center backlog” — the only metric his administration wasn’t able to substantially improve when he was running the agency under former President Joe Biden.
The processing centers serve as a backstop to Social Security field offices, handling their overflow and complex cases. With so many fewer workers throughout the Social Security Administration, the centers are sure to be seeing many more cases while having less capacity to deal with them, O’Malley said.
“The processing center is like an escape valve and if and when a member of Congress gets them to show what the processing center backlog is, you will see that it’s adversely affecting millions of people,” he said. “In fact, dare I say, it’s probably at an all-time, record high.”
The Social Security Administration spokesperson said the agency is keeping Congress up to date.
“SSA regularly engages with Congress and shares timely performance data, which is prepared by SSA’s dedicated career workforce using long-standing agency methodology,” the spokesperson said. “Additionally, we publish our performance metrics on our website for public awareness to provide a snapshot of the real experiences of the people we serve and highlight the optimal ways our customers can get service.”
For his part, O’Malley described one way he thinks the new administration is manipulating some of the metrics it does report. 
At the start of 2024, the 8 million who called the agency’s 1-800 number each month had to wait 42.5 minutes on average to get through. After a vendor and technology change, the agency got the average wait down to 12.8 minutes before beneficiaries could get an answer, O’Malley said.
The Social Security Administration on Monday reported that it had gotten those wait times down even further, to eight minutes. But O’Malley said it appears to have simply changed the definition of “answer.”
“‘Answer’ would appear to be anytime a person calls and hangs up after hearing a recording, or calls and gets run around the barn three times by a chatbot and has their call dumped,” he said. “That’s what they call ‘answered.’ That’s what they call ‘served.’ None of it bears any reality to what people are experiencing.” 
A call Wednesday to the Social Security Administration’s Georgesville Road field office in Columbus appeared to produce such a result. A caller was asked by a chatbot why he was calling. When he said he wanted to check his eligibility, the chatbot hung up.
O’Malley also said the Social Security Administration under Trump is ducking basic questions about who’s working there and what they’re doing.
For their part, the offices of Ohio’s U.S. senators didn’t respond to a question asking about staffing levels. O’Malley said that’s because the administration has put itself in a bind.
“Out of one side of their mouths they applaud themselves for getting rid of 7,000 people and yet, they won’t share the data in terms of what that means for workloads,” he said.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)LaRonna Lassiter Saunders launched a petition earlier this year in Topeka urging city attorney Amanda Stanley and Shawnee County District Attorney Mike Kagay to resign. Half of that wish came true when Stanley announced her resignation, effective Sept. 6.
“One down,” Lassiter Saunders said in an email. “Kagay needs to be next.”
Lassiter Saunders has co-represented the family of Taylor Lowery, a Topeka man killed by Topeka police in 2022. Since seeing bodycam footage last year, she’s stood resolute in demanding Kagay resign.
This entire episode — the inaccurate press releases, the speedy exoneration of the officers and the attempts to hide the video — illustrates how police can ignore transparency, commandeer narratives, and avoid accountability.
We wouldn’t know the truth had the video not been released. That should concern us. It calls into question every frame of withheld footage, every line of coached testimony, and the contents of every nondisclosure agreement. If this sounds unfair, it’s because we’re conditioned to believe public servants can decide when transparency is appropriate.
Citizens asserting their right to know isn’t the issue. It’s the lack of transparency that fosters doubt.
Lassiter Saunders said Kagay misled the public by presenting screenshots of the video out of sequence.
This action “supported the false narrative that Taylor ran at officers with a knife when he was gunned down,” Lassiter Saunders said. “He also said Taylor had cocaine in his system when the (toxicology) report showed negative for cocaine.”
Emails seeking comment from Kagay went unanswered.
Stanley reportedly has accepted a job away from Topeka. She issued a statement expressing pride in her work and gratitude to her coworkers.
“Public service is a calling,” Stanley said in the statement. “I leave with pride in what we’ve achieved together and with sincere wishes for the City’s continued success.”
Lassiter Saunders said it’s Kagay’s turn.
Press releases and a report by Kagay’s office insisted that Lowery charged police while holding a knife above his head. The video showed Lowery picking up a wrench and backing away from police when he was shot 34 times.
Lassiter Saunders’ petition urging Stanley and Kagay to resign has drawn nearly 400 signatures.
Community activist Danielle Twemlow said via email that Kagay’s behavior wasn’t a misuse of words or an incomplete rendering. Twemlow said he went to great lengths to hide misconduct.  Kagay, Twemlow said, thought the case would evaporate, but a judge allowed the footage to be released, and the narrative began to crumble.
“They watched him bleed to death before ever approaching him for assistance,” Twemlow said. “They admitted he had a wrench, not a knife, but lied to Lowery’s family when they arrived on scene. Kagay knew all of this. Instead of doing what he is sworn to do, he lied.”
Glenda Overstreet Vaughn, a former head of the state NAACP, welcomed news of Stanley’s resignation. But she also insisted Kagay also step down.
“Seeing the city attorney step down was like a Godsend sign of righteous justice for families that have been too long injured by the misdeeds of those who sit in such positions as the city attorney and district attorney,” she said in an email.
People hoped Kagay would uphold the integrity of the office, she said.
“Yet he eroded public trust when he blatantly lied, withheld videos showing true evidence, and then aligned with organizations of privilege, in essence doubling down on his wrongness,” she said. “He will realize there is power in the faith of the people.”
Overstreet Vaughn argued earlier this year that Kagay willfully misinterpreted the video out of absolute confidence the video never would go public.
“It’s very evident that they will do anything to try to hide the things they’ve done wrong,” she said in a previous interview.
Overstreet Vaughn said the community no longer could take Kagay at his word.
“How do we know how many times this has happened before?” she asked.
Lassiter Saunders said Kagay’s behavior demands investigation: “We need a full review of his conduct and sentence recommendations and his eventual resignation from office.”
Even if that happened, we’d need more than a new nameplate on the district attorney’s office door. We’d need a transparency open house where we open windows and air the place air out.

Alongside providing our shelter, homes are where we make memories with friends and family — where bonds are formed and strengthened.
Unfortunately, the right to a home in America is under threat. Rents have skyrocketed, homelessness is rising, and home ownership is increasingly unattainable for most Americans.
There are multiple causes, but one culprit stands out: classic Wall Street greed. Massive private equity corporations and hedge funds are buying up homes by the thousands — houses, apartment buildings, and mobile home parks alike — and then jacking up rents.
This trend accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis, when investment firms snatched up homes in foreclosure and began renting them to the growing number of people locked out of ownership.
The result? An epidemic of corporate slumlords.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
According to a recent study, nearly a fifth of all homes sold in the first quarter of 2024 were purchased by investment firms — including over a quarter of low-priced homes that might have been affordable to working people.
With their vast wealth, these companies are able to easily outbid real people, often paying a premium to buy properties before they even hit the market. This reduces supply — and encourages developers to sell at higher prices that only Wall Street can afford. Once a firm owns a property, they rent it out at an inflated, algorithm-fixed price, further driving up costs for working people.
Take Blackstone. The trillion dollar private equity giant owns over 300,000 U.S. residential units, making it the largest corporate landlord in the world. The company has hiked rents in its properties by as much as 64 percent over just two years. While Blackstone’s tenants often can’t make rent, CEO Stephen Schwarzman now enjoys a net worth north of $50 billion.
I’ve seen the impacts of Wall Street’s assault on our homes firsthand.
According to a Georgia State study, my hometown of Atlanta has the highest concentration of Wall Street-owned single family homes in the country. In the past 15 years, mega-corporations have purchased over 70,000 homes in Atlanta, accounting for over 30 percent of all single family rental properties in the city. In some districts, as much as 99.6 percent of the market is owned by corporate investors!
As a result, longtime residents have been pushed out, housing costs have soared, and inequality has multiplied. For me and many of my friends, the idea of owning a home in the city we grew up in feels less realistic every day — an unfortunate truth across countless towns and cities in America.
That includes Cleveland, where nearly 24 percent of homes have now been purchased by investors.
As a fundamental need, housing should be a right for all people and families — not an investment commodity for the ultra-rich. In the short term, rent control and increased tenant protections could ease people’s pain in this corporate-controlled housing market.
In the longer term, there’s an alternative that would allow us all to have the homes we deserve: social housing.
Social housing refers to housing developed by non-corporate entities like non-profits or local, state, or federal governments. Social housing is permanently and truly affordable, controlled democratically by its community, and never resold for profit. There are a variety of models, but they all share one key component: they exist outside the for-profit housing market.
Cities and states can take the lead in developing their own social housing, like what’s happening in Seattle after a citizen-driven referendum. There, a tax on rich corporations will fund a city-owned social housing developer — a great model for cities across the country.
Housing should be a source of safety and joy for everyone — not yet another source of profit for the ultra wealthy. By rejecting corporate home ownership and supporting social housing, we can build a world where that’s the case.

When California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled his plan to retaliate if Republican-led Texas redrew its congressional districts to favor the GOP, he affirmed his support for less partisan maps — and then promised to “meet fire with fire.”
“We’re doing it mindful that we want to model better behavior,” Newsom told reporters in Los Angeles earlier this month, nodding to the independent system his state currently uses to draw districts. “ … But we cannot unilaterally disarm. We can’t stand back and watch this democracy disappear.”
President Donald Trump’s call for Republicans to redraw U.S. House districts so the party can win more seats in the 2026 midterm elections — to gerrymander them — has triggered a redistricting frenzy this summer that also threatens to prompt moves by Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and New York, among others. Ohio was already set to redraw its lines, even before the current fracas.

The battle for partisan advantage is placing Democratic politicians, advocates of less partisan maps and others who support curbs on gerrymandering in an uncomfortable position, pitting their desire for change against fears that Trump will take advantage of their scruples to wring more GOP seats out of a handful of key states. Some say they accept that Democratic states need to respond, while others warn retaliation will only yield short-term gains.
The Texas House passed a new map on Wednesday, clearing the way for a final vote in the state Senate and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature. In California, lawmakers passed their own map on Thursday, setting up a statewide vote in November over the new districts.
Other states are now likely to follow, as Republicans and Democrats scramble for a political leg up.










I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard.


– David Daley, senior fellow at FairVote


But gerrymandering opponents say the current moment has the potential to produce new energy for their movement. More people are paying attention to gerrymandering, they say, and new polls show the public opposes the practice. The rush to redraw maps demonstrates the need for Congress to set national limits, they say.
“I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard,” said David Daley, an author of books on gerrymandering and a senior fellow at FairVote, a Maryland-based nonpartisan group that supports ranked choice voting and multimember House districts to end the practice. “We will never have reform if a handful of states can act on their own.”
At the same time, some gerrymandering opponents fear states will unravel hard-fought victories. They wonder whether temporary measures, such as California potentially setting aside the independent commission it uses to redraw maps, could become permanent.
 ‘An unprecedented time’

State legislatures exercise primary control over congressional redistricting in 39 states, according to All About Redistricting, a compendium of information on map-drawing hosted by Loyola Law School in California. While some states use other methods, only nine states rely on independent commissions, which typically limit participation by elected officials and are favored by many gerrymandering opponents.
Most states draw maps once a decade after the census, making the mid-decade maneuvers and counter-maneuvers highly unusual (six states currently have only one representative, eliminating the need to draw district lines). But just a few seats could determine who controls the U.S. House. Republicans currently hold 219 seats to Democrats’ 212, with four vacancies.
“We affirm that gerrymandering, both racial and political, disenfranchises voters,” Virginia Kase Solomón, president and CEO of Common Cause, an organization that has long advocated for changes to the redistricting process, said during a press call the day before Newsom’s announcement.
“But this is an unprecedented time of political upheaval,” she said. People don’t want to see a situation develop where maps are redrawn every two years, she added.
Texas House Republicans propose new congressional map to increase GOP seats

The new Texas map could ease the path for Republicans to win an additional five seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Texas lawmakers rapidly advanced the redraw this week once Democratic state lawmakers returned to the state. They had traveled to other states to deny Texas House leaders the quorum required to approve the map, but returned after Newsom outlined California’s response.
Gerrymandering typically involves “packing” and “cracking.” “Packing” refers to the concentration of opposition party voters in a small number of districts to reduce competition elsewhere. “Cracking” means diluting the voting power of the opposing party’s supporters across many districts.
Texas Republicans have been frank that they are pursuing the redraw for partisan advantage. But they emphasize that no prohibition exists, in Texas or nationally, against mid-decade redistricting and that a 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision cleared the way for states to draw maps for partisan purposes, removing the power of federal courts to police political gerrymandering.
The new maps give Republicans a chance of winning additional districts but doesn’t guarantee victories, they add.
“The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance,” Texas state Rep. Todd Hunter, a Republican who carried the bill in the Texas House, said during floor debate on Wednesday. He added a short time later: “According to the U.S. Supreme Court, you can use political performance, and that is what we’ve done.”
 Tricky terrain

As Texas moves forward and California prepares to respond, Common Cause illustrates the tricky terrain anti-gerrymandering advocates are now navigating.
The group, headquartered in Washington, D.C., fought to enact the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2008. But earlier this month, Common Cause declined to condemn California’s retaliation, saying it will judge the effort by whether the maps are a proportional response to gerrymanders in other states, whether the process includes meaningful public participation, and whether the maps expire and are replaced after the 2030 census through the state’s regular redistricting process, among other criteria.
Newsom’s proposal, the Election Rigging Response Act, will ask California voters in November to temporarily set aside the state’s redistricting commission and approve the new map drawn by the legislature. The commission would resume drawing maps following the census.
Why congressional redistricting is blowing up across the US this summer

Recent polling shows widespread public opposition to gerrymandering. A YouGov poll of 1,116 Americans conducted in early August found 69% believe it should be illegal to draw districts in a way that makes it harder for members of a particular political party to elect their preferred candidates. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The number of Americans who say gerrymandering is a big problem has jumped in recent years. In the YouGov poll, 75% of respondents said it is a major problem when districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party, up from 66% in a 2022 survey.
Some California Republicans have responded to Newsom’s proposal by defending the commission system. A group of Republicans sued in state court to block the plan, but the California Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a request to temporarily halt the effort.
 ‘Is this bad for reform?’

While members of the public might say they favor citizen-led commissions, they may not care deeply about the issue, said David Hopkins, a political science professor at Boston College who has written on polarization in American politics. He called gerrymandering a “classic process subject” that comes off as “inside baseball” to many people.
“The legislators in states that haven’t adopted commissions clearly don’t feel any particular political pressure to do so,” Hopkins said.
Some Republicans in states weighing a mid-decade gerrymander also discount the risk of a public backlash.
In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe may call a special session this fall to redraw the state’s map in hopes of gaining an additional GOP seat in the U.S. House. James Harris, a Missouri Republican consultant with close ties to GOP officials in the state, said he wasn’t concerned redistricting would create momentum to change the process.
Missouri voters in recent years have approved ballot measures favored by Democrats, including one in 2018 that empowered a nonpartisan demographer to draw state legislative districts, though not congressional districts. But Republicans led a successful campaign to convince voters to repeal the changes two years later.
Harris painted any new potential map as part of a national effort to help Trump — who received 58.5% of the vote in Missouri last November.
“I think the lens is wanting to make sure the president has a majority in Congress so he can actually govern for the last two years versus two years of investigations, gridlock,” Harris said.
Advocates of less partisan maps said lawmakers aren’t likely to surrender their own role in mapmaking. While some state courts may limit redistricting excesses, federal courts stopped policing partisan gerrymandering following the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision. And the high court may soon weaken the judiciary’s power to block race-based gerrymandering.
Samuel Wang, director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which supports eliminating partisan gerrymandering, said the “one good thing” about the redistricting battle is that it’s prompted voters to pay attention to an arcane and technical issue. That could be a positive in the long run, he said, “if people can keep a cool head.”
Wang has written online that any response to Texas should remain measured and proportionate. California offers Democrats the only clean option to strike back, Wang wrote. Five Democratic seats could be added by redrawing the state.
“Is this bad for reform? I mean, I’m torn,” Wang told Stateline. “Because on the other hand, Democrats have been, over the last few decades, vocal in their advocacy for voting rights in various forms and now that advocacy is in question because they find a need to fight fire with fire.”
“So I guess the way I would characterize it is if they can hold it in check and not do it in every single state and just engage in whatever they’re doing where it will make a difference,” he said, “then we might not lose all the progress that’s been made.”

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)Here’s an idea: If you believe our elections are rigged — and that we should do something extreme and inane such as abolish mail-in ballots and voting machines — step over to your local county election office and sign up to work. See for yourself. Put some experience where that conspiratorial narrative is.
You’ll learn plenty about our election process, not the least of which is that rigging, perverting or stealing a single vote requires an inordinate amount of planning, subterfuge and sophistication few voters have. The math on such malfeasance — in person or by mail— is undeniable, too. 
Voter fraud incidents remain infinitestably small.
You will also discern that rigging, perverting or stealing a general election in the United States via mail-in ballots or voting machines is virtually impossible — even if conspiracists insist mules are involved, foreign countries are feverishly rewriting lines of voting machine code and non-citizens are casting ballots from prison camps in our backyard. 
No. If you want to rig, pervert or steal an election, your best bet is drawing nonsensical maps or employing a racial calculus to gerrymander your state into illegible knots, ligatures bent on choking off the way we choose our leaders and essentially conduct our democracy: With the power of the vote. For details see Texas and the ensuing redistricting arms race response in California. 
The same thinking has been applied in Nebraska during debates to end our way of determining Electoral College votes, shorthand for eliminating the “blue dot.”
Between gigs as an op-ed writer, I worked at the Hall County Election Office during an election season, not because I doubted the fidelity of our process but rather to be part of a civic duty from the other side. 
I stuffed envelopes, keyed in voter data, helped sign up new registrants and, on election night, was part of a well-oiled machine, I sorted, counted, and tallied the results. I worked with the professionals who ran the office and the citizens like me who came aboard in the run up to and on the night of the main event.
Signing up to work elections would also make you part of the solution to a growing problem: The lack of election workers. Nationwide the turnover rate for election workers has hovered around a third since 2020. Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen says the state will need about 9,000 workers to run polling sites and keep county election offices efficient and effective. He told the Nebraska Examiner that he would like to add young people to a workforce often populated by retired people.
Of course, one reason poll workers are leaving and election offices are becoming short staffed started in 2020, when some workers were harassed and threatened by those who chose to believe the election for the White House was stolen. The Justice Department had to create the Election Threats Task Force in 2021 to deal with the boors and bad actors who get their jollies menacing others based on lies.
Conspiracy theory hyperbole aside, as is true with individual votes, the evidence that the country’s elections are free, fair and safe is overwhelming.
Yet, here we are, facing calls to do away with mail-in ballots and join the current gerrymandering mess in Texas in attempts to diminish the power of voting through disenfranchisement or redistricting. The president — without evidence and in direct opposition to the Constitution — is promising to lead a “movement,” using an executive order to rid our remarkably secure and efficient elections of mail-in ballots and voting machines.
Of course, a president has no such authority. The Constitution’s Election Clause gives election responsibility solely to the states and assigns to Congress the duty of federal oversight. 
Nevertheless, we are hearing the drumbeat to remove a process that began in earnest during the Civil War when it became known as casting an “absentee ballot.” The idea of giving military men and women the chance to vote while deployed has been a staple of our elections since World War I. 
Eight states — California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Vermont — have exclusively mail-in voting. In Nebraska, 11 rural counties have all-mail voting, and, on average, voter turnout in those counties increased 16% from 2016 to 2020 when the switch was made. Mail-in ballots also reduce the need for poll workers at voting precincts.
Doing away with mail-in ballots and voting machines solves no problem because none exists. If, however, those changes came to pass, we would have some serious ones on our hands.

Brandon Beach. Some Fulton County voters hoping to beat election day lines have already stopped by the Alpharetta Branch Library to cast their votes. Amber Roldan/Georgia RecorderSeven candidates are vying to replace former state Sen. Brandon Beach as the lawmaker representing a northern Atlanta suburban district in the Georgia Senate. Early voting concluded Friday in the district, which covers much of Cherokee County and extends into north Fulton County, and just under 12,000 voters have already cast a ballot for a turnout rate of 8% in early voting.
Election day is Tuesday, and polls will open again at 7 a.m. If one candidate does not secure more than 50% of the vote, a runoff is on the books for Sept. 23.
Beach resigned earlier this year, leaving his seat vacant. His resignation came after a March appointment from President Donald Trump to become the 46th U.S. Treasurer. Prior to this appointment, the Alpharetta Republican held onto his seat in the Senate for 13 years. 
Beach has been a consistent Trump ally – including by backing false conspiracies that the 2020 election had been rigged. The conservative suburban and rural district sent him back to the state Capitol with large margins of victory. In 2024, he won more than 70% of the vote against a Democratic challenger.
While Democrats are hoping to flip the seat, GOP voters feel optimistic about retaining party control with six Republicans on the ballot.
“I’m a Republican, so I’d like to see a Republican fill Brandon Beach’s shoes, and there were several to choose from,” said Fulton County early voter Lynna Lee after casting a ballot at the Alpharetta library.
Democrats have placed their faith in Alpharetta mom, attorney and small business owner, Debra Shigley. As the only Democratic candidate in the race, Shigley is fighting to overturn a long standing precedent in the red district.
“(When) hoping to flip a Republican-held seat, the best opportunity is to have only one candidate, because it’s a jungle general election where the candidates from both parties are listed on the ballot,” said Melita Easters, executive director of Georgia WIN List.
Georgia WIN List, a political action committee focused on electing Democratic women who support reproductive rights, has officially endorsed Shigley. Easters believes that Shigley will stand out against the “stale, pale, male” Republicans also fighting for a spot in the Senate.
“You’ve got these five men over here yelling, ‘I’m more MAGA than the other guys’, and they’re all spouting the same message,” Easters said.
Stephanie Donegan is the only Republican woman running in the district, and her campaign remains rooted in conservative values.
The party in power typically faces a backlash after a presidential election. Democrats are hoping frustration with GOP leaders at the state and federal levels could depress Republican turnout while invigorating Democrats to vote. Flipping a seat in a staunchly conservative district would be a major publicity win for a state party that has spent decades in the minority.
Gabrielle Smith, a Democratic voter, cast her ballot in Alpharetta during the second week of early voting. Smith said she was “concerned about the way things are going in the country” and hopes that her vote for Shigley could help make a difference.
“I think that a woman’s voice is needed,” Smith said. “I think that in a red state, a blue voice is needed. I think that somebody who isn’t trading on fear and hate is needed. Honestly, that’s why I voted for her.”
Democrats hope that having a single candidate in the race will work to their advantage, but Republicans are not convinced that the strategy will prove successful. Kennesaw State University professor of political science and former Cobb County Republican Party Chair Jason Shepherd said he thinks that it could be hard for Democrats to walk away with a victory. 
Shepherd predicts Shigley could be a third place finisher in the “overwhelmingly Republican” district and that there will be a September runoff between Tuesday’s top two Republican vote-getters. 
“If by some reason the Democrats do win it, then the Republicans need to be very nervous about these midterm elections,” Shepherd said. “And the person who should be most nervous is (Lt. Gov.) Burt Jones, who has Trump’s endorsement.”
Jones is a Republican running for governor next year who has heavily touted his early endorsement from the president. Right now, his top rival on the GOP side is Attorney General Chris Carr. 
Despite signs some voters are excited to use their voice at the ballot box this month, low turnout is expected to continue tomorrow.
“Voting is important, and I think the local people can impact your life a lot, in addition to the people in Washington, D.C.,” Lee said. “I think that since I get the opportunity to vote, especially as women we’ve had people fight for us to vote, that I should execute that.”

OK, the observance is in October, but it’s always Banned Books Week in Florida. Every day seems to bring another hissy fit from a state goon or “concerned” parent hell-bent on returning us to the glory days of censorship.
Hillsborough County School Superintendent Van Ayres has been attacked by parents and shouted at by state government for failing to remove materials chest-thumping Attorney General James Uthmeier claims are “pornographic“ from school libraries.
Ayres already had two books — ”Call Me By Your Name,” a gay romance with some sex scenes, and “Jack of Hearts (and Other Parts),” which has no sex scenes — taken off the shelves.
That was not enough for Uthmeier and some of the school board’s more hysterical members. So, in an abundance of caution, Ayres had 600 more removed from schools for a “review,” estimated to cost $350,000.
It was not enough: During a June school board meeting, one member called many surviving books “nasty and disgusting,” and another, obviously in need of smelling salts, said, “I, as a 56-year-old woman, mother of five and a physician, can’t look at these pages.”
She wants heads to roll: “Have you considered firing all your media specialists and starting from scratch with women and men who can read, or have a single shred of decency? These people that you trust to review these materials are abusing the children of your county. They’re child abusers.”
Here are some of those child-abusing materials: “The Diary of Anne Frank,” “What Girls Are Made Of,” “The Bluest Eye,” “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,” “Slaughterhouse Five,” and “The Handmaid’s Tale.”
Women and men who can — and do — read will know the authors of those books include a Booker Prize winner, a National Book Award winner, winner of a Presidential Medal of Freedom, and a Nobel Prize laureate.
Obviously, a bunch of perverts and losers.
‘Overbroad and unconstitutional’
The good news is that some at that ambush of a meeting objected to the objections.
One parent said it was not the state’s responsibility to decide what books her kid should have access to, it was hers: “Don’t tell me that it’s inappropriate if I think it’s appropriate for my child to read.”
The chair of the school board also took exception to the abuse heaped on school librarians (annoyingly now called “media specialists”) who are, in fact, experts in “age-appropriate” materials.
The even better news is that a federal judge has struck down the worst parts of Gov. Ron DeSantis’ pet book-banning law as “overbroad and unconstitutional.”
A gaggle of big publishers including Simon and Schuster, Hachette, HarperCollins, Penguin Random House, plus a bunch of well-known authors and hacked-off parents, sued over the state’s vague decree that if a text “describes sexual conduct” it’s “pornographic.”
U.S. District Judge Carlos Mendoza, probably trying hard not to roll his eyes, pointed out the state can’t seem to define what they mean by “sexual conduct”: Consensual intercourse? A kiss? A rape? A seductive conversation? A hand sliding down (or up) to touch certain body parts which may or may not be named? Joyous marital congress?
The state’s arguments boiled down to:

If a parent or random Moms for Liberty busybody think something is obscene and therefore an assault on the Moral Fiber of Our Youth, it is, even if they can’t quite get specific about what that means. They know obscenity when they see it, by golly.
Books in public school libraries should promote “government speech,” i.e., the views espoused by the DeSantis regime.

Views such as, say, gays are not good; trans people are worse; sex outside of marriage is terrible; authority should not be questioned; climate change should not be studied.
Legal fees
According the state, “When the government speaks, it ‘can freely select the views that it wants to express, including choosing not to speak and speaking through the removal of speech that the government disapproves.”
According to DeSantis’ lawyers, school books are “not subject to the First Amendment.”
You thought free speech was protected in the Free State of Florida?
In 2023, PEN America file a lawsuit against the Escambia County School District for removing or restricting access to books some people found objectionable.
Escambia keeps losing in court, but that hasn’t stopped them from continuing to spend taxpayer money: at least $440,000. So far.
To make an obvious point, think about the field trips and school supplies that cash could have funded.
What’s all this book banning really about, anyway?
Authoritarianism for authoritarianism’s sake? That’s probably part of it.
Bullies love to bully.
Does it spring from deeply held religious notions of “purity” which hold that any exposure to what some people see as “immoral” words or images will pollute the minds of innocent children?
Y’all might remember the embarrassing kerfluffle at a Tallahassee charter school over showing students one of the great achievements of Western art.
The teacher leading a unit on the Renaissance had the temerity to display a picture of Michelangelo’s statue of David.
Some parents freaked out: You could see David’s junk!
As if half the planet does not sport similar junk.
Consider “And Tango Makes Three,” the famous true story of two male penguins raising a chick at New York’s Central Park Zoo.
That book has been snatched off library shelves all over Florida because, well, maybe because it could encourage tolerance toward flightless birds?
Fear factor
The banners seem to think stories with a gay hero or a trans character will turn kids gay or trans.
These people do not assume stories with gun violence will turn kids into mass shooters.
But books telling the truth about Native American genocide and slavery will make kids question the essential virtue of America.
Biographies of Malcolm X or Martin Luther King or novels by Ralph Ellison or Alice Walker will make white kids feel guilty.
It’s true the Left has been known to criticize certain books — ”The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” and “To Kill a Mockingbird,” for racist language, or “Lolita” for its depiction of pedophilia — but rarely demand they be deep-sixed altogether.
Still, nobody can take away the Right’s title as the undisputed heavyweight champs of the book banning world.
Here’s the real reason for MAGA animosity to books: Fear.
They are scared of an America where white is not the default ethnicity, Christianity is not the dominant religion, heterosexuality is only one kind of “normal,” and history is a complicated tangle of high ideals and low crimes.
They cannot bear the thought their children will grow up in the 21st Century when all they cherished as solid and eternal can be questioned, even discarded.
So, they fight for control.
Until March of this year, a website called “BookLooks,” founded by a member of Moms for Liberty, touted a ratings system for books it deemed unsuitable for decent eyeballs.
BookLooks has shut down, saying that “after much prayer and reflection it has become apparent that His work for us here is complete and that He has other callings for us.”
However, the ratings system is still all over the Web, with “0″ (no sex, no swearing, no nudity, no booze or drugs), to “4″ denoting a text with “depictions of sexual organs in a state of arousal” plus oral sex of every kind.
Level 5, “Aberrant Content,” means stuff so filthy (“sadomasochistic abuse, assault, and ‘beastiality’” (sic) it’d burn the retinas of a saint.
‘Book of Books’
Take a look at the Moms’ “Book of Books,” a document that is at once alarming, absurd, and not a little prurient.
It quotes carefully curated and utterly out of context scenes of sex and sexual assault from Toni Morrison’s “The Bluest Eye” or Yaa Gyaasi’s “Homegoing.” (Newsflash: in a novel about slavery, you’re pretty much going to encounter sexual assault.)
They react with horror at novels about kids coming to terms with being gay, such as “The Perks of Being a Wallflower.”
They declare books dangerous for supposedly promoting “alternative gender ideologies.”
The “Book of Books” also lavishly shares sex act image after sex act image from graphic novels including “The Handmaid’s Tale” and Maia Kobabe’s “Gender Queer.”
That stuff is, admittedly, pretty raw, even hard to look at.
However, you can’t help wondering why they couldn’t have done with just two or three explicit pictures — and whether the compilers were getting a naughty thrill out of the whole thing.
We expect the Moms and their ilk to freak out over sex of any flavor, but even more of their ire has been directed at references to race, which they label “controversial social commentary” or just “hate.”
They don’t mean “hate” as in scenes of racist violence or oppression of people of color.
They mean people of color daring to expose or criticize or otherwise express strong disapproval of racism.
‘Nasty white folks’
Adding to the many transgressions of “The Bluest Eye,” they point to this sentence: “Nasty white folks is about the nastiest things they is.”
In Angie Thomas’ “The Hate U Give” the Moms clutch their pearls at: “A sixteen-year-old black boy is dead because a white cop killed him. What else could it be?”
Sherman Alexie’s “The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian” raises alarm for this: “Our white dentist believed that Indians only felt half as much pain as white people did, so he only gave us half the Novocain.”
This nonsense would be hilarious if it weren’t driving public education policy in Florida.
Those who want to ban or suppress books are closing the barn door after the horse has bolted and is now in the next town, sitting in a bar drinking a Mai Tai.
They’re also exposing themselves as the frightened creatures they are.
The bans will continue: Escambia County has removed another 400-plus books from its libraries without reviewing a single one.
The lawsuits will continue.
And the 21st century will continue, despite the state of Florida trying its best to drag us back to the 19th.

Despite over a decade of reaching record donor and transplant numbers in the U.S. each year, the need remains high. August is National Multiethnic Donor Awareness Month, a time to call attention to the improvement and innovation needed to meet the needs of those waiting. 
There are three aspects of donation where we can drive change: trust, technology and training. Increase trust in the system, improve technology, and expand training for the next generation of clinicians. Through intentional work in these three focus areas, we can expand access to life-saving transplants for everyone.


Building public trust in organ donation
The success of organ donation depends on one thing above all: public trust. Families say “yes” to donation often as they grieve the loss of a loved one, the most difficult moment of their lives. The decision to authorize donation must be rooted in confidence that the system is empathetic, ethical, fair, and accountable. To strengthen trust in the field of organ donation, we must address the concerns and dispel the myths that many in the community hold about donation. 
It’s important to keep in mind the following facts: 

Medical professionals are trained to work their hardest to keep their patients healthy and alive, no matter their organ donor status. 
Hospital staff and organ procurement specialists keep donor-patient safety and the donor family at the center of their work.
Organ donation comes at no financial cost to the donor family. 
The wealthy and famous do not get preference on the national transplant waitlist. Wealth is not a factor. The computerized waitlist considers factors such as medical urgency, geographic proximity to the donor, and organ compatibility.

Dispelling myths like these helps instill trust not just for those considering donor registration but for those waiting for a transplant. Every patient, regardless of zip code, sex, race or ethnicity, should know the system strives to provide each of them an equal chance of receiving a transplant based on medical urgency, time waiting, biological matching and other factors that work to increase the chances of a successful transplant.
Building trust requires not only better informing the public but also building transparent communication that emphasizes humanity at the center of the donation process.
Needed technology improvements in the organ donation process
Technology has undoubtedly revolutionized medicine and organ transplantation. We now have tools, such as organ perfusion technology, which can keep donated kidneys, hearts, lungs, and livers viable for hours or days outside the donor’s body. That means organs that once may have gone unused can now save lives. The technology not only preserves the organ for a longer period of time, but in many cases can improve the organ’s function while on the perfusion machine. 
As Senior Director of Multicultural Community Outreach at New England Donor Services (NEDS), Connecticut’s leading organ procurement organization, I’ve witnessed the close work NEDS does with innovators developing devices that expand transplant opportunities to better meet the needs of the donation and transplant community. These collaborations have allowed for the creation, testing and deployment of devices that expand transplant opportunities for organs that previously would have gone unused.
In addition to technology that helps preserve organs, the potential for an AI-driven matching system for the transplant waitlist that can better predict which organs will do well in which patients would be a valuable development. This would cut down on the many hours spent finding a home for every recovered organ while at the same time reducing complications and improving transplant outcomes. Such AI tools are currently being developed to improve efficacy and effectiveness of organ allocation. 
Training the next generation of transplant professionals
Organ donation and transplantation is one of the most complex, high-stakes areas of medicine. It requires not only technical skills but compassion and resilience. Yet for many medical students, the field may remain an afterthought and may not be introduced at all. 
Expanding the pipeline of trained transplant and donation professionals are needed to maintain and expand our nation’s capacity for more transplants. At NEDS, we recently celebrated the graduation of our inaugural class of seven medical school students from our Galen V. Henderson, MD Program. The program is an eight-week immersive experience for medical students in New England to raise awareness about the role of organ donation and transplantation in healthcare, help students better understand the full scope of the transplant journey and learn about potential career paths in organ donation and transplantation. 
Increasing trust, leveraging technology, and training new donation and transplant professionals are necessary, life-saving imperatives. While the U.S. transplant system improves each year, with increasing donors and transplants for 14 years in a row, the success can only continue if we identify and confront roadblocks. By committing to improvement and innovation in these three target areas, we can reach a place where every patient awaiting a transplant has a chance at receiving the organ they need.

The Willow Creek fire prompts evacuation of a few homes in Star Valley; The Dollar Lake Fire near Green River Lakes could burn into October.
The post Western Wyoming fires spur evacuations, close highway, backcountry appeared first on WyoFile .","As the Dollar Lake Fire near Green River Lakes burned thousands of acres of dense timber over the weekend, the Willow Creek forest fire erupted at the south end of Star Valley and forced people from their homes.
One Hundred forty-one firefighters are fighting the blazes on the Bridger-Teton National Forest. There have been no official reports of lost structures or homes.
The Star Valley Willow Creek Fire was first reported Friday and swelled to almost 4,000 acres by Sunday. As it licked the asphalt of U.S. 89 — a scenic byway between Wyoming and Idaho — on Saturday night, it forced an hours-long closure of the route, creating a backup a couple of miles long.
State Sen. Dan Dockstader, who owns the Star Valley Independent, witnessed a standoff at the highway’s Salt River Pass on Saturday night. Firefighters kept the blaze at bay there, stopping it from crossing from the west side of the highway to the east.
“Some would explode in orange, some would explode in white light.” Dan Dockstader
“I got up there [at] the same time the thing was exploding, blowing up,” Dockstader said. He photographed trees torching.
“When they go, there’s that deep sound,” he said. “All of a sudden ‘whoosh’ and an explosion. Some would explode in orange, some would explode in white light.
“It was doing its own weather picture up on top … mini tornados,” he said of the nighttime scene on the pass. “It was burning at leisure and fast.”
Firefighters held the blaze at the highway.
“Hotshots lined up on both sides – watched throughout the night,” he said. “Big embers would float over the top of the highway. Those guys were on it.”
Closures, evacuations
Bridger-Teton Supervisor Chad Hudson closed portions of the national forest area around the pass, also known as South End Pass, and published a map of the restriction. Emergency managers also issued an evacuation notice for an area south of Smoot.
A shelter opened for displaced residents at a National Guard facility in Star Valley, Dockstader said, but wasn’t really needed.
“Star Valley is a very well-connected community,” he said. “People reach out and take care.”

A teacher brought ice cream from Shumway Farms for the firefighters, Dockstader said. Sunday, he visited two churches.
“Prayers in both places were to bless the firefighters,” Dockstader said. 
“Rain has subdued the fire this afternoon,” he said Sunday, although it’s uncertain whether it was the result of the supplication. “Even hail accumulation in some areas.”
At the Dollar Lake Fire north of Pinedale, the Sierra Front/Nevada Team 5 estimated the blaze, which was first reported Thursday, to be almost 10,000 acres Sunday. It forced the evacuation of Green River Lakes campground and rural outposts within a five-mile radius of Dollar Lake.
The fire team ordered overnight flights Sunday to map the blaze and expects to have updated acreage Monday. Meanwhile, there’s a lot of logistical work going on.
“We’re setting up a camping site for the firefighters, yurts for the incident management team to work out of,” said Tammy Boyd, spokesperson for the Sierra Front/Nevada Team 5. The group is marshalling other facilities including kitchens, toilets and showers.
Supervisor Hudson also closed a large area of national forest south and west of the big bend of the Green River above the community of Kendall. The causes of both fires are under investigation
“The dense lodgepole with dead and down 1000-hour fuels (3- to 8-inch diameter timber) produced extreme fire behavior, sustained crown runs, and spotting with long-range running,” firefighters reported. Steep slopes and prevailing winds will carry the blaze, they said.
“The dead and down lodgepole will be in alignment with winds and topography,” according to an assessment.
Although the fire is burning toward the wilderness, an outfitter’s camp, the Green River Lakes elk feedground’s hay sheds and cabins, the Green River Lakes campground and the Green River Lake Lodge are all in its path.
Fire managers estimated containment on Oct. 15. They will host a community meeting at 6 p.m. Tuesday in the Sublette County Library.

(Photo by Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado House of Representatives on Sunday passed a bill that would use state money to fund Medicaid reimbursements for reproductive health care providers, namely Planned Parenthood, that have recently faced federal funding cuts.
Senate Bill 25B-2 was approved in a party-line 43-19 vote, with Democrats in favor. It passed the Senate on Friday, during the ongoing special legislative session that is focused on raising revenue to soften the impact of recent changes to the federal tax code. The bill now goes to Gov. Jared Polis’ desk for his signature.
The bill was proposed in the wake of President Donald Trump signing the federal Republican tax break and spending cut law, dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, in July. That law prohibited Planned Parenthood from receiving federal Medicaid funds, including for services like sexually transmitted disease screenings and HIV-related treatments. Federal law already bars federal Medicaid money from funding most abortion services.

SB-2 forces the state to step in. It would require the Department of Health Care Policy and Financing, which administers the state’s Medicaid program, to use state funds to reimburse health care providers that are prohibited from receiving federal Medicaid reimbursements.
Jack Teter, the vice president of government affairs for Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, said 991 appointments had to be canceled in the days after the federal law went into effect. The provision in the law that affects Planned Parenthood has been paused while a challenge to it moves through federal courts. But PPRM’s operations are now in limbo, Teter said.
“We are in the midst of a health care access disaster that began (when the federal law) was signed,” Teter said.
The bill’s fiscal notes estimates it would cost Colorado a maximum of $4.4 million during the current fiscal year, which began on July 1.
Rep. Brandi Bradley, a Littleton Republican, called for lawmakers to vote down the bill during initial debate on the bill on Saturday afternoon. She spoke for about 30 minutes against abortion services and Planned Parenthood, and also argued that due to the state budget gap it would be unfair to spend money on Planned Parenthood.
“It’s weird how that works,” Bradley said. “We (the Republicans) can’t have any fiscal notes, but wow, $4.4 million on this bad boy right here.”
Boulder resident Lilly Boyd, a single mother of three children, spoke to the Senate Health and Human Services Committee in favor of the bill on Thursday. Boyd, who is enrolled in Medicaid, said a follow-up appointment she had scheduled with PPRM after receiving a medication abortion was canceled in July due to the recent federal law. Days later, Boyd experienced hemorrhaging and had to go to the emergency room, she said. 
“You’ve heard that ensuring patients on Medicaid can return to Planned Parenthood is a matter of life and death,” Boyd said. “Please know this is not an exaggeration. For many people, myself included, that was the reality we faced following Planned Parenthood being kicked out of the federal Medicaid program.”
More than 150 PPRM volunteers and reproductive rights advocates have come to the Capitol to support the bill over the course of the special session, according to Teter. 
“Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains is an essential, irreplaceable piece of Colorado’s primary and reproductive health care system,” said Sen. Jeff Bridges, a Greenwood Village Democrat and one of the bill’s sponsors.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The American Southwest – including Arizona, New Mexico, and portions of Nevada, Colorado, Utah and California – is linked to one of four continental-scale “mega-drying” regions worldwide that have undergone unprecedented rates of drying, according to a recent study in Science Advances.
The loss of freshwater from the regions is the result of two key factors: severe droughts and groundwater overuse.
Two decades of satellite observations revealed that as the dry areas of the world become drier and surface water in rivers and lakes declines, communities are becoming more reliant on groundwater, leading to rapid depletion of freshwater.

The lower Colorado River Basin – which supplies water for Nevada, Arizona, and California – has lost groundwater equivalent to Lake Mead’s full storage capacity in the last 20 years, or about 28 million acre-feet of water. An acre-foot of water is enough to supply roughly two urban households with indoor and outdoor water needs for a year.
“All the drying is happening in the Southwest. Three quarters of the country is getting a little bit wetter, but the southwestern quadrant of the country is getting a lot drier,” said Jay Fagmiglietti, the study co-author and Global Futures Professor at Arizona State’s School of Sustainability.
Even areas in the U.S. that are experiencing more precipitation are not keeping pace with the rate of rapid drying, leading to a net loss of freshwater, according to the study. The areas experiencing drying have increased, while the areas experiencing wetting have decreased.
Globally, drying land is expanding by about two times the size of California every year, according to the study.
The four “mega drying” regions globally are Alaska and Northern Canada, Northern Russia, Middle East/North Africa/PanEurasia, and Southwestern North America and Central America.
The research is especially noteworthy for Nevada, where about half the state’s counties rely on groundwater for more than 80% of their water supply, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. In 2015 Esmeralda, Eureka, Lincoln, Mineral and Nye counties received more than 95% of their water from groundwater.
  Mega-drying on the continents: 1 Northern Canada and Alaska; 2. Northern Russia; 3. Southwestern North America and Central America; 4. Middle East/North Africa/PanEurasia. (Map from “Unprecedented continental drying, shrinking freshwater availability, and increasing land contributions to sea level rise,” Science Advances, July, 2025)
Throughout several parts of Nevada, significantly more groundwater is extracted than is returned to aquifers each year, leading to declining water levels. About 20% of Nevada’s groundwater basins are currently over-pumped, according to the Nevada Division of Water Resources.
Despite the state’s dependence on groundwater, Nevada lacks detailed data on available groundwater. Water managers in Nevada currently rely on water budget estimates developed 50 to 70 years ago, raising major concerns about the accuracy of groundwater availability, according to the Nevada state agency.
The consequences of groundwater depletion in the Southwest include reduced irrigation water supply and threats to agricultural productivity, reduced capacity for climate adaptation, and damage to groundwater dependent ecosystems.
Most of Nevada’s rivers, streams, and lakes are groundwater dependent. Groundwater also plays a crucial role in supporting the state’s unique ecosystems. There are 242 wetland-dependent species recorded by Nevada Division of Natural Heritage – 143 of which can only be found in Nevada.
A growing awareness of ground water as a critical natural resource has raised several research questions: How much ground water do we have? Are we running out? Where are ground-water resources most stressed by human development?
Fagmiglietti said the study was conceived to answer some of those questions and prepare water managers for a drier future.
About 75% of the world’s population lives in the 101 countries that make up the four mega-drying regions, according to the study.
Researchers used satellites to measure changes in gravity to detect weight loss or gain in regions, indicating groundwater depletion or prolonged drought.
The research team said global drying is not slowing down. Their data indicates groundwater was lost three times faster over the last decade than in the prior one.
The loss of groundwater is also contributing more to global sea level rise than melting glaciers and ice caps, according to the study. Increased runoff from groundwater pumping and glacier melting contributes to the ocean’s water levels, exacerbating sea level rise.
“Drying continents themselves are now contributing, they’re the largest contributor to sea level rise, ahead of either the Greenland or the Antarctic ice sheet,” Fagmiglietti said.
“We pump groundwater for irrigation. And a lot of that, you know, doesn’t make it back into the ground. It evaporates, or it runs off, and ultimately ends up in the ocean,” he said.
The study also points to a tipping point during the “mega El-Niño” years around 2014 to 2015 when equatorial waters in the Pacific were 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius above average. During that period climate extremes began to accelerate, leading to more groundwater usage to cover the lack of rainfall.
Fagmiglietti emphasized the critical importance of groundwater in drying regions and the need for better management and protection. Groundwater is often unprotected and unmonitored, Fagmiglietti said, making it at risk in many regions around the world. States need to recognize the importance of groundwater and enforce effective management policies.
“Communities that depend on groundwater entirely, again, need to understand that that groundwater is disappearing rapidly. They need to understand what their supply looks like and need to prioritize how they’re going to use it and try to sustain it,” he said.
Last week, federal officials announced they would continue water allocation cuts on the Colorado River for the fifth consecutive year following a persistent drought that has shrunken Lake Mead, the river’s largest reservoir. Persistent drought like the one impacting the reservoir will only put more pressure on groundwater, said Fagmiglietti.
“No one ever talks about the groundwater, especially when it comes to the Colorado River. Discussion is always about the reservoirs and the river itself, but really thinking holistically about how much water you have in the region is really, really important, and in particular with the increased stress that will happen on groundwater,” Fagmiglietti said.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Summer heat is bearing down on U.S. prisons, where temperatures in uncooled cells can climb well into the triple digits.
Facing growing pressure from advocacy groups, lawsuits and climate projections that show hotter days ahead, some state prison systems are moving to install air conditioning and expand cooling measures — though many facilities remain years away from significant upgrades.
But in other states, such efforts have stalled or failed. That may lead to more lawsuits in the future, experts say, even as judges may raise the bar for such cases.
An emphasis on being “tough on crime” and prioritizing other public safety measures may have contributed to less attention on prison conditions in some states. In others, slowing revenue growth and pressure to rein in corrections spending could be making new investments a harder sell.
At least two states this year, Virginia and Texas, considered legislation addressing excessive heat in prisons but neither measure became law. The Texas bill would have required the state Department of Criminal Justice to purchase and install climate control systems in all of its facilities by the end of 2032. About two-thirds of the state’s correctional facilities have only partial or no air conditioning.
The measure passed the House but did not advance in the Senate before the legislature adjourned in June.
In Virginia, lawmakers approved a bill that would have required the state corrections department to install heat and air conditioning in its prisons and to ensure cell temperatures not exceed 80 degrees. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed it, citing the cost of installation and operational burdens. Youngkin also wrote that existing state corrections data “does not substantiate the claims of extreme temperatures or health risks.”
But in Delaware, the fiscal year 2026 capital budget approved last month includes $2 million in funding to install air conditioning at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center.
These changes mark the latest actions in a long-running debate over how correctional systems respond to rising summer temperatures — an issue that affects both incarcerated people and staff. Some of the policy debates and facility updates this year follow years of advocacy and litigation over the health, safety and operational challenges posed by heat in correctional settings.
The problem of excessive heat in prisons has persisted for decades and has unfolded alongside other challenges, including chronic understaffing and overcrowding. In some cases, these problems have led to extended facility lockdowns, even during the summer months.
“There are people working in prisons and they have the right to work in climates that are comfortable,” said Nancy La Vigne, a criminal justice researcher and dean of the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University. “When they’re not, there’s retention issues, and it’s hard to replace staff. And when you don’t replace staff, then you have challenges in maintaining the safety and security of the facility.”
In New York, for example, correctional officers staged a three-week strike earlier this year and many didn’t return to work. Some facilities now are operating with 30%-60% fewer guards than needed, resulting in some incarcerated people getting only an hour or two outside of their cells each day.
A 2023 study published in the peer-reviewed PLOS One journal found that mortality in state and private prisons rose during periods of extreme heat, with deaths increasing 3.5% on extreme heat days and up to 7.4% during three-day heat waves. Between 2001 and 2019, nearly 13,000 people died in prison during the summer months, almost half of them in the South, though the study did not determine how many of those deaths were directly attributable to heat.
Climate change is fueling longer, more intense periods of extreme heat. Exposure to extreme heat can worsen conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and asthma, and has also been linked to worsening mental health and higher suicide rates among incarcerated people.
“Average temperatures are rising, and you’re going to have more and more states around the country where incarcerated people are held in conditions that are not livable because they’re too hot,” said Sharon Dolovich, a law professor and director of the Prison Law and Policy Program at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Some upgrades
At least 44 states lack universal air conditioning within their prison facilities, even in regions known for sweltering summer temperatures, according to a 2022 USA Today analysis. A recent Reuters investigation also found that nearly half of state prisons across 29 states have partial or no air conditioning in housing units.
But some states are investing millions to update their prison facilities.
In North Carolina, corrections officials are working toward their goal of installing air conditioning in all 54 state prisons by 2026. To date, 33 facilities are fully air-conditioned, 17 are partially air-conditioned, and four have no air conditioning, according to its dashboard.
In California, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, which operates 31 adult prisons, has spent $246 million in the past five years on cooling improvements at five prisons, according to a department spokesperson.
Lawmakers this year also approved funding for the Air Cooling Pilot Program at three facilities, with $17.6 million allocated for fiscal years 2025-26 and $20 million for fiscal years 2026-27. It will evaluate the effectiveness of two alternatives prior to a statewide plan to address high indoor temperatures across the California prison system.
The Texas Department of Criminal Justice, as of Aug. 1, is building 12,827 “cool beds,” or prison cells in air-conditioned units, and is in the process of procuring an additional 7,162, according to its dashboard.
Texas is one of the states most closely associated with heat-related deaths in prison. A 2022 study estimated that, on average, 14 deaths per year in Texas prisons are associated with heat. And a Texas Tribune analysis found that at least 41 incarcerated people died during a record-breaking heat wave in 2023.
In March, a federal judge ruled the extreme heat in Texas prisons is “plainly unconstitutional,” but declined to order immediate air conditioning, saying the work could not be completed within the court order’s 90-day window and temporary systems might delay a permanent fix.
‘More miserable’
Sweltering summer heat can turn prisons into pressure cookers. People inside already may have health conditions, limited access to cooling, or take medications that make it harder for their bodies to handle the heat. And research suggests that high temperatures can heighten irritability and aggression, sometimes fueling more conflicts between incarcerated people or with staff.
“It makes you more miserable. … If you to the point of even thinking about suicide, that’s just going to add to it,” said Ronald McKeithen, who spent 37 years incarcerated in Alabama prisons and is now the director of second chances at the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice. McKeithen recalls feeling “on edge” due to tension among other incarcerated people on hot days.
At the Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin, Devin Skrzypchak said the heat worsens his bladder condition, and he often can’t get the incontinence briefs he needs. The heat forces him to drink more water, and on days when ice isn’t available, he’s left drenched in sweat.
“At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating,” Skrzypchak wrote in a message to Stateline through the facility’s messaging platform.










At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating.


– Devin Skrzypchak, who is incarcerated at Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin


D’Angelo Lee Komanekin — who has spent about 25 years in and out of different Wisconsin corrections facilities — said prison architecture plays a major role in why temperatures inside climb so high.
“The planet is getting hotter and hotter,” said Komanekin, who relies on a small plastic fan to stay cool. Komanekin also is incarcerated at the Oshkosh Correctional Institution. “They’re doing nothing about the architecture. Some institutions’ windows open, some don’t, but most of the doors have steel doors with trap doors.”
Older prison designs that rely heavily on steel and concrete building materials often trap heat, making it difficult to keep temperatures down in the summer. Aging facilities also are less likely to be equipped for the installation of central air conditioning.
Some state prison systems, including Alabama’s and Wisconsin’s, are adding air-conditioning or air-tempering systems to new prison construction and major renovation projects.
Future legal battles
Legal experts say the issue of excessive heat in prisons is likely to become more pressing as climate change drives longer and hotter summers.
Extreme heat in correctional facilities has already been the subject of litigation in dozens of states, with plaintiffs arguing that high temperatures constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Court rulings in these cases have varied, but some experts say even more lawsuits are likely if facilities do not adapt.
“The conditions are going to worsen. [Incarcerated people are] going to be looking for every possible avenue for assistance they can,” Dolovich, the UCLA law professor, told Stateline.
One of the latest cases comes from Missouri, where the nonprofit law firm MacArthur Justice Center filed a class-action lawsuit in May on behalf of six incarcerated people at Algoa Correctional Center.
The lawsuit alleges that the conditions violate their constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment. It seeks to require the Missouri Department of Corrections to work with experts to develop a heat mitigation plan that keeps housing unit temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees. If the department cannot meet that standard, the plaintiffs are asking for the release of three of the incarcerated people who have less than a year remaining on their sentences.
Lawsuits such as the Missouri case often focus on claims that extreme heat worsens existing medical problems. To proceed, they must meet two legal requirements: proving the heat poses a serious health or safety risk, and showing prison officials knew about the danger but failed to address it, according to Dolovich, whose work has focused on the Eighth Amendment and prison conditions.
Courts may also raise the bar for proving such claims if judges echo decisions in cases with similar Eight Amendment arguments related to the death penalty and homelessness, Dolovich said. Judges have shifted, she said, toward a “superadding terror, pain and disgrace” standard under the Eighth Amendment — a higher threshold requiring proof that conditions were created with the intent to cause unnecessary suffering.
Dolovich added that some recent court decisions have provided only narrow remedies, such as ordering ice and fans instead of installing air conditioning.
“Prison officials have a moral and a constitutional responsibility to respond to changing conditions. In this case, it means air conditioning. … Anything less than that, to me, is indefensible.” she said.

(Photo by Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado Legislature is meeting in a special session to address a nearly $800 million hole in the state budget. Work began on Thursday morning and is expected to last through the weekend.
After Republicans in Congress passed the federal tax cut and spending bill in July, Colorado’s estimated tax revenue collections shrunk by about $1.2 billion for the current fiscal year, which began July 1. Most of that is a loss of corporate income taxes.
Colorado has to have a balanced state budget, so lawmakers must figure out a way to get backed to a balanced bottom line. The Democratic majority in both chambers, alongside Gov. Jared Polis, plan to do that by dipping into the state’s reserves, cutting program spending and passing an array of tax laws to eliminate some deductions and loopholes.
In his call for the special session, Polis also allowed bills on health insurance premiums and artificial intelligence regulations. A controversial AI law is set to go into effect next February and it has been a longtime goal of Polis and moderates to tweak it before then.
Legislative action is live-streamed and archived on the General Assembly’s website.

Lawmakers change funding source for health insurance bill in special session


By: Sara Wilson - Sunday August 24, 2025 12:46 pm





Lawmakers now want to sell additional tax credits instead of borrowing from the state’s unclaimed property fund to shore up the Health Insurance Affordability Enterprise fund, which pays for programs to reduce individual insurance market premiums.
House Bill 25B-1006 aims to raise $100 million for that enterprise to soften the impact of the expiration of federal enhanced premium tax credits. Health insurance premiums for people who buy it on the individual market are expected to face an average of a 28% increase next year, with higher increases along the Western Slope.
HIAE funds the state’s reinsurance for claims from high-cost individuals, subsidies for carriers on the state’s Health Insurance Exchange and the state’s OmniSalud program for undocumented people.
It is possible Congress will extend or partially restore the federal enhanced premium tax credit in question, in which case the loan considered in the bill wouldn’t happen.
The bill originally planned to borrow money from the state’s Unclaimed Property Trust Fund. That is how it passed the House, but the funding mechanism was amended in the Senate Finance Committee on Sunday morning.
“We worked with the treasurer’s office to do this, broadening the pool to make sure we’re not
The state’s treasury department would tap a third-party vendor to sell the tax credits to insurance companies and C corporations during this fiscal year. The credits would allow companies to essentially get a discount on future tax liabilities to the tune of 80 cents on the dollar — the department could sell up to $100 million in credits that would then have a face value of $125 million.
“This $100 million is going to have a meaningful impact on folks,” Colorado Insurance Commissioner Michael Conway told lawmakers on Sunday morning. “But it’s not going to replace everything at the federal level. It’s not even close.”
The bill would give the Legislature some time and breathing room to come up with a “sustainable solution,” Conway said.
It is a similar strategy to another bill on the table this special session to raise revenue for the state’s General Fund.
The Legislature also allowed the treasury department to sell tax credits to fund loans for small businesses in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
HB25B-1006 now needs to get through the Senate Appropriations Committee.

House Democrats use chamber rule to end lengthy debate on tax bills


By: Sara Wilson -  3:46 pm





House Democrats used a seldom-used chamber rule to prevent debate on four of the bills after Republicans spoke at length about the first pair of bills. They used House Rule 16 to call the question — end debate and immediately vote on the bill in question — as debate on the second bill on the agenda extended past an hour.
Before that, Rep. Sean Camacho, a Denver Democrat, accused Republicans of filibustering.
“If every member on this side of the room,” he said, motioning to the Republican caucus, “uses your full allotted 10 minutes to filibuster on bills instead of doing the people’s work, that costs the state $283.” He was referring to the extra cost of operating the Colorado Capitol during a special legislative session.
The remark drew anger from Republicans.
“I will not let them be accused of wasting the people’s time when they are telling the story of their district,” Assistant Minority Leader Ty Winter, a Trinidad Republican, said.
“Don’t make our fighting four our constituents to be a cheap trick,” he said.
Democratic leadership then used Rule 16 on the next four bills, and they all passed. Members are typically allotted ten minutes each ahead of the final vote on a bill, meaning that if all 21 Republicans used their time, debate would be over three hours per bill.
The House is now doing initial debate and votes on the five bills that made it through committee yesterday. Democratic leadership limited floor debate to one hour per bill.









Colorado Legislature begins third day of special session


By: Sara Wilson -  12:27 pm





The House began work on the third day of the special legislative session around 10 a.m. on Saturday morning. The plan is do final votes on a series of tax-related bills and send them over to the Senate for consideration.
Their first vote, after about two hours of debate, was a 43-19 approval of House Bill 25B-1001, which would make permanent an add-back for federal qualified business income deduction on state taxes.
In federal law, some businesses can deduct up to 20% of their QBI for their taxes. It was set to expire this year, but the recent federal tax and spending law extended that tax deduction. The bill would continue to decouple Colorado from the deduction, so taxpayers making above $500,000 individually or $1,000,000 jointly would need to add back that federal deduction for their state taxes.
Republicans argued that the federal deduction is important for small business owners in the state.
“This bill removes a key deduction passed in federal law. It’s a deduction designed to level the playing field between large corporations and small businesses,” Rep. Brandi Bradley, a Littleton Republican, said.
But bill sponsor Rep. Emily Sirota, a Denver Democrat, countered that the bill just maintains the status quo in Colorado tax code.
“They still get this benefit at the federal level. In this bill, we’re not making tax policy change. We are simply extending our current tax policy,” she said.
The bill’s fiscal note estimates it will raise about $46 million in the current fiscal year and about $95 million in the next one.
The House has five more bills on its calendar for final votes today. It will likely then head into initial debate on the bills cleared through committee yesterday.









Amended AI bill proposes to delay implementation of 2024 law


By: Sara Wilson - Friday August 22, 2025 5:36 pm





House Bill 25B-1008, one of the dueling artificial intelligence bills introduced by Colorado lawmakers during the special session, was gutted during its House Appropriations Committee hearing on Friday afternoon to become a simple extension of the controversial 2024 law’s effective date.
The bill would now push implementation of Senate Bill 24-205 until October 2026, rather than February 2026. The change was approved on an 8-3 bipartisan vote and now heads to the full House for debate.
“That’s where we are, so that we as a Legislature can come back to this issue and have a proper discussion when have time during a session. Doing this during a special session is quite difficult,” Rep. William Lindstedt, a Broomfield Democrat, said. “I’m asking that we move out the date so we can do this responsibly during the next session.”

Colorado Democrats want to raise revenue for food assistance program during special session


By: Sara Wilson -  4:00 pm





Colorado voters could be asked this November whether the state can keep extra tax money to fully fund universal school meals and offset lost federal funding for food assistance programs.
The Legislature referred Proposition MM to the ballot during its regular lawmaking session earlier this year, seeking to raise more money for the Healthy School Meals for All program. Senate Bill 25B-3, being considered during the current special session, would tweak that proposition to allow any leftover money to cover costs associated with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.

Senate ends work for the day as House sets slugglish pace for bill debate


By: Sara Wilson -  3:55 pm





As of mid-afternoon on Friday, the Senate had adjourned and the House broke into committee work after moving through just two bills in floor debate.
Senate Bill 25B-4, the artificial intelligence bill from Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez, was originally scheduled for its appropriations committee hearing, but that is now delayed as sponsors work through possible amendments.  The bill has an approximate $7 million annual price tag to retain more employees in the Office of Information and Technology and Judicial Department.
The Senate will continue work on Saturday.
The other AI bill, favored by moderates and the governor, is set for its own appropriations committee hearing in the House later on Friday afternoon.
The House got through two bills for initial floor debate and voice votes in four hours. The chamber recessed around 2 p.m. for committee work, including for those four bills passed in the Senate on Friday morning.

Senate gives initial OK to 4 bills on first day of special session


By: Sara Wilson - Thursday August 21, 2025 9:03 pm





By the end of Thursday, the Colorado Legislature made it through the bulk of their committee work for the special session and the Senate gave its initial approval to four bills. Tomorrow morning, the Senate will have formal votes on those bills and the House will begin floor debate on its own set of bills.
The bills the Senate considered on second reading were:

Senate Bill 25B-1: This bill sets a process for the governor to notify and consult with the Joint Budget Committee on mid-year spending cuts needed to overcome a revenue shortfall, like the ones he is poised to do soon after this special session. The governor would be able to suspend and cut state funding, and therefore need to meet with the JBC, if the reserve needs to be tapped by up to 2% of the General Fund budget, or if that reserve is projected to dip below $1 billion.
Senate Bill 25B-2: This would allow the state to pay for Medicaid services from organizations that provide reproductive health care, namely Planned Parenthood, that the federal government has withheld Medicaid money from.
Senate Bill 25B-3: This changes a referred ballot measure in November to ask voters if the state can use extra money collected for universal school meals to also cover costs related to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Senate Bill 25B-5: This bill would reallocate about $260,000 from the wolf reintroduction program to the state health insurance fund. It was amended in committee to still allow the capture and release of wolves this winter.

The Senate still needs to take up Senate Bill 25B-4, the artificial intelligence bill focused on transparency and disclosure. That bill, backed by progressive lawmakers and consumer advocates, would require notification when people interact with AI and allow people to request information about how AI influences important decisions related to things like employment or school admissions. It awaits a hearing in the Appropriations Committee.
Over in the House, committees gave approval to the series of Democrat-backed tax policies. The chamber will start debate on them tomorrow. Those were:

House Bill 25B-1001: This would permanently extend a requirement that high-income taxpayers add back their qualified business income federal tax deductions when calculating their Colorado taxable income.
House Bill 25B-1002: This bill would expand the list of countries that the state considers to be tax havens.
House Bill 25B-1003: This would repeal a tax incentive for insurance companies that have at least 2.5% of their domestic employees in Colorado.
House Bill 25B-1004: This would allow qualifying companies to pay certain state taxes early at a discount.
House Bill 25B-1005: This bill would repeal a provision in state law that allows retailers to keep 4% of their sales tax collections, as a way for the businesses to cover the cost of collecting the taxes.

A House committee also signed off on House Bill 25B-1006, which would loan $100 million from the Unclaimed Property Trust Fund to prevent major health insurance premium increases.
House Bill 25B-1008, the dueling AI bill, also cleared its committee even with some Democrats voting against it. That bill would require companies to tell consumers when they are interacting with AI and fold the technology into the state’s existing anti-discrimination and consumer-protection laws. Bill sponsors removed a provisions that would have only allowed the attorney general, not consumers, from suing developers and deployers that violate consumer-protection laws.
Both HB25-1008 and HB25B-1006 need to pass the Appropriations Committee.
Democrats, who make up a majority in both chambers, also killed Republican-backed bills in committee on Thursday. The entire House State, Civic, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee agenda, for example, was made of Republican bills that died.

Lawmakers back off plan to pause Colorado’s wolf reintroduction program


By: Chase Woodruff -  5:16 pm





Colorado lawmakers gave initial approval Thursday to a bill to redirect a small amount of state money from gray wolf restoration efforts to a health insurance affordability fund, but stopped short of requiring Colorado Parks and Wildlife to pause the capture and release of new wolves this winter.
With the Legislature convened for a special session to cope with a billion-dollar revenue shortfall triggered by changes to the federal tax code, Senate Bill 25B-5 would withhold $264,268 from the state’s general fund previously appropriated for wolf reintroduction. The money would instead be directed to the state’s Health Insurance Affordability Enterprise, which helps subsidize health coverage costs and faces an estimated shortfall of around $100 million after Congress failed to extend federal tax credits for insurance premiums.

Republican-backed artificial intelligence bills killed in committee


By: Sara Wilson -  4:13 pm





Both Republican-backed bills on artificial intelligence died on the first day of the special legislative session, as Senate Bill 25B-8 and House Bill 25B-1009 did not make it through their respective committees.
“Because of the pace of the special session, I did not have the time I needed to refine the language for the standard our small businesses deserve,” Rep. Ron Weinberg, a Loveland Republican, told the House Business Affairs and Labor Committee before he asked members to vote against his bill.
His bill would have narrowed the definition of “consequential decision” in the state’s forthcoming artificial intelligence law to include decisions related to employment or public safety. The Senate bill, backed by Republican Sen. Mark Baisley of Woodland Park, would have broadly prohibited discrimination using any technology.
Lawmakers are considering changes to the state’s artificial intelligence law, which was passed in 2024 and is set to go into effect next February, at the behest of Gov. Jared Polis. The technology business community worry about implementation of the law, which sets rules for companies that use AI in their decision making, while consumer rights advocates say the law it gives necessary guardrails for technology that can inform life-changing decisions.
The Legislature will likely debate and vote on two competing AI-related bills backed by Democrats. Legislation from the sponsors of the 2024, Senate Bill 25B-4, law would strip the law to become essentially a disclosure policy. The other bill, House Bill 25B-1008, would extend existing civil rights laws and consumer protections to AI and require notice if a consumer is interacting with AI in some circumstances.
The Senate bill passed its committee earlier this afternoon. The House bill’s committee hearing was ongoing as of 4:15 p.m. on Thursday.









Colorado Senate committee approves bill to fund Medicaid reimbursements for abortion providers

The Colorado Senate Health and Human Services committee on Thursday approved a bill to use state money to fund Medicaid reimbursements for reproductive health care providers that have recently faced federal funding cuts.
Senate Bill 25B-2  passed the committee on a party-line vote, with Democrats in favor. The bill was introduced because of the “enormously negative impact” of the federal Republican domestic policy law on Coloradans seeking abortion services and other reproductive health care, bill sponsor Sen. Jeff Bridges, a Greenwood Village Democrat, said. The law, which President Donald Trump signed in July, blocks certain abortion providers from receiving Medicaid funding.
The bill would require the Department of Health Care Policy and Financing to use state funds to reimburse health care providers that are prohibited from receiving federal Medicaid reimbursements. The non-partisan Legislative Council Staff estimates the bill would cost the state a maximum of $4.4 million during the current fiscal year, which began on July 1.
Jack Teter, the vice president of government affairs for Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, said 991 appointments had to be canceled in the days after the federal law went into effect. Planned Parenthood’s operations are now in limbo, Teter said, while challenges to the law’s provision affecting abortion providers move through federal courts.
“We can’t keep canceling people’s appointments and then trying to bring them back again,” Teter said. “It’s not sustainable and it’s not fair to our patients. This bill allows the state to cover the difference for the Medicaid reimbursements and ensures we don’t have to close our doors to those patients.”
During the committee hearing, dozens of Planned Parenthood volunteers and reproductive rights advocates sat in the audience, wearing pink clothing and showing their support for the bill. Teter said PPRM expects more than 150 supporters of the bill to come to the Capitol throughout the special session as the bill moves through the Legislature.
“We sent out a call to action to our incredible activists across the state, and people are showing up,” Teter said. “It’s awesome.”

Special session on Colorado budget woes gets underway

The Colorado House and Senate gaveled in for the special session shortly after 10 a.m. After some procedural business, the chambers recessed to start committee work for the first introduced bills.
Earlier this morning, the caucuses laid out their priorities in separate press conferences.
“We’ve got our work cut out for us. We’re back to address a $1 billion budget shortfall thanks to Trump and Republicans in Congress — $1 billion that should be invested in Colorado, for Colorado, but instead is for tax breaks for corporations and the ultra wealthy,” Senate President James Coleman, a Denver Democrat, said.
The Republicans were less optimistic.
“When we walk away from this session, the Democrats will have increased taxes. The Democrats will have done nothing to cut General Fund spending — that’s the $700 million we’re in the red — and the Democrats will not have rebalanced the state’s budget,” Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, a Brighton Republican, said.
In addition to finding solutions to that revenue shortfall, Gov. Jared Polis tasked lawmakers with addressing health insurance premium costs, tweaking the state’s artificial intelligence law and shoring up food assistance program funding.
Committee work will begin around 11:30 a.m.

[…],"A member of the National Guard arrives at the Guard’s headquarters at the D.C. Armory on Tuesday, Aug. 12, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Gov. Henry McMaster has deployed 200 S.C. National Guard troops to Washington D.C. to “restore law and order” even though South Carolina itself has one of the highest murder rates in the nation.
McMaster and state leaders should deal seriously with South Carolina’s own longstanding violent crime issues before they try to solve Washington’s problems.
And there’s no need to deploy the S.C. National Guard. Just deploy common sense.
The S.C. Guard’s mission in Washington is a bad idea. National Guard units are not trained to police American streets.
The state-based Guard has two main duties: responding to natural disasters and mobilizing, when needed, in time of war, according to the guard’s website.
The guard assists local and state authorities in disasters such as hurricanes, floods and wildfires. The guard also plays a role in search and rescue operations, and in riot control. And it can be called up if the country is at war.
It’s certainly true that the guard has been used for other purposes — such as the 250 South Carolina guard troops currently at the southern border — but the question remains whether guard troops are qualified to be street police. Using them as police risks blurring the line between military and civilian authority.
Most Americans, like the Founding Fathers, are wary of a militaristic intervention on U.S. soil in peacetime. Local Washington D.C. officials, of course, did not request military support and appear to have been completely ignored. This undermines democratic governance and home rule in a city that already lacks full statehood representation.
Local officials and residents argue that the troops are a response to a manufactured crisis, with some residents reporting that they feel unsafe.
South Carolina Democrats are right also that the state shouldn’t send out our National Guard troops when they might be needed here during hurricane season.
At best, sending the S.C. Guard to Washington is a waste of resources; at worst, it poses a danger to residents of the district and our own guard troops.
South Carolina should butt out of this misguided crusade in Washington.
We’ve got plenty of crime problems right here at home, including the eighth-highest murder rate in the nation, when including Washington, D.C., at 11.3 homicides per 100,000 people in South Carolina. In overall violent crime, South Carolina ranked ninth in 2023.
The first duty
The homicide rate has fallen nationwide and in South Carolina over the past few years — a hopeful trend.
But it remains near-historic highs.
McMaster said he deployed the troops to Washington to “restore law and order” and “ensure safety for all who live, work, and visit there,” according to reporting by S.C. Daily Gazette Editor Seanna Adcox.
Those are fine sentiments from McMaster, but a governor’s first duty is to protect the citizens of his own state.
In recent years, at least four South Carolina counties — Dillion, Lee, Allendale and Hampton counties — exceeded Washington’s 2024 murder rate, according to the state Department of Public Health.
These counties and all of South Carolina’s counties don’t need militaristic intervention but rather sustained support and partnership.
It begins with listening to South Carolina law enforcement. Advocates have expressed alarm over “historic staffing shortages” in South Carolina law enforcement. Helping police departments and sheriff’s office reach a full-staffing level would be a vital step in reducing violent crime.
Instead of cutting taxes every year, McMaster and state lawmakers should invest in more funding not only for local law enforcement but also for mental health and substance abuse programs.
State leaders also need to focus on South Carolina’s notorious gun violence problem.
Firearms account for more than 80% of homicides in South Carolina.
A lot can be done to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. One study based on 25 years of evidence found that states with universal background checks had homicide rates 15% lower than states without them.
South Carolina also needs safe storage laws and meaningful red flag laws.
Red flag laws, also known as extreme risk protection order laws, allow courts to temporarily remove firearms from individuals deemed a threat to themselves or others. Attempts to introduce red flag laws in South Carolina have so far failed.
State lawmakers also should finally close the so-called “Charleston loophole” that allowed Dylann Roof to purchase a gun that he used to murder nine worshipers at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in 2015.
A comprehensive 2019 study from Boston University found that “universal background checks, permit requirements, ‘may issue’ laws (where local authorities have discretion in approving who can carry a concealed weapon), and laws banning people convicted of violent misdemeanors from possessing firearms are, individually and collectively, significantly able to reduce gun-related deaths.”
Sending National Guard troops to Washington makes for eye-catching political theater but reducing South Carolina’s high violent crime rate requires something far more challenging: a serious and sustained commitment by principled state leaders to proven anti-crime solutions.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/nationalguarddc-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-24 13:56:31.990495

Photograph by John Partipilo/  Tennessee Lookout ©2025NASHVILLE —The Trump administration may deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he rejected a last-minute deal to remain in jail, plead guilty to human smuggling charges and be deported to Costa Rica, a legal notice filed Saturday by his attorneys said.
The behind-the-scenes ultimatum bolsters claims that Abrego is the target of “selective and vindictive prosecution” by the government after he contested his wrongful deportation to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador prison in March, Abrego’s lawyers wrote.
Abrego was released Friday to await trial in January on human smuggling charges in Tennessee and returned to Maryland, where the sheet metal apprentice lives with his wife and children. His wrongful deportation to El Salvador in March has brought ongoing scrutiny to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics. Abrego has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.
In a deal offered by the government late Thursday, it promised to deport Abrego to Costa Rica where he could live freely if he remained jailed until Monday, pleaded guilty to the Tennessee human smuggling charges and served the sentence imposed by the court, his attorneys wrote. The government of Costa Rica had agreed to take him, the filing said.
Abrego’s attorneys informed the Acting U.S. Attorney Rob McGuire, who is prosecuting the Tennessee case, they would “of course, communicate the government’s proposal to Mr. Abrego” but declined to agree to a demand that he remain incarcerated until Monday.
Abrego was released shortly after 2 p.m. Friday from a detention facility in Putnam County, Tenn. Within minutes of Abrego’s release, a representative of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, informed his attorneys they intended to deport him to Uganda and ordered him to report to the agency’s field office in Baltimore, his attorneys wrote.
“The only thing that happened between Thursday — Costa Rica — and Friday — Uganda — was Mr. Abrego’s exercise of his legal entitlement to release under the Bail Reform Act and the Fifth Amendment,” his attorneys wrote.
Government officials again, late Friday evening, informed Abrego he has until first thing Monday morning to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica “or else that offer will be off the table forever.”
“There can be only one interpretation of these events: the (Department of Justice) and ICE are using their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat,” Abrego’s attorneys wrote.
Attorneys for Abrego have already filed a motion to dismiss the criminal charges against him, calling the case a clear example of “selective and vindictive prosecution” by the Trump administration in legal filings last week.
The ultimatums offered by the Trump administration serve to underscore Abrego’s allegations that it is acting with vindictiveness towards him, their latest legal filing said.
The Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security “are obviously working in lockstep to coerce Mr. Abrego into accepting a guilty plea in his criminal case, holding over his head the prospect of possible indefinite detention — or worse — in a country halfway across the world,” the attorneys wrote. “It is difficult to imagine a path the government could have taken that would have better emphasized its vindictiveness.”

His ex-wife, afraid for the lives of her family members and herself, said it was a lie.
Montesi’s ex-wife had sought a domestic violence protection order against him, alleging in a court petition that he arrived at her home in a rage one spring day, swinging an ax and threatening to kill her. He warned that she should “think twice before messing with him” because he has a “safe full of guns,” she recalled. 
A court commissioner ordered Montesi to turn his firearms over to the King County Sheriff’s Office. Despite the court order, a judge found that about 13 of his firearms remained unaccounted for — assault rifles, hunting rifles, handguns, a shotgun and an AR-15. 
Instead of surrendering the missing guns, Montesi argued that Washington’s firearm surrender law requiring him to do so violates his Fourth and Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination and unreasonable search and seizure, citing a November 2022 Washington Court of Appeals ruling known as the Flannery decision.
The Flannery decision, which said an earlier version of the state’s firearm surrender law was unconstitutional under the Fourth and Fifth Amendment, has been similarly cited by judges throughout Washington as preventing them from ordering alleged abusers to give up their weapons, court records show.
Now, the barriers created by Flannery could be knocked down. In one of the clearest rulings to date on the constitutionality of Washington’s firearm surrender law in protection order cases, the state Court of Appeals rejected Montesi’s argument, concluding that the law is constitutional. 
While federal law prohibits some alleged domestic abusers from having guns, Washington — along with 21 other states — has gone a step further, requiring judges to order people subject to certain domestic violence protection orders to surrender their firearms to law enforcement. Victim advocates are hopeful that the recent ruling, issued on June 30, will prompt judges to enforce the law. But so far, legislative efforts to do the same have had limited success. 
Even after state lawmakers updated the firearm surrender law in 2021 and again in 2023 with a “Flannery Fix” aimed at resolving Flannery’s self-incrimination concerns, some judicial officers — including all of those in the Pierce County Superior Court — still aren’t issuing firearm surrender orders in domestic violence protection order cases, according to a recent poll of Washington’s 39 superior courts conducted by InvestigateWest. The Cowlitz County Superior Court had not been issuing firearm surrender orders until recently, when some judicial officers began ordering surrenders again on a case by case basis due to the Montesi decision.
“The bench is and will continue to be discussing the Montesi decision,” Cowlitz County Superior Court Administrator Danyel Paul wrote in a statement to InvestigateWest.
Some superior courts, including Adams County and Grays Harbor County, responded that they do issue firearm surrender orders, but sparingly. In Clark County, Presiding Judge Derek Vanderwood said the superior court began issuing the orders again in January — a few months after a Vancouver mother of three, Carissa Larkin, was shot and killed by her ex-fiance. Larkin had obtained a protection order against her abuser, but the court hadn’t ordered him to turn in his guns due to the Flannery decision, The Columbian reported.
Montesi, who declined to comment through his attorney, is now asking the state Supreme Court to hear his case. If the ruling stands, victim advocates, attorneys and legal experts say it would reaffirm an assertion that they’ve been making for years: that the Flannery decision, which centered on a criminal assault case and an outdated state law, should never have been broadly applied to civil protection order cases.
“I think the Flannery decision, there was some room for interpretation about what they meant by it. I think that’s why you saw different trial courts making different decisions,” said King County Superior Court Presiding Judge Ketu Shah. The King County court has continued issuing firearm surrender orders after Flannery. “In other jurisdictions, there’s stronger passion around firearm rights and Second Amendment rights, and so they want to litigate that more and see where the limits are.” 
Shah noted that the Montesi ruling — decided in a civil protection order case — gives courts more direct legal guidance.
“Montesi is pretty clear. It’s right on the point of what these rights are and whether they infringe on those rights. And they found the statute does not infringe on those rights,” he said.
For some attorneys and victim advocates, courts’ decisions not to issue firearm surrender orders seem to have more to do with political will than with upholding the law.
“What it looked like to me that the courts were doing was just saying, ‘Oh, sorry, it’s out of my hands. Flannery prevents me from issuing a weapon surrender,’” said Benjamin Gould, an attorney who represented Montesi’s ex-wife. “You are, in effect, completely ignoring Washington law as passed by the Legislature. And that is very troubling.”
A controversial legal analysis
Ever since the Washington State Legislature unanimously passed a 2014 law to remove guns from the hands of domestic abusers, that law has drawn constitutional challenges. 
The firearm surrender law requires courts to order the relinquishment of guns in certain circumstances, such as when an individual has a domestic violence protection order against them and is believed to be a threat to the protected person or their child’s safety. Judges have discretion in other circumstances, like when there’s evidence that there will likely be a serious and imminent threat to a person’s health and safety without a surrender order.  
One of the first major rulings on the state law’s constitutionality came in 2022. Dwayne Flannery, a Kitsap County man accused of beating and choking his girlfriend, argued that an order to surrender weapons would force him to illegally search his own home for guns and potentially incriminate himself by admitting to having firearms, which he wasn’t allowed to have under a no-contact order. The Court of Appeals agreed with Flannery and dropped the weapons surrender order.
Judges across Washington immediately raised questions about how the Flannery decision would impact civil protection order cases. Unlike no-contact orders, which are issued in criminal matters, civil protection orders are filed by individuals seeking to keep alleged abusers away from them, even if no criminal charges have been filed. To be granted a protection order, victims must only demonstrate that it’s more likely than not that the abuse occurred.
Upon a judge’s request, a team of attorneys at the Washington State Administrative Office of the Courts, which supports judges across the state, sent two memorandums analyzing the Flannery decision to Cowlitz County judges. Although the office says the memos are meant to be confidential and aren’t official guidance for the courts as a whole, the analysis was widely circulated among attorneys and included in a public 2024 State of the Judiciary report. 
The memos concluded Washington’s firearm surrender law likely violates the Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. An immunity provision added to Washington’s firearm surrender law in 2021 likely would not provide “complete protection” from self-incrimination because it only protects against prosecution for certain crimes, the analysis says. It also likened surrender orders to a “warrantless search” under the Fourth Amendment — a characterization that many attorneys representing domestic violence victims disagree with.
“You’re complying with a court order. In this case, the court order says, ‘Go get your guns. You can’t have them.’ But they’re calling that an unlawful search, which is a very creative interpretation,” said Washington state Rep. Lauren Davis, D-Shoreline, who sponsored the 2023 Flannery Fix bill. 
Karla Carlisle, a managing attorney with the Northwest Justice Project, a nonprofit legal aid program in Washington, said constitutional protections against unreasonable searches are aimed at preventing the government from violating a person’s reasonable expectation of privacy — not at individuals who are asked to turn over their firearms to ensure a victim’s safety.
“No search occurs when a trial court grants an order to surrender weapons,” Carlisle argued in a July 2023 appellate court filing. “The orders are served the same way any other legal process is served, and to the extent a respondent locates and surrenders firearms from their own home, there is no governmental intrusion into the privacy of the person’s home.”
Yet following the memos’ release, Carlisle said she saw a “wave across the state” of courts refusing to issue weapon surrender orders.
“Those memos were very damaging because I think they came to trial court judges with the authority and approval from the Administrative Office of the Courts,” she said. “So a lot of judges, I think, took that for face value and didn’t do their own analysis.”

In Cowlitz County, judicial officers started crossing out the weapons surrender section of the protection order and penciling in “State v. Flannery.” A Benton County judge rescinded and terminated a firearm surrender order that had been granted to a domestic violence survivor the year before, citing Flannery.
The Pierce County Superior Court edited its protection order paperwork to remove all firearm surrender language. Now when a person requests a firearm surrender, the court instead gives them a document titled, “Findings on Weapons Surrender.” It informs them that the court is not issuing surrender orders because doing so would “by its very nature” subject the respondent to potential self-incrimination and unreasonable searches and seizures.
To ensure compliance with the law, the Flannery Fix also requires the Administrative Office of the Courts to report annually on the number of firearm surrender orders issued by each court. But the office is still not doing so. A disclaimer on the office’s website explains that because data is unevenly collected across jurisdictions, the office believes that reports “would not accurately convey the reality of enforcement practices across the state.” To address this, the office says it is overhauling the way that it receives and reports protection order data.
Davis said she plans to continue working on legislation to protect domestic violence survivors from gun violence. But there’s only so much that legislators like her can do, she added.
“For the most part, we actually have pretty solid words on paper,” Davis said. “They’re just not being followed.”
The Montesi decision
Attorneys like Carlisle and Gould are hopeful that courts will see the Montesi ruling as limiting the Flannery decision’s application in civil protection order cases. The Pierce and Cowlitz County superior court benches are now reviewing the Montesi decision to determine its impact on firearm surrender orders going forward, according to the courts’ administrators.
Anne Levinson, a retired Washington judge who has helped author several state bills to protect domestic violence survivors, said the decision gives judges a clearer guide than Flannery for how to handle firearm surrender requests in civil cases. 
“The Montesi case is a more current case, more on point for orders that are issued as part of the civil protection order process,” Levinson said. “It can and should be applied by courts across the state.”
In addition to the Fourth and Fifth Amendment issues, the state Court of Appeals also rejected Montesi’s argument that the weapons surrender statute infringes upon Montesi’s right to bear arms. This issue was directly addressed in a June 2024 U.S. Supreme Court decision, United States v. Rahimi, which ruled that a federal law prohibiting people subject to domestic violence restraining orders from possessing firearms is constitutional under the Second Amendment.
Still, it remains to be seen whether the Montesi ruling will clear the path for weapons surrender orders in Washington. Although the ruling affirms that the state law is constitutional, it’s only binding for lower courts in Division I of the Court of Appeals, where the decision took place, according to Shah. This includes King, Snohomish, Skagit, Island, San Juan and Whatcom counties. For counties outside of this division, the ruling can provide guidance for judicial officers but does not necessarily need to be followed, Shah noted. The Flannery decision, meanwhile, took place in Division II, which covers several of the superior courts that had stopped issuing firearm surrender orders, including Pierce, Cowlitz and Clark.
Some legal experts, including Carlisle, dispute this interpretation of Court of Appeals rulings, arguing that appellate court decisions like Montesi are binding for all trial courts throughout the state.
Other similar cases involving firearm surrender orders are also pending before the Court of Appeals. If those decisions conflict with the Montesi decision, that could set up a legal dispute for the Washington Supreme Court to resolve. But for that to happen, the state Supreme Court would first have to agree to hear a case. It has so far declined at least two motions filed by women fleeing their intimate partners — including one by Montesi’s ex-wife — that argued the life-or-death urgency of the issue warrants direct intervention by the high court. 
On July 31, Montesi tried again to put the issue in front of the state Supreme Court, arguing that the appellate court made a mistake by ruling that the Legislature’s Flannery Fix resolves the law’s Fourth and Fifth Amendment violations. The high court has not yet decided whether it will hear the case.
Mary Welch, an attorney and statewide advocacy counsel for the Northwest Justice Project, said that while she’s optimistic about the Montesi ruling, she’s remaining vigilant of how future courts may act. She initially thought that the constitutionality concerns over Washington’s firearm surrender law would be resolved with the U.S. Supreme Court’s Rahimi decision, until judges began using Flannery to justify not issuing the orders.

The conservative comic strip was published in my local paper Aug. 9, ironically the 80th anniversary of America’s cataclysmic A-bomb attack on the Japanese city of Nagasaki in 1945, one of history’s most alarming — and also among the most catastrophic and morally fraught — demonstrations of science’s jaw-dropping, world-transforming power.
The long, excruciatingly detailed path to creating a working atomic bomb included countless small research and development steps — as science requires — any number of which might have been seen by nonscientists as incomprehensible, if not pointless.
Which brings us to the recent “Mallard Fillmore” cartoon’s take on a Duke University study, released this July. The study concluded that caloric intake is a far more significant culprit in obesity than how much energy a person expends, or not, in their daily life.


To which, Mallard said, in effect: duh.
Here’s the cartoon’s text:
“A new study from Duke University has revealed that obesity is closely linked to a poor diet, which is fascinating, because without this study, we might have never known that Duke even had a department of observing the blindingly obvious while accepting hundreds of millions in federal research grants.”
Two phrases in that ’toon text jump out: “a poor diet” and “blindingly obvious.” Note that the Duke study found obesity predominant in advanced nations that enjoy abundant and varied, not “poor,” diets. Also, science is intrinsically skeptical because supposedly “blindingly obvious” truths have been proved staggeringly wrong over millennia, including the Bible’s casual acknowledgement that the Sun revolves around the Earth. Pioneer scientists Nikolas Copernicus and Galileo Galilei (and others) proved irrefutably in the Middle Ages, much to the chagrin of the monolithic Catholic Church, that the opposite is true.
So, a widely popular cartoonist’s ignorant denigration of science in the 21st century is a problem, as was the Catholic Church’s debasement and banishment of Galileo to house arrest for the rest of his life and a prohibition from discussing or teaching his “heliocentric” theory that the Sun sits at the center of the solar system, orbited by all the planets, including Earth. For thousands of years, the learned consensus had been that not only did the Sun orbit Earth, the Earth was the center of the entire universe.
This kind of intellectual suppression born of science-wary ideology is still with us in the modern world. We mustn’t forget, for example, that the president of the United States a few years ago urged Americans to consider injecting bleach as a curative for COVID-19, which was devastating the nation and world at the time. 
Ultimately, about a million Americans died during the pandemic, which was finally blunted not by bleach or other fraudulent, harebrained “treatments” but by miraculously effective vaccines developed by scientists in record time — vaccines now being undermined by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Donald Trump’s vehemently anti-vax U.S. secretary of Health and Human Services. Kennedy, in his first six months on the job and after telling Congress, under oath, that he would not undermine vaccines, removed all vaccine and infectious disease experts from the federal Center for Disease Control’s independent and essential Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Replacements included vaccine deniers.
This is numbskull ideology warring against settled science. Vaccines have saved untold millions of lives worldwide over many decades. Decades of countless respected studies have roundly debunked the vaccine fears of Kennedy and his ilk. The overwhelming conclusion of research is that vaccines are demonstrably safe and also don’t cause autism, another favorite Kennedy bugaboo.
Which brings me back to obesity, Mallard Fillmore, and South Dakota’s relationship with rotundity, and why a comic strip’s unfounded denigration of science about obesity matters. A 2011 study report available in the National Library of Medicine, titled “The obesity epidemic in South Dakota: how big is the problem?” reported that 30.3% of the state’s adults self-reported being obese (based on the body mass index), a rate then “higher than the national prevalence and also increasing at a faster rate than other states.” By 2023, the state’s adult obese population increased more than five points to 36%, making South Dakota tied for the 11th highest rate of obesity in the U.S.
So, Mallard Fillmore aside, we don’t know whether South Dakotans are relatively rotund because they eat too much, move too little, or have chubby genes. Or something else entirely.
But the place to find the answer is nuanced science, not ill-informed, snarky cartoons.

More than a thousand people were expected to seek free dental, medical and vision care at the two-day event in the rural and financially struggling area of western Virginia. RAM provides free medical care through mobile clinics in underserved, isolated, or impoverished communities around the country and world. As health care continues to be a contentious issue in America, an estimated 29 million Americans, about one in 10, lack coverage.  An estimated 27 million people — or 8.3 percent of the population of America- were uninsured, according to a report from the Census Bureau.  This rate is considerably high in rural and poorer parts of the country. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)A combination of Trump administration policies will make health care coverage more expensive for people who purchase plans from health insurance marketplaces — and rural residents will be hit the hardest, according to a new analysis.
Researchers from the Century Foundation say Trump administration policies — especially its refusal to ask Congress to extend Biden-era tax credits that are set to expire at the end of this year — will boost out-of-pocket premiums by 93% in the 32 states that allow the federal government to operate their Affordable Care Act insurance marketplaces. New rules and tariffs will have a smaller impact.
Rural county residents in those states will see an increase of 107%, while residents of urban counties will pay 89% more, according to the analysis by the Century Foundation, a left-leaning research nonprofit.
Insurers participating in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces are proposing a median premium increase of 18% for 2026 — the biggest jump since 2018 and 11 points more than the growth from 2024 to this year. That bump would come on top of the increase resulting from the expiration of the tax credits and the other policy changes.
About 2.8 million people who are enrolled in marketplace plans in the 32 states live in rural counties, including 776,000 adults between the ages of 55 to 64 and more than 223,000 children, according to the Century Foundation.
“Rural residents tend to be older. They may be more likely to have chronic illness at the same time,” said Jeanne Lambrew, director of health care reform at the foundation. “It costs more, both because they have somewhat greater needs and less access to health care.”
The researchers calculated that average annual premiums for rural residents will increase by $760 — 28% more than the expected average increase for urban residents. States where rural enrollees are expected to see the highest cost increases are Wyoming ($1,943), Alaska ($1,835), and Illinois ($1,700).
Many of the states with a large number of rural residents have chosen not to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, meaning many people who earn between 100% and 138% of the federal poverty level, between $15,650 and $21,597 for an individual, get their coverage from an insurance marketplace, Lambrew said.
Of the seven states where 10% or more of rural residents are enrolled in marketplace plans (Alabama, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Wyoming), only two — Nebraska and North Carolina — have expanded Medicaid.
State officials in Pennsylvania recently advised residents who use the marketplace that they should closely examine the plans that are available.
“This year, even more than previous years, Pennsylvanians should consider shopping around to find the best plans to meet their individual needs, at a price that makes sense for their current financial situation,” Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner Michael Humphreys said in a statement released at the beginning of this month.
Lambrew said the increases will force many people to forgo insurance altogether.
“It’s harmful for those individuals in terms of their own health and life expectancy. It’s harmful for our providers, because they’re now dealing with people who are sicker and in the wrong settings, and it’s kind of expensive for our society,” Lambrew said.
“We know health insurance matters, so having these large potential increases on uninsured Americans is distressing.”

NASHVILLE —The Trump administration may deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he rejected a last-minute deal to remain in jail, plead guilty to human smuggling charges and be deported to Costa Rica, a legal notice filed Saturday by his attorneys said.
The behind-the-scenes ultimatum bolsters claims that Abrego is the target of “selective and vindictive prosecution” by the government after he contested his wrongful deportation to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador prison in March, Abrego’s lawyers wrote.
Abrego was released Friday to await trial in January on human smuggling charges in Tennessee and returned to Maryland, where the sheet metal apprentice lives with his wife and children. His wrongful deportation to El Salvador in March has brought ongoing scrutiny to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics. Abrego has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.

In a deal offered by the government late Thursday, it promised to deport Abrego to Costa Rica where he could live freely if he remained jailed until Monday, pleaded guilty to the Tennessee human smuggling charges and served the sentence imposed by the court, his attorneys wrote. The government of Costa Rica had agreed to take him, the filing said.
Abrego’s attorneys informed the Acting U.S. Attorney Rob McGuire, who is prosecuting the Tennessee case, they would “of course, communicate the government’s proposal to Mr. Abrego” but declined to agree to a demand that he remain incarcerated until Monday.
Abrego was released shortly after 2 p.m. Friday from a detention facility in Putnam County, Tenn. Within minutes of Abrego’s release, a representative of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, informed his attorneys they intended to deport him to Uganda and ordered him to report to the agency’s field office in Baltimore, his attorneys wrote.
“The only thing that happened between Thursday — Costa Rica — and Friday — Uganda — was Mr. Abrego’s exercise of his legal entitlement to release under the Bail Reform Act and the Fifth Amendment,” his attorneys wrote.
Government officials again, late Friday evening, informed Abrego he has until first thing Monday morning to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica “or else that offer will be off the table forever.”
“There can be only one interpretation of these events: the (Department of Justice) and ICE are using their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat,” Abrego’s attorneys wrote.
Attorneys for Abrego have already filed a motion to dismiss the criminal charges against him, calling the case a clear example of “selective and vindictive prosecution” by the Trump administration in legal filings last week.
The ultimatums offered by the Trump administration serve to underscore Abrego’s allegations that it is acting with vindictiveness towards him, their latest legal filing said.
The Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security “are obviously working in lockstep to coerce Mr. Abrego into accepting a guilty plea in his criminal case, holding over his head the prospect of possible indefinite detention — or worse — in a country halfway across the world,” the attorneys wrote. “It is difficult to imagine a path the government could have taken that would have better emphasized its vindictiveness.”

(Mario Tama/Getty Images)When California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled his plan to retaliate if Republican-led Texas redrew its congressional districts to favor the GOP, he affirmed his support for less partisan maps — and then promised to “meet fire with fire.”
“We’re doing it mindful that we want to model better behavior,” Newsom told reporters in Los Angeles earlier this month, nodding to the independent system his state currently uses to draw districts. “… But we cannot unilaterally disarm. We can’t stand back and watch this democracy disappear.”
President Donald Trump’s call for Republicans to redraw U.S. House districts so the party can win more seats in the 2026 midterm elections — to gerrymander them — has triggered a redistricting frenzy this summer that also threatens to prompt moves by Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and New York, among others. Ohio was already set to redraw its lines, even before the current fracas.
The battle for partisan advantage is placing Democratic politicians, advocates of less partisan maps and others who support curbs on gerrymandering in an uncomfortable position, pitting their desire for change against fears that Trump will take advantage of their scruples to wring more GOP seats out of a handful of key states. Some say they accept that Democratic states need to respond, while others warn retaliation will only yield short-term gains.
The Texas House passed a new map on Wednesday, clearing the way for a final vote in the state Senate and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature. In California, lawmakers passed their own map on Thursday, setting up a statewide vote in November over the new districts.
Other states are now likely to follow, as Republicans and Democrats scramble for a political leg up.


But gerrymandering opponents say the current moment has the potential to produce new energy for their movement. More people are paying attention to gerrymandering, they say, and new polls show the public opposes the practice. The rush to redraw maps demonstrates the need for Congress to set national limits, they say.


“I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard,” said David Daley, an author of books on gerrymandering and a senior fellow at FairVote, a Maryland-based nonpartisan group that supports ranked choice voting and multimember House districts to end the practice. “We will never have reform if a handful of states can act on their own.”
At the same time, some gerrymandering opponents fear states will unravel hard-fought victories. They wonder whether temporary measures, such as California potentially setting aside the independent commission it uses to redraw maps, could become permanent.
 
‘An unprecedented time’
State legislatures exercise primary control over congressional redistricting in 39 states, according to All About Redistricting, a compendium of information on map-drawing hosted by Loyola Law School in California. While some states use other methods, only nine states rely on independent commissions, which typically limit participation by elected officials and are favored by many gerrymandering opponents.
Most states draw maps once a decade after the census, making the mid-decade maneuvers and counter-maneuvers highly unusual (six states currently have only one representative, eliminating the need to draw district lines). But just a few seats could determine who controls the U.S. House. Republicans currently hold 219 seats to Democrats’ 212, with four vacancies.
“We affirm that gerrymandering, both racial and political, disenfranchises voters,” Virginia Kase Solomón, president and CEO of Common Cause, an organization that has long advocated for changes to the redistricting process, said during a press call the day before Newsom’s announcement.
“But this is an unprecedented time of political upheaval,” she said. People don’t want to see a situation develop where maps are redrawn every two years, she added.
The new Texas map could ease the path for Republicans to win an additional five seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Texas lawmakers rapidly advanced the redraw this week once Democratic state lawmakers returned to the state. They had traveled to other states to deny Texas House leaders the quorum required to approve the map, but returned after Newsom outlined California’s response.
Gerrymandering typically involves “packing” and “cracking.” “Packing” refers to the concentration of opposition party voters in a small number of districts to reduce competition elsewhere. “Cracking” means diluting the voting power of the opposing party’s supporters across many districts.
Texas Republicans have been frank that they are pursuing the redraw for partisan advantage. But they emphasize that no prohibition exists, in Texas or nationally, against mid-decade redistricting and that a 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision cleared the way for states to draw maps for partisan purposes, removing the power of federal courts to police political gerrymandering.
The new maps give Republicans a chance of winning additional districts but doesn’t guarantee victories, they add.
“The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance,” Texas state Rep. Todd Hunter, a Republican who carried the bill in the Texas House, said during floor debate on Wednesday. He added a short time later: “According to the U.S. Supreme Court, you can use political performance, and that is what we’ve done.”
 
Tricky terrain
As Texas moves forward and California prepares to respond, Common Cause illustrates the tricky terrain anti-gerrymandering advocates are now navigating.
The group, headquartered in Washington, D.C., fought to enact the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2008. But earlier this month, Common Cause declined to condemn California’s retaliation, saying it will judge the effort by whether the maps are a proportional response to gerrymanders in other states, whether the process includes meaningful public participation, and whether the maps expire and are replaced after the 2030 census through the state’s regular redistricting process, among other criteria.
Newsom’s proposal, the Election Rigging Response Act, will ask California voters in November to temporarily set aside the state’s redistricting commission and approve the new map drawn by the legislature. The commission would resume drawing maps following the census.
Recent polling shows widespread public opposition to gerrymandering. A YouGov poll of 1,116 Americans conducted in early August found 69% believe it should be illegal to draw districts in a way that makes it harder for members of a particular political party to elect their preferred candidates. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The number of Americans who say gerrymandering is a big problem has jumped in recent years. In the YouGov poll, 75% of respondents said it is a major problem when districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party, up from 66% in a 2022 survey.
Some California Republicans have responded to Newsom’s proposal by defending the commission system. A group of Republicans sued in state court to block the plan, but the California Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a request to temporarily halt the effort.
 
‘Is this bad for reform?’
While members of the public might say they favor citizen-led commissions, they may not care deeply about the issue, said David Hopkins, a political science professor at Boston College who has written on polarization in American politics. He called gerrymandering a “classic process subject” that comes off as “inside baseball” to many people.
“The legislators in states that haven’t adopted commissions clearly don’t feel any particular political pressure to do so,” Hopkins said.
Some Republicans in states weighing a mid-decade gerrymander also discount the risk of a public backlash.
In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe may call a special session this fall to redraw the state’s map in hopes of gaining an additional GOP seat in the U.S. House. James Harris, a Missouri Republican consultant with close ties to GOP officials in the state, said he wasn’t concerned redistricting would create momentum to change the process.
Missouri voters in recent years have approved ballot measures favored by Democrats, including one in 2018 that empowered a nonpartisan demographer to draw state legislative districts, though not congressional districts. But Republicans led a successful campaign to convince voters to repeal the changes two years later.
Harris painted any new potential map as part of a national effort to help Trump — who received 58.5% of the vote in Missouri last November.
“I think the lens is wanting to make sure the president has a majority in Congress so he can actually govern for the last two years versus two years of investigations, gridlock,” Harris said.
Advocates of less partisan maps said lawmakers aren’t likely to surrender their own role in mapmaking. While some state courts may limit redistricting excesses, federal courts stopped policing partisan gerrymandering following the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision. And the high court may soon weaken the judiciary’s power to block race-based gerrymandering.
Samuel Wang, director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which supports eliminating partisan gerrymandering, said the “one good thing” about the redistricting battle is that it’s prompted voters to pay attention to an arcane and technical issue. That could be a positive in the long run, he said, “if people can keep a cool head.”
Wang has written online that any response to Texas should remain measured and proportionate. California offers Democrats the only clean option to strike back, Wang wrote. Five Democratic seats could be added by redrawing the state.
“Is this bad for reform? I mean, I’m torn,” Wang told Stateline. “Because on the other hand, Democrats have been, over the last few decades, vocal in their advocacy for voting rights in various forms and now that advocacy is in question because they find a need to fight fire with fire.”
“So I guess the way I would characterize it is if they can hold it in check and not do it in every single state and just engage in whatever they’re doing where it will make a difference,” he said, “then we might not lose all the progress that’s been made.”

Like a lot of Native American people, she relied on Medicaid — for herself and daughter Oakleigh McDonald — before she lost coverage in 2023.(Tommy Martino for KFF Health News)ST. IGNATIUS—Jonnell Wieder earned too much money at her job to keep her Medicaid coverage when the COVID-19 public health emergency ended in 2023 and states resumed checking whether people were eligible for the program. But she was reassured by the knowledge that Medicaid would provide postpartum coverage for her and her daughter, Oakleigh McDonald, who was born in July of that year.
Wieder is a member of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes in Montana and can access some health services free of charge through her tribe’s health clinics. But funding is limited, so, like a lot of Native American people, she relied on Medicaid for herself and Oakleigh.
Months before Oakleigh’s 1st birthday, the date when Wieder’s postpartum coverage would come to an end, Wieder completed and returned paperwork to enroll her daughter in Healthy Montana Kids, the state’s version of the Children’s Health Insurance Program. But her paperwork, caught up in the lengthy delays and processing times for applications, did not go through.
“As soon as she turned 1, they cut her off completely,” Wieder said.
It took six months for Wieder to get Oakleigh covered again through Healthy Montana Kids. Before health workers in her tribe stepped in to help her resubmit her application, Wieder repeatedly called the state’s health department. She said she would dial the call center when she arrived at her job in the morning and go about her work while waiting on hold, only for the call to be dropped by the end of the day.
“Never did I talk to anybody,” she said.
Wieder and Oakleigh’s experience is an example of the chaos for eligible Medicaid beneficiaries caused by the process known as the “unwinding,” which led to millions of people in the U.S. losing coverage due to paperwork or other procedural issues. Now, tribal health leaders fear their communities will experience more health coverage disruptions when new federal Medicaid work and eligibility requirements are implemented by the start of 2027.
The tax-and-spending law that President Donald Trump signed this summer exempts Native Americans from the new requirement that some people work or do another qualifying activity a minimum number of hours each month to be eligible for Medicaid, as well as from more frequent eligibility checks. But as Wieder and her daughter’s experience shows, they are not exempt from getting caught up in procedural disenrollments that could reemerge as states implement the new rules.
“We also know from the unwinding that that just doesn’t always play out necessarily correctly in practice,” said Joan Alker, who leads Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families. “There’s a lot to worry about.”
The new law is projected to increase the number of people who are uninsured by 10 million.
The lessons of the unwinding suggest that “deep trouble” lies ahead for Native Americans who rely on Medicaid, according to Alker.
  Changes to Medicaid 

Trump’s new law changes Medicaid rules to require some recipients ages 19 to 64 to log 80 hours of work or other qualifying activities per month. It also requires states to recheck those recipients’ eligibility every six months, instead of annually. Both of these changes will be effective by the end of next year.
The Congressional Budget Office estimated in July that the law would reduce federal Medicaid spending by more than $900 billion during the course of a decade. In addition, more than 4 million people enrolled in health plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplace are projected to become uninsured if Congress allows pandemic-era enhanced premium tax credits to expire at the end of the year.
Wieder said she was lucky that the tribe covered costs and her daughter’s care wasn’t interrupted in the six months she didn’t have health insurance. Citizens of federally recognized tribes in the U.S. can access some free health services through the Indian Health Service, the federal agency responsible for providing health care to Native Americans and Alaska Natives.
But free care is limited because Congress has historically failed to fully fund the Indian Health Service. Tribal health systems rely heavily on Medicaid to fill that gap. Native Americans are enrolled in Medicaid at higher rates than the white population and have higher rates of chronic illnesses, die more from preventable diseases, and have less access to care.
Medicaid is the largest third-party payer to the Indian Health Service and other tribal health facilities and organizations. Accounting for about two-thirds of the outside revenue the Indian Health Service collects, it helps tribal health organizations pay their staff, maintain or expand services, and build infrastructure. Tribal leaders say protecting Medicaid for Indian Country is a responsibility Congress and the federal government must fulfill as part of their trust and treaty obligations to tribes.
  Lessons Learned During the Unwinding 

The Trump administration prevented states from disenrolling most Medicaid recipients for the duration of the public health emergency starting in 2020. After those eligibility checks resumed in 2023, nearly 27 million people nationwide were disenrolled from Medicaid during the unwinding, according to an analysis by the Government Accountability Office published in June. The majority of disenrollments — about 70% — occurred for procedural reasons, according to the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
CMS did not require state agencies to collect race and ethnicity data for their reporting during the unwinding, making it difficult to determine how many Native American and Alaska Native enrollees lost coverage.
The lack of data to show how the unwinding affected the population makes it difficult to identify disparities and create policies to address them, said Latoya Hill, senior policy manager with KFF’s Racial Equity and Health Policy program. KFF is a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
The National Council of Urban Indian Health, which advocates on public health issues for Native Americans living in urban parts of the nation, analyzed the Census Bureau’s 2022 American Community Survey and KFF data in an effort to understand how disenrollment affected tribes. The council estimated more than 850,000 Native Americans had lost coverage as of May 2024. About 2.7 million Native Americans and Alaska Natives were enrolled in Medicaid in 2022, according to the council.
The National Indian Health Board, a nonprofit that represents and advocates for federally recognized tribes, has been working with federal Medicaid officials to ensure that state agencies are prepared to implement the exemptions.
“We learned a lot of lessons about state capacity during the unwinding,” said Winn Davis, congressional relations director for the National Indian Health Board.
Nevada health officials say they plan to apply lessons learned during the unwinding and launch a public education campaign on the Medicaid changes in the new federal law. “A lot of this will depend on anticipated federal guidance regarding the implementation of those new rules,” said Stacie Weeks, director of the Nevada Health Authority.
Staff at the Fallon Tribal Health Center in Nevada have become authorized representatives for some of their patients. This means that tribal citizens’ Medicaid paperwork is sent to the health center, allowing staff to notify individuals and help them fill it out.
Davis said the unwinding process showed that Native American enrollees are uniquely vulnerable to procedural disenrollment. The new law’s exemption of Native Americans from work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks is the “bare minimum” to ensure unnecessary disenrollments are avoided as part of trust and treaty obligations, Davis said.
  Eligibility Checks Are ‘Complex’ and ‘Vulnerable to Error’ 

The GAO said the process of determining whether individuals are eligible for Medicaid is “complex” and “vulnerable to error” in a 2024 report on the unwinding.
“The resumption of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations on such a large scale further compounded this complexity,” the report said.
It highlighted weaknesses across state systems. By April 2024, federal Medicaid officials had found nearly all states were out of compliance with redetermination requirements, according to the GAO. Eligible people lost their coverage, the accountability office said, highlighting the need to improve federal oversight.
In Texas, for example, federal Medicaid officials found that 100,000 eligible people had been disenrolled due to, for example, the state system’s failure to process their completed renewal forms or miscalculation of the length of women’s postpartum coverage.
Some states were not conducting ex parte renewals, in which a person’s Medicaid coverage is automatically renewed based on existing information available to the state. That reduces the chance that paperwork is sent to the wrong address, because the recipient doesn’t need to complete or return renewal forms.
But poorly conducted ex parte renewals can lead to procedural disenrollments, too. More than 100,000 people in Nevada were disenrolled by September 2023 through the ex parte process. The state had been conducting the ex parte renewals at the household level, rather than by individual beneficiary, resulting in the disenrollment of still-eligible children because their parents were no longer eligible. Ninety-three percent of disenrollments in the state were for procedural reasons — the highest in the nation, according to KFF.
Another issue the federal agency identified was that some state agencies were not giving enrollees the opportunity to submit their renewal paperwork through all means available, including mail, phone, online, and in person.
State agencies also identified challenges they faced during the unwinding, including an unprecedented volume of eligibility redeterminations, insufficient staffing and training, and a lack of response from enrollees who may not have been aware of the unwinding.
Native Americans and Alaska Natives have unique challenges in maintaining their coverage.
Communities in rural parts of the nation experience issues with receiving and sending mail. Some Native Americans on reservations may not have street addresses. Others may not have permanent housing or change addresses frequently. In Alaska, mail service is often disrupted by severe weather. Another issue is the lack of reliable internet service on remote reservations.
Tribal health leaders and patient benefit coordinators said some tribal citizens did not receive their redetermination paperwork or struggled to fill it out and send it back to their state Medicaid agency.
 The Aftermath 

Although the unwinding is over, many challenges persist.
Tribal health workers in Montana, Oklahoma, and South Dakota said some eligible patients who lost Medicaid during the unwinding had still not been reenrolled as of this spring.
“Even today, we’re still in the trenches of getting individuals that had been disenrolled back onto Medicaid,” said Rachel Arthur, executive director of the Indian Family Health Clinic in Great Falls, Montana, in May.
Arthur said staff at the clinic realized early in the unwinding that their patients were not receiving their redetermination notices in the mail. The clinic is identifying people who fell off Medicaid during the unwinding and helping them fill out applications.
Marlena Farnes, who was a patient benefit coordinator at the Indian Family Health Clinic during the Medicaid unwinding, said she tried for months to help an older patient with a chronic health condition get back on Medicaid. He had completed and returned his paperwork but still received a notice that his coverage had lapsed. After many calls to the state Medicaid office, Farnes said, state officials told her the patient’s application had been lost.
Another patient went to the emergency room multiple times while uninsured, Arthur said.
“I felt like if our patients weren’t helped with follow-up, and that advocacy piece, their applications were not being seen,” Farnes said. She is now the behavioral health director at the clinic.
Montana was one of five states where more than 50% of enrollees lost coverage during the unwinding, according to the GAO. The other states are Idaho, Oklahoma, Texas, and Utah. About 68% of Montanans who lost coverage were disenrolled for procedural reasons.
In Oklahoma, eligibility redeterminations remain challenging to process, said Yvonne Myers, a Medicaid and Affordable Care Act consultant for Citizen Potawatomi Nation Health Services. That’s causing more frequent coverage lapses, she said.
Myers said she thinks Republican claims of “waste, fraud, and abuse” are overstated.
“I challenge some of them to try to go through an eligibility process,” Myers said. “The way they’re going about it is making it for more hoops to jump through, which ultimately will cause people to fall off.”
The unwinding showed that state systems can struggle to respond quickly to changes in Medicaid, leading to preventable erroneous disenrollments. Individuals were often in the dark about their applications and struggled to reach state offices for answers. Tribal leaders and health experts are raising concerns that those issues will continue and worsen as states implement the requirements of the new law.
Georgia, the only state with an active Medicaid work requirement program, has shown that the changes can be difficult for individuals to navigate and costly for a state to implement. More than 100,000 people have applied for Georgia’s Pathways program, but only about 8,600 were enrolled as of the end of July.
Alker, of Georgetown, said Congress took the wrong lesson from the unwinding in adding more restrictions and red tape.
“It will make unwinding pale in comparison in terms of the number of folks that are going to lose coverage,” Alker said.

(Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)The ethanol industry won’t tell you to fill your vehicle with illegal fuel, but thanks to a long-term study of fleet vehicles in Nebraska, it now says your vehicle would be fine if you did.
Most of the ethanol-blended gasoline sold in the U.S. is 90% petroleum and 10% ethanol. The Trump administration issued an executive order in April allowing nationwide, year-round sales of E15, despite concerns that it worsens air pollution in some areas during the summer. The next administration could rescind it, so some farm-state lawmakers are pushing to codify E15 availability.
The leader of the Nebraska Ethanol Board said Friday that a 30% ethanol blend — approved by the EPA for use in flex-fuel vehicles, but not in others — is “the fuel of the future.” Flex-fuel vehicles can run on gas, ethanol, or any blend of the two.
A representative for South Dakota Corn, meanwhile, said a marketing partnership with KwikStar shows that teens are more likely to start their driving careers buying E15 if they see it as a way to save money for snacks. Typically, the more ethanol a fuel has, the cheaper it is.
Both speakers at the the American Coalition for Ethanol’s annual conference in downtown Sioux Falls pressed the idea that ethanol — and the corn markets that rely on it — can overcome consumer skittishness with the right message.
Nebraska study: Most cars do well with E30
Ben Rhodes, executive director of the Nebraska Ethanol Board, backed his claims on 30% ethanol’s fuel efficiency with a presentation about a long-term study of its use in Nebraska state government fleet vehicles.
The first phase came in 2019, when 50 non-flex-fuel vehicles of various model years, all located in Lincoln or Omaha, filled up with either E30 or E15 for a year. The study required a waiver from the EPA, he said.
The results of the study’s first phase were published in a peer-reviewed paper in 2021, and showed that the vehicles using E30 got similar gas mileage, suffered no engine damage and produced fewer carbon dioxide emissions.
Rhodes said the second phase of the study offers stronger proof still. Since 2023, 100 state fleet vehicles have used either E30 or E10 and the results have been similar. That phase used E10 because the fleet vehicles were used across the entire state, and E15 isn’t available everywhere.
Newer vehicles lost about one mile per gallon with E30, Rhodes said.
“For the older vehicles, 2003 to 2013, E30 had a better fuel economy,” Rhodes said.
Why Minnesota wants to be a leader in sustainable aviation fuel

After the presentation, Rhodes told Searchlight that “we shouldn’t take our eyes off the prize” of E15 to start pushing for the adoption of E30. Even so, he said, the fleet study shows that there’s a future for higher blends.
“This is a long term, forward thinking project, because we know that the data will have to lead,” Rhodes said. “The horse has to pull the cart.”
Ron Lamberty, the ethanol coalition’s chief marketing officer, said the Nebraska results are “the best study we’ve seen” to confirm a claim he’s heard for years from farmers: That they don’t lose mileage with E30.
“Even then, I was skeptical,” Lamberty said. “Are they saying that because they love ethanol, or is it true? Now we’ve shown it to be true.”
Lamberty stressed that he can’t recommend people use E30 in a non-flex-fuel vehicle, given its legal status. But he also said he’d be happy to see the EPA issue a fine to a driver for ignoring that advice, and for that driver to challenge the EPA, “because they would lose the case.”
“Then we’d have a legal judgment,” Lamberty said, to show that the fuel is safe to use.
Kwik Star partnership: Selling ethanol to young people
Ethanol’s cultural stock as an antidote to climate change and reducer of carbon emissions has fallen since its mainstream adoption decades ago.
Some studies performed by researchers outside the industry have suggested that the carbon intensity and water demands of corn cultivation cancel out the environmental benefits of ethanol. It’s been more than a decade since the Environmental Working Group lambasted the industry with a report called “Ethanol’s Broken Promise,” which accused it of causing the conversion of grassland to crops. Greenpeace opposes the U.S. biofuels mandate, which incentivizes the use of ethanol, citing similar reasoning.
Ethanol backers have pushed back on such assertions.
Amanda Bechen, director of marketing and communications for South Dakota Corn, said last year’s marketing partnership with the convenience store chain Kwik Stop was part of a strategy to target the youngest generation of drivers, ideally before they develop opinions on ethanol.
“Fourteen-year-olds can drive,” Bechen said. “We want to make sure that they see this message and before they develop the behavior of not using ethanol, so we get them to understand that this is a fuel that they can use for the rest of their life.”
The “Fuel Up South Dakota” marketing campaign, which ran from last July through the end of June 2025, used splashy signs with taglines like “it’s okay to go low” at the pump to push lower-priced E15. Video ads encouraging young people to save their money for snacks were aired across social media, as well as during televised Summit League collegiate basketball games and on streaming video platforms.
Bechen visits high schools as part of her regular duties, and said teens tend to know little about the kinds of fuel they’ve often just recently begun to put in their cars. Gas is labeled by octane, but she said kids don’t usually know what the numbers mean. The number “87” corresponds to E10, “88” to E15. An “89” on the pump handle would signal a mid-grade fuel without ethanol.
Bechen told South Dakota Searchlight she’s heard teens say they pick “87” because it’s Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce’s jersey number, or “89” because it corresponds to the album “1989” from Kelce’s girlfriend Taylor Swift.
The Kwik Star promotion’s biggest day came on March 29. On that day, the campaign ran a promotion offering 88-octane E15 fuel for $1.88 a gallon, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Bechen said it was “a landmark event, the largest single day of sales for unleaded 88 in South Dakota” for Kwik Star.
“Some stations did run out,” she said.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Election officials turned over at the highest rate in at least a quarter century during the last presidential election, according to new research from the Bipartisan Policy Center.
An analysis of shifts in election officials published Tuesday found nearly 41% of election officials administering the 2024 election were different than those in 2020. Turnover has accelerated over the past two decades, rising from about 28% in 2004 to 40.9% last year.
The growing percentage of departing election officials comes after years of challenges. They navigated the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as well as harassment and false conspiracy theories surrounding stolen elections that persist today.
The analysis released by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based group that seeks to foster policy cooperation across party lines, represents an updated version of a report that previously examined turnover from 2004 to 2022. The new research, which extends the data through 2024, shows the turnover rate continued to climb.
Wanted: Poll workers. Must love democracy.

The change means that, over time, election officials have less experience. The research found that the share of chief local election officials with six or more years in their role has dropped from 60% in 2006 to 47% in 2024.
But last year, 60% of election officials had previously overseen the administration of a presidential election in their jurisdiction.
“Despite increasing turnover and loss of experience, the majority of chief election officials still have experience running at least one presidential election cycle,” the analysis said. “This is important because presidential elections typically see the highest turnout and are the most visible elections administered.”
The analysis found that over the long term, election official turnover rates have been rising gradually in small jurisdictions, defined as areas with fewer than 100,000 voting-age residents. But large jurisdictions have experienced a more sudden jump in turnover.
Small jurisdictions had a 27% turnover rate in 2004 that had risen to 40% in 2024. But large jurisdictions enjoyed a turnover rate as low as 31% in 2018 before climbing rapidly to nearly 46% last year.

WILSONVILLE — The people of Wilsonville aren’t about to let it happen to them, at least not without a fight.
After seeing residents of nearby Bessemer, Alabama, get blindsided by a proposal for a massive data center, with little public disclosure and public officials silenced by non-disclosure agreements, Wilsonville residents sprang into action when word got out that a developer was looking to build a similar data center in their town.
More than 100 Wilsonville residents packed the town hall for Monday night’s City Council meeting to voice their objections to the proposed “hyperscale” data center in the small, riverside community of fewer than 2,000 residents about 25 miles southeast of Birmingham.

The 3 million square-foot data center project wasn’t on the agenda for Monday’s council meeting, but people showed up anyway, 50 of them carrying red signs that read “No Wilsonville Data Center.” There weren’t enough signs, or chairs, for everyone as the overflow crowd spilled out into the hallway.
Former Wilsonville Mayor Lee McCarty, who was in the crowd among the protesters, said the project, if it proceeds, would be “extremely detrimental to the community.”
“A lot of people live in Wilsonville because they want the country repose,” McCarty said. “They don’t want gigantic power lines and water lines and traffic. They don’t want a Walmart, much less one of these.”
Project planning documents obtained by Inside Climate News from a resident show the site would encompass 664 acres and contain 14 buildings, each 219,000 square feet, more than the size of a typical Walmart Supercenter.
The residents say a data center that size would disrupt their peaceful community that includes multi-generational family farms and million-dollar waterfront homes on Lay Lake.
“All I know is, the people selling this land and the people brokering the deal, that’s going to be their legacy, to potentially destroy a small town,” Wilsonville resident Renny Stanhope said after the meeting.
The Wilsonville data center project is just one in a series of new data center proposals sweeping the country.
In Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio, Tennessee, Michigan, Iowa and elsewhere, data center projects are popping up, often in rural or low-income areas, leaving local residents to deal with noise pollution, air pollution, destruction of forest land and likely higher electricity costs due to massive demand.
The Trump administration has announced plans to waive environmental rules and other regulations for data centers that might slow their development in the midst of an arms race for computing power to run AI systems.
Alabama Power, which will likely provide electricity for the Wilsonville project, has already gotten approval to buy an existing natural gas plant for $622 million, increasing customer bills in anticipation of higher loads from data centers.
In Wilsonville, Monday’s council meeting lasted less than 15 minutes, including the opening prayer and Pledge of Allegiance. After some brief council business, Mayor Ricky Morris said that there were no updates on the project, and that any future rezoning or annexation requests for the project would be on the council agenda.
“When we have something to discuss, it will be on the agenda,” Morris told the crowd.

The data center proposal came to light during the council’s August 4 meeting, when a resident asked the council about the project on the outskirts of town.
At that meeting, council members said they had been approached by representatives from NorthPoint Development, a Kansas City commercial real estate company involved in data center development, which  inquired about annexing parcels of land into the town for a data center project. The project location includes land within Wilsonville town limits and land in unincorporated Shelby County. Annexing the land would put the entire footprint under the control of Wilsonville instead of the county, for zoning purposes, documents show.
Council members said Monday they have not yet received a formal application for annexation.
“We’ve had no other contact with them, they have not requested nothing,” Morris said. “So it’s just like it was last meeting.”
NorthPoint Development did not respond to requests for comment or to authenticate the document.
During a brief public comment period, residents pressed the council members for any updates on the project, and asked whether either they or the mayor would pledge not to sign non-disclosure agreements, which have become common in data center development across the country. The council members did not make such a pledge, with Morris saying they could not promise that for legal reasons. He did not elaborate and declined to answer additional questions from Inside Climate News after the meeting.
Shelby County probate records show NorthPoint Development reached a two-year option on approximately 687 acres from Richard Cashio, a Birmingham steel industry magnate, on Feb. 27. The purchase price was not included in the document. Cashio did not immediately return messages seeking comment.
The project would be located off of County Highway 61, alongside Lick Branch, a small Coosa River tributary. It would be located about 2.5 miles northwest of the Ernest C. Gaston Electric Generating Plant, a coal and natural gas-fired power plant operated by Alabama Power alongside the Coosa.
According to the feasibility plan, the projected peak power demand is 1,008 megawatts, more than half of the maximum output from the Gaston Plant, which is 1,880 megawatts, according to Alabama Power’s website.
Running a 1008 MW data center 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, would use 8.8 million megawatt-hours of electricity a year. That’s about half as much as all of Alabama Power’s 1.3 million residential customers used in 2023, according to company filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
The Wilsonville data center would use about 20 percent less power than the proposed data center in Bessemer, which would use 1200 megawatts at peak.
The plan also states that developers need to “verify volume of water available and capacity of wastewater treatment plant,” as well as “verify if the site is subject to air quality standards,” and “verify power source, location, substation size & location will be adjusted as needed.”

Coosa Riverkeeper Justinn Overton helped distribute signs at the meeting and share information on social media, and said the large turnout should send a message to the elected officials on the dais.
“Although there was not a lot of information shared tonight, our purpose was to apply gentle pressure and let them know how many people are watching and listening,” she said.
If the council approves the data center request, voter ire would take a while to reach them at the ballot box. According to a post on Wilsonville’s web site, the town will not host municipal elections this year, because the candidates for mayor and five council seats are all unopposed.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Wilsonville-protest-for-August-24-2025-story-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-24 08:57:03.592224

Photograph by John Partipilo/  Tennessee Lookout ©2025NASHVILLE —The Trump administration may deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he rejected a last-minute deal to remain in jail, plead guilty to human smuggling charges and be deported to Costa Rica, a legal notice filed Saturday by his attorneys said.
The behind-the-scenes ultimatum bolsters claims that Abrego is the target of “selective and vindictive prosecution” by the government after he contested his wrongful deportation to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador prison in March, Abrego’s lawyers wrote.
Abrego was released Friday to await trial in January on human smuggling charges in Tennessee and returned to Maryland, where the sheet metal apprentice lives with his wife and children. His wrongful deportation to El Salvador in March has brought ongoing scrutiny to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics. Abrego has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.
In a deal offered by the government late Thursday, it promised to deport Abrego to Costa Rica where he could live freely if he remained jailed until Monday, pleaded guilty to the Tennessee human smuggling charges and served the sentence imposed by the court, his attorneys wrote. The government of Costa Rica had agreed to take him, the filing said.
Abrego’s attorneys informed the Acting U.S. Attorney Rob McGuire, who is prosecuting the Tennessee case, they would “of course, communicate the government’s proposal to Mr. Abrego” but declined to agree to a demand that he remain incarcerated until Monday.
Abrego was released shortly after 2 p.m. Friday from a detention facility in Putnam County, Tenn. Within minutes of Abrego’s release, a representative of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, informed his attorneys they intended to deport him to Uganda and ordered him to report to the agency’s field office in Baltimore, his attorneys wrote.
“The only thing that happened between Thursday — Costa Rica — and Friday — Uganda — was Mr. Abrego’s exercise of his legal entitlement to release under the Bail Reform Act and the Fifth Amendment,” his attorneys wrote.
Government officials again, late Friday evening, informed Abrego he has until first thing Monday morning to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica “or else that offer will be off the table forever.”
“There can be only one interpretation of these events: the (Department of Justice) and ICE are using their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat,” Abrego’s attorneys wrote.
Attorneys for Abrego have already filed a motion to dismiss the criminal charges against him, calling the case a clear example of “selective and vindictive prosecution” by the Trump administration in legal filings last week.
The ultimatums offered by the Trump administration serve to underscore Abrego’s allegations that it is acting with vindictiveness towards him, their latest legal filing said.
The Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security “are obviously working in lockstep to coerce Mr. Abrego into accepting a guilty plea in his criminal case, holding over his head the prospect of possible indefinite detention — or worse — in a country halfway across the world,” the attorneys wrote. “It is difficult to imagine a path the government could have taken that would have better emphasized its vindictiveness.”

We fear that if income sensitivity is not effectively applied to the income tax equation, Vermonters will not be able to stay in their homes.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Concerned Windham citizens: Property taxes may drive residents out of their homes.","This commentary is by Windham citizens, who are listed below the text.


Earlier this year, the Town of Windham underwent a full property reappraisal which has left a significant number of our residents struggling. The Board of Abatement reconvened on Monday, February 10, for the second time to hear and decide on more desperate cases. 
According to the law (32 V.S.A. § 6066), residents with an annual household income not exceeding $47,000 should not have to pay more than 5% (3% for municipal and 2% for educational taxes) of their household income for their house and 2 acres, as long as their reassessed property value is under $400,000. In all of the abatement cases the Board of Abatement heard, this applied to each of the appellants who should not have had to pay more than roughly $600 and yet were charged more than four times that amount. The one-year lag in the income sensitivity calculation is also a very unfair challenge in a reappraisal year for probably every town in Vermont.
In one instance, a person received a tax bill that amounted to 16% of their household income. They own less than 2 acres, 1.09 acres to be exact. Their household income was similar for 2022 ($14,230) and 2023 ($14,871), less than $15,000 in both instances, which qualifies them for a 4.5% cap. Their homestead value rose from $180,000 to $345,000 after reappraisal, which is still less than the $400,000 limit. How does this comport with 32 VSA, Chapter 154, Sec. 6066(a)(3-4), which indicates that they should not be paying more than 4.5% of their household income for their total tax bill? And how are they to handle the increase in their mortgage payments if and when their taxes are in escrow?
Windham is a small rural community with just over 550 permanent residents and about 55% second-home owners. Our town has no grocery store, no post office, no school nor any other amenities — hardly even a street light — and yet it ranks at the top of the tax rates in the state. We are being penalized for the fact that wealthy buyers from out of state have been buying properties for more than twice their value, often sight unseen. 
We fear that if income sensitivity is not effectively applied to the income tax equation, Vermonters will not be able to stay in their homes. We hope that a solution will be found to address the apparent anomaly that occurs as a result of a pandemic and reappraisal. 
In our deliberations that Monday, the Board of Abatement decided to calculate the appellants’ appeals based on the 4.5% value that 32 VSA, Chapter 154, Sec. 6066(a)(3-4) indicates. 
The remaining balance will have to be divided among the town’s residents in order to fulfill our tax obligations, but this cannot be the norm, nor can we continue to see tax rates rising beyond affordability. Oddly enough, all attempts to get confirmation and advice on how to proceed based on 32 V.S.A. § 6066 led nowhere. It seemed like relevant officials were unaware of the income sensitivity 5% cap or did not know how to answer our questions. We wonder how many other communities in Vermont have had a similar experience.

But making T finances more sustainable by bringing them in line with other large urban transit agencies takes more than just capital improvements.  It will require legislative leaders and Gov. Healey to reinstate and empower an entity like the Fiscal and Management Control Board to explicitly focus on operating cost control.  
The post Without a watchdog, T[...]","SINCE ITS collapse into the snows of February 2015, the MBTA has ramped up capital spending on much-needed maintenance and repairs to move the agency closer to a state of good repair.    
The capital investment was long overdue. But since the Fiscal and Management Control Board established in 2015 to oversee MBTA finances was dissolved six years later, operating costs have spiraled.  Addressing out-of-control costs will require the reinstatement of an operating budget watchdog like the FMCB.  
In 2018, the MBTA balanced its operating budget without state contract assistance or federal funds.  With the onset of the pandemic, MBTA fare revenue fell by $285 million and unlinked passenger trips fell by 37 percent between fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2023. But state operating support increased by $539 million during that time and the T also received about $2 billion in federal COVID relief money.    
Nonetheless, the MBTA was looking at a $700 million deficit for this fiscal year before Gov. Healey approved $535 million for the T in June.  The money comes in addition to funding the agency receives from state sales tax receipts, assessments on the municipalities it serves, and self-generated revenue such as fares.  
Since fiscal 2021, system operating costs have risen more steeply every year, including by nearly 15 percent between fiscal 2023 and 2024.    
The biggest culprit is the bus system. In 2019, the MBTA spent $153 per hour in operating costs to run a bus, compared to $220 at New York’s Metropolitan Transit Authority. By 2023, costs had risen slightly to $263 in New York, but the hourly cost of operating an MBTA bus nearly doubled to $297, exceeding New York’s costs.   
An analysis of eight comparable US transit agencies found that MBTA bus operating costs rose by more than 90 percent.  The Chicago Transit Authority had the next sharpest increase at less than 40 percent.  
One way the T control board succeeded at keeping operating costs under control was through the agency’s three-year exemption from the Commonwealth’s so-called Pacheco Law. That unique statute makes it exceptionally difficult to contract out any service provided by state (or MBTA) employees.    
During the exemption, the T contracted out operation of its secure cash counting facility.  It reduced costs by 65 percent and the time it takes to deposit funds by 80 percent.  Contracting out the operation of warehousing and logistics cut costs and improved inventory accuracy from 57 percent to 80 percent, with 99.8 percent of deliveries completed within 10 hours.   
The threat of competition also brought the Carmen, the MBTA’s largest union, to the table to renegotiate their contract, saving an estimated $218 million over a decade.  All told, the T estimated the 1o-year savings from actions taken under the Pacheco Law exemption at more than $450 million.  This exemption expired before the pandemic and should be restored.  
It’s also long past time for the Commonwealth to address the MBTA’s nearly bankrupt pension system.  When the T contributed $37.7 million to the retirement fund in fiscal 2007, its funding ratio was over 90 percent.  The fiscal 2025 budget called for the MBTA to contribute $207.7 million to a system that is just 56 percent funded.   
The fundamental problem is that there are more people collecting benefits than paying in, mostly due to how early MBTA employees can retire. Those hired before December 2012 can retire with a full pension after 23 years of service, regardless of age. Those hired after December 2012 can retire with a full pension at age 55 after 25 years.  In addition, T employees receive pensions that are significantly more generous than those of their state government counterparts.   
 There has been progress at the MBTA of late.  Thanks to increased capital funding and the leadership of General Manager Phillip Eng, service is more reliable and subway slow zones have disappeared.   
But making T finances more sustainable by bringing them in line with other large urban transit agencies takes more than just capital improvements.  It will require legislative leaders and Gov. Healey to reinstate and empower an entity like the Fiscal and Management Control Board to explicitly focus on operating cost control.  
Charles Chieppo and Andrew Mikula are senior fellows at Pioneer Institute.  Together with Aidan Enright, they authored the recent report “Cost Control Takes the Wheel: Priority Reform Areas for Balancing the MBTA’s Operating Budget.”

Most had mail-in voting when Trump won in 2016, lost in 2020 and won again in 2024.","Russia’s Vladimir Putin, U.S. President Donald Trump and many Mississippi politicians, including Gov. Tate Reeves, have something in common – their disdain for mail-in voting.
Putin, Russia’s president/dictator, has waged wars where thousands of men, women and children have been killed, and his political enemies who aren’t in prison have a knack for dying under strange and often gruesome circumstances.
Yet, Putin has thoughts about American democracy, and apparently President Trump is listening.
One takeaway Trump said he gleaned from his recent Alaskan summit with Putin, which was called to discuss ending Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, is that the Russian president believes Trump would not have lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden if not for fraud and mail-in voting.
Trump volunteered that Putin told him, “‘Your election was rigged because you have mail-in voting. … It’s impossible to have mail-in voting and have honest elections.’” Trump added that Putin said “no country” has mail-in voting.
It is not clear how discussions of the 2020 election will help end the Russian/Ukrainian war. But Putin’s comments are false. Many countries have mail-in voting. And Trump lost the 2020 election because Joe Biden won more votes – a lot more.
Still, soon after the summit Trump announced his intent to draft an executive order to end mail-in voting.
“An executive order is being written right now by the best lawyers in the country to end mail-in ballots because they’re corrupt,” he told reporters.
And here in Mississippi, Reeves and many other politicians have been longtime opponents of no-excuse, mail-in voting.
In 2020 the Republican governor said on social media, “I will also do everything in my power to make sure universal mail-in voting and no-excuse early voting are not allowed in MS—not while I’m governor! Too much chaos.”
In Russia, Putin could most likely end mail-in voting by himself. Russia has consistently been cited for not conducting fair and free elections. But the election clause of the U.S. Constitution gives the legislature in each state the authority to establish the laws regulating elections. The Constitution gives the U.S. Congress the authority to alter the laws passed by the state legislatures. The president, of course, would have the duty of signing into law or vetoing the changes approved by Congress.
But it is difficult to fathom how the president could end mail-in voting by himself. And the White House staff appeared to be walking back the president’s comments that he could end mail-in voting by himself.
The question then is whether Congress would be willing to take such action.
Currently 36 states, red and blue , have universal mail-in voting. Most had mail-in voting when Trump won in 2016, lost in 2020 and won again in 2024.
So, could Trump convince House members and senators, even Republicans ones, to end early voting in say Florida, Arizona, Georgia, Montana or in various other red or swing states?
Perhaps. Republican politicians have often submitted to Trump’s wishes. But it is important to remember politicians passed mail-in voting because their constituents like it. It makes voting easier and promotes civic engagement.
And contrary to the opinion of Trump, as related to him by dictator Putin, there are safeguards to prevent fraud in early voting.
Some of those safeguards include the fact that people have to sign the envelope the ballot is mailed in. And that signature is checked by poll workers against the signature on record from when the person registered to vote.
In addition, most states with mail-in voting also require some type of identifying information, such as the last four digits of the voter’s Social Security number, driver’s license number or an assigned code (usually a set of numbers) that must be placed on the envelope for the mail-in ballot.
If people trust doing banking online, they should feel comfortable with mail-in voting.
Reeves and other Mississippi officials, it is obvious, do not feel comfortable with mail-in voting. Mississippi is among the 14 states that do not have no-excuse mail-in voting.
In addition, Mississippi is among only three states that have no form of no-excuse early voting either by mail or in person.
In the vast majority of states, people can go vote before Election Day. In Mississippi, a person under the age of 65 must have an excuse to vote early.
Mississippi lawmakers have constantly rejected efforts to expand voter access.
In other words, Vlad Putin would most likely endorse Mississippi election laws.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/07003054/MG_1717-scaled.jpg,,,2025-08-24 07:56:52.706761

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in the News & Citizen on Aug. 21, 2025.
A Morristown lawmaker last week called on state health care regulators to block or delay the planned closure of Copley Hospital’s birthing center until the decision could be further analyzed by the state.
Rep. Dave Yacovone, D-Morristown, made his pitch Aug. 13, during Copley’s budget presentation to the Green Mountain Care Board.
Copley, one of the smallest critical access hospitals in the state, was the last to present its annual budgetary plans to the board. A team of administrators led by CEO Joe Woodin and Kathy Demars, vice chair of the hospital’s board of trustees, provided an explanation of the high profile and controversial decision to close the birthing center, and asked the board for support.
Woodin presented data from a consultant’s analysis that paired a declining birthrate with the expense of operating the birthing center, which ultimately swayed most of the trustees to vote to close the center by Nov. 1. An analysis that Copley presented to the Green Mountain Care Board claimed that maintaining birthing center operations would have resulted in the hospital running a $3.7 million loss, based on 2023 data. Also according to the analysis, the hospital would see a $2.9 million gain by only providing pre- and post-natal care.

Woodin’s presentation also emphasized the emotional toll the process had put upon the administration and volunteer trustees, with several slides dedicated to criticism the hospital had received during the process. Woodin claimed last week, as he had previously, that the nurses’ union had collaborated with community members to protest the closure.
“It was more than anything I’ve ever seen, and it made it really hard. But at the end of the day, it came down to a discussion of, ‘Can we afford this?’ and ‘Do we have enough volume to justify a direction towards growth?’” Woodin said. “That’s hard to say, and people really fight over those issues.”
Demars said the trustees had received hundreds of letters at their homes, some of which were unkind.
“We’re a volunteer board, and we really appreciate any support we can get from the Green Mountain Care Board in making tough decisions,” she said.
‘Defer, delay’
Yacovone, in the public comment portion following the presentation, urged the state board to prevent the hospital from closing its birthing center as planned on Nov. 1, so that its full effects on Vermont’s health care landscape could be considered and the decision could be made in accordance with the Agency of Human Services’ ongoing analysis of how to make Vermont’s health care system more efficient and less expensive.
“My request to the board is that you work to defer, to delay any decision on the Copley birthing center until the (Agency of Human Services’) strategic health plan is developed to see if this kind of decision would even comport with the strategic health plan as envisioned,” Yacovone said. “I would also ask that Copley revise their community health needs assessment to see how a community without a birthing center would be impacted and what would need to be done.”
Yacovone, a former Copley trustee, commended the current trustees for attempting to fulfill their fiduciary duty to the hospital, but said the birthing center’s closure would make health care more expensive for Vermonters, even if it helped Copley’s bottom line.
He added the travel time for residents of Morrisville and other areas of Lamoille County would be dangerous for expecting mothers.
Yacovone was not alone in his request that the birthing center be delayed. Vicki Rich, a local lactation consultant and birthing coach, asked the board to give maternal health care providers more time to respond.
Other meeting attendees, including a nurse-midwife at Copley and former birthing center patients, emphasized the importance of the birthing center in maternal health care in Lamoille County.
Yacovone contends that the Green Mountain Care Board has the ability, in setting Copley’s budget, to dictate the hospital take a specific action and require it to work with the Agency of Human Services to under Act 68, a law passed earlier this year meant to help stabilize and reform Vermont’s health care system. However, Kristen LaJeunesse, a spokesperson for the care board, said that it was beyond the board’s authority.
“Decisions about whether to continue or close specific service lines, such as birthing centers, are made by the hospitals themselves,” LaJeunesse said. “The Green Mountain Care Board’s responsibilities include hospital budget regulation and review of certain projects through the certificate of need process, but we do not have the authority to direct a hospital to keep a department open or to close one.”
Communications previously obtained by the News & Citizen between Woodin and care board chair Owen Foster show that the Copley CEO had sought the board’s endorsement of the birthing center decision. Woodin ultimately received a statement acknowledging that “transformational efforts will require hard decisions and trade-offs.”
Foster, during last week’s meeting, endorsed the idea that Vermont hospitals shouldn’t decide what services to cut purely based on their financial burden following tearful testimony from a mother who had suddenly gone into labor but was able to make it to Copley due to its proximity.
“With some of the budgets we’ve seen, there’s often a request for finances for services that lose money,” Foster said. “As we go forward with transformation, we definitely don’t want to see cherry picking and lemon dropping. It has to be consistent with the transformation plan that the Agency of Human Services is leading.”
Modest request
While the birthing center closure decision continued to be the center of attention, Copley’s actual spending proposal was more modest than in years past.
The hospital requested a 3.7% decrease to net patient revenue, a 1.6% increase to operating expenses and a 4.2% increase to commercial insurer reimbursement rates. Woodin previously asked the board for double-digit percentage increases to its commercial reimbursement rates after complaining of financial issues and a cost for services that are far lower than other hospitals in the state.
Copley also asked for spending exemptions for its financial support of the beleaguered Lamoille Health Partners and for the construction of a fourth operating room at the Morristown hospital.
The hospital gave Lamoille Health Partners a $150,000 lifeline last year after the federally qualified health care center suddenly found itself in a financial crisis. The hospital also took back some of the laboratory diagnostic work the health center had previously outsourced to a different company and provided additional services following the closure of the partner’s Stowe office.
The hospital said the construction of a new operating room was necessary to meet the demand for more space from across the hospital.
“The addition of a fourth OR is in direct response to increased demand across multiple service lines. This expansion is essential to meeting our growing patient care needs, improving financial stability, and keeping care local,” Copley’s presentation to the care board said. “The additional capacity will directly reduce patient wait times for surgical procedures, improve overall patient experience and provide surgeons with additional block time availability, supporting both provider satisfaction and recruitment efforts.”
Woodin touted the cost savings of the New England Health Care Collaborative he announced last year, and Foster encouraged hospital staff to lean into its status as a relatively low-cost health care provider and more aggressively compete with larger hospitals like the University of Vermont Medical Center.
“I think as Vermonters become more aware of the affordability challenges we have as a state, I think they probably are more sensitive to the fact that your prices are lower,” Foster said. “We would like to see you be a competitor and would like to see others compete on your prices.”

Kate Lewton is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
BURLINGTON — Christmas trees are a staple in many households throughout Vermont in the winter months, but it’s the summer months that make the Christmas magic happen. Even though peak sales for Christmas tree farms are in November and December, the saplings are largely tended in the spring and summer. 
“We all feel like Christmas tree farms are a vital part of Vermont’s rural landscape and character and contribute to Vermont’s economy,” said Amanda Werner, the daughter of Cheryl and Fred Werner of Middlebury’s Werner Tree Farms. “They are a tradition that connects generations.” 
Werner Tree Farms has been selling trees since 1980, after a push for Christmas tree planting in the mid 1970s. They’ve since grown to about 15,000 trees across their properties. 
“There was a county forester who was really pushing Christmas tree planting in Addison County, and in the early ages of this farm, about 30 years ago, there were about 75 tree farms in Addison County,” Werner said. “You look out there today, now there’s 15.” 
There is a trend of dwindling farms in Vermont, including tree farms, but according to the 2022 agricultural census there were still 3,495 acres of Christmas trees in the state on 260 farms. That crop is worth $2.6 million as of 2022. 
Steve Moffat began Moffat’s Tree Farm in 2000. However, his family had been selling trees loosely on the side since they started a dairy farm on the land in the 1930s. The trees looked different back then, Moffat said.
“The trees were just wild,” Moffat said. “Uncultivated, unsheared, unfertilized, very natural trees.”
But today trees require more cultivation to become marketable. After Cody Purinton started selling trees from the Purinton Maple and Tree Farm in Huntington in 1996, he learned a drip application method, a system of irrigation to deliver water and other substances, like herbicides and pesticides. The herbicides remove weeds, said Purinton, and the pesticides prevent insects like aphids from harming the plant. 
“Aphids come in and they will attack the new growth on trees just as it starts growing and they actually make it curl so it isn’t as pretty or lush as it’s supposed to be on the Christmas tree,” Werner said. 
In late spring, fertilizer is put down, and then they start trimming the trees, followed by mowing and more shaping. Werner Farms estimated it took about 60 full days to complete the shearing. 
Werner said he’s intentionally crafted cultivation practices at Werner Farms with sustainability and innovation in mind. 
“I think any smart farmer understands that without good stewardship of their land, their farm is not gonna be viable in the future,” Werner said. 
He implemented rotational grazing to keep their trees healthy with a breed of sheep called Shropshires. They’re extremely picky eaters, and they skip the trees and instead much on the grass and weeds around them, Werner said. 
“They’re removing grass so that we don’t need to go and mow the grass that they eat. They’re leaving manure behind that should be improving the soil over time,” Werner said.
But Christmas tree farming is a long-term investment because the slow growth of trees requires longer land leases.
“It takes 10 years to grow one Christmas tree and it isn’t profitable to only get one crop off. You realistically need a 15 to 20 year lease to make it feasible,” Werner said. “Without land access, existing farms will continue for a while, but if the new generation of farmers can’t afford to take ’em over then it doesn’t work.”
But modern farmers say they will keep working because of the joy it brings to Vermont’s Christmas season. 
“I like to think that, spiritually, if you wanna put it that way, that the Christmas trees know they’re being grown as Christmas trees. They’re happy with their fate. I’m good with that. And I always say, you cut it down, I’m gonna plant another, don’t worry,” Moffat said.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)When California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled his plan to retaliate if Republican-led Texas redrew its congressional districts to favor the GOP, he affirmed his support for less partisan maps — and then promised to “meet fire with fire.”
“We’re doing it mindful that we want to model better behavior,” Newsom told reporters in Los Angeles earlier this month, nodding to the independent system his state currently uses to draw districts. “ … But we cannot unilaterally disarm. We can’t stand back and watch this democracy disappear.”
President Donald Trump’s call for Republicans to redraw U.S. House districts so the party can win more seats in the 2026 midterm elections — to gerrymander them — has triggered a redistricting frenzy this summer that also threatens to prompt moves by Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and New York, among others. Ohio was already set to redraw its lines, even before the current fracas.
The battle for partisan advantage is placing Democratic politicians, advocates of less partisan maps and others who support curbs on gerrymandering in an uncomfortable position, pitting their desire for change against fears that Trump will take advantage of their scruples to wring more GOP seats out of a handful of key states. Some say they accept that Democratic states need to respond, while others warn retaliation will only yield short-term gains.
The Texas House passed a new map on Wednesday, clearing the way for a final vote in the state Senate and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature. In California, lawmakers passed their own map on Thursday, setting up a statewide vote in November over the new districts.
Other states are now likely to follow, as Republicans and Democrats scramble for a political leg up.










I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard.


– David Daley, senior fellow at FairVote


But gerrymandering opponents say the current moment has the potential to produce new energy for their movement. More people are paying attention to gerrymandering, they say, and new polls show the public opposes the practice. The rush to redraw maps demonstrates the need for Congress to set national limits, they say.
“I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard,” said David Daley, an author of books on gerrymandering and a senior fellow at FairVote, a Maryland-based nonpartisan group that supports ranked choice voting and multimember House districts to end the practice. “We will never have reform if a handful of states can act on their own.”
At the same time, some gerrymandering opponents fear states will unravel hard-fought victories. They wonder whether temporary measures, such as California potentially setting aside the independent commission it uses to redraw maps, could become permanent.
 ‘An unprecedented time’

State legislatures exercise primary control over congressional redistricting in 39 states, according to All About Redistricting, a compendium of information on map-drawing hosted by Loyola Law School in California. While some states use other methods, only nine states rely on independent commissions, which typically limit participation by elected officials and are favored by many gerrymandering opponents.
Most states draw maps once a decade after the census, making the mid-decade maneuvers and counter-maneuvers highly unusual (six states currently have only one representative, eliminating the need to draw district lines). But just a few seats could determine who controls the U.S. House. Republicans currently hold 219 seats to Democrats’ 212, with four vacancies.
“We affirm that gerrymandering, both racial and political, disenfranchises voters,” Virginia Kase Solomón, president and CEO of Common Cause, an organization that has long advocated for changes to the redistricting process, said during a press call the day before Newsom’s announcement.
“But this is an unprecedented time of political upheaval,” she said. People don’t want to see a situation develop where maps are redrawn every two years, she added.

The new Texas map could ease the path for Republicans to win an additional five seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Texas lawmakers rapidly advanced the redraw this week once Democratic state lawmakers returned to the state. They had traveled to other states to deny Texas House leaders the quorum required to approve the map, but returned after Newsom outlined California’s response.
Gerrymandering typically involves “packing” and “cracking.” “Packing” refers to the concentration of opposition party voters in a small number of districts to reduce competition elsewhere. “Cracking” means diluting the voting power of the opposing party’s supporters across many districts.
Texas Republicans have been frank that they are pursuing the redraw for partisan advantage. But they emphasize that no prohibition exists, in Texas or nationally, against mid-decade redistricting and that a 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision cleared the way for states to draw maps for partisan purposes, removing the power of federal courts to police political gerrymandering.
The new maps give Republicans a chance of winning additional districts but doesn’t guarantee victories, they add.
“The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance,” Texas state Rep. Todd Hunter, a Republican who carried the bill in the Texas House, said during floor debate on Wednesday. He added a short time later: “According to the U.S. Supreme Court, you can use political performance, and that is what we’ve done.”
 Tricky terrain

As Texas moves forward and California prepares to respond, Common Cause illustrates the tricky terrain anti-gerrymandering advocates are now navigating.
The group, headquartered in Washington, D.C., fought to enact the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2008. But earlier this month, Common Cause declined to condemn California’s retaliation, saying it will judge the effort by whether the maps are a proportional response to gerrymanders in other states, whether the process includes meaningful public participation, and whether the maps expire and are replaced after the 2030 census through the state’s regular redistricting process, among other criteria.
Newsom’s proposal, the Election Rigging Response Act, will ask California voters in November to temporarily set aside the state’s redistricting commission and approve the new map drawn by the legislature. The commission would resume drawing maps following the census.

Recent polling shows widespread public opposition to gerrymandering. A YouGov poll of 1,116 Americans conducted in early August found 69% believe it should be illegal to draw districts in a way that makes it harder for members of a particular political party to elect their preferred candidates. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The number of Americans who say gerrymandering is a big problem has jumped in recent years. In the YouGov poll, 75% of respondents said it is a major problem when districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party, up from 66% in a 2022 survey.
Some California Republicans have responded to Newsom’s proposal by defending the commission system. A group of Republicans sued in state court to block the plan, but the California Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a request to temporarily halt the effort.
 ‘Is this bad for reform?’

While members of the public might say they favor citizen-led commissions, they may not care deeply about the issue, said David Hopkins, a political science professor at Boston College who has written on polarization in American politics. He called gerrymandering a “classic process subject” that comes off as “inside baseball” to many people.
“The legislators in states that haven’t adopted commissions clearly don’t feel any particular political pressure to do so,” Hopkins said.
Some Republicans in states weighing a mid-decade gerrymander also discount the risk of a public backlash.
In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe may call a special session this fall to redraw the state’s map in hopes of gaining an additional GOP seat in the U.S. House. James Harris, a Missouri Republican consultant with close ties to GOP officials in the state, said he wasn’t concerned redistricting would create momentum to change the process.
Missouri voters in recent years have approved ballot measures favored by Democrats, including one in 2018 that empowered a nonpartisan demographer to draw state legislative districts, though not congressional districts. But Republicans led a successful campaign to convince voters to repeal the changes two years later.
Harris painted any new potential map as part of a national effort to help Trump — who received 58.5% of the vote in Missouri last November.
“I think the lens is wanting to make sure the president has a majority in Congress so he can actually govern for the last two years versus two years of investigations, gridlock,” Harris said.
Advocates of less partisan maps said lawmakers aren’t likely to surrender their own role in mapmaking. While some state courts may limit redistricting excesses, federal courts stopped policing partisan gerrymandering following the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision. And the high court may soon weaken the judiciary’s power to block race-based gerrymandering.
Samuel Wang, director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which supports eliminating partisan gerrymandering, said the “one good thing” about the redistricting battle is that it’s prompted voters to pay attention to an arcane and technical issue. That could be a positive in the long run, he said, “if people can keep a cool head.”
Wang has written online that any response to Texas should remain measured and proportionate. California offers Democrats the only clean option to strike back, Wang wrote. Five Democratic seats could be added by redrawing the state.
“Is this bad for reform? I mean, I’m torn,” Wang told Stateline. “Because on the other hand, Democrats have been, over the last few decades, vocal in their advocacy for voting rights in various forms and now that advocacy is in question because they find a need to fight fire with fire.”
“So I guess the way I would characterize it is if they can hold it in check and not do it in every single state and just engage in whatever they’re doing where it will make a difference,” he said, “then we might not lose all the progress that’s been made.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE —The Trump administration may deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he rejected a last-minute deal to remain in jail, plead guilty to human smuggling charges and be deported to Costa Rica, a legal notice filed Saturday by his attorneys said.
The behind-the-scenes ultimatum bolsters claims that Abrego is the target of “selective and vindictive prosecution” by the government after he contested his wrongful deportation to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador prison in March, Abrego’s lawyers wrote.
Abrego was released Friday to await trial in January on human smuggling charges in Tennessee and returned to Maryland, where the sheet metal apprentice lives with his wife and children. His wrongful deportation to El Salvador in March has brought ongoing scrutiny to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics. Abrego has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.
In a deal offered by the government late Thursday, it promised to deport Abrego to Costa Rica where he could live freely if he remained jailed until Monday, pleaded guilty to the Tennessee human smuggling charges and served the sentence imposed by the court, his attorneys wrote. The government of Costa Rica had agreed to take him, the filing said.
Abrego’s attorneys informed the Acting U.S. Attorney Rob McGuire, who is prosecuting the Tennessee case, they would “of course, communicate the government’s proposal to Mr. Abrego” but declined to agree to a demand that he remain incarcerated until Monday.
Abrego was released shortly after 2 p.m. Friday from a detention facility in Putnam County, Tenn. Within minutes of Abrego’s release, a representative of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, informed his attorneys they intended to deport him to Uganda and ordered him to report to the agency’s field office in Baltimore, his attorneys wrote.
“The only thing that happened between Thursday — Costa Rica — and Friday — Uganda — was Mr. Abrego’s exercise of his legal entitlement to release under the Bail Reform Act and the Fifth Amendment,” his attorneys wrote.
Government officials again, late Friday evening, informed Abrego he has until first thing Monday morning to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica “or else that offer will be off the table forever.”
“There can be only one interpretation of these events: the (Department of Justice) and ICE are using their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat,” Abrego’s attorneys wrote.
Attorneys for Abrego have already filed a motion to dismiss the criminal charges against him, calling the case a clear example of “selective and vindictive prosecution” by the Trump administration in legal filings last week.
The ultimatums offered by the Trump administration serve to underscore Abrego’s allegations that it is acting with vindictiveness towards him, their latest legal filing said.
The Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security “are obviously working in lockstep to coerce Mr. Abrego into accepting a guilty plea in his criminal case, holding over his head the prospect of possible indefinite detention — or worse — in a country halfway across the world,” the attorneys wrote. “It is difficult to imagine a path the government could have taken that would have better emphasized its vindictiveness.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Abrego002-1536x1015-1-1024x677.jpg,,,2025-08-24 05:57:30.640417
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-24 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,This CT recovery coach could lose his job to federal cuts. What will happen to his clients?,Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/24/ct-recovery-coach-federal-funding/,"The future of CT’s recovery coaches, who help people navigate sobriety and stay safe, is in flux. One man’s story shows what could be lost.","On a rainy April morning, Kerry Bilda pulled up to his client Jack’s apartment in downtown Norwich to give him a ride to work. 
Close to the street corners where tiny bags of fentanyl change hands, Jack locked his front door, jumped into Bilda’s car, and together they left the city behind: a beloved grinder shop, the imposing stone facade of the Catholic Church, skinny headstones on a hillside. Are any of Bilda’s former clients buried here, taken by an overdose epidemic that’s stalked this corner of Connecticut more viciously than virtually any other? 
Bilda is a recovery coach. He helps people enrolled in medication-assisted treatment in 11 cities and towns in eastern Connecticut to navigate sobriety and saw 107 clients last year. Bilda acts as a shield from the kinds of small but bedeviling snags — a needed ride, a glitched prescription — that can quickly unravel a delicate recovery. 
But to witness Bilda’s work is to see a still larger project in action: how scores of workers at clinics, nonprofits and state agencies help some of Connecticut’s most at-risk residents to stay not only sober, but also fed, safe, housed. It’s the nonlinear endeavor of helping people who may have never known stability to build stable futures. 
But that work’s future has been spun off-kilter in recent months by massive federal budget cuts to programs that serve the poor. Those cuts will soon impact everything from food security to access to health care.
Bilda’s position relies on a $140,000 annual grant from the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, but the money comes from the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, an agency that’s currently being dismantled. Which raises the question: will Bilda’s job survive? And if not, will his clients?

Many lives
When they’re in the car together, Jack and Bilda chat about Jack’s schedule, an idea he has for a small business, his work fixing up apartments. At times, they look and sound like old high school buddies, reminiscing. 
Bilda is a native son of Norwich who has lived experience with addiction — in his case, long-ago struggles with alcoholism. At 6-foot-2, he’s most often speaking to someone below his eyeline, but his casual stance and restrained expression create a gentle, sturdy presence: he is here to help.
Jack, 41, asked that his last name not be used out of respect for his family’s privacy. He’s originally from East Haven. He has a soft, even voice, and when he talks about his struggles with addiction and the road out, he’s self-critical but unguarded, the story flowing unencumbered. Bilda chimes in when a moment he witnessed comes up. 
Like back in 2018, when Jack was using heroin.  
“I would go to these programs and detoxes and whatever, and as soon as the doors would open, I’d be using again,” Jack remembered. “It was kind of hopeless.”  
Jack had manic episodes and for years couldn’t find a medication that effectively managed them. 
In the throes of an episode, Jack felt grandiose — like he was right about everything — and like he could get anything done. “Who wants to be around someone like that?” he said. Though he didn’t swing to the opposite extreme of major depression, he sometimes felt pushed low by “the crap I got myself into.” That “crap” included a combination of larceny, drug possession and misdemeanors, according to his criminal record, landing him in prison and jail for a total of five years. 
Jack ended up in a New London shelter in 2018. It was there that he met Bilda through United Community & Family Services, the nonprofit health clinic where Bilda works.
Each morning, according to shelter rules, Jack had to be out of his bunk by 9 a.m. He couldn’t return to bed until 6 p.m. 
“It was just so easy to walk in circles and get in a trap, you know? Staying occupied was vital at that point,” Jack said.
Bilda had spent two decades working in behavioral health, but he was still new to the recovery coach position when he came by the shelter to pick Jack up. 
“Get me out of there for the day, get my mind off everything,” Jack remembered.  
“And we’d go hiking,” Bilda said. “Get a bite to eat, get coffees.”
On one outing, Jack and Bilda drove to Fort Shantok, sacred Mohegan land. They walked into the clean woods there, tree trunks like cathedral beams, light peeking through leaves overhead. On those trips, Bilda could offer Jack something more than a ride or a bag of groceries — he could give Jack the feeling of peace he’d always found in nature. 
One day at the shelter, police arrived and showed residents a photograph: they were trying to identify a man who had recently overdosed. Jack felt like he was in a movie, that eerie experience of recognizing the two-dimensional version of a friend whom he would never see in three dimensions again. And the final image of that friend’s life rattled him: “These two little kids were going to Sunday school one morning and found him” in front of a fast food joint. 
It was then that Jack really decided to stop using. He had made the decision before, but now he was determined.

‘There’s no way to delay that trouble coming every day’ 
Bilda drives a new company car, with a computer screen to connect him to online libraries of music and podcasts. But he favors the radio, and quotes the poetry he finds there. “It’s a fun job. It’s interesting. What’s that quote? ‘There’s no way to delay that trouble coming every day,’” a Frank Zappa lyric. “So you just deal with it, you figure it out. You figure it out the best you can, and you work with the person.” 
The line is from a Zappa song packed with images of a society in collapse, written in response to the Watts riots in Los Angeles: 
“...Don't you know that this could startOn any street in any townIn any state if any clownDecides that now's the time to fightFor some ideal he thinks is rightAnd if a million more agreeThere ain't no great societyAs it applies to you and meOur country isn't free…”
The trouble Bilda sees in eastern Connecticut every day crested just a few short years ago. It was then that the overdose death rate reached its apex: 42.3 per 100,000 people in the state, 57.6 per 100,000 in Connecticut’s southeast corner. 
Some of his clients were driven to use in a narrative heard across the U.S.: Patients were prescribed OxyContin for a workplace injury or bad back, the drug that was manufactured in Stamford and marketed as a nonaddictive pain killer. But then many found they were addicted when their prescriptions were unceremoniously cut off by doctors. People like Bilda’s client H.W., who was injured while working at Electric Boat, found that heroin filled the void. 
That crisis spurred a rise in overdose deaths, one that exploded when fentanyl infiltrated U.S. illegal drug markets in 2013, rapidly poisoning the supply. People who thought they were taking heroin or cocaine, or even pills like Adderall or Xanax, died of unintentional overdose when they took drugs laced with fentanyl, while people seeking out fentanyl often died of overdose too, because the concentration of the drug varied so widely. 
The most deadly year in Connecticut for overdoses was 2021, as it was in many states around the U.S., when the combination of fentanyl in the illegal drug market and the isolation of the COVID pandemic converged. 
But during the past three years, as the state has invested in recovery efforts, including the availability of the overdose reversal drug naloxone, the number of overdose deaths has been on the decline. In southeast Connecticut, a region hit especially hard by the crisis, the rate fell from 57.6 per 100,000 in 2021 to 37.8 per 100,000 people in 2024.
Rep. Cristin McCarthy-Vahey, D-Fairfield, co-chair of the Public Health Committee, said that such progress isn’t free. 
“It takes medication, which requires funding,” she said. “It requires recovery coaches. It takes infrastructure, people, buildings, staff, which requires funding. The things in place now are saving lives, but lacking those interventions, people will die.”
But there is more to living than survival. Recovery coaches like Bilda are part of a deeper effort to help people sustain their progress and rebuild their lives.
“We usually don’t see or recognize that somebody is struggling until they’re at the severe end of their addiction,” said Rebecca Allen, the director of recovery advocacy at the Connecticut Community for Addiction Recovery. But Allen said getting people beyond sobriety, to help them rebuild a life that may have been damaged by that addiction, requires more than just treatment. 
While Medicaid pays for medication-assisted treatment for recipients, recovery coaches are mainly funded by grants. There are dozens of state-funded recovery coaches across Connecticut, according to Luiza Barnat, opioid services director at DMHAS. Many are located in emergency departments within hospitals, others at health centers like the one where Bilda works in Norwich, sometimes going by other titles, like recovery support specialists. 
Some of the funding that supports recovery coaches, like the federally allocated State Opioid Response grant of $15 million per year, is approved through September 2027. Typically this grant is renewed on a two to three year cycle, and though state officials are hopeful it will be renewed again, that remains uncertain.
“People will struggle, people will suffer and some people will die,” McCarthy Vahey said of the prospect of such funding cuts. 
Medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder, the program in which Bilda’s clients are enrolled, has also come a long way. For decades, methadone was the only medication available to treat opioid use disorder, a treatment that has involved taking the drug daily at a specialized clinic. 
“That is an incredible burden for many people, and it also makes it very hard to hold down a job if you have to go to a clinic every day and stand in a line,” said Robert Heimer, a Yale professor of epidemiology and pharmacology.  
Regulations have relaxed, allowing people who have been faithfully using the drug to eventually be allowed to bring doses of methadone home instead of having to come in person to take the drug every day, Heimer said, and there is also another medication available — buprenorphine — which is an alternative to methadone and can be taken by injection or prescribed by a doctor. That’s the only medication Bilda’s clients use. 
Barnat says that while medication alone can keep people from returning to opioid use and overdosing, that’s not enough to truly “recover.”
“A lot of folks working on recovery have lost a lot of their connections to family and friends, and it can be really difficult to maintain recovery when you’re alone and isolated,” Barnat said. A recovery coach may serve as that figure, or just help someone as they find a different type of support — like a minister, a family member or a new career.

‘Maybe I don’t look like a heroin addict, alcoholic anymore’
Once Jack decided to quit using, he went into detox. 
“The easiest thing was to go find a fix at that time, but I just remember sticking through it and being so ill, so sick,” he said. He enrolled in a medication-assisted treatment program at the health center where Bilda works. Then, Jack was able to move into a halfway house, where he lived for 18 months. He got a job at a ShopRite and worked his way up to manager of dairy and frozen foods. 
“It was a big thing for myself, because I hadn’t lasted anywhere, really. The trust and friendships I started to build … ” he said.
Before, Jack said he felt like he always had a reason close at hand to throw his sobriety away: “‘It’s a beautiful day out!’ Or, ‘it’s a horrible day out!’ And you’d always have an excuse to go use.” But he wasn’t using. He wasn’t throwing it away.
Then, COVID happened. During that time, Bilda learned that Jack had lost his job at ShopRite. Bilda never learned exactly what happened but he’d seen precarious moments like this one before, times when it would have been obvious for a client like Jack to start using again. Then, Jack was evicted. 
“Boof, there I am. I’m homeless.” 
It would have been so easy to use again, so obvious. 
Jack found a spot in the woods to camp where he wouldn’t bother anyone, and where no one was around to tempt him out of sobriety. Soon he found a job doing maintenance for the owner of some of the grand homes in Norwich that had been divided into apartments. He lived on instant ramen and cheap pizza. He used a gas-powered bike to get to work. And he had Bilda, whom he could call on rainy days when he couldn’t commute by bike.
It was May 2021 when Jack first started camping out. But when the weather got cold, Jack decided it was time to tell his boss his story.
“He’s very pure,” Jack said of his boss, awestruck at encountering a person who “doesn’t lie, he doesn’t cheat, he doesn’t steal. Period. He does not.” When his boss seemed genuinely shocked that Jack had once used drugs, it meant something to him. “I was like wait, maybe I don’t look like a heroin addict, alcoholic anymore.” It was a morale booster. 
By November, Jack had saved $1,700. He gave it all to his boss for the rent and first month’s deposit on a one-bedroom apartment, where he has lived ever since. The following spring, Bilda took Jack to Connecticut College in New London, where he’d been invited to pick up unwanted furniture after graduation. 
“It’s a rich college, so what happens is, the kids leave and they don’t take anything with them — they just leave. Lamps. TVs. Radios. Clothes. A whole bunch of jackets,” Bilda said. Bilda drove Jack down in the big van from work and told Jack, “Take whatever you want.”

Peaks and valleys 
Norwich has lived many lives: home of the Mohegan tribe; armory of American revolutionaries; hub of shipbuilding and textile mills. At the dawn of the 20th century, Norwich claimed more millionaires per capita than any other U.S. city — in fact, the apartments Jack works on are subdivided mansions in the city’s “Millionaires’ Triangle.” But when industry after industry departed, what was once Connecticut’s most densely populated city fell to its 10th. Today, the median income hovers at around $37,000 a year. 
Bilda has lived through tough stretches and hopeful moments in his city, like when the Mohegan Sun Casino opened in 1996, bringing jobs.
“This city’s like any other city,” Bilda said. “It’s got problems like any other city. Peaks and valleys, peaks and valleys is what I would say.”
U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney says that the district he represents has been gaining more economic momentum in recent years — in fact, it’s now the fastest growing labor market in the state, thanks in large part to jobs at General Dynamics Electric Boat. 
But the region was not spared the opioid crisis. Courtney said the devastation of the opioid epidemic is closely linked to the rural character of the region. Courtney worked to secure a grant in 2022 for two recovery coaches in the region. 
“The wonderful thing about the recovery coach model … is that these guys were able to sort of overcome that tyranny of distance in terms of just door-to-door service,” Courtney said, so the coach can bring preventative care to clients as opposed to waiting for them to show up in emergency departments. 
But Courtney says that the recent progress his area of the state has made — both in lowering overdose numbers and building economic stability — is threatened by the potentially devastating impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
Cuts to Medicaid, nutritional assistance and programs that support medication-assisted treatment and recovery efforts is “really a terrible convergence as far as this issue is concerned,” Courtney said. “To me, it’s proof of concept that shows when you have that concerted, persistent coverage for vulnerable populations that you can really make a difference.” 
Over the past few years, as opioid death numbers declined, Courtney had begun to feel more confident that efforts were working. 
“You sort of felt like we really have sustainability here, and now with the wave of cuts that are about to come, it is frightening. We really could be just going backwards and squandering structures that were put in place to address the problem.”

Small victories
Before becoming a recovery coach, Bilda spent 22 years working at the state Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, and he learned the importance of maintaining boundaries. At 4:30 p.m., he turns off his work phone. Clients know the other numbers to call in the evening. The boundary serves Bilda, but it’s also a way of showing his clients that they can set their own limits with the people in their lives. 
“Recovery coaching is definitely the model of, ‘what does a healthy relationship look like?’” said Michelle Melendez, director of substance use at United Community & Family Services, the clinic where Bilda works. 
Bilda told Melendez about a tense moment when he told a man he was coaching that he wasn’t allowed to leave his things in the health center’s car. “I think many times with our clients, if someone gets upset, they’re all done and they don’t talk to them forever. And that’s not the real world,” Melendez said. Having a disagreement with Bilda and seeing that he’s still there for them on the other side can help a client learn to weather conflict in their other relationships, she said. 
When Melendez first started the medication-assisted treatment program at United Community & Family Services, she said she would only open the program if they had a staffed recovery coach, because there is only so much that a clinician can do within the four walls of a health center. 
“A recovery coach is really going to be able to figure out what a person is going to need, whether it be housing, employment, life skills,” Melendez said. “In order to sustain recovery, you need to have someone on your side to help you navigate all of that.” 
Above his desk, Bilda logs the past month’s activity on a Post-it: 92 trips, 1,975 miles. On a Tuesday in May, he signed out a few specimen cups from the health center, and grabbed bags of food from its pantry. Then he set off to collect urine samples from people enrolled in medication-assisted treatment programs.
At his first stop, Bilda learned that his client was in crisis. Though she was taking her medication, her adult daughter was using drugs, and they’d gotten into an argument. The client was worried about her grandson, who had been living with her, but who had gone across the state to temporarily stay with his dad. She confided in Bilda “because I’m comfortable enough to tell him.” She asked that her name not be used in this article, “for my grandson’s sake.” 
In the car, Bilda took notes on the meeting, information he’d share with the client’s team at the health center.
Another client had good news to report — her daughter had gotten into art school, and a friend had agreed to pay the costly tuition. The day could just as easily lead him into crisis as success. Throughout, he maintained an air of calm reserve. 
“We tend to celebrate the small victories,” Bilda said as he drove. “And then they tend to add up and add up and add up.”

Invisible thread  
Today, Jack takes sublocade injections, a form of buprenorphine, for opioid addiction, and medications to manage his mania and ADHD. He’s been sober for seven years, since July 3, 2018. He loves his apartment, a place he can finally call home, even though it’s close to some of the most active drug corners in town. 
“You need to put your blinders on and don’t inquire for anything, because that will get you ripped down,” he said. It’s no mystery what would happen if he veered from his path: “If you play the tape through, it’s the same result every time.”
After a nine-year estrangement, he has a relationship with his mother again. They talk every day. “Beyond my wildest dreams, I didn’t think that relationship would be healed, or normal,” he said. 
Now, every few weeks, his mother drives an hour and a half to Norwich where they do laundry and she takes him out for a meal. “She spoils the shit out of me.” 
Jack has a good relationship with his boss, too. And then there’s Bilda, so enmeshed in Jack’s story that it’s easy to miss him. Like invisible thread, Bilda was there making sure Jack’s recovery held together: driving him to his medical appointments, picking up a urine sample from work so he wouldn’t have to take time off to come in person, sitting with him through a manic episode and then speaking to clinicians to make sure they adjusted his meds. Bilda might have been a good Samaritan, but his presence was no accident: he is an employee, placed here by a health center, funded by the state, which was given that funding by Congress, to help Jack see his recovery through.  
Bilda isn’t too far from retirement now, and said he’d like to work his way out of the job — if only he could help enough to outpace the need. “But unfortunately, I don’t see that happening in the future, because there’s more bad stuff hitting the streets,” he said.
Every month he attends a meeting at a soup kitchen with other advocates and volunteers and together they get updates on the opioid epidemic. They learn about new synthetic drugs, like carfentanil, N-pyrrolidino protonitazene. “I can’t even pronounce the names.” 
Seven years since they first met, Bilda has faded some from Jack’s life, as intended. But the combined forces of the medication, psychiatric care, counseling, and, when needed, Bilda’s support, mean that Jack is no longer in crisis. It doesn’t mean he no longer needs the help. Rather, the combination is working.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/RECOVERY-COACH-0501-7-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-24 05:57:30.640417

Fawson, whose salary and benefits are currently $686,941, is under fire over executive pay at the six-county mental health center. (Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)IOLA — Nathan Fawson is a man under fire.
And he wants you to know he is grateful.
Sitting in a consultation room painted a calming shade of neutral, Fawson — CEO of the Southeast Kansas Mental Health Center here — uses the word or a variation of it half a dozen times in explaining why his salary and benefits are more than $628,074. That figure has raised eyebrows and tempers in the community, a fiscal Rorschach test of one’s beliefs about the value of work, the cost of expertise, and who — if anyone — should pay for the public good.
“I’m very grateful that we’ve been able to offer fair, market-competitive wages to better support the community that coincidentally increased wages for management,” he says. “I’m grateful that we’ve been able to offer those competitive wages for expert services provided by management, allowing for those with that expertise to live and enjoy southeast Kansas rather than feel the need or desire to relocate.”
During the interview in the neutral room, decorated with a soothing triptych of what may be a beach scene, Fawson smiles often, gestures broadly, and sometimes refers to a printout summarizing the exponential growth of his six-county agency over the past decade. The center’s number of employees has nearly tripled since 2015, to 583; the budget has grown from $8 million to $75 million; and the number of patients served has expanded sixfold, to 25,906. The center has also, in recent years, offered medical and dental services, as part of its mission as a Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic and doubled its number of sites, to 30, including the clinic on Jefferson Street where our interview takes place.
But it’s not the additional employees or added services that has sparked a regional political backlash. It’s Fawson’s pay and benefits, which have more than quadrupled since 2020.
The SEKMHC serves six of the sickest and poorest counties in Kansas: Anderson, Allen, Bourbon, Linn, Neosho and Woodson. The median household income for Allen County is $57,618, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and about 10% of its residents lack health insurance. That compares with the Kansas median income of $70,333 and an uninsured rate of 8.4%.
In Iola, the seat of Allen County, a historic town of 5,400 on the Neosho River, the need for mental health services is one of those obvious things, like the need for rain to break a drought. Some townspeople told me that just about everyone knows somebody close who died by suicide or who were lost to drugs or alcohol. Local resident Sharla Miller, whose 19-year-old son Matt killed himself in 2019, started a conversation about mental health that included a local conference with representatives from the mental health center. The SEKMHC provides school therapists for districts in all six counties it serves.
Most of the center’s revenue comes from a variety of grants and Medicare and Medicaid. Its board of directors are appointed by the county commissions in the six counties. Each county appoints two representatives and also contributes a combined total of $550,120 in funding for this year, which amounts to less than 1% of the center’s budget. The county funds are earmarked for those not on Medicaid and who could not afford to pay for services — not salaries.
But this year, because of the heat over Fawson’s compensation package, the counties began decreasing their support. Three counties — Allen, Anderson and Neosho — dropped their support to just $1 — that’s right, a single dollar — for 2026, according to reporting by the Iola Register. Anderson County also stopped its quarterly payments for the last two quarters of this year. Linn County voted to contribute $0 for 2025 and 2026. Woodson County slashed its 2026 contribution by more than half, to $35,000. Bourbon County has discussed the issue, but has not yet made a decision on funding.
Even if all six counties pulled funding, Fawson said, the center would continue to operate. Under federal law, nobody who needed emergency services would be turned away because of an inability to pay.
The controversy began in February of this year, when Allen County Commissioner David Lee called, according to Fawson. The commissioner had just seen the center’s latest available 990, from 2023. A 990 is the federal return tax-exempt 501(c)3 nonprofits are required to file annually with the IRS.
Lee asked him if the executive salary and benefits reported were accurate.
“I responded yes,” Fawson said. “Then he responded, ‘The community would disagree with those wages, and prepare yourself for a challenge.’ And that challenge has ensued.”
Fawson said he didn’t anticipate there would be a political concern about executive compensation until that call. He said he was surprised because he was confident in the wage analysis provided in 2021 and 2023 by the Hebets Co., a Phoenix-based consulting firm. The center retained Hebets, Fawson said, because its advisers are experts and would provide a reliable and objective analysis.
The center’s board of directors adopted the Hebets recommendation to increase salaries across the board. Fawson also said that because he was familiar with medical and behavioral health operations, the executive compensation packages suggested seemed appropriate to him.
Before the increases, Fawson said, wages at the center were below the 25th percentile nationally, and the goal was to bring them up to at least the 50th percentile. These increases were across the board, he said, and have improved the lives of the center employees and added to the southeast Kansas economy.
In 2023, according to the center’s 990 tax return, other top-paid executives and employees included Doug Wright, chief operating officer, $444,282; Job Springer, chief financial officer, $423,551; Holly Jerome, director of human resources and marketing, $348,614; John Robinson, urologist, $334,368; and Steven Dooley, chief information officer, $311,604.
Michelle Hoag, clinical director and Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic grant oversight officer, made $276,555 in salary and benefits. Greta Sue McFarland Huebert, a pediatrician, was listed on the 990 at $253,481.
All executive compensation for 2023 was just more than $3 million.
A master’s level clinical therapist just starting out at the clinic, Fawson said, is paid about $71,000.

Fawson, a native of St. George, Utah, graduated in 1997 from Washburn University in Topeka with a master’s degree in clinical psychology. He also has an MBA in business and health service administration from the University of Utah. He began as a therapist with the SEKMHC in the 1990s, he said, and worked his way until he became associate director. In 2010 he left to become director of clinic operations at Cox Medical Center in Branson, Missouri. He returned to the Southeast Kansas Mental Health Center in 2013 and became CEO in 2016.
In a June shakeup, the Allen County Commission dismissed its two previous representatives to the SEKMHC board and replaced them with new members. One of those new members is Jerry Daniels, a Republican who is also the chair of the county commission.
“I agreed with the reduction of funding,” Daniels told me, citing Fawson’s salary as a primary reason. “It’s more than the (U.S.) president makes.”
The U.S. Code sets the salary of the president at $400,000, with an additional $50,000 in expenses. That, of course, does not represent the ever-expanding perks of being president.
“My concern, whether you agree with it or not, is that in this DOGE environment, what are they going to do if the funding runs out?” Daniels said. “I don’t know all the details, but it’s my speculation that their budget got big on Biden bucks. What are you going to do with all these employees and salaries when the money dries up?”
Daniels said he has no doubt the center is doing good work and that its therapists are dedicated to their clients. He said he wasn’t picking on the center but that oversight of management and expenditure of funds was a serious business concern.
“I’ve been a commissioner for 10 years, and I’ve never had as many phone calls as on this subject,” Daniels said. “There’s (also) a lot of text and emails and Facebook questioning.”
A question Daniels said he had, but to which he had not received a clear answer, was whether the SEKMHC was subject to the state’s open records and open meetings laws. I posed the question in an email to Bob Johnson, counselor to the Allen County Commission, but did not receive a reply.
Fawson told me board meetings were open to the public, though few community members attended, and that the center was subject to both the Kansas Open Records Act and the Kansas Open Meetings Act. He said, however, that he would not provide a copy of the Hebets wage analysis. It was propriety, he said.
Fawson also said he didn’t feel comfortable with the Hebets report going public because it might make some center employees uncomfortable. It also might draw unwanted scrutiny to organizations used for comparison, he said.
“That may well bring harm to our employees,” he said. “One thing I recognized early on in my management experience is how sensitive employees are regarding the subject of salary.”
And, he said, exposing other organizations to scrutiny would be unfair.
“I don’t want to draw this type of attention to any organization and have them experience the level of scrutiny we’ve experienced,” he said.
Some of the comparable institutions, both for-profit and nonprofit, were in Missouri and others in Oklahoma, he said, but he declined to identify them more narrowly.
“It’s not fair to them,” he said. “I realize it’s your role to do just that, but I don’t want comparison. I want the community to come to understand value, but not from a perspective of ‘they’re better than you’ or ‘you’re better than them.’ Right?”
Comparisons with other nonprofits in Kansas, including the 25 other mental health centers in the state, are difficult because of differences in size and mission. The Iroquois Center for Human Development at Greensburg, for example, has expenditures of about $2.6 million, according to a database compiled by ProPublica, while the Bert Nash Community Health Center at Lawrence had expenses of more than $34 million. Executive pay typically ranged from 2% to 4% of expenditures for the Kansas mental health nonprofits included in the database.
The Southeast Kansas Mental Health Center executive compensation was 5.8% of its $38 million in expenses in 2023, according to ProPublica. An independent audit commissioned by the organization for fiscal 2023, ProPublica noted, found a “deficiency in internal financial or governance controls that could limit the organization’s ability to track and report financial data reliably.”
Fawson said no audits or other reviews had flagged executive compensation as a cause for concern. He also referred to his information handout, which indicated the center’s executive compensation was reviewed by the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services.
A KDADS official told me the agency reviews all expenses that make up the cost of operating a mental health center, with an eye to the “bigger picture” of the services provided by certified community behavioral health clinics to communities.
“The goal of reviewing these reports is to ensure transparency and accountability,” said Cara Sloan-Ramos, director of communications for KDADS. “Reported salaries are also reviewed using U.S. Department of Labor statistics and evaluated for reasonableness compared to other health care salaries by a third-party contractor.”
She said, however, Fawson’s individual salary was not reviewed as part of the most recent process.
“With regard to specific salaries, in the last report from the Southeast Kansas Mental Health Center,” Sloan-Ramos said, “all administrative salaries were grouped in one line item. Additionally, it is the role of the SEKMHC Board of Directors to approve and finalize executive salaries.”
The fear among some Iola civic leaders is that the controversy about executive compensation at the mental health center will impede its ability to provide vital services to the community. The Iola Register, in a July 3 editorial signed by managing editor Tim Stauffer and publisher Susan Lynn, cited the achievements of the center, from being designated a CCBHC to having therapists embedded in the public schools to staffing an around-the-clock crisis line. The editorial made the case for scrutiny, but cautioned county officials against defunding the center. Diminishing the SEKMHC’s capacity would only result in self-inflicted harm.
“At a time when it’s abundantly clear federal and state funding cannot be counted on, it’s also a dangerous thing to do,” the editorial reads. “We know the risks. Do we want more unattended crisis, more substance abuse, more violence?”
The county should restore the center’s funding and continue to invest in the community’s mental health, the Register urged. If there was concern over executive pay, then dialogue was the answer.
Toward the end of our 90-minute interview in the consultation room, Fawson asked for my take on the salary controversy. If I were offered a salary that was more than 10 times the median household income for my area, I said, I would be uncomfortable.
“I am uncomfortable with it,” he said, and it was the first time I noted emotion in his voice. “I’m very uncomfortable with it. So tell me … I don’t know how to … I don’t know how to effectively resolve that.”
I asked if he had considered taking a salary cut.
“I’ve considered a lot of ways in which I could give back,” he said. “And yet I have some advising me not to take a salary reduction (for) the best interest of the organization. I’ll just say that I’m very conflicted in that regard, very uncomfortable with where I’m at, and I very much wish there was a solution that would both satisfy the concerns and best support the community.”
Earlier this year, Fawson said, the SEKMHC board had frozen executive salaries. But, he said, the next 990, which has not yet been filed, will likely show an increase. The Hebets salary plan the board adopted included an increase for 2024 as well, an adjustment made before the salary freeze went into effect. Fawson estimated his current pay to be $495,000 plus benefits similar to 2023.
That amounts to $686,941.
Holy smokes.
Fawson and his board were naive at best in accepting the recommendations from an out-of-state consulting firm without taking into account the mood of the community. The eye-popping salaries paid to Fawson and his top executives may be justified by the market, but they may end up doing more harm to the center than good. What Fawson and his board have traded for competitive wages is the trust of the county commissions that appoint the center’s governing board. Some of those commissioners, including David Lee, who kicked the hornet’s nest in February, already believe the center is an experiment in socialized medicine diverting patients from the local Iola hospital.
Should staff salaries have been adjusted to keep and recruit therapists and others? Of course. But quadrupling the CEO salary and benefits? Risky at any time, but downright foolish in this age of populist revolt. It’s like handing a hammer to those who, out of misunderstanding or malice, would like to beat the system to pieces.

Phillip Randolph. This was the first predominantly African-American labor union in the U.S.
Pullman CarsIt was in 1862 that George Pullman launched the first deluxe railroad sleeping cars bearing his name. They were an instant hit, offering middle and upper-class passengers the comforts of home while on the rails.


All of the Pullman Car conductors were white, but the porters (who tended to the passengers) were Black. Many of them were former slaves. Pullman theorized they would be used to the subservient roles of lugging baggage, making up the sleeping berths and serving the white passengers’ every whim.
After they retired for the night, passengers could place their shoes in a small compartment accessible from the corridor where the porters would retrieve and shine them while passengers slept.
Long hours, low payPullman’s porters had to be on call 20 hours a day, serving passengers and tending to boardings at intermediate stations.
Porters worked 400 hours per month with their time off being uncompensated. They had to pay for their own uniforms, meals and shoe shine kits. Between runs, even away from home, they paid for their own lodging. The hours they spent before and after each trip preparing and cleaning the car were also unpaid… much like some present day flight attendants.
In 1926 the average porter earned $72 a month in wages and got about $58 a month in tips. In contrast, Pullman’s white conductors (who had a union) earned $150 for a 240 hour month, plus benefits and a pension.
Still, Pullman’s Black porters made a good income compared to other Black workers, allowing many to enter the middle class in railroad hub cities like Chicago and St Louis.As one historian put it, a Pullman porter had the best job in his community and the worst job on the train. There was no room for promotion. Passengers often referred to Pullman porters by demeaning names like “boy”, or “George,” applying the first name of the Pullman cars’ owner.
Unionization
In 1925 A. Phillip Randolph started organizing The Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters under the rallying cry “Fight or be slaves.” It took a decade of court battles and the threat of a national strike before the union was recognized in 1937, giving porters a big wage hike and a 240-hour per month work schedule.
Randolph and others in the Brotherhood went on to become leaders of the civil rights movement. One porter, Edgar D. Nixon, helped organize the Montgomery Alabama bus boycott after Rosa Parks’ arrest in 1955.
Among other famous Pullman porters were future U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, activist Malcolm X and photographer Gordon Parks.
By the 1950’s, train service was in decline and in 1959 Pullman closed up its sleeping car business. Some porters went on to work with the legacy railroads and a few were still around when Amtrak took over.
In 1981 when the Pullman company delivered its last Superliner sleeping car, it was named after George Pullman. Years later, after Randolph had passed away, another Amtrak sleeping car was named in his honor.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Pullman-Porters-AmericanHistory-dot-edu.jpg,,,2025-08-24 04:56:10.026633

(Photo by Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado House of Representatives gave final approval to six bills on Saturday, sending them to the Senate for consideration as part of the ongoing special legislative session. 
The bills focus on raising additional state tax revenue to help close the state’s nearly $800 million budget hole, which was triggered by federal tax code changes.
House lawmakers started off by approving House Bill 25B-1001 in a party-line vote of 43-19, with Democrats in favor. The bill would make permanent an add-back for federal qualified business income deductions on state taxes for high-income taxpayers. The bill’s fiscal note estimates it would raise about $46 million in the current fiscal year and about $95 million in the next one.
Next up was House Bill 25B-1002, which House lawmakers approved in a party-line vote of 43-20, after more than an hour of debate. The Democrats voted in favor of the bill, which would expand the list of countries that the state considers to be tax havens. The bill would bring in an estimated $36 million in state tax revenue for the current fiscal year, according to its fiscal note.
The bill’s sponsors have argued that the bill closes corporate tax loopholes that are costly for the state. But Republicans said the bill would harm businesses.
“It doesn’t really give these corporations and companies the motivation to expand, to hire more people, which is what we need,” said Rep. Carlos Barron, a Fort Lupton Republican who voted against the bill.
House Democrats used a seldom-used chamber rule to prevent debate on four of the bills after Republicans spoke at length about the first pair of bills. They used House Rule 16 to call the question — end debate and immediately vote on the bill in question — as debate on HB25B-1002 extended past an hour. They then used Rule 16 on the next four bills. 
Members are typically allotted ten minutes each ahead of the final vote on a bill, meaning that if all 21 Republicans used their time, debate would be over three hours per bill.
House Bill 25B-1003 passed the House in a 41-21 party-line vote. It would repeal a tax incentive for insurance companies that have at least 2.5% of their domestic employees in Colorado. The bill would raise $44 million for the state in the current fiscal year and $91 million the following year, based on the estimate in its fiscal note. 
House lawmakers approved House Bill 25B-1004 in another party-line, 41-20 vote. This bill would allow qualifying companies to pay certain state taxes early at a discount, which its sponsors have argued is necessary during the state budget crunch. The bill’s fiscal note estimates it would raise up to $100 million during the current fiscal year.
The fifth proposal, House Bill 25B-1005, passed the House in a 37-25 vote. This bill would repeal a provision in state law that allows retailers to keep 4% of their sales tax collections, as a way for the businesses to cover the cost of collecting the taxes. The bill’s fiscal note estimates it would raise $28 million in revenue for the state in the current fiscal year, and $57 million the next year. 
By mid-afternoon on Saturday, House lawmakers made it through the last of the six bills: House Bill 25B-1006. The bill, which would loan $100 million from the Unclaimed Property Trust Fund to prevent major health insurance premium increases, passed the House in a 41-22 vote.",https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Special_Session_Day_3-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-23 18:57:41.562964

(Photo by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The Trump administration intends to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he rejected a last-minute deal to remain in jail, plead guilty to human smuggling charges and be deported to Costa Rica, a legal notice filed Saturday by his attorneys said.
The behind-the-scenes ultimatum bolsters defense claims that Abrego is the target of “selective and vindictive prosecution” by the government for contesting his wrongful deportation to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador in March, Abrego’s lawyers wrote.
The revelations come one day after Abrego was released from a Tennessee jail where he was awaiting a January trial on human smuggling charges. The sheet-metal apprentice was on his way back to Maryland, where he lives in Prince George’s County with his wife and children, when his attorneys received an emailed notice at 4:01 p.m. Friday from Immigration and Customs Enforcement saying it may send him to Uganda.
Abrego, an undocumented immigrant who was arrested in March, was swiftly and erroneously deported to a prison in El Salvador, even though a previous court order prohibited his deportation there because of possible threats from Salvadoran gangs. The Trump administration acknowledged his deportation was a mistake, and since then his case has focused unwelcome public scrutiny on the administration’s immigration crackdown tactics.
Kilmar Abrego Garcia released from custody in Tennessee, heading back to Maryland

On return to the U.S., Abrego was taken to Tennessee to face charges that an unremarkable 2022 traffic stop there with several immigrants in his car was really part of a human smuggling ring.  Abrego has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.
In a deal offered by the government late Thursday, it promised to deport Abrego to Costa Rica where he could live freely if he remained jailed until Monday, pleaded guilty to the Tennessee human smuggling charges and served the sentence imposed by the court, his attorneys wrote. The government of Costa Rica had agreed to take him, the filing said.
Abrego’s attorneys informed the Acting U.S. Attorney Rob McGuire, who is prosecuting the Tennessee case, they would “of course, communicate the government’s proposal to Mr. Abrego” but declined to agree to a demand that he remain incarcerated until Monday.
Abrego was released shortly after 2 p.m. Friday from a detention facility in Putnam County, Tennessee. Within minutes of Abrego’s release, a representative of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, informed his attorneys they intended to deport him to Uganda and ordered him to report to the agency’s field office in Baltimore, his attorneys wrote.
“The only thing that happened between Thursday — Costa Rica — and Friday — Uganda — was Mr. Abrego’s exercise of his legal entitlement to release under the Bail Reform Act and the Fifth Amendment,” his attorneys wrote.
Government officials again, late Friday evening, informed Abrego he has until first thing Monday morning to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica “or else that offer will be off the table forever.”
“There can be only one interpretation of these events: the (Department of Justice) and ICE are using their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat,” Abrego’s attorneys wrote.
Attorneys for Abrego on Wednesday filed a motion to dismiss the criminal charges against him, calling the case a clear example of “selective and vindictive prosecution” by the Trump administration in legal filings last week.
The ultimatums offered by the Trump administration serve to underscore Abrego’s allegations that it is acting with vindictiveness towards him, their latest legal filing said.
“The Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security “are obviously working in lockstep to coerce Mr. Abrego into accepting a guilty plea in his criminal case, holding over his head the prospect of possible indefinite detention — or worse — in a country halfway across the world,” the attorneys wrote. “It is difficult to imagine a path the government could have taken that would have better emphasized its vindictiveness.”

As part of the campaign against him, Abrego’s motion to dismiss said, Trump administration officials early on mounted a public campaign to distract from the erroneous deportation by smearing him. It started with Vice President JD Vance falsely claiming Abrego was an MS-13 gang member, and “other Executive Branch officials soon joined the Vice President’s effort to discredit Mr. Abrego, claiming publicly that he was violent, a gang member, and a terrorist,” the motion said.
Those attacks continued Friday when Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem complained in a social media post about “this publicity hungry Maryland judge mandating this illegal alien who is a MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator be allowed free.”
Abrego has never faced any of those charges in the U.S. Even though Noem also blasted a Maryland judge, Abrego’s release Friday was ordered by U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes in Tennessee, not U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland, who is overseeing his original deportation case.
Abrego is scheduled to appear at ICE office in Baltimore on Monday. According to the email from the agency, the 72-hour clock on his threatened deportation was paused over the weekend.

Republican President Donald Trump’s continued power grab in the nation’s capital, and his threat to expand his militarized takeover to other Democratic-led cities, is setting up a high-stakes showdown over the country’s democracy that pits him prominently against a familiar political foe: Black women.
On Aug. 11, Trump declared that crime in the District of Columbia was “out of control,” despite violent crime being at a 30-year low, and directed Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Black woman, to hand over control of the city’s police force.

This report was first published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of The 19th News Network.

Trump then attempted to oust the city’s police commissioner, a Black woman, and replace her with a white man, before backing down after the city threatened legal action. Now, his Justice Department is investigating the accuracy of the reported crime statistics, which the agency touted in a still-available press release earlier this year.
“Mayor Bowser better get her act straight or she won’t be mayor very long because we’ll take it over with the federal government and run it like it’s supposed to be run,” Trump said from the Oval Office on Friday, calling the city a “crime-infested rat hole.”

Earlier this summer, Trump deployed Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to protests over his administration’s immigration raids — the first time in 60 years that a president had taken such action without a governor’s request. Los Angeles is led by Mayor Karen Bass, another Black woman, who confronted the uninvited federal agents in a high-profile exchange at a city park.
Using the District of Columbia as a template, even though 79 percent of its residents oppose Trump’s actions, according to a Washington Post/Schar School poll, the president has, citing crime, threatened to send federal law enforcement back into Los Angeles, and to Baltimore, Chicago, Oakland and New York — all cities led by Democratic Black mayors, including Barbara Lee in Oakland.
And the power struggle between the administration, its allies and Black women is not limited to mayors. Texas state Rep. Nicole Collier said she was held as a “political prisoner” in the state Capitol overnight this week due to Democrats’ opposition to a Trump-ordered redistricting plan aimed at shoring up U.S. House control in the midterms. Trump, who has lobbed escalating complaints at the Federal Reserve for not lowering interest rates, on Wednesday called for the resignation not of its chair, Jerome Powell, a White man, but its governor, Linda Cook, after his housing finance agency chair launched an investigation into her personal mortgages.


Let us know what you think...


 

While Trump’s retribution is neither currently nor historically limited to Black women, or to women or people of color more broadly, and is directed at anyone who opposes him, including one-time supporters, there are twin realities colliding when it comes to Black women political leaders, said Sydney Carr-Glenn, a political scientist at the College of the Holy Cross. Black women have in recent years reached new levels of political power and are the electoral group that most opposes the president. It’s converging at an “interesting time,” Carr-Glenn said, given the “simultaneous penalty that Black women face in this country on account of being both Black and women.”
“We have seen Black women really ascending to these roles of political prominence in recent years in ways we haven’t seen before,” said Carr-Glenn, who studies race, ethnicity and politics. She cited big-city mayors like Bowser, Bass and Lee, along with high-profile Trump critic U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett; Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman in the role; and former Vice President Kamala Harris, whose South Asian, Black and gender identities drew related attacks from Trump as the two competed to lead the country in the 2024 elections.
“Black women have certainly been breaking these barriers but it’s also come at a really interesting time in our American government, and our democracy, when we are seeing this rise in authoritarianism,” Carr-Glenn added. “And it presents different challenges for Black women who are trying to really push back against what we’ve seen.”

For Harris, her identities as a Black, South Asian woman meant enduring and sometimes having to respond to attacks based on her race and gender during the 2024 campaign. Trump amplified suggestions that Harris traded sex to get ahead in her career and questioned whether she was actually Black, suggesting she was deploying her racial identity for political benefit.
In the closing weeks of the race, high-profile Trump supporter and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson likened Trump to a dad who was going to spank Harris because she was a “bad little girl.” Then-Trump ally Elon Musk’s super PAC cut an ad that called Harris a “big ol’ c-word,” before eventually saying the “c” stood for communist.
Though Harris’ presidential bid was historic, becoming the first Black woman to be nominated by a major party, she ultimately failed to be elected as the country’s top executive. No Black woman has been elected governor of a state yet either, noted Jamil Scott, an assistant professor at Georgetown University who has written about the political power of Black women mayors.
“So where is the next place to let the backlash flow? It’s in cities with very visible executives that are Black women,” she said. “This is in many ways a political warning, a political message, to say to these Black women and other Black mayors and other women of color mayors, ‘Your leadership can be challenged, too.’”
Victoria Woodards, the mayor of Tacoma, Washington, and a board of trustees member for the African American Mayors Association, said Black women mayors are resilient despite the realities they face in a job that requires balancing community needs with external pressures from state and federal governments.
“These are women who, despite all of the things that have been in their way or barriers that have come to them, they are still fighting the fight. They are still getting up every day and going to city hall,” she said. “They are still doing the jobs, because that’s what’s required of us.”
Wendy Via is co-founder and CEO of Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, an organization that tracks how online discourse shapes the potential for political violence. Via said the president’s actions against the mayors and their jurisdictions are “part of the authoritarian playbook” to try to crush political opposition. She noted that demonizing them creates an “enemy” that can later be used to justify military action and formal policy that removes rights.
“I do not think it is an accident that the mayors he’s gone after have been Black women, because another trait of authoritarianism is demonizing communities that have a history of being marginalized,” Via said. “When you can send in the troops and it’s a Black woman leader on the receiving end, then it’s not such a big deal to send in the troops — because they’re already the enemy, and they must not be capable of managing their city.”
The manner in which Trump insults Black women political leaders frequently calls into question their ability and aptitude to do their jobs.
The president just this week repeated a demand that Crockett, the Dallas-area representative who uses her post on the House Oversight Committee to hold the administration accountable, take an intelligence test. He also put quotation marks around the word congresswoman in a move to delegitimize Crockett’s stature and demeaned the progressive group of mostly women House members of color known as the Squad.
Crockett responded in a fundraising email that “Donald Trump just cannot stop thinking about me. He’s insulted me, challenged me to an IQ test — but now, he’s finally said something I agree with.” She then linked to a social media post in which the president wrote: “Jasmine Crockett is the future of the Democrat party!”
Black women have also faced physical restraint and even arrest for opposing the president’s actions.
Rep. LaMonica McIver of New Jersey is the first sitting member of Congress to be prosecuted by the Trump administration. She was indicted on three counts of “forcibly impeding” law enforcement during a confrontation earlier this summer outside an ICE facility. She pleaded not guilty, and in a recent court filing argued that her prosecution showed “unconstitutional differential treatment” because the Trump administration dropped cases against defendants facing the same charges over their actions during the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.
When McIver denounced as racist Trump’s characterization of his militarized incursion into the District of Columbia as “liberation day,” a White House spokesman called her an “unserious person.”

In Texas, Collier spent the night in the Capitol alone after she refused a GOP-mandated law enforcement escort to monitor her whereabouts ahead of a vote on the Trump-requested congressional redistricting map, which had previously prompted Democrats to delay the vote by leaving the state, and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to order their arrests.
“I thought: ‘Hell no,’” Collier said in a video released to the public.
Collier settled in for her long night on the House floor with a blue eye mask and white-and-red blankets and a small Texas flag that marked a page in the book “African Founders: How Enslaved People Expanded American Ideals.” She abruptly left a video call with U.S. Sen. Cory Booker and California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday after someone off screen informed her she faced a felony charge for speaking from the Capitol.
Scott said the president may be miscalculating how leaders like Bass and Bowser will respond to his attempts to seize their power — partly because of their own years of experience in politics, and partly because of how the information ecosystem is shaped now. Mayors are able to directly communicate with constituents in ways that may have been more limited in the past. Plus, social media platforms allow the public to see the impact of troops on the streets in these heavily Democratic communities where they are not welcomed.
“There’s a narrative that’s being placed on them, but they’re able to negate those narratives by what they themselves put out there on social media,” she said. “These are folks who are not shying away from the media … they want to talk about what they’re doing.”

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)When California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled his plan to retaliate if Republican-led Texas redrew its congressional districts to favor the GOP, he affirmed his support for less partisan maps — and then promised to “meet fire with fire.”
“We’re doing it mindful that we want to model better behavior,” Newsom told reporters in Los Angeles earlier this month, nodding to the independent system his state currently uses to draw districts. “ … But we cannot unilaterally disarm. We can’t stand back and watch this democracy disappear.”
President Donald Trump’s call for Republicans to redraw U.S. House districts so the party can win more seats in the 2026 midterm elections — to gerrymander them — has triggered a redistricting frenzy this summer that also threatens to prompt moves by Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and New York, among others. Ohio was already set to redraw its lines, even before the current fracas.
The battle for partisan advantage is placing Democratic politicians, advocates of less partisan maps and others who support curbs on gerrymandering in an uncomfortable position, pitting their desire for change against fears that Trump will take advantage of their scruples to wring more GOP seats out of a handful of key states. Some say they accept that Democratic states need to respond, while others warn retaliation will only yield short-term gains.
The Texas House passed a new map on Wednesday, clearing the way for a final vote in the state Senate and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature. In California, lawmakers passed their own map on Thursday, setting up a statewide vote in November over the new districts.
Other states are now likely to follow, as Republicans and Democrats scramble for a political leg up.
But gerrymandering opponents say the current moment has the potential to produce new energy for their movement. More people are paying attention to gerrymandering, they say, and new polls show the public opposes the practice. The rush to redraw maps demonstrates the need for Congress to set national limits, they say.
“I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard,” said David Daley, an author of books on gerrymandering and a senior fellow at FairVote, a Maryland-based nonpartisan group that supports ranked choice voting and multimember House districts to end the practice. “We will never have reform if a handful of states can act on their own.”
At the same time, some gerrymandering opponents fear states will unravel hard-fought victories. They wonder whether temporary measures, such as California potentially setting aside the independent commission it uses to redraw maps, could become permanent.
 ‘An unprecedented time’

State legislatures exercise primary control over congressional redistricting in 39 states, according to All About Redistricting, a compendium of information on map-drawing hosted by Loyola Law School in California. While some states use other methods, only nine states rely on independent commissions, which typically limit participation by elected officials and are favored by many gerrymandering opponents.
Most states draw maps once a decade after the census, making the mid-decade maneuvers and counter-maneuvers highly unusual (six states currently have only one representative, eliminating the need to draw district lines). But just a few seats could determine who controls the U.S. House. Republicans currently hold 219 seats to Democrats’ 212, with four vacancies.
“We affirm that gerrymandering, both racial and political, disenfranchises voters,” Virginia Kase Solomón, president and CEO of Common Cause, an organization that has long advocated for changes to the redistricting process, said during a press call the day before Newsom’s announcement.
“But this is an unprecedented time of political upheaval,” she said. People don’t want to see a situation develop where maps are redrawn every two years, she added.
The new Texas map could ease the path for Republicans to win an additional five seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Texas lawmakers rapidly advanced the redraw this week once Democratic state lawmakers returned to the state. They had traveled to other states to deny Texas House leaders the quorum required to approve the map, but returned after Newsom outlined California’s response.
Gerrymandering typically involves “packing” and “cracking.” “Packing” refers to the concentration of opposition party voters in a small number of districts to reduce competition elsewhere. “Cracking” means diluting the voting power of the opposing party’s supporters across many districts.
Texas Republicans have been frank that they are pursuing the redraw for partisan advantage. But they emphasize that no prohibition exists, in Texas or nationally, against mid-decade redistricting and that a 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision cleared the way for states to draw maps for partisan purposes, removing the power of federal courts to police political gerrymandering.
The new maps give Republicans a chance of winning additional districts but doesn’t guarantee victories, they add.
“The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance,” Texas state Rep. Todd Hunter, a Republican who carried the bill in the Texas House, said during floor debate on Wednesday. He added a short time later: “According to the U.S. Supreme Court, you can use political performance, and that is what we’ve done.”
 Tricky terrain

As Texas moves forward and California prepares to respond, Common Cause illustrates the tricky terrain anti-gerrymandering advocates are now navigating.
The group, headquartered in Washington, D.C., fought to enact the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2008. But earlier this month, Common Cause declined to condemn California’s retaliation, saying it will judge the effort by whether the maps are a proportional response to gerrymanders in other states, whether the process includes meaningful public participation, and whether the maps expire and are replaced after the 2030 census through the state’s regular redistricting process, among other criteria.
Newsom’s proposal, the Election Rigging Response Act, will ask California voters in November to temporarily set aside the state’s redistricting commission and approve the new map drawn by the legislature. The commission would resume drawing maps following the census.
Recent polling shows widespread public opposition to gerrymandering. A YouGov poll of 1,116 Americans conducted in early August found 69% believe it should be illegal to draw districts in a way that makes it harder for members of a particular political party to elect their preferred candidates. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The number of Americans who say gerrymandering is a big problem has jumped in recent years. In the YouGov poll, 75% of respondents said it is a major problem when districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party, up from 66% in a 2022 survey.
Some California Republicans have responded to Newsom’s proposal by defending the commission system. A group of Republicans sued in state court to block the plan, but the California Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a request to temporarily halt the effort.
 ‘Is this bad for reform?’

While members of the public might say they favor citizen-led commissions, they may not care deeply about the issue, said David Hopkins, a political science professor at Boston College who has written on polarization in American politics. He called gerrymandering a “classic process subject” that comes off as “inside baseball” to many people.
“The legislators in states that haven’t adopted commissions clearly don’t feel any particular political pressure to do so,” Hopkins said.
Some Republicans in states weighing a mid-decade gerrymander also discount the risk of a public backlash.
In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe may call a special session this fall to redraw the state’s map in hopes of gaining an additional GOP seat in the U.S. House. James Harris, a Missouri Republican consultant with close ties to GOP officials in the state, said he wasn’t concerned redistricting would create momentum to change the process.
Missouri voters in recent years have approved ballot measures favored by Democrats, including one in 2018 that empowered a nonpartisan demographer to draw state legislative districts, though not congressional districts. But Republicans led a successful campaign to convince voters to repeal the changes two years later.
Harris painted any new potential map as part of a national effort to help Trump — who received 58.5% of the vote in Missouri last November.
“I think the lens is wanting to make sure the president has a majority in Congress so he can actually govern for the last two years versus two years of investigations, gridlock,” Harris said.
Advocates of less partisan maps said lawmakers aren’t likely to surrender their own role in mapmaking. While some state courts may limit redistricting excesses, federal courts stopped policing partisan gerrymandering following the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision. And the high court may soon weaken the judiciary’s power to block race-based gerrymandering.
Samuel Wang, director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which supports eliminating partisan gerrymandering, said the “one good thing” about the redistricting battle is that it’s prompted voters to pay attention to an arcane and technical issue. That could be a positive in the long run, he said, “if people can keep a cool head.”
Wang has written online that any response to Texas should remain measured and proportionate. California offers Democrats the only clean option to strike back, Wang wrote. Five Democratic seats could be added by redrawing the state.
“Is this bad for reform? I mean, I’m torn,” Wang told Stateline. “Because on the other hand, Democrats have been, over the last few decades, vocal in their advocacy for voting rights in various forms and now that advocacy is in question because they find a need to fight fire with fire.”
“So I guess the way I would characterize it is if they can hold it in check and not do it in every single state and just engage in whatever they’re doing where it will make a difference,” he said, “then we might not lose all the progress that’s been made.”

(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)This week, the Trump administration’s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced an effort to check the immigration status of people who get their health insurance through Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.
Medicaid is the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. For families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford private insurance, CHIP is a public program that provides low-cost health coverage for their children.
The feds will begin sending states monthly enrollment reports that identify people with Medicaid or CHIP whose immigration or citizenship status can’t be confirmed through federal databases. States are then responsible for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of individuals in those reports. States are expected to take “appropriate actions when necessary, including adjusting coverage or enforcing non-citizen eligibility rules,” according to a CMS press release.
States scramble to shield hospitals from GOP Medicaid cuts

“We are tightening oversight of enrollment to safeguard taxpayer dollars and guarantee that these vital programs serve only those who are truly eligible under the law,” Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who oversees CMS as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in a press release announcing the new program.
As of April, roughly 71 million adults and children nationwide have Medicaid coverage, while another 7 million children have insurance through CHIP. Immigrants under age 65 are less likely to be covered by Medicaid than U.S.-born citizens, according to an analysis from health research organization KFF.
Immigrants who are in the country illegally aren’t eligible for federally funded Medicaid and CHIP. Only citizens and certain lawfully present immigrants — green card holders and refugees, for example — can qualify.
But some states have chosen to expand Medicaid coverage for immigrants with their own funds. Twenty-three states offer pregnancy-related care regardless of citizenship or immigration status, according to KFF. Fourteen states provide coverage for children in low-income families regardless of immigration status, while seven states offer coverage to some adults regardless of status.
The tax and spending package President Donald Trump last month cuts federal spending on Medicaid by more than $1 trillion, leaving states to either make up the difference with their own funds or reduce coverage. But the new law also includes restrictions on coverage for certain immigrants, including stripping eligibility from refugees and asylum-seekers.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Five hours after the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) declared its Providence headquarters bat-free Friday, there was another bat sighting on the second floor of the five-story building.
That sent the agency scrambling to confirm for its staff that everything was still going according to plan, with pest control technicians scheduled to report to the Friendship Street building Saturday, according to an internal agency email sent Friday at 7:25 p.m.  
The agency still plans to reopen the office building Monday morning, following what it assumed was the successful removal of two bats found on the premises last week. The offices have been closed since Monday, Aug. 18. One bat was spotted and caught on Aug. 14. Another bat sighting came on Aug. 17, prompting the office shutdown. 
In a follow-up email sent to staff, union representatives, and Rhode Island Current around 10 p.m. Friday, DCYF Chief of Staff Misty Delgado wrote that the bat was sighted “before our contractors could begin sealing the entry points we had previously identified.”
“A professional pest control team will return to the building to locate and safely remove the bat to conduct a comprehensive search to ensure no other bats are present,” Delgado wrote. “Once the building has been cleared, our contractors will immediately begin their work to permanently seal all potential entry points.” 
Bats out, workers back in at DCYF headquarters

No details were available about who saw the bat Friday night and exactly where. 
SEIU Local 580 workers are concerned that the building’s age and condition, including poor ventilation, expose them to health and safety hazards. The union represents about 300 of the 460 workers who regularly occupy the building, where some labor long hours or into the night. 
The local’s president, Matthew Gunnip, fired off emails to DCYF leadership after the bat was spotted. In emails sent up to 11:59 p.m. Friday, Gunnip included responses from union members who were surveyed on Aug. 19 and again Friday night about their concerns about the health and safety conditions in the building.  
“[W]hy would a return to ‘business as usual’ be in order?” wrote one union member in the Friday night survey. “Shouldn’t the health and safety of not only the staff, but children and families who enter the building come first?”
“Yet another bat was found tonight? I thought the company secured the building?” wrote another union member.
The building’s lease is up for renewal, but the State Properties Committee has twice postponed a decision on a proposed 10-year lease renewal pending a public hearing for union input. That meeting has still not been scheduled as of Friday.

Eviction protections for bat families
Liz Frieling, co-owner of Vanguard Wildlife Solutions, a pest removal specialist in Coventry, who is not involved with the DCYF response, said the little brown bat and the big brown bat are Rhode Island’s two most common bat species and are known to favor human-made structures to raise their young.
Frieling said in a phone interview Saturday that removing bats from a property during June and July would strand baby bats who haven’t learned to fly. Then, bats hibernate from late October through May, making removal unfeasible then, too. That means pest control can only remove bats in select months. In Rhode Island, “eviction season” runs from August through mid-October, and once more in May, before the bats’ “maternity season” begins, according to Frieling.
“They say, ‘June and July, let them fly,’” she added. 
While Frieling couldn’t speak to the specific process being used at DCYF, she described one process of bat eviction. First, pest control workers identify entry points, which can be anything as small as ⅜ of an inch. Then, one-way valves are installed that allow bats to exit but not re-enter. As the bats depart nightly, the population in a building slowly evacuates, and it takes about two weeks for a full exodus, Frieling said. Then, the valves and any additional entry points are sealed back up.     
Based on last week’s timeline of events, and the appearance of multiple bats, Frieling said, “It’s not going to be just one or two bats.”
Colony sizes can vary, but a maternal colony for big brown bats is typically 40 to 100 bats. According to the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, bat colonies can be as small as a few mothers and their babies.
But even technicians have trouble knowing the exact size of a colony, Frieling said, because the bats hide themselves in a structure’s dark recesses, like attics or rafters.
“They’re not always popping into a living space,” she said. “If you’re seeing them in the living space, there is a colony there.”
A more reliable metric is guano, or bat excrement, Frieling said, as its presence and volume can help pest control determine the potential size of a colony. Frieling added that union members’ concerns about disease in guano, particularly histoplasmosis, are “reasonable.” But she added that to get sick one needs continued exposure to large amounts.
Frieling said old buildings like the Friendship Street headquarters can be a “nightmare for pest control” as they’re hard to seal, and it can “be difficult to fully exclude bats.”

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)When California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled his plan to retaliate if Republican-led Texas redrew its congressional districts to favor the GOP, he affirmed his support for less partisan maps — and then promised to “meet fire with fire.”
“We’re doing it mindful that we want to model better behavior,” Newsom told reporters in Los Angeles earlier this month, nodding to the independent system his state currently uses to draw districts. “ … But we cannot unilaterally disarm. We can’t stand back and watch this democracy disappear.”
President Donald Trump’s call for Republicans to redraw U.S. House districts so the party can win more seats in the 2026 midterm elections — to gerrymander them — has triggered a redistricting frenzy this summer that also threatens to prompt moves by Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and New York, among others. Ohio was already set to redraw its lines, even before the current fracas.
The battle for partisan advantage is placing Democratic politicians, advocates of less partisan maps and others who support curbs on gerrymandering in an uncomfortable position, pitting their desire for change against fears that Trump will take advantage of their scruples to wring more GOP seats out of a handful of key states. Some say they accept that Democratic states need to respond, while others warn retaliation will only yield short-term gains.
The Texas House passed a new map on Wednesday, clearing the way for a final vote in the state Senate and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature. In California, lawmakers passed their own map on Thursday, setting up a statewide vote in November over the new districts.
Other states are now likely to follow, as Republicans and Democrats scramble for a political leg up.












I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard.


– David Daley, senior fellow at FairVote




But gerrymandering opponents say the current moment has the potential to produce new energy for their movement. More people are paying attention to gerrymandering, they say, and new polls show the public opposes the practice. The rush to redraw maps demonstrates the need for Congress to set national limits, they say.
“I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard,” said David Daley, an author of books on gerrymandering and a senior fellow at FairVote, a Maryland-based nonpartisan group that supports ranked choice voting and multimember House districts to end the practice. “We will never have reform if a handful of states can act on their own.”
At the same time, some gerrymandering opponents fear states will unravel hard-fought victories. They wonder whether temporary measures, such as California potentially setting aside the independent commission it uses to redraw maps, could become permanent.
 ‘An unprecedented time’

State legislatures exercise primary control over congressional redistricting in 39 states, according to All About Redistricting, a compendium of information on map-drawing hosted by Loyola Law School in California. While some states use other methods, only nine states rely on independent commissions, which typically limit participation by elected officials and are favored by many gerrymandering opponents.
Most states draw maps once a decade after the census, making the mid-decade maneuvers and counter-maneuvers highly unusual (six states currently have only one representative, eliminating the need to draw district lines). But just a few seats could determine who controls the U.S. House. Republicans currently hold 219 seats to Democrats’ 212, with four vacancies.
“We affirm that gerrymandering, both racial and political, disenfranchises voters,” Virginia Kase Solomón, president and CEO of Common Cause, an organization that has long advocated for changes to the redistricting process, said during a press call the day before Newsom’s announcement.
“But this is an unprecedented time of political upheaval,” she said. People don’t want to see a situation develop where maps are redrawn every two years, she added.
The new Texas map could ease the path for Republicans to win an additional five seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Texas lawmakers rapidly advanced the redraw this week once Democratic state lawmakers returned to the state. They had traveled to other states to deny Texas House leaders the quorum required to approve the map, but returned after Newsom outlined California’s response.
Gerrymandering typically involves “packing” and “cracking.” “Packing” refers to the concentration of opposition party voters in a small number of districts to reduce competition elsewhere. “Cracking” means diluting the voting power of the opposing party’s supporters across many districts.
Texas Republicans have been frank that they are pursuing the redraw for partisan advantage. But they emphasize that no prohibition exists, in Texas or nationally, against mid-decade redistricting and that a 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision cleared the way for states to draw maps for partisan purposes, removing the power of federal courts to police political gerrymandering.
The new maps give Republicans a chance of winning additional districts but doesn’t guarantee victories, they add.
“The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance,” Texas state Rep. Todd Hunter, a Republican who carried the bill in the Texas House, said during floor debate on Wednesday. He added a short time later: “According to the U.S. Supreme Court, you can use political performance, and that is what we’ve done.”
 Tricky terrain

As Texas moves forward and California prepares to respond, Common Cause illustrates the tricky terrain anti-gerrymandering advocates are now navigating.
The group, headquartered in Washington, D.C., fought to enact the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2008. But earlier this month, Common Cause declined to condemn California’s retaliation, saying it will judge the effort by whether the maps are a proportional response to gerrymanders in other states, whether the process includes meaningful public participation, and whether the maps expire and are replaced after the 2030 census through the state’s regular redistricting process, among other criteria.
Newsom’s proposal, the Election Rigging Response Act, will ask California voters in November to temporarily set aside the state’s redistricting commission and approve the new map drawn by the legislature. The commission would resume drawing maps following the census.
Recent polling shows widespread public opposition to gerrymandering. A YouGov poll of 1,116 Americans conducted in early August found 69% believe it should be illegal to draw districts in a way that makes it harder for members of a particular political party to elect their preferred candidates. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The number of Americans who say gerrymandering is a big problem has jumped in recent years. In the YouGov poll, 75% of respondents said it is a major problem when districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party, up from 66% in a 2022 survey.
Some California Republicans have responded to Newsom’s proposal by defending the commission system. A group of Republicans sued in state court to block the plan, but the California Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a request to temporarily halt the effort.
 ‘Is this bad for reform?’

While members of the public might say they favor citizen-led commissions, they may not care deeply about the issue, said David Hopkins, a political science professor at Boston College who has written on polarization in American politics. He called gerrymandering a “classic process subject” that comes off as “inside baseball” to many people.
“The legislators in states that haven’t adopted commissions clearly don’t feel any particular political pressure to do so,” Hopkins said.
Some Republicans in states weighing a mid-decade gerrymander also discount the risk of a public backlash.
In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe may call a special session this fall to redraw the state’s map in hopes of gaining an additional GOP seat in the U.S. House. James Harris, a Missouri Republican consultant with close ties to GOP officials in the state, said he wasn’t concerned redistricting would create momentum to change the process.
Missouri voters in recent years have approved ballot measures favored by Democrats, including one in 2018 that empowered a nonpartisan demographer to draw state legislative districts, though not congressional districts. But Republicans led a successful campaign to convince voters to repeal the changes two years later.
Harris painted any new potential map as part of a national effort to help Trump — who received 58.5% of the vote in Missouri last November.
“I think the lens is wanting to make sure the president has a majority in Congress so he can actually govern for the last two years versus two years of investigations, gridlock,” Harris said.
Advocates of less partisan maps said lawmakers aren’t likely to surrender their own role in mapmaking. While some state courts may limit redistricting excesses, federal courts stopped policing partisan gerrymandering following the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision. And the high court may soon weaken the judiciary’s power to block race-based gerrymandering.
Samuel Wang, director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which supports eliminating partisan gerrymandering, said the “one good thing” about the redistricting battle is that it’s prompted voters to pay attention to an arcane and technical issue. That could be a positive in the long run, he said, “if people can keep a cool head.”
Wang has written online that any response to Texas should remain measured and proportionate. California offers Democrats the only clean option to strike back, Wang wrote. Five Democratic seats could be added by redrawing the state.
“Is this bad for reform? I mean, I’m torn,” Wang told Stateline. “Because on the other hand, Democrats have been, over the last few decades, vocal in their advocacy for voting rights in various forms and now that advocacy is in question because they find a need to fight fire with fire.”
“So I guess the way I would characterize it is if they can hold it in check and not do it in every single state and just engage in whatever they’re doing where it will make a difference,” he said, “then we might not lose all the progress that’s been made.”

(Photo by Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado Legislature is meeting in a special session to address a nearly $800 million hole in the state budget. Work began on Thursday morning and is expected to last through the weekend.
After Republicans in Congress passed the federal tax cut and spending bill in July, Colorado’s estimated tax revenue collections shrunk by about $1.2 billion for the current fiscal year, which began July 1. Most of that is a loss of corporate income taxes.
Colorado has to have a balanced state budget, so lawmakers must figure out a way to get backed to a balanced bottom line. The Democratic majority in both chambers, alongside Gov. Jared Polis, plan to do that by dipping into the state’s reserves, cutting program spending and passing an array of tax laws to eliminate some deductions and loopholes.
In his call for the special session, Polis also allowed bills on health insurance premiums and artificial intelligence regulations. A controversial AI law is set to go into effect next February and it has been a longtime goal of Polis and moderates to tweak it before then.
Legislative action is live-streamed and archived on the General Assembly’s website.

Colorado Legislature begins third day of special session


By: Sara Wilson - Saturday August 23, 2025 12:27 pm





The House began work on the third day of the special legislative session around 10 a.m. on Saturday morning. The plan is do final votes on a series of tax-related bills and send them over to the Senate for consideration.
Their first vote, after about two hours of debate, was a 43-19 approval of House Bill 25B-1001, which would make permanent an add-back for federal qualified business income deduction on state taxes.
In federal law, some businesses can deduct up to 20% of their QBI for their taxes. It was set to expire this year, but the recent federal tax and spending law extended that tax deduction. The bill would continue to decouple Colorado from the deduction, so taxpayers making above $500,000 individually or $1,000,000 jointly would need to add back that federal deduction for their state taxes.
Republicans argued that the federal deduction is important for small business owners in the state.
“This bill removes a key deduction passed in federal law. It’s a deduction designed to level the playing field between large corporations and small businesses,” Rep. Brandi Bradley, a Littleton Republican, said.
But bill sponsor Rep. Emily Sirota, a Denver Democrat, countered that the bill just maintains the status quo in Colorado tax code.
“They still get this benefit at the federal level. In this bill, we’re not making tax policy change. We are simply extending our current tax policy,” she said.
The bill’s fiscal note estimates it will raise about $46 million in the current fiscal year and about $95 million in the next one.
The House has five more bills on its calendar for final votes today. It will likely then head into initial debate on the bills cleared through committee yesterday.









Amended AI bill proposes to delay implementation of 2024 law


By: Sara Wilson - Friday August 22, 2025 5:36 pm





House Bill 25B-1008, one of the dueling artificial intelligence bills introduced by Colorado lawmakers during the special session, was gutted during its House Appropriations Committee hearing on Friday afternoon to become a simple extension of the controversial 2024 law’s effective date.
The bill would now push implementation of Senate Bill 24-205 until October 2026, rather than February 2026. The change was approved on an 8-3 bipartisan vote and now heads to the full House for debate.
“That’s where we are, so that we as a Legislature can come back to this issue and have a proper discussion when have time during a session. Doing this during a special session is quite difficult,” Rep. William Lindstedt, a Broomfield Democrat, said. “I’m asking that we move out the date so we can do this responsibly during the next session.”

Colorado Democrats want to raise revenue for food assistance program during special session


By: Sara Wilson -  4:00 pm





Colorado voters could be asked this November whether the state can keep extra tax money to fully fund universal school meals and offset lost federal funding for food assistance programs.
The Legislature referred Proposition MM to the ballot during its regular lawmaking session earlier this year, seeking to raise more money for the Healthy School Meals for All program. Senate Bill 25B-3, being considered during the current special session, would tweak that proposition to allow any leftover money to cover costs associated with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.

Senate ends work for the day as House sets slugglish pace for bill debate


By: Sara Wilson -  3:55 pm





As of mid-afternoon on Friday, the Senate had adjourned and the House broke into committee work after moving through just two bills in floor debate.
Senate Bill 25B-4, the artificial intelligence bill from Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez, was originally scheduled for its appropriations committee hearing, but that is now delayed as sponsors work through possible amendments.  The bill has an approximate $7 million annual price tag to retain more employees in the Office of Information and Technology and Judicial Department.
The Senate will continue work on Saturday.
The other AI bill, favored by moderates and the governor, is set for its own appropriations committee hearing in the House later on Friday afternoon.
The House got through two bills for initial floor debate and voice votes in four hours. The chamber recessed around 2 p.m. for committee work, including for those four bills passed in the Senate on Friday morning.









Colorado Senate approves four bills on second day of special session

Senate gives initial OK to 4 bills on first day of special session


By: Sara Wilson - Thursday August 21, 2025 9:03 pm





By the end of Thursday, the Colorado Legislature made it through the bulk of their committee work for the special session and the Senate gave its initial approval to four bills. Tomorrow morning, the Senate will have formal votes on those bills and the House will begin floor debate on its own set of bills.
The bills the Senate considered on second reading were:

Senate Bill 25B-1: This bill sets a process for the governor to notify and consult with the Joint Budget Committee on mid-year spending cuts needed to overcome a revenue shortfall, like the ones he is poised to do soon after this special session. The governor would be able to suspend and cut state funding, and therefore need to meet with the JBC, if the reserve needs to be tapped by up to 2% of the General Fund budget, or if that reserve is projected to dip below $1 billion.
Senate Bill 25B-2: This would allow the state to pay for Medicaid services from organizations that provide reproductive health care, namely Planned Parenthood, that the federal government has withheld Medicaid money from.
Senate Bill 25B-3: This changes a referred ballot measure in November to ask voters if the state can use extra money collected for universal school meals to also cover costs related to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Senate Bill 25B-5: This bill would reallocate about $260,000 from the wolf reintroduction program to the state health insurance fund. It was amended in committee to still allow the capture and release of wolves this winter.

The Senate still needs to take up Senate Bill 25B-4, the artificial intelligence bill focused on transparency and disclosure. That bill, backed by progressive lawmakers and consumer advocates, would require notification when people interact with AI and allow people to request information about how AI influences important decisions related to things like employment or school admissions. It awaits a hearing in the Appropriations Committee.
Over in the House, committees gave approval to the series of Democrat-backed tax policies. The chamber will start debate on them tomorrow. Those were:

House Bill 25B-1001: This would permanently extend a requirement that high-income taxpayers add back their qualified business income federal tax deductions when calculating their Colorado taxable income.
House Bill 25B-1002: This bill would expand the list of countries that the state considers to be tax havens.
House Bill 25B-1003: This would repeal a tax incentive for insurance companies that have at least 2.5% of their domestic employees in Colorado.
House Bill 25B-1004: This would allow qualifying companies to pay certain state taxes early at a discount.
House Bill 25B-1005: This bill would repeal a provision in state law that allows retailers to keep 4% of their sales tax collections, as a way for the businesses to cover the cost of collecting the taxes.

A House committee also signed off on House Bill 25B-1006, which would loan $100 million from the Unclaimed Property Trust Fund to prevent major health insurance premium increases.
House Bill 25B-1008, the dueling AI bill, also cleared its committee even with some Democrats voting against it. That bill would require companies to tell consumers when they are interacting with AI and fold the technology into the state’s existing anti-discrimination and consumer-protection laws. Bill sponsors removed a provisions that would have only allowed the attorney general, not consumers, from suing developers and deployers that violate consumer-protection laws.
Both HB25-1008 and HB25B-1006 need to pass the Appropriations Committee.
Democrats, who make up a majority in both chambers, also killed Republican-backed bills in committee on Thursday. The entire House State, Civic, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee agenda, for example, was made of Republican bills that died.

Lawmakers back off plan to pause Colorado’s wolf reintroduction program


By: Chase Woodruff -  5:16 pm





Colorado lawmakers gave initial approval Thursday to a bill to redirect a small amount of state money from gray wolf restoration efforts to a health insurance affordability fund, but stopped short of requiring Colorado Parks and Wildlife to pause the capture and release of new wolves this winter.
With the Legislature convened for a special session to cope with a billion-dollar revenue shortfall triggered by changes to the federal tax code, Senate Bill 25B-5 would withhold $264,268 from the state’s general fund previously appropriated for wolf reintroduction. The money would instead be directed to the state’s Health Insurance Affordability Enterprise, which helps subsidize health coverage costs and faces an estimated shortfall of around $100 million after Congress failed to extend federal tax credits for insurance premiums.

Republican-backed artificial intelligence bills killed in committee


By: Sara Wilson -  4:13 pm





Both Republican-backed bills on artificial intelligence died on the first day of the special legislative session, as Senate Bill 25B-8 and House Bill 25B-1009 did not make it through their respective committees.
“Because of the pace of the special session, I did not have the time I needed to refine the language for the standard our small businesses deserve,” Rep. Ron Weinberg, a Loveland Republican, told the House Business Affairs and Labor Committee before he asked members to vote against his bill.
His bill would have narrowed the definition of “consequential decision” in the state’s forthcoming artificial intelligence law to include decisions related to employment or public safety. The Senate bill, backed by Republican Sen. Mark Baisley of Woodland Park, would have broadly prohibited discrimination using any technology.
Lawmakers are considering changes to the state’s artificial intelligence law, which was passed in 2024 and is set to go into effect next February, at the behest of Gov. Jared Polis. The technology business community worry about implementation of the law, which sets rules for companies that use AI in their decision making, while consumer rights advocates say the law it gives necessary guardrails for technology that can inform life-changing decisions.
The Legislature will likely debate and vote on two competing AI-related bills backed by Democrats. Legislation from the sponsors of the 2024, Senate Bill 25B-4, law would strip the law to become essentially a disclosure policy. The other bill, House Bill 25B-1008, would extend existing civil rights laws and consumer protections to AI and require notice if a consumer is interacting with AI in some circumstances.
The Senate bill passed its committee earlier this afternoon. The House bill’s committee hearing was ongoing as of 4:15 p.m. on Thursday.









Colorado Senate committee approves bill to fund Medicaid reimbursements for abortion providers

The Colorado Senate Health and Human Services committee on Thursday approved a bill to use state money to fund Medicaid reimbursements for reproductive health care providers that have recently faced federal funding cuts.
Senate Bill 25B-2  passed the committee on a party-line vote, with Democrats in favor. The bill was introduced because of the “enormously negative impact” of the federal Republican domestic policy law on Coloradans seeking abortion services and other reproductive health care, bill sponsor Sen. Jeff Bridges, a Greenwood Village Democrat, said. The law, which President Donald Trump signed in July, blocks certain abortion providers from receiving Medicaid funding.
The bill would require the Department of Health Care Policy and Financing to use state funds to reimburse health care providers that are prohibited from receiving federal Medicaid reimbursements. The non-partisan Legislative Council Staff estimates the bill would cost the state a maximum of $4.4 million during the current fiscal year, which began on July 1.
Jack Teter, the vice president of government affairs for Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, said 991 appointments had to be canceled in the days after the federal law went into effect. Planned Parenthood’s operations are now in limbo, Teter said, while challenges to the law’s provision affecting abortion providers move through federal courts.
“We can’t keep canceling people’s appointments and then trying to bring them back again,” Teter said. “It’s not sustainable and it’s not fair to our patients. This bill allows the state to cover the difference for the Medicaid reimbursements and ensures we don’t have to close our doors to those patients.”
During the committee hearing, dozens of Planned Parenthood volunteers and reproductive rights advocates sat in the audience, wearing pink clothing and showing their support for the bill. Teter said PPRM expects more than 150 supporters of the bill to come to the Capitol throughout the special session as the bill moves through the Legislature.
“We sent out a call to action to our incredible activists across the state, and people are showing up,” Teter said. “It’s awesome.”

Special session on Colorado budget woes gets underway

The Colorado House and Senate gaveled in for the special session shortly after 10 a.m. After some procedural business, the chambers recessed to start committee work for the first introduced bills.
Earlier this morning, the caucuses laid out their priorities in separate press conferences.
“We’ve got our work cut out for us. We’re back to address a $1 billion budget shortfall thanks to Trump and Republicans in Congress — $1 billion that should be invested in Colorado, for Colorado, but instead is for tax breaks for corporations and the ultra wealthy,” Senate President James Coleman, a Denver Democrat, said.
The Republicans were less optimistic.
“When we walk away from this session, the Democrats will have increased taxes. The Democrats will have done nothing to cut General Fund spending — that’s the $700 million we’re in the red — and the Democrats will not have rebalanced the state’s budget,” Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, a Brighton Republican, said.
In addition to finding solutions to that revenue shortfall, Gov. Jared Polis tasked lawmakers with addressing health insurance premium costs, tweaking the state’s artificial intelligence law and shoring up food assistance program funding.
Committee work will begin around 11:30 a.m.
