Currently, families stationed at White Sands Missile Range and Holloman Air Force Base travel nearly 100 miles to El Paso, Texas, for medical care, but are denied reimbursement because they are just under the 100-mile threshold. Heinrich’s TRICARE Travel Improvement Act will ensure fairness for military families serving in remote areas by lowering the travel reimbursement threshold under TRICARE Prime from 100 miles to 50 miles for active-duty servicemembers and their families.

His primary focus at Defense Health Agency-Public Health is on behavioral health and suicide prevention.

For centuries, gambling has been a popular form of entertainment and leisure activity, but for some, it can be a source of risk and harm—and service members are no exception.

Historically, military members tend to gamble more often than their civilian counterparts. Research indicates certain factors associated with military service increase the risk for gambling problems among those actively serving and for those who served. A 2021 study found that problem gambling scores for past and current service members were more than double those of the civilians studied. The 2020 DOD Health Related Behaviors Survey indicated 51.3% of active duty service members reported engaging in some form of gambling in the previous year.

While gambling is generally considered recreational, it can adversely impact military personnel, their families, and unit readiness.

“Unhealthy gambling behaviors are an increasing problem across the Armed Forces today due to the ease of online/app sports betting,” said U.S. Army Lt. Col. Isaac Lopez, a clinical psychologist with Defense Health Agency-Public Health in Aberdeen, Maryland. “This behavior is increasingly troublesome as research has shown it can lead to more significant problems to include increased risk of substance abuse and behavioral health symptoms.”

Problem gambling impacts

Several factors contribute to higher rates of military gambling; examples include its being seen as either a way to develop cohesion or escape from stress and boredom, and 24-hour online and phone app access. Service members also tend to be risk-takers and are often more willing to engage in high-risk activities.

Studies have also connected alcohol use to rates of gambling, linking increased drinking with more significant amounts of gambling. More gambling typically leads to a higher risk for harm, such as financial difficulties, relationship problems, and mental health concerns.

Gambling can have a negative impact on physical health, especially for those engaging in high-risk gambling. For instance, risky gambling can lead to sleep deprivation, poor nutrition and substance abuse. Financial concerns resulting from gambling can bring about stress-related problems such as hypertension and increased tobacco, nicotine, and substance use.

Daily behavioral health can be influenced by high-risk gambling, increasing the chances of anxiety, depression, and suicidal thinking. A risk-taking gambling style can also aggravate existing mental health problems, such as substance use and posttraumatic stress. Excessive gambling may also result in relationship issues, including separation, divorce, and domestic violence, and may increase the risk for criminal behavior, such as theft and fraud.

According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, problem gambling is defined as ""gambling behavior that causes disruptions in any major area of life: psychological, physical, social, or vocational."" The NCPG estimates that approximately 2 million Americans meet the criteria for problem gambling, with another 4–6 million experiencing problems related to their gambling behaviors.

Safe gambling techniques

A way to reduce the harm that can result from gambling is to practice safe gambling techniques. The first step is to view gambling as a leisure activity, not a way to make money. While winning is always possible, losing is just as likely. In fact, with the odds set in favor of the gaming industry, losing money over time is more likely, making it essential to gamble only with an affordable amount of money to lose.

Setting limits on both time and money spent on gambling is a technique that helps reduce gambling harm. Deciding in advance how much time and money to spend on gambling and sticking to that amount keeps more of your money in your pocket. Once the time or money limit has been reached, it is time to stop. Also, gambling is best experienced as a social activity with trusted friends; avoid gambling alone.

Another technique for reducing gambling harm is not chasing losses. Gambling to win back money lost can quickly become out of control and often leads to more losses. It’s important to accept that gambling involves losing, and the odds are not set in your favor. Using gambling tools that provide feedback on amounts spent can help prevent chasing losses and preserve any winnings earned.

Tips for sensible gambling

For many, gambling can be a fun and exciting activity, but it is important to realize you may win some of the time but will lose most of the time. The following tips can help you gamble sensibly:

Set a budget. Determine how much of your money you are willing to gamble; when you have reached that amount, stop gambling.

Don't chase losses. If you lose money while gambling, don't try to win it back by continuing to gamble. Doing so can lead to even bigger losses.

Take breaks. Gambling can be addictive, so it's essential to take regular breaks to help you stay in control and reduce the risk of problem gambling.

Don't gamble when you're stressed or upset. Gambling can be a way to take a break from daily life, but it is not a way to deal with stress or negative emotions. If you are feeling stressed or upset, don’t gamble; instead, find healthy and safe ways to relax and cope with your feelings.

Don't gamble if you have a history of addiction. If you have a history of addiction, gambling is not a healthy activity for you. Talk to your healthcare provider about ways to manage your addiction and avoid gambling altogether.

Know the odds. Before gambling, understand how the odds work and the risks of winning and losing. This knowledge will help you decide how much of your money you’re willing to risk and when to stop gambling.

Don't let gambling interfere with your life. If you decide to participate in gambling, do not let it interfere with your work, relationships, or other vital aspects of your life. If it does, it’s time to seek help.

Following these tips will help you experience gambling while lowering the risk of harmful outcomes.

Resources

When gambling becomes hard to manage or is out of control, it can become self-destructive, like a substance use disorder. Indicators of addictive behavior include spending more time or money gambling than intended, feeling anxious or irritable when not gambling, hiding or lying about personal gambling habits, having financial difficulties because of gambling, and avoiding responsibilities at work or in relationships to spend time gambling instead.

If any of these signs is present, it is time to seek help. It’s not uncommon for gamblers to feel isolated or ashamed; some may even have thoughts of suicide. There are resources available to find support for gambling concerns:

Military families face unique stressors. Frequent moves, deployments, and separation from family can impact health and well-being. For anyone who may feel they need someone to talk to, the Military Health System is here to help.

“It’s crucial for the military family to seek mental, emotional, and spiritual grounding to fully become a part of the U.S. military at its most ready,” said Susan Orsega, deputy assistant secretary of defense for health services policy and oversight.

“Whether it’s in-person or remote access, in groups, or one-on-one, therapy can help address these pressures and get the service member or families feeling better able to cope before they deepen into crisis,” she said. “Therapy helps sustain readiness and gives service members the necessary mental health support they need during any transitions or challenges they may face.”

Help is more readily available now than ever, Orsega said.

“This is particularly important when service members experience some challenges such as the loss of a sense of purpose, posttraumatic stress disorder, and other mental health symptoms,” she said.

Recognize risks

Service members at risk of harming themselves may feel isolated, agitated, or anxious, according to Military OneSource, the Department of Defense’s 24/7 gateway to family support programs and services for military members and families.

According to Military OneSource, times and events in military life when you can feel especially stressed include:

• Times nearing deployment or difficulty readjusting following deployment

• Loss of a family member, friend, or fellow service member

• Career setbacks, lack of advancement, or disciplinary actions

• Difficulty in relationships or family life

• Transitioning from military to civilian life

• Financial difficulty

• Major life changes

• Being young and unmarried without a supportive relationship

• Combat-related psychological injuries

• Heavy drinking or problematic substance use

• Medical health problems

• Negative attitude toward getting help

Military OneSource provides confidential counseling and support to service members and family members at no cost, available via phone or in person on and off installations. This is just one of many resources the DOD offers to all service members, families and military retirees.

Available MHS mental health resources

The MHS Mental Health Hub provides a comprehensive listing of mental health services available through the MHS. This includes ways to seek care, tips from experts, and in-depth information on available resources. You can connect directly to mental health support services near you with one click.

• Targeted Care: Many military mental health clinics are now using a process called Targeted Care. This connects you to the specific type of care you need after an initial evaluation — and can be an individual appointment, in-person group therapy or virtual group therapy, or virtual therapy. You can also receive referrals to nonmedical support such as a chaplain, financial advisor, or a military family life counselor.

• TRICARE covers mental health services through its worldwide network of civilian providers. To set up a mental health appointment through TRICARE, visit the mental health doctors and appointments page.

• Virtual care: The Defense Health Agency is also working to make mental health services available to service members at remote installations. One example is BRAVE, the DHA’s Behavioral Health Resources and Virtual Experience. This program offers tele-mental health services at 84 locations around the world by connecting a service member with a counselor through virtual sessions.

• inTransition is a confidential program that offers specialized coaching and assistance for active duty service members, National Guard and Reserve members, veterans, and retirees. It focuses on those receiving mental health or traumatic brain injury care who are experiencing disruption in their lives, like a PCS (permanent change of station) move, separation, or retirement.

• The Real Warriors Campaign is a DOD public health initiative. It strives to decrease stigma, increase psychological health literacy, and encourage early mental health help-seeking behaviors in the military community.

• CHAMP, the Uniformed Services University’s Consortium for Health and Military Performance, offers dozens of fact sheets, articles, and infographics to help you strengthen your mental health and grow from adversity or crisis.

• Mobile apps are there whenever needed, providing tools for coping, monitoring your health, and managing stress.

• The Brandon Act empowers service members to get the help they need confidentially by seeking a referral for a mental health evaluation through their commander or supervisor. This reduces the stigma associated with mental health.

• The Warrior Care Recovery Coordination Program, executed by the branches of service, provide holistic care to wounded, ill, or injured Service members and their families and caregivers. Recovery Care Coordinators serve as a guide through recovery, rehabilitation, and transition or reintegration by facilitating a comprehensive recovery plan. This plan covers needs associated with daily living, career, family, finances, health, legal, military, and spirituality.

So retired over the summer and this past weekend had my first real health problem requiring me to use the system. I have both tricare prime retiree and VA healthcare.

Anyways Saturday rolled around and I felt like ass, coughing, fever, etc. Figured probably Covid, so hid away in my room and tried to sweat it out a few days.

Yesterday (Labor Day) it was unbearable and getting worse so I contacted the VA who referred me to an urgent care clinic. I went in and they told me possibly bronchitis or pneumonia, prescribed me some steroids and an inhaler and sent me on my way.

This morning it was even worse so I called the tricare nurse advice line. They tried getting me in to my PCM, but were unable so they recommended I go to the ER. I live next to a base, so my PCM is at an MTF. So it is my understanding that between these two visits I shouldn’t hypothetically be charged for anything correct?

It may include funny memes, entertainment and news stories, and pictures and updates from friends and family. With so much to scroll through, it can be difficult to spot a concerning post made by a fellow warrior, friend, or family member when they may be thinking about suicide.

Learn how to recognize the warning signs of suicide on social media and what you can do to help. Recognizing the signs and taking the right steps can save lives.

What to look for

Signs of emotional crisis or thoughts of suicide are not always obvious on social media. A fellow warrior, friend, or loved one may share that they are going through a challenging time and may mention feeling hopeless or ending their lives. They might frame these statements as a joke or even include a meme or a lighthearted emoji. Regardless of how casual they seem, these posts can be signs of more serious psychological health concerns.

If someone you know makes comments about suicide or expresses emotional pain online, always take them seriously. Whether it's a single post or multiple, do not ignore them. In addition to posts that directly reference dying, signs of emotional crisis in social media posts may include those that mention:

Self-medicating in response to emotional or physical pain

Feeling alone or isolated

Feeling guilt, shame, anger, or rage (seeking revenge)

Feeling like a burden to coworkers or loved ones

Feeling trapped or in unbearable pain

Expressing hopelessness or having no reason to live

Saying goodbye or expressing a desire to escape

Describing methods of suicide

Some of the above signs may be expressed through images as well. If you spot a post that contains one or more of the above signs, it could indicate that the person is in crisis. Do not wait for someone else to respond. Reaching out and taking the right action may save their life.

What to do

A common misconception is that by asking someone about suicide, you are putting the idea into their head. However, reaching out is one of the most helpful things you can do. If you notice someone engaging with social media in a concerning way, immediately reach out to them through private message or chat, or by calling or meeting with them in person. Starting the conversation can be as simple as saying, ""It seems like you're going through a hard time right now. Can we talk?""

Follow these three simple steps when reaching out:

Ask:

Are they considering suicide?

Listen:

Check in with them and see how they are feeling. Listen to their concerns and remind them that they are not alone.

Get Help:

Speak with a trained crisis responder through the Veterans/Military Crisis Line: dial 988 and press 1 or text 838255.

They can provide guidance to you and/or the person in crisis and help connect you with services.

If they are in immediate danger of suicide, call 911.

Are you calling the Military/Veterans Crisis Line from overseas? The country code to reach the United States will be required for each of these numbers, depending on your location.

Europe, call: 844-702-5495 or DSN 988

Pacific, call: 844-702-5493 or DSN 988

Southwest Asia, call: 855-422-7719 or DSN 988

Contact the Safety Team:

Along with reaching out directly and providing crisis resources, you should also alert the social media platform's safety team. While each platform's protocol is different, generally they will assess the post and reach out to the user with resources to connect them with help. To learn more about the safety teams and protocols visit Facebook, X, Instagram, and Snapchat.

If you’re not working and don’t have insurance through your own job or your spouse’s employer plan, Medicare enrollment at 65 is mandatory. Failing to sign up leaves you uninsured and subject to penalties.

Employees of Small Companies (19 or Fewer Employees)

For workers at small businesses, Medicare becomes the primary payer at age 65, and the employer’s plan shifts to secondary coverage. If you don’t enroll in Medicare, you could be responsible for most of your medical bills.

ACA, Marketplace, or Obamacare Plans

Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans stop making financial sense once you turn 65. Premium credits and tax subsidies vanish, and you’re required to transition to Medicare. Staying on ACA could cost you far more than switching.

Retired Military with Tricare or Tricare for Life

Tricare requires enrollment in Medicare Part B at age 65. Without it, you risk losing Tricare coverage and may face permanent late enrollment penalties. Active-duty military are the only exception until their service ends.

COBRA Participants

If you’re on COBRA when you turn 65, you still need to enroll in Medicare. COBRA drops to secondary coverage, paying only 20% of claims—leaving you responsible for the other 80% if you don’t sign up for Medicare.

Enrollment Timeline and Process

Your Initial Enrollment Period (IEP) begins three months before your 65th birthday, includes your birth month, and extends three months after. Enrolling early ensures coverage starts the first day of your birth month. Waiting until or after your birthday can delay coverage by up to three months.

Already on Social Security? You’ll be enrolled automatically, with your Medicare card arriving about 100 days before your birthday.

Not on Social Security? You must enroll yourself either at ssa.gov, by submitting paper forms, or with help from a Medicare educator.

Penalties for Missing the Deadline

The stakes are high if you miss your Medicare Part B enrollment:

10% penalty added to your premium for every 12 months of delay.

Penalties last for life.

For Tricare members, skipping enrollment risks losing Tricare altogether.

COBRA participants without Medicare at 65 could face massive out-of-pocket costs, as COBRA won’t cover what Medicare should.

How Medicare Coordinates with Other Coverage

When you turn 65:

Small employer plans, Tricare, and COBRA all move to secondary status, meaning Medicare pays first.

Tricare + Medicare together provide excellent, comprehensive coverage, including drug benefits.

COBRA can still cover younger spouses or dependents, but the primary enrollee must transition to Medicare.

Getting Help with Enrollment

Navigating Medicare’s rules can feel overwhelming, but you don’t have to do it alone. Experts like Erica Smiley at MedicareSchool.com help seniors:

Understand whether they need to enroll at 65

Compare plan options (Medigap, Advantage, Part D)

Avoid penalties and gaps in coverage

If you’re approaching 65, review your coverage early, check your Initial Enrollment Period dates, and get help if you’re unsure. A misstep could cost you for life.

According to a recent report from KNSI Radio, 40-year-old Adelle Starin – who operated a store that sold baby products and toys – made false claims for reimbursement to the healthcare program TRICARE to the tune of $9 million.

Authorities say that TRICARE initially paid out the claims, but when it started rejecting them, she created a fictitious shell company – Sunshine Medical LLC – in which she falsely claimed she represented two lenders who needed financing to purchase supplies from her firm.

However, according to a previous press release from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), her firm “had no business operations or revenue.” Therefore, to pull off the scheme, she had to create fake invoices for Sunshine Medical LLC and send them to the lenders she claimed the firm represented.

All in all, she fraudulently raked in $9 million from her fabrications to TRICARE.

She pleaded guilty to wire fraud in December 2024 and was sentenced to three years of probation and ordered to pay $2.35 million in restitution in addition to her time behind bars.
