In her current dual roles, she faces the additional challenge of integrating DHA’s patient health care mission with the Army’s medical readiness mission.
Teyhen also knew that two separate processes would create confusion and inefficiencies, which could be alleviated by a shared governance model.
She wants her two organizations to be focused on supporting their subordinate units, integrating solutions to optimize healthcare delivery and medical readiness, while avoiding confusion and frustration.
According to Gardner, governance is “a structured framework of roles, processes, and mechanisms that empowers leaders to set direction, establish priorities, and drive effective change.","Military medicine in the Indo-Pacific region took a major leap forward during a strategic offsite conference August 11-13 as more than 80 leaders from the Defense Health Agency’s Defense Health Network Indo-Pacific and the Army’s Medical Readiness Command, Pacific met to establish a common governance framework. The resulting framework will help the two organizations combine the separate missions of health care and medical readiness into an integrated process, enhancing both access to health care for patients and medical readiness for soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines.

U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Deydre S. Teyhen used her extensive governance experience to lead the conference. She currently serves as the director of DHN IP, which oversees military medical facilities in Washington, California, Hawaii, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. She is also the commanding general of MRC, P, which provides command and control to medical department activities, medical centers, dental health commands, Public Health Command, Pacific, and soldier recovery units in Washington, Alaska, Hawaii, Japan, and the Republic of Korea.

Assuming both roles in April, she brought important lessons about governance from her previous assignment as the director of DHN National Capital Region, which treats the military community as well as the President of the United States, members of Congress, and the Supreme Court.

“We often focus on the 5W’s: who, what, when, where, and why—but in the NCR, we focused on the ‘how,’” said Teyhen as she departed the East Coast. “How we lead, how we build trust, and how we treat our people and patients. How is critical in leading the joy and soul back to medicine. Governance gave us the foundation to transform this network into an integrated healthcare system that focused on making it better for our patients and our staff.”

During Teyhen’s NCR tour, she saw governance help the network increase patient enrollment and access, expand virtual health, increase operating room utilization, and make many other improvements. In her current dual roles, she faces the additional challenge of integrating DHA’s patient health care mission with the Army’s medical readiness mission. As the leader of two staffs in different agencies, she saw the need to bring them together by creating a shared mission, vision and values. Teyhen also knew that two separate processes would create confusion and inefficiencies, which could be alleviated by a shared governance model.

“We aim to adopt an integrated approach, ensuring unifying governance and decisions within MRC, P, and DHN IP, while also promoting empowered leaders who drive effectiveness and efficiency,” stated Teyhen.

She wants her two organizations to be focused on supporting their subordinate units, integrating solutions to optimize healthcare delivery and medical readiness, while avoiding confusion and frustration.

Teyhen also noted there is record burnout in both the military and civilian healthcare systems. Reducing the burden on healthcare providers is critical to providing quality health care for patients, and increasing efficiency and standardization can help.

To assist with creating a combined governance model for DHN-IP and MRC, P, Teyhen brought in an expert team from DHN NCR to facilitate the strategic offsite, led by John Gardner, DHN NCR’s assistant director for network operations.

According to Gardner, governance is “a structured framework of roles, processes, and mechanisms that empowers leaders to set direction, establish priorities, and drive effective change. It ensures accountability, effectively manages risk, and aligns actions with strategic goals, enabling agility.”

Many of the world’s largest and most effective organizations utilize a governance model, said Gardner, including Apple, Microsoft and premiere healthcare systems like Johns Hopkins, Cleveland Clinic and the Mayo Clinic. Yet, some people are hesitant to embrace governance, and misconceptions persist. For instance, some think “governance” means an increase in bureaucracy, more meetings, wasted time, and decreased flexibility.

“The truth is just the opposite,” said Gardner. Governance increases efficiency and clarifies responsibilities. At NCR, governance reduced more than 130 meetings to just a few. It can help align priorities and share best practices, uphold common standards of care, and build trust among stakeholders, including patients and providers.

Some people look at governance as an opportunity. U.S. Army Col. James “Jimmy” Watts is the director of Madigan Army Medical Center at Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington, as well as the commander of the medical readiness unit there. According to Watts, prior to the offsite he “was optimistic about the opportunity to align and integrate the efforts of both organizations into a cohesive and coherent effort.”

During the three-day offsite, Gardner’s team instructed attendees about the need for governance and guiding principles, then led them through case studies to illustrate how effective governance can prevent or solve problems. For instance, in one case study, the business resources division in a fictional health system reduced funding for environmental services staff without consulting clinical leaders, which resulted in increased infection rates in the hospital and tension between the business and clinical teams. In another example, unclear appointing and booking protocols led to miscommunication between medical offices, causing a cancer patient to hang in administrative limbo and delaying his treatment.

Effective governance could have prevented both by creating processes for different offices to coordinate prior to making decisions that could affect others. In another example, governance would have provided standardization for medical carts, which would have helped a nurse find correct medication in a timely manner after she moved from one hospital to another.

Gardner’s team also led offsite participants as they developed the committees that form the foundation of the governance structure. With representation from medical, dental, veterinary, public health, human resources, business resources, and senior enlisted leaders, they developed a Board of Directors, which oversees a Medical Affairs Committee, Network Regional Operations Committee, Resource Management Committee, and Senior Enlisted Leader Committee. Each of those committees will ultimately be supported by multiple councils, working groups and sprint team. For instance, the MAC will include a council of nurses, and the RMC will include a human resources council.

Teyhen emphasized throughout the process that collaboration is key. In each committee, there are voting members from DHN IP and MRC, P as well as each of the network’s major medical facilities and the readiness command’s direct reporting units.

With the committees established, participants next determined each committee’s authorities and responsibilities as well as voting and non-voting members. Finally, the committees developed proposed priorities for the next few months.

With proposed priorities scribbled on paper on the wall, Gardner allowed all the participants to vote on initial priorities, such as operating room optimization and standardization of medical services across facilities, before leading the participants through the first Board of Directors meeting where the board approved the proposed authorities, membership team and initial priorities.

“The next step is to put this in motion,” said Gardner. “There is a lot of work to do and a lot to figure out, but I’m happy to help you put this into effect.”

Watts is optimistic that the new governance structure will be beneficial. “I believe the conference was positively reinforcing, because we have taken concrete steps towards hardwiring critical organizational processes,” said Watts. “This will increase information and knowledge sharing, as well as decision transparency.” He also believes “the newly established governance system will help MAMC streamline its headquarters and organizational structure.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2508/9260343/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-18 13:56:09.937619

TRICARE beneficiaries in Routt County are now eligible to receive emergency prescription refills through Aug. 24. For beneficiaries in Rio Blanco County, the date has been extended from Aug. 16 to Aug. 24.

As a reminder, beneficiaries in Delta County may receive refills through Aug. 16 due to the Elk and LeRoux Fires, and beneficiaries in Archuleta County may receive emergency prescription refills through Aug. 21 due to the Oak Fire.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator: https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/find-pharmacy

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates: https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/notices/weather

Well, yes, only with several conditions. In general, TRICARE will pay for couples or marriage counseling when it is a part of treating a diagnosed mental health condition in one or both spouses. In case it is a mere general improvement of relationships, and there is no diagnosis, it is not covered.

As Anna Welch, a U.S. citizen who’s spent years helping military families navigate TRICARE’s rules, I know how confusing the system can be. Between plan requirements, referral processes, and finding an authorized provider, it’s easy to feel lost.

In this blog, I’ll cover who qualifies, which mental health issues make counseling eligible, how to find a provider, the coverage process, costs, and online therapy options.

What is TRICARE?

TRICARE is the United States Department of Defense’s Official Health Care Program for its members, retirees people and the families of the military. It caters to on-duty service personnel, National Guard, and Reserve personnel, qualifying veterans, and survivors. TRICARE is not bare bones medical care, but provides coverage of a vast variety of medical, dental, vision, mental health treatment, and specialty care. The program is based on work with military treatment facilities and civilian providers, depending on your location and plan type.

Learning TRICARE work functions is important since the TRICARE coverages, when providing services such as marriage counseling, are highly specific. Being aware of the rules beforehand may save you time, money, and frustration when you want assistance in the relationship.

Only Diagnosed Mental Health Covered

You may well be asking yourself whether TRICARE will cover marriage counseling because you and your spouse would like to work on your relationship. The brief answer is no. Counseling to help improve your relationship, learn how to communicate with one another, or receive premarital counseling is not covered by TRICARE. The overall condition is that TRICARE will only compensate for marriage or couples counseling about a recognized mental health disorder in one or both partners.

As a military helper myself, this appears to be the most common cause of people’s downfall. They assume marriage counseling is treated like any other preventive health service, but TRICARE treats it as a mental health intervention, and that means there must be a documented, diagnosable condition.

What This Means for You

One of the partners has to be assessed and have a mental health condition, at least of depression, anxiety, PTSD, substance use disorder, or adjustment disorder.

Couples counseling should be medically required and recommended by a mental health provider sanctioned by TRICARE in the treatment program.

Your provider must document how the therapy supports the treatment of that diagnosis.

If there’s no diagnosis, you’ll have to pay out of pocket for marriage counseling.

Why TRICARE Has This Rule

TRICARE is a health insurance program that is operated by the government, and similar to the majority of other health insurance plans, it only covers this or that types of services which is deemed to be medically necessary. General relationship problems, though very real and quite important, do not come up to that criterion unless they are associated with a well-defined mental health problem.

Example Scenarios

Covered: Your spouse was diagnosed with PTSD, and your mental health doctor suggests that couples counseling would assist in communicating and supporting you during the treatment time.

Not Covered: You and your partner are disagreeing more, and you both want to fix your marriage, but neither of you has a diagnosable mental health issue.

Who Qualifies?

TRICARE’s marriage counseling coverage isn’t open to just anyone; you have to be eligible under their health program.

From my perspective, here’s exactly who can qualify:

Active Duty Service Members: While you serve, you are covered by TRICARE. Your spouse is also covered.

Retired Service Members: You and your spouse can continue to have coverage during retirement when you continue enrolling in TRICARE.

National Guard & Reserve Members: You and your dependents are covered, provided you are on active duty orders or are eligible under TRICARE Reserve Select.

Survivors: As the surviving spouse of an active service member, eligible to get TRICARE you are not denied benefits.

Retired Members, Medically: They and their families are freely provided with full, including mental health, coverage.

The main point? You must be officially enrolled in a TRICARE plan; without that, there’s no access to any mental health coverage.

Which Mental Health Issues Qualify?

Marriage or couples counseling will be covered by TRICARE only in the presence of a diagnosed and treatable mental health condition within one or both spouses.

Here are only some of the most common conditions under which the door to coverage opens:

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): This is connected with military jobs, trauma, or combat-related.

Depression: These include major depressive disorder; persistent depressive disorder.

Persistent stress and worry about daily interactions and activities are signs of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).

Adjustment Disorders: Failure to cope with such severe life changes as migration or deployment.

Substance Use Disorders: Alcohol or drug dependence, and the use of couples therapy as a part of recovery.

Other diagnoses of the DSM-5: Examples of these are bipolar disorder, panic disorder, among others.

If you or your spouse isn’t sure whether your symptoms fit these categories, you’ll need a mental health evaluation. The first step toward TRICARE coverage is the diagnosis.

Finding an Authorized Provider

You will have to use the services of a TRICARE-authorized person, not an arbitrarily selected local therapist.

Who is Authorized?

LMFTs: Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists

LCSWs: Licensed Clinical Social Workers

PhD/Psy D Clinical Psychologists

MD or DO psychiatrists

How to Find One:

Visit the TRICARE Find a Doctor Tool on their official website.

Select “Mental Health” as your specialty.

Filter by your TRICARE plan (e.g., Prime, Select).

Confirm that they indeed practice couples therapy in the mental health treatment regime.

In my personal experience, I would advise calling the office of any provider before booking and asking about being in-network, as this will save a headache later.

Referral Required?

The answer depends on your TRICARE plan:

TRICARE Prime:

Usually requires a referral from your Primary Care Manager (PCM) to any mental health specialist.

Without it, you risk higher costs or complete denial of coverage.

TRICARE Select:

No referral needed, but the provider still must be TRICARE-authorized.

Active Duty Service Members:

In any non-emergency specialty, mental health care always requires referral.

Note: Although your plan may not need any referral, you should still know how to tell your PCM, as that would help your medical record represent the care.

Getting Covered: Step-by-Step Process

Here’s the path I recommend if you want TRICARE to cover your marriage counseling:

Talk to Your PCM: Explain your relationship struggles and how they’re affecting your mental health.

Get a Mental Health Evaluation: This step determines if there’s a qualifying diagnosis.

Get a Referral (where necessary): Paperwork taken care of by your PCM or mental health provider.

Select a TRICARE- Authorized Provider: Make sure they are in-network and provide couples treatment.

Participate in Counseling: This is the most effective way to keep to the treatment schedule.

Follow up on the coverage after the First Session: phone TRICARE or log on online to make certain that the claim was filed.

Copays and Costs

TRICARE coverage reduces costs dramatically, but it’s not always 100% free.

TRICARE Prime:

$0 copay for active duty members

Small copay for retirees and dependents

TRICARE Select:

Copays vary based on the sponsor’s status (active duty vs. retired) and provider network

Lower costs for in-network providers

Out-of-Network Care:

Higher costs and possible denial of full coverage

Advice from me: Always double-check the provider’s status before your first session to avoid surprise bills.

Online Therapy: Talkspace

Online therapy, which may involve couples therapy, is offered by TRICARE in collaboration with Talkspace.

Why it’s worth considering:

Sessions via secure text, audio, or video calls

Great for geographically separated couples or those on deployment

Flexible scheduling with licensed providers

Note: As with face-to-face therapy, treatment for hormonal needs requires a qualifying diagnosis to be covered by TRICARE.

Real-Life Tips & Stories

I’ve seen both sides of this process. One military spouse I know couldn’t get coverage for marriage counseling because neither she nor her husband had a diagnosable condition, so they ended up paying privately.

Another friend’s husband was diagnosed with PTSD after deployment. Their couples therapy was folded into his treatment plan, and TRICARE covered it entirely. A major factor in their recovery as a marriage was counseling.

From what I’ve learned, here’s my advice for you:

Don’t downplay symptoms; be honest in evaluations

Keep all paperwork and referral forms

Check coverage before starting sessions

If you’re denied, ask about the appeals process

TRICARE Plan Types and How They Affect Coverage

You can explain that TRICARE has several plan options, and coverage rules can vary:

TRICARE Prime: A low cost with the least expensive coverage, but with the necessity of referrals.

TRICARE Select: increased vendor options, no references, higher out-of-pocket expenses.

TRICARE Reserve Select: For eligible personnel of the National Guard and Reserve.

TRICARE For Life: For military retirees eligible for Medicare.

TRICARE Overseas Program: Rules for service members and families stationed abroad.

Marriage Counseling vs. Family Counseling in TRICARE’s Eyes

Many people don’t realize TRICARE may categorize “marriage counseling” under “family therapy” if it involves more than one person in the session. This matters because:

The provider’s billing code affects TRICARE’s payment status.

The diagnosis must be tied to one person, even if both partners attend.

How Session Limits Work

Some TRICARE plans may limit the number of covered mental health sessions before requiring a re-authorization. For example:

You might get up to 8 sessions without additional approval.

Beyond that, the provider may need to submit updated clinical notes.

What Happens if You’re Stationed Overseas

Under the TRICARE Overseas Program rules are different:

It can be paid in advance and file a claim to get a rebate.

Not every state has TRICARE-approved marriage guidance counselors, so telehealth may be the optimum solution.

The Appeal Process if Denied

In case the TRICARE refuses to cover your marriage counseling:

Step 1: Check the denial letter to understand the reasons why it has been rejected.

Step 2: Develop follow-up papers (diagnosis, treatment plan notes).

Step 3: First Level appeal(must be within the deadline; say 90 days).

Step 4: Denied again? Ask for a Second-Level Appeal.

Alternative Low-Cost or Free Options

Unless you are eligible for TRICARE-covered counseling, you might consider:

Military OneSource: Provides short-term and free relationship counseling.

Chaplains: free confidential counseling.

Community Mental Health Clinics: Sliding fees.

Common Myths

You can bust a few myths:

Myth: TRICARE covers any marriage counseling if you’re married to a service member.

Fact: Coverage is only for diagnosed mental health conditions.

Myth: You are free to choose any therapist.

Fact: They should be authorized for TRICARE.

FAQs:

Does TRICARE cover marriage counseling for any reason?

No. TRICARE only covers it if it’s part of treatment for a diagnosed mental health condition.

Which mental ailments are covered?

These might include substance use disorders, adjustment disorders, anxiety, depression, and PTSD.

Is marriage counseling a referral program?

If you have TRICARE Prime, yes. There is no requirement for a recommendation if you have TRICARE Select.

Can I choose any counselor I want?

No. The provider must be TRICARE-authorized.

Does TRICARE cover online marriage counseling?

Yes, through options like Talkspace, but the same diagnosis requirement applies.

Final Words:

When your marriage is having problems, asking for help is a show of strength rather than weakness. TRICARE may be your friend, so long as you know its rules. Here is the plain truth: unless one has a diagnosed mental health condition and a plan of treatment, there will be no coverage. However, TRICARE might be the key that will unlock access to professional help that would allow you and your spouse to restore trust and increase communication, as well as to overcome challenges as a unit.

Do not leave it until minor fissures become wide enough. Contact a TRICARE-enrolled mental health care provider, get the diagnosis, should you need it, and proceed with the process step-by-step. The later you respond, the earlier you can work on healing your marriage because a healthy marriage does not just benefit you, it also benefits the family, the future, and your inner peace.",https://reallovetips.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Military-Couple-Counseling.png,N,0.0,2025-08-17 11:56:12.993359

(NASDAQ: GRAL) has emerged as a pivotal player in the race to revolutionize cancer diagnostics through its liquid biopsy technology. The company's recent financial results and strategic advancements have not only validated its mission but also spurred a surge in investor confidence, reflected in a revised price target of $40.50—a 23.4% upside from its current trading price. This analysis explores how GRAIL's progress in early cancer detection is reshaping the industry and whether the optimism is justified.

Financial Performance: Growth Amidst Strategic Restructuring

GRAIL's Q2 2025 earnings report underscored a mix of resilience and transformation. Total revenue rose 11% year-over-year to $35.5 million, driven by a 22% increase in Galleri test revenue to $34.4 million. The U.S. market accounted for $34.2 million of this growth, with test sales surging 29% year-over-year to over 45,000 units. These figures highlight the growing adoption of GRAIL's flagship product, which detects multiple cancers from a single blood draw.

However, the company's path to profitability remains challenging. A net loss of $114 million in Q2 2025, while a 93% improvement from the $1.52 billion loss in Q2 2024, still reflects the heavy costs of R&D and commercialization. The impairment of Illumina acquisition-related intangible assets ($28 million) and a gross loss of $17.8 million further illustrate the financial hurdles. Yet, GRAIL's cash reserves—$606.1 million as of June 30, 2025—provide a buffer, with updated cash burn guidance of $310 million for 2025. This suggests a disciplined approach to capital allocation, critical for sustaining long-term innovation.

Clinical and Commercial Momentum: The Catalyst for Optimism

GRAIL's recent clinical updates have been a game-changer. The PATHFINDER 2 study, analyzing 25,578 participants, reported a significant jump in positive predictive value (PPV)—a key metric for diagnostic accuracy—without compromising specificity or cancer signal origin (CSO) accuracy. These results, coupled with positive outcomes from the NHS-Galleri trial, position GRAIL to submit data to the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2025 Congress. Such validation is crucial for gaining regulatory and payer trust.

Commercially, the company has expanded access through partnerships like the one with Everlywell, enabling direct-to-consumer sales via prescription, and with Quest Diagnostics, integrating Galleri into a national testing network. Additionally, TRICARE's decision to cover the Galleri test for high-risk adults over 50 has broadened its addressable market. These moves address a critical bottleneck: reimbursement. With payers increasingly recognizing the value of early detection, GRAIL's revenue trajectory appears poised for acceleration.

Analyst Price Target: A Calculated Bet on Future Potential

The $40.50 price target, led by Kyle Mikson of Canaccord Genuity ($43.00), hinges on several factors:

1. Scientific Validation: PATHFINDER 2 results and NHS-Galleri data strengthen GRAIL's case for FDA approval and broader adoption.

2. Operational Efficiency: A 93% reduction in net losses and improved cash burn guidance signal better cost management.

3. Market Expansion: Partnerships and TRICARE coverage are unlocking new revenue streams.

4. Investor Sentiment: The stock's 108.4% year-to-date gain in 2025 reflects growing confidence in GRAIL's ability to disrupt traditional cancer screening.

Analysts project GRAIL could reach $217 million in revenue by 2028, assuming 18.4% annual growth. While ambitious, this forecast assumes continued progress in payer negotiations and regulatory milestones. The $40.50 target also implies a valuation that accounts for the company's leadership in a high-growth sector, despite current losses.

Risks and Realities

Investors must weigh GRAIL's potential against risks. The company remains unprofitable, and reimbursement challenges persist. Regulatory delays or clinical setbacks could derail momentum. Additionally, competition from rivals like Exact Sciences (maker of Cologuard) and emerging startups could fragment market share.

Investment Thesis: A High-Risk, High-Reward Play

GRAIL's progress in liquid biopsy technology is undeniably transformative. The Galleri test's ability to detect over 50 cancers with a single blood draw addresses a critical unmet need in oncology. For investors with a long-term horizon, the company's strong cash position, clinical validation, and strategic partnerships justify the optimism. However, the path to profitability is not without potholes.

The $40.50 price target reflects a belief in GRAIL's ability to scale its commercial model and secure broader reimbursement. While the stock's current valuation incorporates significant upside, it also demands patience. Investors should monitor key metrics: test adoption rates, payer coverage expansions, and regulatory updates.

Conclusion

GRAIL, Inc. is at a pivotal juncture. Its liquid biopsy technology has the potential to redefine cancer diagnostics, but success depends on navigating financial, regulatory, and competitive challenges. The recent price target increase to $40.50 is a vote of confidence in the company's vision and execution. For investors willing to bet on innovation, GRAIL offers a compelling, albeit speculative, opportunity. However, prudence is advised: this is a high-stakes game where the rewards are tied to the company's ability to turn scientific promise into commercial reality.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,0.0,2025-08-16 10:56:13.081679

The stock ranked 496th in market activity, reflecting heightened investor interest. This momentum followed the company’s engagement at the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium (MHSRS), where it advanced discussions with U.S. government agencies on deploying Entolimod as a radiation countermeasure for military personnel. Key meetings included representatives from BARDA, AFRRI, and the MCDC, all aligned with the Department of Defense’s focus on CBRN defense solutions.

Tivic’s leadership emphasized the strategic value of these discussions, highlighting Entolimod’s potential to protect warfighters from radiation exposure. The product, currently in late-stage development with Fast Track designation, has drawn attention for its role in addressing unmet medical needs in military contexts. The MHSRS symposium provided direct access to funding bodies and decision-makers, reinforcing the company’s position in a niche but critical therapeutic area. Executives noted the importance of these collaborations in accelerating regulatory and commercial pathways for Entolimod.

Investor optimism appears tied to the perceived progress in military partnerships, despite Tivic’s broader financial challenges. The company’s dual-platform approach—combining biopharmaceuticals and bioelectronics—remains centered on Entolimod’s development, while its ncVNS device is in early-stage trials. However, the stock’s recent performance underscores market speculation around potential contracts, even as structural risks such as regulatory hurdles and funding dependencies persist.

The strategy of buying the top 500 stocks by daily trading volume and holding them for one day from 2022 to 2025 delivered moderate returns.

Balance billing occurs when a provider bills a TRICARE beneficiary for any amount more than the TRICARE-allowable charge after TRICARE has processed the claim.

TRICARE prohibits the practice of balance billing. Balance billing requirements apply to both network and non-network providers who treat TRICARE beneficiaries, and noncompliance can impact your TRICARE and/or Medicare status. TRICARE encourages both network and non-network providers to explore all available options to resolve claims issues without involving a debt collection agency.

Moonlighting

Moonlighting is the practice of healthcare professionals providing services outside of their position under TRICARE.

There are limited circumstances where moonlighting providers are permitted to treat TRICARE beneficiaries, such as providing emergency services.

Some providers employed full-time by the DOD may receive permission to moonlight, or work in the civilian sector as a second job, if they have Commander approval. Only active duty military providers and General Schedule (GS) civil service providers are eligible for moonlighting. These providers may not treat TRICARE beneficiaries and bill for such services while moonlighting. This restriction includes civilian health care entities who employ moonlighting providers and knowingly bill TRICARE for beneficiaries seen by active duty military or GS civil service providers.

Hold Harmless

If a beneficiary received any excluded or excludable services from a network provider, that provider must not require payment (i.e., the beneficiary will be held harmless) with the following exceptions:

If the beneficiary did not inform the provider that they are a TRICARE beneficiary, the provider may bill the beneficiary for services provided.

The patient is advised in writing that TRICARE does not cover the non-covered procedure, and the patient accepts financial liability. An agreement to pay must be reflected in the written records such as:

Provider notes written prior to receipt of the services

Statement or letter written by the beneficiary before receipt of the services

Statements written by both the beneficiary and provider following receipt of the services

Network pharmacies are not subject to Hold Harmless provisions; the beneficiary may appeal such a denial.

General agreements to pay, such as those signed by the beneficiary at the time of admission, are not evidence that the beneficiary knew specific services were excluded or excludable.

In their participation agreements with TRICARE, certified marriage and family therapists agree to hold eligible beneficiaries harmless for non-covered care.",https://tricare.triwest.com/Static/tricare-favicon.ico,N,0.0,2025-08-16 02:56:15.657865

Here’s what you need to know about finding different types of Medicare providers.
“You can lower your health care costs when you see Medicare participating providers who accept the Medicare-approved amount as full payment,” said Anne Breslin, TRICARE For Life Program Manager at the Defense Health Agency.
Medicare pays its portion of the claim, TRICARE pays the remaining amount, and you pay nothing.
Emergency care means care for an illness or injury that threatens your life, limb, sight, or safety.","AUGUST 15, 2025 – If you have TRICARE For Life, you’ll get health care from Medicare providers. Here’s what you need to know about finding different types of Medicare providers.

“You can lower your health care costs when you see Medicare participating providers who accept the Medicare-approved amount as full payment,” said Anne Breslin, TRICARE For Life Program Manager at the Defense Health Agency. “Always prepare to show your Medicare card along with your Military ID card at any medical appointment.”

How do I find the right provider?

TFL is Medicare-wraparound coverage for TRICARE beneficiaries who have Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B. You can see three types of providers. This is described in the TRICARE For Life Handbook.

Medicare participating providers. They accept the Medicare-approved amount as full payment. Seeing these providers will result in the lowest costs.

Medicare nonparticipating providers. They don’t accept the Medicare amount as full payment. They can charge up to 15% more than Medicare allows. TRICARE covers this extra cost.

Opt-out providers. They don’t work with Medicare at all. You’ll pay much more when you see these providers. Medicare won’t pay anything. TRICARE only pays what it normally would. This is about 20% of the TRICARE-allowable charge. You pay the rest.

How do Medicare and TRICARE pay?

Medicare is generally your primary payer. Are you seeing a Medicare participating or Medicare nonparticipating provider? If so, then you have no out-of-pocket costs for services covered by both Medicare and TFL. Most health care services fall into this category. Medicare pays its portion of the claim, TRICARE pays the remaining amount, and you pay nothing.

Sometimes, TRICARE is your primary insurance. In this case, you must see TRICARE-authorized providers. This occurs when:

Medicare doesn’t cover the service.

You’re in overseas locations.

Can I get Department of Defense care?

You can get care at military hospitals and clinics if space is available.

How does Department of Veterans Affairs care work?

VA providers can’t bill Medicare. If you see a VA provider for care that isn’t related to a service-connected condition, you’ll pay about 80% of the bill. TRICARE only pays up to 20%. Want to see a VA provider? Call the TFL contractor, WPS Military and Veterans Health, at 866-773-0404 to check your coverage before you go.

What about care overseas?

Do you live overseas? You can usually see any civilian provider. You’ll need to pay up front and file your own claim. In the Philippines, you must see certified providers.

For emergencies overseas, try military hospitals first. If none are available, go to the nearest emergency care facility. Call the TRICARE Overseas regional call center within 24 hours if you’re admitted.

How do I get emergency and urgent care?

When getting emergency or urgent care, always show your Medicare card along with your Military ID card.

Do you need emergency care? Emergency care means care for an illness or injury that threatens your life, limb, sight, or safety. If you reasonably believe you have an emergency, always call 911 or your international emergency number. Or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Do you need urgent care? Urgent care treats conditions that need attention within 24 hours but aren’t life-threatening. Examples include sprains or rising fevers.

Are virtual health care visits covered?

You can get virtual health care via phone or video appointments. Medicare covers these visits when your provider accepts Medicare. TRICARE pays first if Medicare doesn’t cover the virtual health service.

Is mental health care covered?

Medicare covers visits with these mental health providers:

Psychiatrists and other doctors

Clinical psychologists

Clinical social workers

Clinical nurse specialists

Nurse practitioners

Physician assistants

What about services that need pre-authorization?

Some services need pre-authorization before you get care. These include:

Dental care for medical conditions

Home health care

Hospice care

Organ transplants

Some prescription drugs

Contact WPS if you have questions about pre-authorization requirements.

Remember! Seeing Medicare participating providers gives you the lowest out-of-pocket costs.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy: https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/find-pharmacy

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates: https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/notices/weather

We are legally (and happily) married, I am also on DEERS, and for the past year I have been able to access his information anytime I've called Tricare.
