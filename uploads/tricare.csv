TRICARE Authorizes Temporary Prescription Refill Waivers for 4 Iowa Counties due to Severe Storms

FALLS CHURCH, Va. – The Defense Health Agency has announced that TRICARE beneficiaries in four Iowa counties may receive emergency prescription refills now through May 1, due to severe storms.

The counties affected are Buena Vista, Fremont, Page, and Plymouth.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

Zynex, headquartered in Englewood, CO, is a medical device company that makes electrotherapy devices for pain management and rehabilitation.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report titled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills,"" which claimed that Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of supplies, such as electrode pads and batteries, in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024.

On March 11, 2025, Zynex reported Q4 and full-year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex further revealed ""Tricare [health insurance program for the U.S. military] has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025.

A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. The lead plaintiff is usually the investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Communicating with any counsel is not necessary to participate or share in any recovery achieved in this case. Any member of the purported class may move the Court to serve as a lead plaintiff through counsel of his/her choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an inactive class member.

Berger Montague, with offices in Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Delaware, Washington, D.C., San Diego, San Francisco and Chicago, has been a pioneer in securities class action litigation since its founding in 1970. Berger Montague has represented individual and institutional investors for over five decades and serves as lead counsel in courts throughout the United States.

Orsega's visit underscores the DOD’s and the Military Health System's focus on the Indo-Pacific region and commitment to ensuring and improving access to health care for active duty service members, family members, and DOD civilian employees.
In her role, Orsega oversees the DOD’s medical efforts in Japan, continuing work that began in January 2023 to address access to care challenges.
She chairs a monthly meeting of MHS and DOD components to discuss current initiatives, including emergency services, behavioral health, civilian access to care, and communications campaigns.
“Through continued dialogue between Pentagon leadership, frontline providers, and the total force in Japan, the DOD aims to develop tailored solutions to address the distinct challenges of delivering military health care in Japan while maintaining the highest standards of care for service members, their families, and DOD civilian employees,” she said.","Susan Orsega, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Services Policy and Oversight, visited military installations in Japan, April 7-11, 2025, to better understand challenges and successes to accessing health care in the region.

Orsega met with military hospital and clinic leaders at Misawa Air Base and Commander, Fleet Activities Yokosuka on mainland Japan and at Camp Foster on the island of Okinawa. Staff from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs also held listening sessions with Department of Defense civilian employees who are enrolled in the new Pilot Health Insurance Enhancement for DOD Civilian Employees in Japan as part of the pilot's evaluation.

Orsega's visit underscores the DOD’s and the Military Health System's focus on the Indo-Pacific region and commitment to ensuring and improving access to health care for active duty service members, family members, and DOD civilian employees. It also reflects the focus of Dr. Stephen Ferrara, the Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, to directly engage with military hospital and clinic staff to understand local challenges and successes.

""When Dr. Ferrara came on board, he gave us clear directives: He challenged us to immerse ourselves in the problems you face daily, especially given the unique complexities of this remote base,"" Orsega shared with military hospital and clinic staff at Misawa’s 35th Medical Group. ""He wanted us to understand your realities, roll up our sleeves, and work collaboratively to make your roles more effective, more efficient, and ultimately, more successful at serving our beneficiaries.""

During staff and leadership engagements, medical personnel in Japan highlighted challenges unique to this remote region. Supply chains face lengthy logistical hurdles, with United States’ medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, and equipment requiring more lead time compared to stateside facilities. Healthcare delivery for military families relies heavily, or even solely, on the military hospitals and clinics in comparison to installations in the United States with more robust and private sector care networks that are readily accessible through TRICARE.

The readiness mission remains top of mind for all healthcare personnel in Japan, given the region's strategic importance.

As Orsega emphasized during her visits, ""Ensuring that we're supporting our warfighters is a critical component of the Military Health System's mission, alongside sustaining clinical skills and supporting military families.”

This readiness focus takes on heightened significance in the Indo-Pacific region, where military hospitals and clinics operate on the frontline of potential conflict zones.

Despite these challenges, leadership across the MHS in Japan demonstrates “remarkable innovation and collaboration,” Orsega said.

Military hospitals and clinics have successfully built relationships with host nation healthcare systems, overcoming difficult language barriers and different medical practices. Leadership teams work across services, with U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Army medical personnel collaborating to provide seamless care, as evidenced by partnerships like the joint neonatal intensive care unit operations and related evacuations between U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa and the U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka.

U.S. Navy Capt. Kathleen Cooperman, commanding officer at U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, highlighted how staff have remained mission-focused through numerous transitions, including, ""staffing challenges, systems upgrades, changes to financial systems, mergers of dental corps,"" and various inspections. ""Not once did any one of these individuals lose sight of why we're here and what we need to do,"" she emphasized.

A team from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, led by the Chief of Staff Dr. Bryce Slinger, hosted six listening sessions with DOD civilian employees to inform an evaluation of the Pilot Health Insurance Enhancement. The services under this pilot began on Jan. 1, 2025, in response to DOD civilian employees' challenges in navigating the host-nation’s healthcare system. The pilot assists eligible DOD civilian employees with healthcare navigation, including provider-finder services, direct billing agreements, and insurance reimbursement.

The team received positive feedback, though civilians noted gaps in some specialty services, family coverage, and translation services. Based on these qualitative findings, paired with quantitative analysis, the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness will determine if the pilot will be extended past the current period of performance, ending on Sept. 29, 2025, and will consider additional solutions to bolster civilian care options.

Jimmie Mathews will serve 42 months, followed by three years of supervised release, with a restitution payment of $632,026.43.
The sentences aim to serve as a deterrent, signaling that health care fraud is not to be tolerated and will result in serious consequences.","A group of three individuals from the Lawton area, involved in a health care fraud scheme, have been handed down sentences to serve more than 12 years in federal prison, collectively. As reported by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Oklahoma in a recent press release, the trio was involved in defrauding TRICARE, the military health care program, for services that were not rendered, amounting to ill-gotten gains close to $3 million.

Jimmie Mathews, 41, and Nathan Mathews, 42, along with Amber Delger, 55, were implicated in a fraudulent billing operation dating back to 2016. Emerald Lane Therapy Services and Stars & Stripes Therapy, both owned by the Mathews brothers, billed TRICARE for multiple appointments that beneficiaries did not attend—sometimes months in advance. This scheme was revealed to have billed more than $7 million to the health program.

As stated in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Oklahoma press release, U.S. Attorney Robert J. Troester emphasized the gravity of exploiting such critical programs: ""These defendants exploited programs intended to provide critical benefits to our nation’s military, veterans, and their families"". Troester further highlighted his commitment to protecting taxpayer-funded institutions and ensuring the integrity of funds meant for those who serve our country.

In what U.S. District Judge Jodi W. Dishman described as an ""egregious and far-reaching"" fraud, Nathan Mathews was sentenced to serve 87 months in federal prison with a subsequent two years of supervised release, and ordered to pay restitution of $1,410,255.66. Jimmie Mathews will serve 42 months, followed by three years of supervised release, with a restitution payment of $632,026.43. Meanwhile, Delger received a 26-month sentence back in January of this year, with two years supervised release and restitution totaling $653,269.00.

This case is a result of vigilant investigation by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service of the United States Department of Defense, and was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney D.H. Dilbeck. Actions such as these, according to Acting Special Agent in Charge Chad Gosch, are pivotal in preventing schemes that compromise the welfare of military healthcare beneficiaries and waste valuable tax dollars. The sentences aim to serve as a deterrent, signaling that health care fraud is not to be tolerated and will result in serious consequences.",https://img.hoodline.com/2025/4/lawton-trio-sentenced-to-over-12-years-in-prison-for-dollar3-million-tricare-health-care-fraud-2.webp,N,0.0,2025-04-23 11:56:21.049798

In February 2025, the Defense Health Agency released a policy memorandum developed by the Sepsis Working Group.
The department's Defense Health Agency coordinates the delivery of these health services, in part through care provided at agency-operated military medical treatment facilities.
This report describes admissions involving sepsis at military medical treatment facilities and sepsis management efforts within the Defense Health Agency, including what entities focus on sepsis, what information is tracked, and selected military medical treatment facility experiences with sepsis diagnosis and treatment.
GAO also reviewed information on sepsis-related quality measures tracked by the Defense Health Agency and facilities' performance on these measures.","This Q&A report examines sepsis at Department of Defense-run medical facilities. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by an extreme response to an infection. It is a leading cause of hospital admissions and deaths.

Sepsis cases accounted for about 1% of admissions at DOD medical facilities in FYs 2017-2023.

DOD tracks 4 measures of medical facility quality related to sepsis. Military facilities generally met or beat the benchmark rates for these measures in calendar year 2023.

DOD established a sepsis strategy in February 2025 that includes monitoring facility performance on these measures.

What GAO Found

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by an extreme response to an infection in the body and typically requires hospital care. GAO's analysis of Defense Health Agency data indicates that the number of inpatient admissions at military medical treatment facilities that involved sepsis was relatively consistent from fiscal year 2017 through fiscal year 2023. These admissions accounted for more than 15,000 (about 1 percent) of the almost 1.3 million total inpatient admissions for this 7-year period. Further, for 86 percent of the admissions involving sepsis, the condition was present when the patient was admitted.

The Defense Health Agency formed a Sepsis Working Group in 2021 to standardize efforts related to sepsis detection, diagnosis, and treatment across military medical treatment facilities. In February 2025, the Defense Health Agency released a policy memorandum developed by the Sepsis Working Group. This memorandum establishes a sepsis strategy in the military medical treatment facilities, referencing national standards and guidelines, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Hospital Sepsis Program Core Elements and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines.

The Defense Health Agency tracks information on four sepsis-related quality measures. For these measures, military medical treatment facilities generally performed comparable to, or better than, the benchmark rates for all hospitals applicable to calendar year 2023. For example, military medical treatment facilities performed comparable to, or better than, the benchmark rates for all hospitals for measures pertaining to patients receiving appropriate care for sepsis in hospital settings, the death rate among surgical inpatients with sepsis as a serious treatable complication, and the rate of postoperative sepsis. Staff GAO interviewed at selected military medical treatment facilities did not report experiencing any major challenges specific to sepsis diagnosis and treatment.

Why GAO Did This Study

The Department of Defense is responsible for providing health care to approximately 9.4 million beneficiaries, including care that could involve the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis. The department's Defense Health Agency coordinates the delivery of these health services, in part through care provided at agency-operated military medical treatment facilities.

The House Report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 includes a provision for GAO to report on various issues related to sepsis within the Department of Defense. This report describes admissions involving sepsis at military medical treatment facilities and sepsis management efforts within the Defense Health Agency, including what entities focus on sepsis, what information is tracked, and selected military medical treatment facility experiences with sepsis diagnosis and treatment.

To conduct this work, GAO analyzed Defense Health Agency data on inpatient admissions involving sepsis at military medical treatment facilities from fiscal year 2017 through fiscal year 2023—the most recent data available. GAO also reviewed information on sepsis-related quality measures tracked by the Defense Health Agency and facilities' performance on these measures. GAO interviewed and obtained information from Defense Health Agency officials and staff from selected military medical treatment facilities, which were selected for variation in the number of sepsis cases treated, inpatient bed capacity, affiliated service branch, and geography.

""As a prescriber who plays ""beat the insurance company"" on a daily basis, here's my best advice: do not claim that it is not working. Have unmanageable side effects instead. In the medical world, effectiveness is a matter of professional opinion, which your insurer will feel they can debate. Side effects, on the other hand, are solely within the interpretation of the patient. Once negative side effects are reported -- that's it. An insurer cannot compel you to continue to take a drug that causes stomach pain, nausea so severe that you miss work, light-headedness that makes it dangerous to drive, etc. Wegovy is documented to have more difficult side effects than Zepbound. Do a search and see what your possible Wegovy side effects might be. It is unlikely that you would have none of them."" https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1k4fee8/comment/mo9mvts/?context=3

By reducing BSI rates and severity during initial training, the military can improve the readiness and resilience of its fighting force.","By V. Hauschild, MPH, Defense Centers for Public Health–Aberdeen Public Affairs

Bone stress injuries, which include stress fractures, can be debilitating to athletes but are also a problem for the U.S. military, according to public health experts.

“Service members who develop BSIs may be placed on a medical profile limiting duty or training activities, or even need orthopedic surgery,” says U.S. Army Maj. Shay Lopez, a physical therapist and chief of the Defense Health Agency-Public Health Injury Prevention Branch at Aberdeen, Maryland. “By finding ways to prevent and reduce the number and severity of BSIs, the military can improve force readiness, lethality, and reduce costs.”

In pursuit of this goal, experts from the DHA-PH have been studying trends and risk factors of BSI with scientists at the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine and military leaders at the U.S. Army Training Center at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, an initial entry training installation for nearly half of the U.S. Army.

These scientists now have a better understanding of some factors that may increase the risk of service members’ developing a BSI.

What are bone stress injuries?

A BSI is a type of musculoskeletal overuse injury resulting from gradual, repetitive force on bone tissues. Common activities in the military that cause these injuries are running, marching, and load-bearing exercises. MSK overuse injuries continue to be a primary reason for service members’ medical visits and cost the Department of Defense billions of dollars annually.

“While a gradual increase of exercise and physical activity will encourage bone and other supporting musculoskeletal tissues to strengthen over time, a BSI happens when the bone tissue doesn’t have enough time to build between activities,” says Katelyn Guerriere-Aaron, a senior research physiologist at USARIEM.

DHA-PH injury experts agree.

Lopez explains that BSIs may be missed during an initial medical exam. BSIs may take time to develop, are confused with other types of injuries, or are painless until becoming severe. Catching early signs of BSIs is also difficult with motivated military personnel, who want to ‘tough out’ physical training programs for fear of restarting (known as being “recycled”) or failing military training due to injury.

“Data show most BSIs in the military are to the lower parts of the body. This includes areas extending from the hip down to the toes,” says Ryan Steelman, a DHA-PH injury prevention epidemiologist. “BSIs to the tibia, which includes a condition sometimes referred to as shin splints, are especially common among men. Women more often experience BSI to the hip or the femoral neck, an upper portion of the thigh bone.”

Diagnosing BSI injuries can be challenging, even by doctors.

“BSIs, particularly hips, can be tricky to diagnose as the pain level doesn’t always equal the severity level, and X-ray imaging doesn’t always show early BSI,” says U.S. Army Maj. Gary Helton, assistant chief of the Fort Jackson Department of Sports Medicine. “Tibial BSIs, and hip BSIs, particularly the femoral neck, can lead to a complete fracture needing surgery if not addressed in a timely manner.”

Evidence indicates extensive running and long road marches with heavy rucksacks – especially on consecutive days – are associated with military lower-body MSK injuries like these BSIs.

“These training activities, however, are critical to ensuring personnel are ready for the physical rigors of combat operations,” says Steelman. “By studying BSI trends and risk factors, we are better able to help identify ways to reduce BSI impacts and build more resilient warfighters.”

Who is at risk?

New military recruits are particularly at risk of BSIs because their initial entry training, typically 10 to 16 weeks, often brings a sudden and substantial increase in the amount and intensity of their physical activity. DHA data show that while female service members have a higher risk of BSI, there are almost five times more male service members, so more men than women will develop a BSI.

“We have been diagnosing BSIs in recruits at Fort Jackson for years. A large number of these BSIs are diagnosed as early as the second and third week of training,” says Helton. “The treatment for these BSIs detracts from the success of the training.”

With support from DHA public health experts and USARIEM researchers, Helton has been able to objectively review BSI trends and risk factors and identify potential ways to reduce BSI severity and case numbers.

“Many recruits who are eventually injured in training lead relatively sedentary lives prior to enlistment, so they do not have the foundation necessary for the rigors of military training,” says Helton. “Preparing their bodies with physical training before volunteering for initial military training can reduce their risk of developing a BSI during initial training programs.”

While all forms of exercise before initial military entry can improve fitness, the type of physical activity may also be important.

“Our findings suggest that specific activities that require multi-directional body movement, such as soccer or basketball, may lower rates of BSI more than exercises like running or lifting by helping build stronger overall MSK structure,” says Julie Hughes, a senior researcher and colleague of Guerriere-Aaron at USARIEM.

What risk factors can be controlled?

USARIEM experts have highlighted an especially critical finding that could help reduce the risk of BSI.

“Several studies have pointed to excessive use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDS, during rigorous physical training activities as a factor that will increase BSI risk,” says Guerriere-Aaron. “NSAIDS have also been found to delay healing in those who do have a bone stress injury.”

Hughes agrees that use of NSAIDs, which include products that can be purchased over the counter, such as ibuprofen, may be one of the most significant and preventable risks of BSI.

“Our ongoing studies are finding that NSAIDS may increase BSI risk as much as five times during initial military entry training,” she says.

Many orthopedic doctors are aware that NSAIDs delay healing, but this may not be well known by others in the medical field, says Helton.

“Since NSAIDs can be effective for pain management, many providers may prescribe NSAIDS, such as ibuprofen, for pain,” he says. “But if pain is the result of potential bone injury, research suggests NSAIDS should be avoided.”

Helton points out that recruits in military initial entry training are dependent on military medical providers for any form of medication and typically cannot purchase over-the-counter medication such as ibuprofen.

“We are working to ensure military providers are aware of the NSAID risks with bone injuries. This is a key message we want to get out,” he says. “We also discourage NSAID use by recruits who may be able to access NSAIDs over the counter or from a buddy.”

Past evidence has also indicated that low bone density is a risk factor for BSI among young women who have other risk factors. Key underlying risks include poor nutrition and/or being underweight, and excessive exercise. Recent evidence suggests similar risks among young adults of both genders may contribute to low bone density and thus increase BSI risk.

Another consideration Helton observed is the added stress on recruits’ lower body bones during running or ruck march formations if drill sergeants tell recruits to ‘stride it out’, particularly shorter trainees.

“There appears to be more bone stress if a trainee has to change their normal gait and stretch their legs forward to keep up with formation, landing harder on the heel and increasing stress at the hip,” Helton says. “Quicker, shorter steps may be safer, or – even better – putting shorter persons up front in a formation to manage the pace.”

What can be done by service members?

An estimated one-third of applicants to military entry training don’t meet basic military fitness standards. Recruits who are more physically fit before their initial training program have lower BSI rates. Other underlying factors, such as poor diet and lack of sleep, may make some service members more vulnerable to developing a BSI than others.

Lopez recommends that before military initial training, recruits should:

- Gradually increase various exercising drills to include agility, power and balance training along with more traditional aerobic endurance (cardio) and strength exercises.

- Allow time between exercise sessions for rest and bone recovery.

During training, recruits should:

- Avoid NSAIDS for bone pain.

- Eat nutritional foods to maintain energy levels.

- Prioritize sleep to allow for bone recovery.

- Avoid overreaching gaits and striding out; aim for shorter quick steps.

- Seek medical assessment at the earliest signs of bone pain and follow recovery treatment plans to avoid more serious BSIs.

By reducing BSI rates and severity during initial training, the military can improve the readiness and resilience of its fighting force.

OKLAHOMA CITY – JIMMIE MATHEWS, 41, NATHAN MATHEWS, 42, and AMBER DELGER, 55, all of the Lawton area, have been sentenced for their roles in a conspiracy to commit health care fraud, announced U.S. Attorney Robert J. Troester.

The defendants were each charged in May 2024, with Delger being charged by Information with conspiring to commit health care fraud, and both Jimmie and Nathan charged by a 16-count federal grand jury Indictment with conspiring to commit health care fraud and fifteen counts of health care fraud. Beginning in 2016, Nathan owned Emerald Lane Therapy Services (Emerald Lane) in Lawton, a massage therapy provider. Delger was a subsequent co-owner of the company. Nathan and Jimmie also owned a separate massage therapy provider, Stars & Stripes Therapy (Stars & Stripes), which opened its doors in Lawton in January 2020. Both businesses purportedly treated TRICARE beneficiaries, submitted claims to the Defense Health Agency (DHA), and received payments from DHA for those services.

According to public record, beginning in January 2018, the defendants conspired together to submit false and fraudulent claims to TRICARE for services that were never rendered. Court documents allege that after TRICARE beneficiaries visited either of the businesses, the defendants would schedule multiple appointments for the beneficiaries many months in advance. If the beneficiary couldn’t make the appointments, or stopped coming altogether, the defendants would nonetheless continue to bill TRICARE as if the beneficiaries had received care. Additionally, Emerald Lane billed TRICARE using the National Provider Identity (NPI) number of an occupational therapist long after the therapist had stopped working for the business. In total, Emerald Lane and Stars & Stripes billed more than $7 million to TRICARE and received nearly $3 million in reimbursement.

In October 2024, Jimmie and Nathan pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit health care fraud. Previously, on June 17, 2024, Delger pleaded guilty to the same.

“Through their fraudulent conduct, these defendants exploited programs intended to provide critical benefits to our nation’s military, veterans, and their families” said U.S. Attorney Robert J. Troester. “Through vigorous investigation and prosecution, we will continue to protect taxpayer funded institutions and ensure that TRICARE dollars are protected and properly allocated to help those who serve.”

“The Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) is committed to ensuring TRICARE, the U.S. Military healthcare program, is not subjected to fraudulent schemes that expose beneficiaries to harm and waste valuable tax dollars,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Chad Gosch of the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, DCIS Southwest Field Office. “These sentencings demonstrate our tireless pursuit to investigate individuals that seek to enrich themselves at the expense of this valuable program.”

Last week, U.S. District Judge Jodi W. Dishman sentenced both Nathan and Jimmie. Nathan was sentenced to serve 87 months in federal prison, followed by two years of supervised release, and ordered to pay $1,410,255.66 in restitution. Jimmie was sentenced to serve 42 months in federal prison, followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay $632,026.43 in restitution. Delger was previously sentenced on January 31, 2025, to serve 26 months in federal prison, followed by two years of supervised release, and ordered to pay $653,269.00. In announcing the sentences, Judge Dishman described the fraud scheme as egregious and far reaching in its scope, duration, and impact. Judge Dishman further noted that the public needs to know that health care fraud is not acceptable, will not be tolerated, and will result in prosecution and punishment.

This case is the result of an investigation by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service of the United States Department of Defense. Assistant U.S. Attorney D.H. Dilbeck prosecuted the case.

According to Psychology Technician Angela Kuesters, military children also benefit from learning to regulate their emotions, develop problem-solving skills and connect with peers facing similar circumstances.
“Military children deal with complex emotions early on.
“Military children make sacrifices too.
“Strong Families create strong Soldiers,” Ragan said.","At Bayne-Jones Army Community Hospital, behavioral health professionals are emphasizing the importance of mental health care in building resilience among military-connected youth because strong families increase the lethality of our warfighters

The Child and Family Behavioral Health Services team at BJACH provides targeted support to help children and Families manage the unique challenges of military life—frequent moves, parental deployments and long separations.

“Our team delivers counseling, coping strategies and crisis intervention to help children build emotional strength and stability,” said Marguerite Wilcox, a licensed clinical social worker with the department. “We tailor care to meet each child’s needs and reinforce their support systems.”

BJACH’s behavioral health staff offers a range of services including grief counseling, skills-building, parenting support, psychological testing, and trauma-specific treatments such as Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, or EMDR.

Dr. Patricia Cornelius, deputy director of psychological health, said supporting military children starts with understanding the emotional strain of transitions and disrupted relationships.

“Resilience helps them bounce back from adversity and adapt to change,” she said. “Mental health care gives children the tools to cope and succeed.”

For children who may be experiencing behavioral or developmental concerns, early intervention is key, said Pfc. Dice Marchioni, a behavioral health specialist at BJACH.

“We guide Families through what care looks like, help them access resources and ensure they understand the support available,” Marchioni said.

According to Psychology Technician Angela Kuesters, military children also benefit from learning to regulate their emotions, develop problem-solving skills and connect with peers facing similar circumstances.

“Building community matters,” she said. “Mental health care plays a fundamental role in creating that support and helping children grow.”

Dr. Ruth Graupera-Frain, a psychiatrist with the team, emphasized the long-term benefits of mental health support.

“Our brains run the show,” she said. “Military children deal with complex emotions early on. Providing consistent care improves their academic, social and emotional development well into adulthood.”

Lt. Col. Alexander Ragan, BJACH’s assistant director of medical affairs and the director of psychological health at Fort Johnson, said these services don’t just support the child—they strengthen the whole force.

“When we take care of military Families, we reinforce readiness,” Ragan said. “Military children make sacrifices too. Supporting their mental health ensures their resilience and helps prepare the next generation of Soldiers.”

BJACH’s behavioral health team remains committed to the mission of improving Family readiness and supporting the military community through expert, compassionate care.

“Strong Families create strong Soldiers,” Ragan said. “And strong Soldiers protect our nation.”

Here’s a closer look at what the handbook highlights.

Understanding how TFL works

Wondering what the transition to TFL will be like? The first thing you should know is that if you’re TRICARE-eligible and have Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B, your transition to TFL is automatic. You don’t need to enroll.

As you make the transition, the handbook can help ease the way. The sections take you through:

• Medicare and TRICARE eligibility

• How Medicare and TFL work together

• What services are covered

• How to get care where you live and when you travel

You’ll learn how TFL works with other health insurance. The handbook also describes your dental and vision coverage options. This includes coverage through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program.

Remember, you have TFL when you’re TRICARE-eligible and have premium-free Medicare Part A (hospitalization insurance) and Medicare Part B (medical insurance, which has a monthly premium), regardless of age or where you live.

Be sure to check the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System to verify that all your information is up to date.

Knowing your pharmacy coverage options

Pharmacy coverage is a priority. TFL offers the same comprehensive prescription drug coverage as other TRICARE health plans, as well as the same convenient options for filling your prescriptions. You can get your prescriptions through:

• Military pharmacies

• TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery

• TRICARE retail network pharmacies

• Non-network pharmacies

Note: You don’t need a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan to keep your TRICARE prescription drug coverage. With Medicare Part D, you may also pay a monthly premium, and you’ll need to follow the plan’s rules for filling prescriptions.

Learning how to get the most from Medicare and TFL

Anytime you change health plans, there’s a learning curve. With TFL, you may wonder how to:

• Find a provider

• Ensure you won’t have any out-of-pocket costs for a service

• Get care if you travel or live overseas

• Obtain a pre-authorization or referral for care

• File claims, an appeal, or a grievance

• Know the difference between Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage

• Get more information

For TRICARE beneficiaries in private sector care, two 2022 DHA contractor reviews showed significantly lower screening rates than direct care.
Missing screenings could result in undiagnosed and untreated perinatal mental health conditions in TRICARE beneficiaries.
Factors such as isolation from social support networks may place military beneficiaries at risk of developing perinatal mental health conditions.
This report examines the screening of TRICARE beneficiaries for perinatal mental health conditions in direct and private sector care.","What GAO Found

The Department of Defense's (DOD) Defense Health Agency (DHA) oversees the TRICARE program that provides health care to beneficiaries—active-duty service members and their dependents. Beneficiaries receive care in military medical treatment facilities (direct care) and through civilian providers, generally administered by two managed care support contractors (private sector care). This care includes addressing mental health conditions that occur during and up to 1 year after pregnancy, known as the perinatal period.

GAO estimates that 52 percent of the 6,151 service members who delivered through direct care in fiscal year 2022 received DHA's three recommended perinatal mental health screenings. These screenings used one of two DHA-recommended tools and were performed at DHA's specified time intervals. All service members were screened at least once during their perinatal period.

Estimated Percentage of Service Members Screened for Perinatal Mental Health Conditions in Direct Care, Fiscal Year 2022

Note: The percentages in the figure represent those screenings that were conducted in accordance with DHA recommendations. GAO reviewed medical records for a random sample of 291 service members with live births in direct care—in a military medical treatment facility—in fiscal year 2022 out of a total population of 6,151. Estimates in this figure have a margin of error within plus or minus 6 percent at the 95 percent confidence interval.

For TRICARE beneficiaries in private sector care, two 2022 DHA contractor reviews showed significantly lower screening rates than direct care. For example, one contractor found that 30 percent of beneficiaries were screened at least once, and about 6 percent were screened more than once.

GAO found that DHA does not monitor or direct its contractors to monitor the frequency of perinatal mental health screenings in direct or private sector care. DOD has indicated that screening is its main prevention strategy for this high-risk group. Missing screenings could result in undiagnosed and untreated perinatal mental health conditions in TRICARE beneficiaries. By routinely monitoring the frequency of screenings in direct and private sector care, and taking corrective actions as needed to ensure adherence to DHA's recommendations and evidence-based practices, DHA can help ensure that beneficiaries consistently receive high-quality care.

Why GAO Did This Study

TRICARE provides health care to about 9.5 million eligible beneficiaries. In fiscal year 2023, there were about 89,000 births among TRICARE beneficiaries. Research shows mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety are the most common complications that develop during the perinatal period. Mental health is a critical part of military readiness. Factors such as isolation from social support networks may place military beneficiaries at risk of developing perinatal mental health conditions.

A report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 includes a provision for GAO to review issues related to perinatal mental health in the military. This report examines the screening of TRICARE beneficiaries for perinatal mental health conditions in direct and private sector care.

GAO reviewed a generalizable sample of 291 service members' medical records that had a live birth in a military medical treatment facility in fiscal year 2022—the most recent year for which complete data were available. GAO reviewed DHA documents, two contractor reviews, and relevant laws. GAO also interviewed DHA officials and contractor representatives.",https://www.gao.gov/assets/extracts/efa9a09bc88bcfb026529c867e1b611b/fastfacts_107163.png,N,-1.0,2025-04-22 11:56:29.120265

Yet, even the strongest and most courageous among us sometimes need support. Especially when raising teenagers who struggle with mental health or behavioral health issues.

Military life demands frequent moves, long deployments, and constant uncertainty. Consequently, even the most resilient military families experience overwhelming stress and invisible strains.

Not surprisingly, adapting to a new home, school, and community takes a significant toll on a fragile teen’s mental health and well-being. In this article, we take a closer look at TRICARE East’s coverage for residential treatment. In addition to other benefits related to treating teen mental health.

Today’s adolescents face unique challenges and pressures unlike any previous generation. Consequently, this has led to an alarming rise in teen emotional and behavioral health issues. Adding to this, consider the intense academic pressures and the pervasive influence of social media in teens’ daily lives. It is no wonder so many are struggling with their emotional well-being.

The Surgeon General described it as a ‘mental health epidemic.” Highlighting the urgent need for more effective interventions and teen mental health treatment.

Recognizing the critical need for specialized mental health support for military teens, TRICARE East has approved Turning Winds Residential Treatment Center as a comprehensive treatment provider option. Turning Winds now accepts TRICARE East as an insurance option for military families whose teens are in need of residential care. This collaboration aims to provide a lifeline for military families seeking recovery and healing for their adolescents.

Recognizing Teen Mental Health Warning Signs: A Parent’s Guide

According to Pew Research, nearly 70% of parents believe it’s harder to be a teenager today than it was for previous generations. Parents need to recognize the warning signs that a teen may be struggling, such as:

Significant changes in mood or behavior

Withdrawing from activities once enjoyed

Sudden academic decline or discipline issues

Understanding the Unique Stressors Faced by Military Teens

While all adolescents grapple with mounting pressures, military teens face more stress, resulting from the unique stressors of military life.

Long separations from deployed parents and the high levels of uncertainty caused by the frequent moves, the distance from the extended families, and other stressors typically intensify emotional struggles and behavioral health issues.

These pressures can significantly impact a teen’s emotional health. In fact, research shows that adolescents in military-connected families are 28% more likely to experience depression symptoms and 42% more likely to report lower life satisfaction compared to their civilian peers.[1]

These findings highlight the critical importance of providing early mental health intervention and targeted support for military teens navigating the unique pressures of military life.

TRICARE East offers expanded mental health coverage to ensure military teens struggling with emotional or behavioral challenges can access professional care when they need it most.

As a result, Residential Treatment Centers (RTCs) like Turning Winds can now offer mental health services to support military families and their struggling teens.

For military families with teens in need of emotional or behavioral health treatment, Turning Winds, a teen mental health residential treatment, is a new treatment option to help their teens find a new path of recovery and healing.

Whether your teen struggles with:

anxiety

depression

co-occurring conditions

behavioral issues

PTSD

is involved in high-risk behaviors

misuses substances

has a technology or social media addiction

Turning Winds’ unique hybrid therapeutic program offers personalized treatment for teens. And, while in treatment, your teenager can continue to work on their academics, helping them to heal, catch up, or excel, so they return home ready to live their best life.

What is TRICARE East?

TRICARE East is the healthcare program offered by the Department of Defense and administered by Humana Military. TRICARE East provides coverage to military families living in the eastern United States. Vital mental and behavioral health treatment is available to families of active duty, retirees, and dependents.

While TRICARE East functions like traditional health insurance and offers access to care, it is more. Officially, it is a comprehensive healthcare program. What parents need to know is that TRICARE East covers residential treatment for your teenager, in addition to other mental health and behavioral health therapies.

TRICARE East provides coverage for both outpatient and inpatient Care. To help parents understand the differences and benefits between these treatment options, we created a comprehensive TRICARE East Care Options Comparison Chart:

Accessing Outpatient Therapy Under TRICARE East: Flexible Support

Outpatient therapy typically includes regular counseling sessions, psychiatric visits, and other supportive services while your teen continues to live at home. These services can include:

Individual therapy

Family therapy

Medication management

Group therapy sessions

Benefits of Outpatient Mental Health Care for Military Teens (TRICARE East)

Allows teens to maintain their daily routines, including school and family activities.

Provides flexibility for families who may have frequent moves or changing schedules.

Often used as a first step or a lower level of care when symptoms are moderate.

Lower cost compared to inpatient programs.

When Outpatient Therapy Isn’t Enough: Exploring TRICARE East Residential Options

May not provide enough structure for teens with severe mental health issues.

Requires a stable home environment and strong family involvement to be effective.

Progress can be slower when intensive daily support is needed.

TRICARE East Coverage for 24/7 Residential Mental Health Treatment for Teens in Crisis

Inpatient care (also referred to as residential treatment or hospitalization, depending on the level of need) provides around-the-clock support for teens who are struggling with more serious emotional, behavioral, or psychiatric issues. TRICARE East covers a range of inpatient services, including:

Psychiatric hospitalization for acute crises

Residential treatment centers (RTCs) for ongoing therapeutic care

Partial hospitalization programs (PHPs) as a step-down from full inpatient care

The Benefits of Intensive Residential Treatment for Teen Mental Health

Provides intensive therapy, medical supervision, and emotional support 24/7.

Removes teens from environments that may be contributing to their mental health struggles.

An excellent option for teens to develop emotional regulation and learn new skills to manage their responses.

Structured daily schedules focused on healing, skill-building, and stabilization.

Essential for teens experiencing safety risks, such as suicidal ideation or severe behavioral disturbances.

Choosing the Right TRICARE East Mental Health Option for Your Teen: Inpatient vs. Outpatient

Your child’s specific needs and the severity of their symptoms will determine the level of care they require. The important thing for parents to know is that there is a path to healing for your teen. TRICARE East offers access to both outpatient and inpatient options, ensuring a pathway to healing, hope, and recovery.

Before your child is admitted into a residential treatment center, TRICARE East requires pre-authorization. For the treatment to be authorized, it must be deemed medically necessary, and the process often involves providing comprehensive documentation from a licensed mental health professional.

What Is Considered Medically Necessary: This means the treatment must be essential for addressing the teen’s mental health condition, with clear clinical documentation supporting the need for this level of care.

Work with us to Get Pre-authorization

Step 1: We Will Verify Your Benefits. We validate available coverage and requirements. We review all financial aspects that affect treatment, including deductibles, copays, and out-of-pocket maximums. These costs can vary depending on your specific plan and the type of treatment your child will receive, our goal is to help you understand exactly what TRICARE East will cover.

Step 2: Necessary Documentation. We work closely with TRICARE East to obtain clarification on the documentation required for approval of your teen’s specific needs, ensuring you have the right documentation and referrals. We also evaluate your child and submit the treatment plan.

Step 3: We Help You Streamline the Process. Our admissions team has experience working with TRICARE East. They will keep you informed on all administrative tasks required to facilitate the preauthorization approval process, including all necessary paperwork submissions.

By proactively working with you through these steps, we avoid delays and ensure your teen receives the care they need without unnecessary roadblocks.

Clinical Documentation Requirements for TRICARE East Residential Treatment

To support residential treatment claims, you’ll need evaluations from mental health professionals, treatment plans, and progress notes. These documents help demonstrate the need for residential treatment to Tricare East.

Appealing TRICARE East Denials for Teen Residential Treatment

Residential treatment claims have a higher risk of denial due to the complexities of treatment, the strict documentation requirements, and the ongoing need for preapprovals; not just at admissions but throughout treatment.

Two men who ran a New Jersey-based marketing company have been sentenced to federal prison for orchestrating a nationwide health care fraud and kickback scheme that bilked Medicare and TRICARE out of over $127 million, according to a statement released by the U.S. Department of Justice.

Eric Karlewicz, also known as “Anthony Mazza,” 46, of Rockland County, New York, was sentenced to 51 months in prison, while Nicco Romanowski, 33, of Roswell, Georgia, received an 80-month sentence.

The two were sentenced by U.S. District Judge Esther Salas in Newark federal court after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit health care fraud and conspiracy to violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute.

According to federal prosecutors, from mid-2017 to mid-2019, Karlewicz and Romanowski operated Empire Pain Center Holdings LLC, a marketing company that worked with doctors, telemedicine firms, and medical equipment suppliers to submit fraudulent claims for durable medical equipment (DME) such as braces for shoulders, knees, and backs.

Using aggressive call tactics, Empire employees pressured Medicare and TRICARE recipients to accept medical equipment they often didn’t need.

The company then paid kickbacks to telemedicine firms, which in turn paid doctors to sign off on the orders—frequently without consulting patients.

The prescriptions were sent to DME suppliers, who submitted claims for reimbursement and shared a portion of the proceeds with Empire.

Through these illicit arrangements, Karlewicz and Romanowski’s company received more than $63 million, while the total fraudulent claims exceeded $127 million.

Authorities said the two used proceeds from the scheme to purchase high-end luxury cars including a Ferrari, Lamborghini, Bentley, and BMW.

In addition to prison time, each defendant was sentenced to three years of supervised release and ordered to pay $127.6 million in restitution.",https://www.rlsmedia.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/field/image/article/IMG_2646.jpeg?h=8f74817f&itok=KWrmrwXA,N,0.0,2025-04-22 06:56:23.784610

They include the American Medical Specialties Board as well as the AOA Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists, and specialty boards for podiatric medicine, foot and ankle, and oral and maxillofacial surgery.
An official with the agency tells the Sun that any physician who meets its standards can work at a military facility, regardless of board certification.
“Board certification is not required for any physicians hired by the military to work within our military medical treatment facilities,” the official said.
“ABMS and AOA are inherently recognized as having unique credentials with respect to board certification,” she said.","A physicians group representing about 5 percent of America’s doctors is asking Congress to break a monopoly held by its rival — the nation’s largest medical board certification group — which it charges has gained exclusive control over military and veterans hospitals, shutting out qualified physicians with needed specialty skills.

The American Board of Physician Specialists certifies doctors in 25 fields, including familiar practices such as anesthesiology, diagnostic radiology, family practice, and obstetrics and gynecology, as well as distinct specialties like integrative medicine and pain management. The group’s CEO, Jeff Morris, says that uniquely skilled doctors are being ignored by the military because of a sweetheart arrangement with the American Board of Medical Specialties, which represents more than 900,000 doctors nationwide. He contends the deal is driving up costs, reducing innovation, and denying access to care.

“Reaching medical readiness is important,“ Mr. Morris tells the Sun. “If you have just one entity controlling that, you no longer have a difference of thought. So then what happens to innovation in medicine?”

The National Defense Authorization Act recognizes credentials from five boards. They include the American Medical Specialties Board as well as the AOA Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists, and specialty boards for podiatric medicine, foot and ankle, and oral and maxillofacial surgery. The act lists qualifications that other boards must meet to become credentialed with the military’s medical care provider, the Defense Health Agency.

An official with the agency tells the Sun that any physician who meets its standards can work at a military facility, regardless of board certification.

“Board certification is not required for any physicians hired by the military to work within our military medical treatment facilities,” the official said. “Our physicians need to have an appropriate license and applicable degree from an accredited institution, along with appropriate post-graduate training certificates for their specialty such as internship residency or fellowship, and evidence of current clinical competency, but board certifications are not required for hiring or for retention.”

While board certification is said to be optional, without it, doctors don’t get hired, Mr. Morris asserted, claiming that the military’s hiring authorities are members of the pre-eminent boards. One emergency medicine doctor with the military added that doctors can only earn the annual incentive pay bonus for certification if they are certified by a credentialed board.

“In terms of practicing in the military, it’s a pay issue because you have a pay incentive if you are board certified through an organization that is recognized by the military,” the doctor, who has been working as a reservist for more than three decades, tells the Sun. “Your board certification was not recognized unless it was through the ABMS.”

The Defense Health Agency official did not provide the number of physicians who operate without board certification or the percentage of certified physicians who are certified by the medical specialties board.

Founded by the American Medical Association in the 1930s in an effort for physicians to assert their medical expertise, the American Medical Specialties Board represents 95 percent of America’s doctors and offers certification by 24 boards in 136 subspecialties.

The organization’s associate vice president for communications, Susan C. Morris, tells the Sun that her organization had no role in determining which boards were recognized in the defense bill, “whether by name or through the standards.” She added that the defense authorization act mirrors the American Medical Association’s standards policy.

“ABMS and AOA are inherently recognized as having unique credentials with respect to board certification,” she said. “The high quality and rigor of the ABMS member boards’ certification programs lead to better care and outcomes for patients.”

Mr. Morris predicts that without recognition of other boards, lack of innovation and increasing costs will only get worse. Last month, Republicans on the House Judiciary’s antitrust subcommittee wrote several residency programs and accreditation councils asking whether hiring practices suppress doctors’ mobility and pay and contribute to doctor shortages.

The medical residency antitrust exemption passed by Congress in 2004 “has distorted the American medical residency market, undermining free market principles to the detriment of the nation’s doctors and the patients who rely on them,” wrote House Ways and Means’ antitrust subcommittee chairman, Scott Fitzgerald.

Among the letter’s recipients was the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education, which was co-founded by the American Medical Specialities Board and is funded by American taxpayers to the tune of $15 billion per year.

“Now you have two entities that work together to control physicians and how medicine is taught completely,” Mr. Morris said.

Ms. Morris disputed claims that her board plays a role in the governance of the accreditation council, but acknowledged that some member boards “have programs to help educate residents about the board certification process for that specialty or subspecialty.”

The federation representing state medical licensing authorities also notes that board certification is voluntary, but “other practical considerations — such as obtaining hospital privileges — lead most physicians to obtain specialty certification.”

At least seven licensing authorities — in Alabama, Iowa, Minnesota, Oregon, Tennessee Medical, Virginia, Wyoming — give preferential treatment to candidates certified by the American Medical Specialties Board. These preferences include allowing physician candidates additional time to obtain a medical license, lowering post-graduate training requirements, and increasing the number of exam attempts a physician can take.

This preference system is just another example of how a stranglehold on board recognition lowers standards without improving care, Mr. Morris said, noting that military members, including Special Forces being deployed with a medic, are disadvantaged as a result.

“There are a lot of boards that don’t even exist yet because medicine is constantly changing,” he said. “These certifying bodies should be able to present themselves, and the Defense Health Agency looks and says, you meet the standard, you’re accepted.”",https://wp.nysun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ear-nose-and-throat-doctors-on-ship.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=fill&fm=jpg&fl=progressive,N,0.0,2025-04-22 06:56:33.737020

From service cancellations to mounting debt, they're fighting for accountability after a change from TRICARE's east to west region.

That change has left a trail of frustrations for Texas families and providers.

""There just needs to be accountability,"" said active military spouse Rebecca Brown. ""Somebody, somewhere within the 'Triwest' system knows what is going on and what needs to be fixed.""

Brown expected a smooth transition from the old company, Humana.

""It has been the exact opposite of that,"" she said. ""We have had referrals get lost, referrals not show up at all and having to reach out directly via phone call to Triwest agents to try and rectify the problem.""

Brown's daughter lives with autism. Referrals make sure she gets the treatment she needs from providers.

According to a by Mission Alpha Advocacy, 75% of TRICARE West Region families experienced disruptions after the January 1 shift.

Providers have also struggled with the transition.

""We couldn't get paid. We couldn't even get into the system,"" said Intergrated Behavior Solutions owner, Britt Sims. ""So it was weeks and weeks of trying to figure that out, and on into the end of January.. before we even talked to anybody that had any clue what was happening.""

The San Antonio clinic mainly serve children and teens with autism. They've had to make tough calls to keep the lights on.

Some have even has to drop TRICARE patients to stay afloat.

""We're four loans in. Most of us that are small providers are."" Sims said. ""It's not about it's not about money. It's not about claims. It's about services, direct services that these children with autism desperately need.""

Those loans total up to roughly $180,000 in debt to keep serving his 90% of his clients who fall under TriWest; and all at the risk of taking a hit to his practice.

""These kids are worth it. These families are worth it. So, let's keep fighting,"" he said. ""But we can't really take any more TRICARE kids.. right now, we don't know what's going to happen with that. So that's a burden for us.""

""We're at danger of approaching irreparable harm to our TRICARE provider network, and that will affect our military readiness and resilience and retention,"" said Mission Alpha Advocacy CEO Kristi Cabiao.

Advocates like Cabiao are now helping push those concerns to the desks of state and local leaders.

""They have responded, but I encourage families to keep reaching out so that it stays in the front of the minds of the congressional members,"" she said. ""Because there's a lot of noise and there's a lot of activity happening.""

""These people served our country, they've put their lives on the line in many situations,"" Brown said. ""This is just something that shouldn't have happened in the first place but -- now that it has happened — it needs to be resolved.""

We've heard from several other families facing the same problems.

We reached out to Triwest to figure out what's going on.

These include Beneficiary Counseling and Assistance Coordinators. You can find them at any military hospital or clinic.

Before you reach out to a BCAC, it’s important to first contact your regional contractor for help with TRICARE issues. Most TRICARE questions and concerns—such as those about enrollment, claims, referrals, or provider networks—can be handled directly through them. If you've already reached out to your contractor and still need help, a BCAC is your next step. They can take a deeper look at your issue and help guide you toward a resolution.

To get help, start by contacting the appropriate resource:

Questions about TRICARE eligibility or updates to a military service record: Contact your Service Personnel Component or the DMDC/DEERS Support Office (800-538-9552).

Questions about enrollment, claims, provider networks, or referrals: Contact your regional contractor first.

So, when should you get in touch with a BCAC? Read below to learn more.

What does a Beneficiary Counseling and Assistance Coordinator do?

BCACs can explain your TRICARE plan and how your benefit works. They work closely with regional contractors and claims processors to help resolve your concerns.

BCACs can address TRICARE-related questions, including:

Enrollment

Referrals and pre-authorizations

Claims processing delays

Covered services

The Military Health System Nurse Advice Line

Getting healthcare services outside the military hospital or clinic

“You may have questions or concerns about TRICARE enrollment, coverage, or costs that haven’t been resolved through traditional channels. BCACs are people you can contact, and even meet with in person,” said Calvin Keller, health systems analyst, Benefit Education, at the Defense Health Agency. “They’re committed to answering your questions and addressing your concerns.”

For example, you may have a question about your TRICARE eligibility or enrollment as shown in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. Maybe your record shows “No healthcare coverage plan” and you believe this is an error. After reaching out to the DMDC/DEERS Support Office, a BCAC can:

Explain the different messages you see in your DEERS record

Provide information on eligibility requirements

Guide you on how to follow up with your sponsor’s Service Personnel Component

BCACs don’t determine or fix TRICARE eligibility—but they can be a valuable resource in navigating the process.

Why reach out to a BCAC?

If you feel lost after trying to resolve issues with your regional contractor or service, there are still other TRICARE experts who can help. Consider reaching out to a BCAC. BCACs will work with you to understand your concerns and explore possible solutions.

Who can get help from a BCAC?

Do you still have questions after contacting your regional contractor? Any TRICARE beneficiary can visit or call a BCAC, even if you don’t regularly get care at a military hospital or clinic, or live far from one.

How do I find a BCAC?

You can meet with a BCAC in person by walking into their office. You don’t need an appointment. If you can’t get there in person, you can give them a call.

Each military hospital or clinic has contact information for their BCAC. Find their information online on the Find a Military Hospital or Clinic page. Or check out the Customer Service Community Directory. You can also ask the hospital staff for their office location if you’d like to meet in person.

What’s the difference between a BCAC and a patient advocate?

While both are there to support you, BCACs and patient advocates have different roles. BCACs help with TRICARE benefits. Patient advocates help with concerns or questions about healthcare services you received at a military hospital or clinic.

They can:

Explain the Patient Bill of Rights and Responsibilities and give you a copy

Explain military hospital or clinic policies, procedures, and operations

Eric Karlewicz a/k/a “Anthony Mazza,” 46, of Rockland County, New York, and Nicco Romanowski, 33, of Roswell, Georgia, were sentenced by U.S. District Judge Esther Salas in Newark federal court following their guilty pleas to Informations charging conspiracy to violate the Federal Anti-Kickback statute and conspiracy to commit health care fraud. Karlewicz was sentenced to 51 months in prison and Romanowski was sentenced to 80 months in prison.

According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:

From in or around June 2017 through in or around May 2019, Karlewicz and Romanowski participated in a scheme with durable medical equipment (“DME”) companies, telemedicine companies, and doctors to submit false claims to health care benefit programs, including Medicare and TRICARE, based on a circular scheme of kickbacks and bribes. Karlewicz and Romanowski controlled a New Jersey-based marketing company, Empire Pain Center Holdings LLC (“Empire”), though which they and their co-conspirators identified Medicare and TRICARE beneficiaries to target. Employees of Empire called the beneficiaries to pressure them to agree to accept DME, frequently consisting of back, shoulder, and knee braces. Karlewicz and Romanowski paid Empire’s employees commissions, bonuses, and incentives to encourage them to convince as many beneficiaries as possible to accept DME, regardless of medical necessity.

Karlewicz and Romanowski, through Empire, then paid kickbacks to telemedicine companies, which in turn paid kickbacks to doctors in exchange for prescriptions for the DME. As agreed upon, the doctors signed the prescription orders regardless of medical necessity, often without ever speaking to the patient. Karlewicz and Romanowski distributed the prescriptions to DME suppliers around the country, with which Empire had additional kickback arrangements. These DME suppliers submitted claims for reimbursement to health care benefit programs including Medicare and TRICARE, and thereafter sent a portion of the proceeds to Empire as payment for the doctor’s orders generated through the conspiracy. Empire received more than $63 million from DME suppliers in exchange for the referrals.

In total, Karlewicz and Romanowski caused the submission of false and fraudulent claims to health care benefit programs totaling in excess of $127 million for DME. Using proceeds from the scheme, Karlewicz and Romanowski purchased luxury vehicles, including a Ferrari, and Lamborghini, a Bentley, and a BMW.

In addition to the prison terms, Judge Salas sentenced each defendant to three years of supervised release and ordered them to pay $127,600,000 in restitution. Karlewicz was ordered to forfeit over $63 million, and Romanowski was ordered to forfeit over $5.5 million.

United States Attorney Habba also announced that Karlewicz and Empire entered into a civil settlement agreement. As part of that civil settlement agreement, Karlewicz and Empire admitted to violating the False Claims Act and agreed to the entry of a consent judgment against them in the amount of $63.8 million.

The civil settlement agreement resolves a lawsuit filed under the whistleblower provision of the False Claims Act, which permits private parties, called relators, to file suit on behalf of the United States for false claims and share in a portion of the government’s recovery. The relator, Robert Jackson Tyler, Jr., will receive a share of the funds recovered by the United States pursuant to the False Claims Act.

United States Attorney Habba credited special agents of the FBI, under the direction of Acting Special Agent in Charge Terence G. Reilly in Newark, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Naomi Gruchacz, and U.S. Department of Defense, Office of Inspector General, Defense Criminal Investigative Service, Northeast Field Office, under the direction of Acting Special Agent in Charge Christopher Silvestro, with the investigation.

The government is represented in the criminal case by Assistant U.S. Attorney Katherine M. Romano of the Health Care Fraud Unit and Senior Trial Counsel Barbara Ward of the Bank Integrity, Recovery, and Money Laundering Unit in Newark.

Common Questions About TRICARE Couples Rehab Coverage Is TRICARE couples rehab free?","A Complete Guide to TRICARE Treatment Options and What to Expect

When couples face the challenges of addiction or mental health issues, seeking treatment together can be an important step toward healing.

Fortunately, TRICARE, the healthcare program for military members, veterans, and their families, provides access to rehabilitation services for couples, making it easier for eligible individuals to get the help they need.

In this Couples Rehab Guide resource, we’ll break down everything you need to know about TRICARE couples rehab coverage, including the types of addiction and mental health treatment covered, how to verify coverage, and what patients can expect from the process.

What is TRICARE?

TRICARE is a health insurance program available to U.S. military service members, veterans, and their families. It offers comprehensive care services, including mental health and substance use disorder treatment, through a network of military and civilian providers.

While it provides a wide range of services, including outpatient and inpatient care, it’s important to understand how couples rehab is specifically covered under this plan.

Does TRICARE Cover Couples Rehab?

Yes, TRICARE does cover rehab services, including treatment for couples struggling with addiction or mental health disorders. The type of care available under TRICARE can vary based on the specific needs of the individuals seeking help, their eligibility, and the specific TRICARE plan they are enrolled in.

The extent of coverage may depend on the specific needs and plan of the individuals seeking help.

Types of Treatment Covered by TRICARE

TRICARE offers several treatment options that may be beneficial for couples in need of rehab. These services can be broadly categorized into inpatient treatment, outpatient treatment, and other specialized services.

TRICARE also covers other drug rehab services in addition to inpatient and outpatient rehab, which are crucial for couples dealing with substance use disorders.

Inpatient Rehabilitation

Inpatient rehab, also known as residential treatment, involves patients staying at a treatment facility for an extended period, where they receive intensive therapy and support. TRICARE typically covers inpatient rehab, but certain guidelines must be met to qualify for this coverage.

For couples struggling with addiction or co-occurring mental health issues, this type of rehab can offer a structured environment where both partners can focus on recovery together. TRICARE typically covers inpatient rehab, but the length of stay and specific services provided will depend on the individual’s treatment needs and plan.

Outpatient Rehabilitation

Outpatient rehab allows patients to continue living at home while attending scheduled therapy sessions at a clinic or treatment center. Couples in outpatient rehab participate in group or individual therapy, but they are not required to stay overnight.

Outpatient services are often used as a step-down approach after inpatient treatment or as a standalone option for those with less severe addiction or mental health issues. TRICARE generally covers outpatient rehab, and the services provided may include counseling, group therapy, and medication management.

Detoxification

For couples who are struggling with substance use disorders, detoxification can be the first step toward recovery.

Detox programs for couples help individuals safely manage withdrawal symptoms as they cleanse their bodies of addictive substances. TRICARE typically covers medically supervised detoxification when it is deemed necessary for the individual’s recovery.

Mental Health Services

Many couples dealing with addiction also struggle with mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, or trauma. TRICARE covers a wide range of mental health services, including therapy and counseling for couples. TRICARE covers therapy for couples when at least one partner has a diagnosed mental health condition, such as PTSD or depression.

These services may include individual counseling, couples therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and trauma-focused therapy, among others. It’s important to work with your treatment provider to ensure that mental health services are included in your rehab program.

How to Verify TRICARE Rehab Coverage

To ensure that your rehab services are covered under TRICARE, there are a few key steps you should take.

Contact Your TRICARE Provider

The first step in verifying your TRICARE coverage is to contact your TRICARE provider directly. Each TRICARE plan may have different coverage rules, so it’s crucial to obtain accurate information from your provider about the specifics of your plan. Your provider will be able to tell you which substance abuse treatment services are covered, how long coverage lasts, and what if any, out-of-pocket costs you may be responsible for.

Review Your Plan’s Benefits

TRICARE offers multiple plans, including TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, and TRICARE for Life. Each TRICARE insurance plan may have different coverage options, so it’s important to review the benefits associated with the plan you’re enrolled in. For example, TRICARE Prime requires referrals for specialty care, including rehab services, while TRICARE Select allows beneficiaries to seek care without a referral. Knowing the details of your plan will help you understand the level of coverage available for couples rehab.

Check with the Treatment Facility

Once you’ve confirmed your plan’s coverage, the next step is to check with the rehab facility you’re considering. Many treatment centers work directly with TRICARE and can verify your coverage ahead of time. They can also provide a breakdown of costs and help you understand what services are included in your treatment plan. Choosing a facility within the TRICARE drug rehab network can help minimize out-of-pocket costs.

Pre-Authorization

Some TRICARE plans may require pre-authorization for certain rehab services, particularly inpatient care. This means you’ll need approval from TRICARE before starting treatment to ensure that it will be covered. Be sure to ask the treatment facility about this process to avoid any delays or surprises when it comes time to begin your rehab program.

Finding the Right Rehab Facility

Finding the right rehab facility can be a daunting task, but Couples Rehab Guide can help make the process easier. We will assist you in researching different facilities and their treatment options to determine which one best meets your needs.

This can involve reaching out to the admissions team, reviewing documentation, and seeking recommendations from healthcare providers. TRICARE couples rehabs, for instance, may offer a structured environment and a variety of services, including group counseling and CBT, to help couples work through their issues and develop healthier communication patterns.

Additionally, considering factors such as location, cost, and insurance coverage can help narrow down the options. In Tennessee, for example, there are several rehab facilities that accept TRICARE insurance and offer a range of treatment programs. By taking the time to carefully evaluate different facilities and their offerings, individuals can find the right fit for their recovery needs.

What to Expect During TRICARE Couples Rehab

When you and your partner enter a couples rehab program under TRICARE, you can expect a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to both your needs. Here’s a general idea of what to expect during the rehab process:

Initial Assessment

At the beginning of your rehab journey, both partners will undergo an initial assessment to evaluate your needs. This may include a physical and mental health evaluation, as well as a review of your substance use history. Based on this assessment, your treatment team will create an individualized plan that addresses both of your unique challenges.

Joint Therapy Sessions

One of the core components of couples rehab is couples counseling, where both partners work together with a therapist to address relationship dynamics and personal issues related to addiction or mental health. Couples therapy can help strengthen communication, rebuild trust, and create a supportive environment for recovery.

Individual Therapy Sessions

In addition to joint therapy, you and your partner will likely also participate in individual therapy sessions. These sessions allow each person to work on their own personal issues, whether related to drug and alcohol addiction, trauma, or mental health. This individualized approach ensures that both partners receive the care and attention they need to heal.

Group Therapy and Support

Many rehab programs incorporate group therapy, where patients meet with others facing similar challenges. Group therapy can help couples connect with others in recovery and share experiences in a supportive environment. It also provides an opportunity to learn from others and gain new perspectives on the recovery process. Additionally, group therapy sessions focus on improving communication skills among couples.

Aftercare Planning

After completing a rehab program, it’s important to have a solid aftercare plan in place to maintain your progress. TRICARE covers certain aftercare services, such as outpatient therapy, support groups, and relapse prevention programs. Your treatment center will help you and your partner develop a plan to stay on track after rehab and maintain long-term sobriety or mental wellness. Having a flexible schedule for aftercare services can help maintain long-term sobriety or mental wellness.

Planning Your Next Steps

Planning your next steps after deciding to seek rehab can be a challenging but crucial part of the recovery process. It’s essential to have a clear understanding of what to expect and how to prepare for the journey ahead. This can involve communicating effectively with your healthcare provider, gathering necessary documentation, and making arrangements for your care during the treatment period.

TRICARE insurance plans can provide coverage for many forms of rehab, including residential treatment and medical detox, but it’s necessary to review your specific plan to determine what is covered and what is not. By understanding your options and taking the necessary steps to prepare, you can set yourself up for success and create a solid foundation for your recovery.

Furthermore, having a support system in place, such as a spouse or child, can be incredibly beneficial in helping you stay sober and motivated throughout the recovery process. With the right mindset and support, individuals can overcome addiction and mental health issues and achieve a happier, healthier

Common Questions About TRICARE Couples Rehab Coverage

Is TRICARE couples rehab free?

While TRICARE covers rehab services, there may still be out-of-pocket costs depending on your plan. These can include co-pays, deductibles, and costs for non-covered services. Be sure to check with both your TRICARE provider and the rehab facility for a clear understanding of potential costs.

Can TRICARE cover the cost of both partners in a couple’s rehab program?

TRICARE may cover both partners’ rehab services, but coverage can depend on the specifics of your plan. It’s important to verify with your provider whether both individuals in the couple are covered for rehab treatment under your TRICARE plan. Additionally, TRICARE covers marriage counseling, which can be an integral part of couples rehab.

What if I don’t qualify for TRICARE coverage?

If you or your partner don’t qualify for TRICARE or if your plan doesn’t fully cover rehab services, there are other options to explore. Many rehab centers offer payment plans or sliding-scale fees based on your income. You can also explore other insurance options or state-sponsored programs that provide coverage for addiction treatment and mental health services.",https://couplesrehabguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TRICARE-Couples-Rehab-Coverage.webp,N,1.0,2025-04-21 19:56:28.510783

The purpose of the survey by The Joint Commission is to evaluate the compliance of NHB and outlying branch clinics with nationally established Joint Commission, Defense Health Agency and Navy Medicine standards of care specific to the needs of patients, including infection prevention and control, leadership, and medication management.

The inspection is conducted approximately every three years at Defense Health Agency and U.S. Navy military treatment facilities with the survey results used to determine whether, and conditions under which, accreditation should be awarded to the command.

By becoming an accredited organization, NHB enhances community confidence, provides a report card for the public, offers an objective evaluation of the organization’s performance, stimulates the organization’s quality improvement efforts, aids in professional staff recruitment, and provides a staff education tool.

An independent, not-for-profit organization, The Joint Commission accredits and certifies more than 20,000 health care organizations and programs in the United States. Joint Commission accreditation and certification is recognized nationwide as a symbol of quality that reflects an organization's commitment to meeting certain performance standards.

By asking for accreditation, NHB agrees to be measured against national standards set by health care professionals. An accredited organization substantially complies with Joint Commission standards and continuously makes efforts to improve the care and service provided.

TJC standards deal with organizational quality of care issues and the safety of the environment in which care is provided. TJC survey team usually consists of specially trained physicians, nurses, administrators and a facilities expert. The surveyors will evaluate NHB’s compliance with established standards and identify strengths and weaknesses.

The overall goal is not merely to find problems, but also to provide education and consultation so health care organizations can improve.

First-Place Awards, Top Spot in Prestigious Categories

MHS civilians earned first place in eight categories, with Douglas Stutz at Naval Hospital Bremerton taking first for best information story about U.S. Navy Lt. Jane W. Njenga ensuring forces are medically ready when facing tropical diseases.

“We’ve had the honor to cover less-than-ideal subjects which still needed to be shared, including suicide and remembering loss on Memorial Day. Njenga’s commitment in the Military Tropical Medical Program offered us the opportunity to share how investing the time and effort can help save lives in future conflicts,” said Stutz.

When asked what drove him to enter the competition, Stutz said, “We submitted content to help highlight and hopefully increase focus on our valued Navy Medicine team of Navy Medical Corps, Medical Service Corps, Nurse Corps, Dental Corps, and especially our enlisted Hospital Corps and our support staff. Every one of them is a subject matter expert. They may not openly realize it, but we believe that each of our staff has a tremendous amount of value and insight to tap into, helping to share who, what, where, when, and why we do our work.”

Additional winners included Bernard Little from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center who won the prestigious Civilian Writer of the Year award, while Jorge Gomez from Irwin Army Community Hospital was named Civilian Videographer of the Year.

“I’m honored to have been recognized as the Civilian Writer of the Year among a very talented group of writers,” said Little. “I want people to know that the staff and care at Walter Reed is second to none. I want people to read the stories that I write and consider coming to Walter Reed for their care if they don’t. For those who do, I want them to feel pleased they are receiving their care here and continue to receive their care here, feeling secure and confident that they are receiving the best care anywhere.”

Brandon Henry from the Uniformed Services University won two top prizes—first place in both animation and multimedia product categories. Thomas Balfour, also from USU, won first place for his featured photo.

The university is no stranger to these achievements. “We’re very proud of the incredible talent we have here at USU,” said Sharon Holland, acting vice president for external affairs and director of alumni affairs. “Our writers, graphic designers, photographers, and multimedia staff have consistently been recognized for their work, either at the local level, the MHS level, the Department of Defense level, and sometimes all three. We’re thrilled to be part of a community that values excellence in telling the military health story.”

In similar categories, Thomas Cieslak from Naval Health Clinic Cherry Point won first in photojournalism, and Justin Moeller from Blanchfield Army Community Hospital took first in the picture story category.

Not only did MHS lead the competition with the most first-place wins, MHS secured the most second and third place finishes of any agency.

Honoring Creativity and Impact While Advancing Mission Readiness

The awards recognize communications professionals for more than just the quality of their products. They are honored for their role in advancing warfighter readiness and telling the military health story in creative, meaningful ways, said Richard H. Breen Jr., director of communications and public affairs for the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs and the Military Health System. “The work of the MHS is beyond health care–it’s about ensuring that every service member is fit to fight, that our medical teams are trained and ready, and that our families receive the care they deserve. The awards capture the essence of this mission in one article, frame, photo, or video.”

“Winning or placing in any category at the DMMA is a testament to the MHS team’s creativity, precision, and ability to translate complex health topics into messages that resonate across the force,” said Derik W. Crotts, communication strategist with the MHS. “Their work directly supports warfighter readiness by ensuring the right information reaches the right people at the right time.”

Karen Roberts, director of the Defense Health Agency Director’s Communications and Public Affairs Division, agrees. “These communicators represent DHA’s deep well of talent and the commitment shared by all of our communication professionals who work hard to highlight the high-quality health care our military hospitals and clinics deliver to millions of service members, retirees, and their families,” she said.",https://militarymedical.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/8819337.jpg,N,1.0,2025-04-21 15:57:06.122796

The New York Times: Trump Aides Solicit Ideas To Raise Birthrate, From Baby Bonuses To Fertility Planning

The White House has been hearing out a chorus of ideas in recent weeks for persuading Americans to get married and have more children, an early sign that the Trump administration will embrace a new cultural agenda pushed by many of its allies on the right to reverse declining birthrates and push conservative family values. One proposal shared with aides would reserve 30 percent of scholarships for the Fulbright program, the prestigious, government-backed international fellowship, for applicants who are married or have children. Another would give a $5,000 cash “baby bonus” to every American mother after delivery. (Kitchener, 4/21)

The Washington Post: CDC Cuts Hamstring Programs That Monitor Fertility And Maternal Health

Federal programs that help people compare IVF clinics, monitor safety in fertility and make sense of health data have been scaled back by the Trump administration in a move some maternal health experts predict will have an enduring effect on women and children. Layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Services this month have dismantled teams at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention responsible for collecting and analyzing data on a range of subjects, including embryo transfers and maternal health disparities.

Faced with a crushing out-of-pocket cost, she left. (Chan, 4/18)

Public, private and charter schools in Iowa would be required to show fetal development videos to students starting in fifth grade under a bill passed Thursday by Republicans in the Iowa House. Human growth and development classes and health classes in grades 5-12 would have to teach about “human development inside the womb.” That would include an ultrasound video showing vital organs in early fetal development.

TRICARE is the health program for members of the U.S. military, veterans, and their families.
In Puerto Rico, it is administered through the TRICARE Overseas Program.
Of particular interest is TRICARE Prime, a managed care option within the TRICARE health care program, primarily available in specific Prime Service Areas (PSAs).
It’s worth noting that when the Philippines gained independence from the United States, veterans who had fought in the U.S. military lost their veterans’ benefits.","Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner Pablo José Hernández has re-introduced the TRICARE Equality Act. The legislative proposal, also introduced by Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon in 2021 and then again in 2023, seeks to improve health benefits available to veterans living in Puerto Rico. Cosponsors of the 2025 bill include House Veterans Affairs Health Subcommittee lead Democrat Rep. Julia Brownley (CA), as well as Reps. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), and Hank Johnson (D-GA).

“Our veterans and military families in Puerto Rico have sacrificed just as much as their counterparts on the mainland, and they deserve equal access to the healthcare benefits they’ve earned,” said Hernández.

“The TRICARE Equality Act will help close the unacceptable gaps in care faced by our servicemembers, retirees, and their families on the island. By improving TRICARE Prime access, expanding travel benefits, and ensuring better coordination of health data, this bill takes a critical step toward treating Puerto Rico’s military community with the dignity and fairness they deserve.”

What is TRICARE?

TRICARE is the health program for members of the U.S. military, veterans, and their families. In Puerto Rico, it is administered through the TRICARE Overseas Program. Unfortunately, the benefits for residents of Puerto Rico do not match those in the states. Veterans on the Island often must pay for services upfront and wait for reimbursement, or even travel to a state for medical services.

Of particular interest is TRICARE Prime, a managed care option within the TRICARE health care program, primarily available in specific Prime Service Areas (PSAs). Prime members are assigned a Primary Care Manager (PCM) who coordinates most of their healthcare. Out of pocket costs are lower with Prime, and travel benefits cover the cost of travel to military healthcare facilities. The TRICARE Overseas Program is similar, but not equal to the Prime benefits.

What does the TRICARE Equality Act provide?

The TRICARE Equality Act calls for PSAs to be established in Puerto Rico as they are in the states — on the basis of the proximity of military medical care facilities such as those at Ft. Buchanan. It also calls for service members, veterans, and their families to have travel benefits as they would if they lived in a state.

The bill also mandates coordination between the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization Office and the Department of Health of Puerto Rico to share health information through the Joint Health Information Exchange.

Why is there inequity?

The Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that Congress can treat territories differently from states, and the differences in veterans’ benefits are examples of this freedom. Although Puerto Rican veterans can access the full range of U.S. Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits if they are living stateside, VA benefits for veterans living in the U.S. territory are less generous.

It’s worth noting that when the Philippines gained independence from the United States, veterans who had fought in the U.S. military lost their veterans’ benefits. Similarly, veterans of the U.S. military living in the U.S. freely associated states (FAS) of Palau, the Marshall Islands and Federated States of Micronesia were legally excluded from receiving VA healthcare in the FAS until last year; although veterans’ healthcare is now authorized within their borders, the programs have yet to be implemented.

These facts are in contrast to the optimistic ideas of separatists who claim that veterans would continue to receive their health benefits if Puerto Rico were to become a sovereign nation, or the small but vocal group of independence supporters living stateside who do not need to worry about the practical implications for U.S. veterans in Puerto Rico if the U.S.-Puerto Rico connection is severed.",https://i0.wp.com/puertoricoreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-742.png?fit=1920%2C1280&ssl=1,N,0.0,2025-04-21 11:56:33.824470

If you have a contraindication like an interaction with another medicine- then the doctor can discuss is in the form and it shouldn’t be an issue.

Side note- I used to be on antidepressants and anti anxiety’s a long time ago, but stopped taking them after I had kids (no good reason not to restart other than I was being stubborn). I’ve struggled for years off my meds, and Zep has made me feel new again. True happiness I haven’t felt in a long time. I’m not as irritable. Not as sad. More good days ❤️ Good luck with your journey!

Also- just in case…. I technically had contraindications to Qsymia/phentermine and was super adamant about not trying it. I went to an obesity specialist, who was not very kind and literally wanted to hear nothing about my contraindications concerns, and adamantly prescribed me Phentermine. I took ONE dose- had the most horrible reactions (racing heart, dizziness, irritability, etc etc) from ONE dose I told them not taking it again. I went back to my other doctor and told them my reactions. That counted as me trying and failing it for the sake of the form and my Zep PA was approved no problem after that. Not that you should have to endure a possible horrible reaction to get approved… but it’s how mine was approved.

I have TriCare as well and was able to get a PA without trying phentermine or the others. I had just worked with med management to get my adhd and anxiety under control for about a year and am on a stimulant, so i expressed my desires to my PCM that I didn’t want to get off of it because I was finally starting to feel good (you can’t take phentermine while on other stimulants). I also have a history of seizures, so I can’t take the other 2. So, a fairly unique circumstance, but ultimately they approved me for it without having to take the oral meds. Best of luck!",,N,0.0,2025-04-20 21:56:17.707257
