One of the most popular choices is TRICARE Prime, which operates similarly to an HMO.
For active duty service members (ADSMs), enrollment in TRICARE Prime is mandatory; however, it’s optional for active duty family members (ADFMs) living in designated Prime Service Areas (PSAs).
For those residing overseas or who have command-sponsored family members abroad, options like the TRICARE Overseas Program come into play.
Whether you're looking at comprehensive coverage through TRICARE Prime or enjoying greater freedom with TRICARE Select, knowing what’s available can empower you and enhance your family's well-being.","In the East region, navigating TRICARE can feel like a daunting task. With various plans available, understanding your options is crucial for ensuring you and your family receive the best possible care. TRICARE serves as a lifeline for uniformed service members and their families, providing access to essential health services across different states.

One of the most popular choices is TRICARE Prime, which operates similarly to an HMO. This plan emphasizes using military hospitals and clinics while significantly reducing out-of-pocket costs when seeking care from authorized civilian providers within the network. For active duty service members (ADSMs), enrollment in TRICARE Prime is mandatory; however, it’s optional for active duty family members (ADFMs) living in designated Prime Service Areas (PSAs). If you're stationed far from these areas or prefer more flexibility, consider TRICARE Select—a self-managed option that allows beneficiaries to choose their own healthcare providers without needing referrals.

Interestingly, if you’re eligible but not enrolled in either of these plans due to unique circumstances or location constraints, there are still viable alternatives such as TRICARE Reserve Select or even TRICARE Young Adult plans tailored specifically for certain demographics.

For those residing overseas or who have command-sponsored family members abroad, options like the TRICARE Overseas Program come into play. These programs ensure that regardless of where life takes you—whether it's a bustling city on U.S. soil or an overseas assignment—you have access to quality healthcare services tailored to your needs.

The key takeaway? Understanding eligibility requirements based on your specific situation will help streamline this process immensely. Whether you're looking at comprehensive coverage through TRICARE Prime or enjoying greater freedom with TRICARE Select, knowing what’s available can empower you and enhance your family's well-being.",https://www.oreateai.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a6p7qra6p7qra6p7.png,N,1.0,2026-01-19 06:56:24.776862

That's if you want to be able to present more to her as to how it would be beneficial for him to have Tricare as well (honestly not sure why you wouldn't, but that's just my personal thoughts)

Also to add, I'm almost positive that now that you're under prime (I'm new to prime, i've always had select) you have to go through the referral process to continue using your same providers, because prime typically has to be seen by their on post provider.

The child can have 2 insurances. Not sure of the circumstances of them having Medicaid or if theyd be able to maintain that. Thats something the bio mom & your husband need to navigate. But the providers as well as a Triicare need to be informed of dual insurance. Medicaid would be filed 1st & Tricare would pick up second to them. Also, if Tricare finds out there's a different primary insurance & claims aren't filed accordingly, yall could be on the hook, financially. So, get it taken care of sooner than later.

Medicaid is one of the few situations where Tricare is first payer. https://tricare.mil/Plans/OHI

Your stepson’s doctors will need to know he has Tricare. Does he live near a military installation? If so, will his mom be willing to switch his doctors if needed and take him on base?

Consider the Political Climate: Some Redditors advise avoiding federal jobs under certain administrations due to instability and emotional toll. ""Do not work for this administration. The emotional tax is crushing""

Persistence Pays Off: Even during hiring freezes, some jobs are still available. ""My FJO somehow has not been rescinded, I scour USAJobs daily in case something pops up and can apply as a plan B.""

Mastering the Application Process

A well-crafted application and strong interview skills are crucial for securing a federal job.

Good Resume and Interview Skills: Ensure your resume is well-formatted and you can excel in interviews. ""What works best is: 1. Good formatted resume 2. Good interview skills 3. Apply Apply Apply""

Seek Ladder Positions: These jobs allow you to progress through different GS levels without reapplying. ""I’m a GS 7 with a ladder to a GS 9""

Gain Experience and Certifications: Continuous learning and skill development are key. ""I got here with solely a combo of experience and IT certifications.""

Networking: Building connections can open doors to new opportunities. ""Best of all get to know people, network and always be positive when dealing with others""

Degrees and Experience

You can get a federal job with or without a degree, depending on your approach.

Degrees Open Doors: Pursuing a degree can make it easier to enter federal service. ""If you want to open doors in federal positions, you need to pursue a degree.""

Experience Can Substitute: Many federal jobs value experience over education. ""Most federal jobs do not require a degree.""

Start Low and Climb: It's possible to start in a lower-grade position and work your way up. ""Started at GS6 0343 and five years later I am a non supervisory GS13""

You can have the court house wedding right now and then have the fancy wedding later if you both truly love each other and want to get married, that way you both will have the coverage.

Eat the costs which will be 6 figures.

Abortion.

You made an adult choice to have unprotected sex, time to have the corresponding adult discussion. Do whatever right means to you but make those choices sooner than later, legitimately in the next two weeks.

FTR they don’t give a fuck about a ring. Just that piece of paper. If gf wants a “real” wedding, just file the official paperwork and be married on paper then have a wedding later. Or look into your state’s Medicaid. They often cover unwed pregnant women.

You done messed up a-a-ron.

Seriously though go ahead and get married at the courthouse. Yall will lose the cost of a wedding to medical bills otherwise. Put that in savings to have the full deal when yall are ready.

Yeah you’re right Tricare won’t cover her until y’all are married. But will cover from the date you get her registered in DEERS as your dependent and she gets her ID card. As for baby, once born, you’ll have 90 days to register baby with DEERS and Tricare and they’ll be covered under you.

You can explain that the courthouse wedding will be done now and then yall can have a big ceremony/reception later. Very common in the service.

Go to the courthouse, do the paperwork and get legally married.

Have a wedding later if that's what she wants.

Having passed the Senate, SB 2018, SB 2016, and SB 2019 now head to the House of Representatives for further consideration.","In a pivotal move for both military service members and the state’s tourism sector, the Mississippi Senate passed two groundbreaking pieces of legislation in the third week of January 2026. These bills, SB 2018 and SB 2016, mark an aggressive start to the 2026 legislative session, with far-reaching implications for Mississippi’s National Guard and tourism industry, while also setting a course for broader economic revitalization. The state has set a bold precedent by focusing on both military readiness and economic infrastructure, signaling a significant policy shift.

What are SB 2018 and SB 2016?

SB 2018, titled the Mississippi National Guard TRICARE Premium Reimbursement Program, is designed to make healthcare effectively free for traditional Guardsmen by reimbursing their monthly insurance premiums. This bill, authored by Senator Jeff Tate of Meridian, aims to provide active-duty Mississippi National Guard members with reimbursement for their TRICARE Reserve Select health care plans. This initiative is aimed not only at expressing gratitude for the service of Guardsmen but also at bolstering recruitment and retention within the state’s military ranks.

SB 2016, the Mississippi Tourism Reorganization Act, creates a new standalone Mississippi Department of Tourism, separating it from the Mississippi Development Authority (MDA). This restructuring is intended to enhance the tourism sector’s efficiency, responsiveness, and competitiveness, reflecting the fourth-largest industry in the state. With a focus on streamlined operations, the legislation aims to increase tourism-related revenue, strengthen marketing efforts, and attract new visitors to Mississippi. Furthermore, the bill ensures the creation of a dedicated Tourism Advertising Fund sourced from sales tax revenues from restaurants and hotels.

Both pieces of legislation reflect Mississippi’s ongoing efforts to address its economic needs while supporting its military personnel.

When and Why Did These Bills Pass?

The Mississippi Senate passed SB 2018 and SB 2016 during the third week of January 2026, signaling the state’s proactive approach as it moves into the new legislative year. These two bills represent an urgent response to long-standing issues of military healthcare accessibility and tourism sector inefficiency. By addressing the military healthcare issue, the state aims to ensure that Guardsmen are medically ready, which is vital for the security of both Mississippi and the nation.

Simultaneously, the reorganization of Mississippi’s tourism efforts is a move to capitalize on the growing potential of the state’s tourism industry. Advocates believe that creating a dedicated department will eliminate bureaucratic layers that have historically hindered the sector’s growth. The state’s tourism industry, fueled by a $18.1 billion impact in 2024, stands to benefit significantly from this legislative overhaul.

Who Will Be Affected by These Bills?

The passing of SB 2018 will directly benefit members of the Mississippi National Guard. The bill targets “traditional” Guardsmen, who work in the private sector without employer-sponsored health benefits, ensuring they have access to free healthcare coverage under TRICARE Reserve Select. As long as Guardsmen meet eligibility criteria such as being an actively drilling member and not being covered by another employer’s insurance, they will receive full reimbursement for their monthly insurance premiums.

Meanwhile, the creation of the Mississippi Department of Tourism under SB 2016 will affect tourism stakeholders across the state, from hoteliers to restaurant owners, as well as workers in the hospitality industry. The restructuring will ensure a more targeted, efficient, and dynamic approach to marketing the state’s attractions, bolstering Mississippi’s status as a tourist destination. The bill also introduces a new Tourism Advertising Fund, directly benefiting local businesses by channeling a portion of the revenue from restaurant and hotel sales taxes into the fund.

What Are the Expected Economic Impacts of These Bills?

The passage of SB 2018 and SB 2016 is expected to have a profound impact on Mississippi’s economy, particularly in tourism and military readiness. The state’s tourism industry, already a substantial contributor to the economy, is expected to benefit from increased agility and focused branding as a result of SB 2016. This bill aims to push tourism revenue beyond its current $18.1 billion threshold and expand the state’s reach to new markets through more effective marketing strategies.

SB 2018, on the other hand, is expected to improve military readiness by ensuring that Mississippi’s National Guard members are medically prepared to respond to emergencies and deploy when needed. With approximately 12,000 Guardsmen currently in service, the state anticipates that this initiative will boost retention rates and ensure that these individuals are able to meet physical and medical standards, a key component of maintaining an effective military force.

Additionally, both bills are projected to support more than 130,000 jobs in the tourism sector, with a special focus on stabilizing the hospitality industry. This includes maintaining jobs linked to hotels, restaurants, and tourism services, all of which have been critical drivers of the state’s economic growth.

How Will These Bills Be Implemented?

The implementation of SB 2018 will begin with the establishment of the Mississippi National Guard TRICARE Premium Reimbursement Program, which will be managed by the Adjutant General of the Mississippi National Guard. The program’s effectiveness will be evaluated in a report due to the legislature by December 1, 2026. This ensures that the program is meeting its goals of improving healthcare accessibility for Guardsmen and supporting retention.

For SB 2016, the new Mississippi Department of Tourism will officially take charge of the state’s tourism efforts by July 1, 2026. The separation from the Mississippi Development Authority (MDA) is intended to streamline processes, allowing for quicker decision-making and more focused marketing. As part of the reorganization, a new Tourism Marketing Advisory Board will be formed, composed of representatives from Mississippi’s five tourism regions: the Hills, Delta, Capital/River, Pines, and Coastal regions. This structure will allow for a more regionally tailored approach to tourism marketing.

In addition to these structural changes, SB 2019 ensures the continued investment in the state’s infrastructure, particularly through the allocation of $80 million in annual lottery proceeds to the State Highway Fund for bridge repairs and pavement projects.

What’s Next for These Bills?

Having passed the Senate, SB 2018, SB 2016, and SB 2019 now head to the House of Representatives for further consideration. Should these bills pass the House, they will be signed into law by the Governor, setting into motion a transformative period for Mississippi’s National Guard and tourism industry. With their focus on healthcare, economic growth, and infrastructure, these legislative changes have the potential to reshape the state’s future, making it more competitive in both the tourism market and national defense efforts.

Conclusion: A New Era for Mississippi’s Economy and National Guard

The passing of SB 2018 and SB 2016 represents a decisive step toward ensuring long-term security and prosperity for Mississippi. The National Guard’s healthcare coverage program addresses a critical need, while the tourism department reorganization is poised to give the state’s fourth-largest industry the tools to thrive. With the continued development of infrastructure through SB 2019, Mississippi is positioning itself for sustained economic growth and a more robust defense posture. As these bills move through the legislative process, their full impact will become clearer, but the early signs are promising for the future of Mississippi’s economy and military readiness.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/mississippi.jpg,N,0.0,2026-01-17 15:56:20.433753

Air Force Medical Command leadership hosted a consolidated standup ceremony for its medical readiness commands, MRC-Alpha and MRC-Bravo, Jan. 15, 2025, during the Air Force Medical Service’s 2025 Senior Leadership Workshop in Leesburg, Virginia.

An order from the Secretary of the Air Force activated and assigned the readiness commands to AFMEDCOM, effective Sept. 14, 2024. Leaders delayed the ceremony until key organizational milestones were accomplished. With nearly 500 senior medical leaders gathered to discuss the future of operational medical support, AFMEDCOM leaders selected SLW for the ceremony.

Lt. Gen. John J. DeGoes, U.S. Air Force and Space Force Surgeon General and Commander, Air Force Medical Command, formally published the orders to stand up MRC-Alpha, based in San Antonio, Texas, and MRC-Bravo, based in Falls Church, Virginia.

While addressing the audience, he recognized the commanders who have led the organizations since they were formed: Maj. Gen. (Dr.) Thomas Harrell who is MRC-A’s commander and is Defense Health Network-Central’s director; and, Maj. Gen. Jeannine Ryder who is MRC-B’s commander and DHN-Continental’s director.

DeGoes thanked Ryder and Harrell for their efforts and said, “their innovative leadership and tireless work over the past two years led to this day, building our medical readiness commands and wings from the ground up. I look forward to continuing to strengthen AFMEDCOM as they both lead these medical readiness commands, meeting all missions, anytime, anywhere.”

The official standup of both MRCs signifies another step toward solidifying the command-and-control functions for more than 25,000 medical forces who represent the Department of Air Force’s operational medicine capability as the organization continues to partner with the Defense Health Agency for health care delivery.

“Our benchmark is mission capable Airmen and Guardians, deployable medics, and sustained access to trusted care for our families,” DeGoes said.

Harrell and Ryder execute authorities under the U.S. Air Force and Defense Health Agency that strengthen unity of effort. As the MRC/CCs, they oversee medical readiness requirements and deliver operational medicine, and as DHN directors they ensure safe, accessible, high-quality health care for beneficiaries.

Within the intermediate command under AFMEDCOM, the MRC/CCs prioritize readiness.

“This structure will ensure that Air Force operational requirements are clearly articulated, advocated and integrated within the joint healthcare enterprise,” DeGoes said. “MRCs empower faster decisions and flatter communications, each with an accountable leader to call and with the authority to address any readiness or health care concern.”

Air Force medical leaders began the first series of inter-command transfers to align medical Airmen under the new AFMEDCOM structure in March 2025. The process features a deliberate, conditions-based approach projected to continue over a two-year period to ensure minimal disruption for medical Airmen.

During the first tranche, the 316th Medical Group at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, and the 316th Medical Squadron at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, Virginia, transferred from Air Force District of Washington to the 79th Medical Wing under MRC-B. This ICT was completed Sept. 9, 2025.

MRC-A has initiated two ICTs realigning medical units from the Air Education and Training Command to MRC-A. The first, which began Sept. 5, 2025, realigned medical Airmen in the 59th MDW under the intermediate management command. The second, which started, Dec. 2, 2025, initiated the transfer of multiple medical groups from AETC to the MRC-A’s 359th Medical Wing.

The commanders thanked their MRC staff, network teams, and families after the unfurling of the command flags, and reinforced to the medical forces present to be proactive in engaging with them and their wing commanders through the cultural shift AFMEDCOM brings.

Harrell emphasized for leaders to connect with their Airmen and to set the tone in their organizations. “It all happens because of you and the environment you set as leaders,” he said. “Our success fully rests on the individual initiative and success of our Airmen you lead.”

After initiating inter-command transfers, the commanders said they remain resolute in driving mission success and sustaining forward momentum into 2026.

“The activation of the MRCs is a renewal of our promise to provide the best medical support to our warfighters and the best care to our families,” Ryder said. “As your commander, I am invested in you. AFMEDCOM’s success is dependent on you, leading through challenges, making tough decisions and holding the line of accountability.”",,N,0.0,2026-01-16 22:56:52.886805

In a significant move for the state’s service members, the Senate passed Senate Bill 2018, establishing the Mississippi National Guard Tricare Premium Reimbursement Program. The legislation is designed to provide effectively free health insurance coverage for eligible members of the Mississippi National Guard by reimbursing premium costs.

Supporters of the bill noted that the program serves as both a recruitment tool and a “thank you” to the thousands of Mississippians serving in the Guard.

The chamber also looked to modernize the state’s economic engine by passing Senate Bill 2016. This bill would transition tourism oversight into a stand-alone Mississippi Department of Tourism. The new department would be led by an executive director and supported by an independent staff and a newly created Mississippi Tourism Marketing Advisory Board.

On the infrastructure front, the Senate moved to ensure the continued stability of the state’s roads. Senate Bill 2019 was passed to maintain the current funding structure for the State Highway Fund, directing the first $80 million in annual lottery proceeds toward transportation projects.

The legislative pace is expected to quicken as the Senate met a key deadline on Wednesday, Jan. 14, for requesting the drafting of general bills and constitutional amendments. Lawmakers now face a Monday, Jan. 19, deadline for the formal introduction of those measures.

Amid the policy debates, the Capitol rotunda echoed with music on Tuesday, Jan. 13. The Starkville High School Choir performed for lawmakers, continuing Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann’s tradition of showcasing student talent from across the state.

All three major bills now head to the House of Representatives for further consideration.",https://desotocountynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/state-senate.jpg,N,1.0,2026-01-16 18:56:44.996167

When a military working dog gets sick overseas, the issue can involve more than just animal health. When service members deploy to regions with different diseases, there are more than just human health hazards to consider. When food safety becomes a problem at a military dining facility, the cause could be germs originating from humans, animals, or the environment. These interconnected health challenges require an integrated solution, and that's where One Health comes in.

""I prefer to think of One Health as integrated public health, working collaboratively across multiple disciplines,"" said Dr. Kristina McElroy, Veterinary Defense Support of Civil Authorities and interagency coordinator, Veterinary Services Division, Defense Health Agency-Public Health in Falls Church, Virginia. “This transdisciplinary approach guides my daily work as a veterinarian in DHA-Public Health.”

This collaborative approach is protecting military communities worldwide by recognizing that human health, animal health, and environmental health are closely connected.

What is One Health?

One Health is a simple but powerful idea: The health of people, animals, and the environment are linked. When one area has a problem, it can affect the others. For military communities, One Health means taking a team approach to prevent diseases, ensure food safety, and protect service members and their families.

Deployment health protection

When service members deploy, they may face unique health challenges that civilian communities rarely encounter. Service members travel frequently, encounter or work with animals, and deploy to regions with different risks of infectious disease.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, zoonotic diseases are caused by germs that spread between animals and people, and are caused by harmful germs like viruses, bacterial parasites, and fungi.

""Different vectors may be present that increase risk of certain zoonotic diseases, so we consider different parasite prevention and sometimes different daily management practices to limit exposure,"" said Lt. Col. Crystal Doyle, chief of animal medicine, Veterinary Services Division, DHA-Public Health. ""We must also be familiar with differing requirements for reportable diseases in the various countries in which we work.""

This global perspective is also essential for protecting military families. When service members deploy to different regions, they may encounter diseases that aren’t prevalent in their home stations. One Health approaches help identify these risks early and develop prevention strategies. “The benefits of One Health aren't theoretical; they're saving lives and protecting military operations every day,” said McElroy.

""During outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza, chikungunya, Zika, as well as COVID-19 — which are all zoonotic diseases — the collaborative interdisciplinary approach of One Health has protected service members' health,"" said McElroy. ""Veterinary Services has worked hand in hand with colleagues at the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Division, the military services and U.S. government agencies to ensure guidance and recommendations are coordinated and appropriate for the military population.""

Military working dogs

The One Health approach also benefits the health and welfare of military working dogs. MWDs are valuable team members who can be affected by zoonotic diseases that can also affect service members.

""There have been MWD kennels with multiple dogs affected by similar clinical signs and symptoms that pointed to a possible zoonotic disease,"" said Doyle. ""While testing was pending to determine a definitive diagnosis, operational tempo was decreased to limit human exposure to the suspected zoonotic disease.""

Military veterinarians also submit ticks from their patients for disease screening, or disease confirmation if a patient is suspected of being infected, said Doyle.

“We routinely submit blood samples from our MWD population to screen for tick-borne diseases, many of which are also found in the human population (such as Lyme disease).”

Food Safety Protection

Food safety is a key part of the One Health mission, as military dining facilities serve thousands of meals daily. ""The military uses a multidisciplinary, multiservice, and interagency approach to analyze food safety and security from a One Health perspective,"" said Lt. Col. Melissa Hehr, deputy chief, Veterinary Services Division, DHA-Public Health. ""This requires close coordination amongst agencies and military services with responsibilities for food procurement, food protection, food sanitation, preventive medicine, public health, diagnostic laboratory, policy, and regulatory functions.""

Global health security benefits

One Health approaches don't just protect individual service members; they strengthen global health security for everyone.

""Military One Health initiatives leverage unique military capabilities to contribute to the United States' global health security efforts,"" said McElroy. ""Specifically for veterinary services, the DOW (Department of War) provides training to veterinarians and public health professionals in partner nations, strengthening their capacity to prevent and respond to disease outbreaks.""

The military also helps strengthen public health infrastructure worldwide, including ""laboratories, surveillance systems, and disease reporting networks"" that benefit both military and civilian populations, said McElroy.

Monitoring emerging threats

Military veterinarians, physicians, environmental health specialists, and public health experts work together using One Health principles. This teamwork helps identify health threats early and respond more effectively than any single group could. An example of this type of collaboration can be found in how these teams are managing the threat of New World screwworm.

“There is currently ongoing collaboration between military veterinary, medical, biosurveillance, and pest management teams to monitor and prepare for a potential incursion of New World screwworm into the United States,” said Hehr. “This flesh-eating parasite is actually a perfect example of a One Health problem where an integrative approach is being used to analyze, monitor, and mitigate the threat posed to human, animal, and environmental health, as well as military operations, food and agriculture, and national security.”

Overcoming challenges

Implementing One Health approaches in military settings requires overcoming unique challenges. ""I think the greatest challenge to implementing a One Health approach lies in our ability to develop a mutual understanding of the capabilities, responsibilities, and authorities of the various organizations and entities that are required for effective One Health integration under different contexts,"" said Hehr. Military health teams work to build these relationships through various communication methods, including news articles, information papers, social media posts, email, meetings, webinars, and educational courses, said Hehr.

Working together for health

The success of One Health depends on collaboration across different specialties and organizations.

""At DHA Veterinary Services, we strive for collaborative communication and integration across the joint force and entire DOW,"" McElroy explains.

This teamwork includes partnerships among military veterinarians, human health professionals, environmental specialists, and public health experts from all service branches. The approach is proactive rather than reactive. By working across traditional boundaries, military health professionals can identify threats earlier, respond more effectively, and protect service members and their families more completely. As health threats become more complex and global, One Health approaches become more important for protecting military communities.

“Having chaperones available is a crucial part of patient-centered care,” said Dr. Paul Cordts, deputy assistant director for medical affairs and chief medical officer at the Defense Health Agency.

During those appointments, McGraw would keep the camera lens of his phone facing outward from the breast pocket of his clothing, according to court documents.","Staff at military medical facilities must now ask patients if they would like a chaperone in the room before a doctor performs a sensitive exam. Leadership made the change after an Army doctor was charged with illegally recording videos of patients during appointments.

“Having chaperones available is a crucial part of patient-centered care,” said Dr. Paul Cordts, deputy assistant director for medical affairs and chief medical officer at the Defense Health Agency. “Chaperones can help protect both patients and health care staff.”

The previous policy required medical facilities to accommodate a patient’s request for a chaperone but did not require that they be asked their preference.

DHA shared the update online Thursday following months of scrutiny about how Maj. Blaine McGraw, an OB-GYN, could be criminally charged with recording videos more than 40 patients at Fort Hood, Texas, using his cellphone.

In total, the doctor is charged with 54 counts of indecent visual recording involving 44 women, according to the Army. All but one of those women received medical care from McGraw in 2025 at Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center at Fort Hood. One woman was recorded at an off-post home.

Many women have said they did request a chaperone or their partner be present during appointments but were denied by McGraw, according to a lawsuit filed in Bell County, Texas, on behalf of 95 women who were patients of McGraw. During those appointments, McGraw would keep the camera lens of his phone facing outward from the breast pocket of his clothing, according to court documents.

There are internal military reviews to determine if the hospital was following policies and systems put in place to protect patients from abuse.

“Cases like McGraw prove that predators thrive in the shadows of ‘discretionary’ policies,” said Andrew Cobos, attorney for the women. “If the DHA is serious about stopping sexual assault in military medicine, they must stop treating patient safety as a suggestion. We need mandatory chaperones who answer to an independent board, not the doctors they are supposed to be monitoring.”

DHA defined a chaperone as an unbiased third party to any exam or clinical visit who is there to safeguard the patient and staff.

“These chaperones are members of the clinical team who are discreet and protect privacy. They’ll immediately report any suspected inappropriate conduct,” according to DHA.

Patients can request the chaperone while making the appointment or during it, and staff “will make a reasonable effort to provide a chaperone of the preferred sex.” If someone is not available, patients can reschedule the visit.

Sensitive appointments that require a provider to ask a patient’s preference include examination, treatment or procedure of the genitalia, rectum or female breasts, or forensic health care examinations. This policy may be waived in emergency situations, according to DHA.",https://www.stripes.com/incoming/jhq1k9-9010755.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/9010755.jpg,N,0.0,2026-01-16 15:56:31.104876

Is TRICARE’s Shield Coverage and Q4 Revenue Strength Altering The Investment Case For Guardant Health (GH)?

Simply Wall St

Reviewed by Sasha Jovanovic

January 16, 2026

In January 2026, Guardant Health reported unaudited revenue of approximately US$280 million for Q4 and US$981 million for 2025, reflecting strong year-on-year growth across its oncology and Shield colorectal cancer screening tests.

At the same time, TRICARE’s decision to cover Guardant’s FDA-approved Shield blood test for colorectal cancer screening with no copay for eligible active-duty service members and families significantly broadens access to this non-invasive screening option within the U.S. military population.

Next, we’ll examine how TRICARE’s Shield coverage and Guardant’s recent revenue strength may influence the company’s investment narrative and risk profile.

Guardant Health Investment Narrative Recap

To own Guardant Health, you need to believe that blood-based cancer diagnostics will keep gaining traction across both oncology care and population screening, and that the company can eventually translate strong test volumes into sustainable profitability. The latest unaudited 2025 revenue of about US$981 million, together with robust Q4 growth, supports the demand side of that thesis, while persistent cash burn and ongoing losses remain the most important near term risk. TRICARE’s Shield coverage appears supportive but not thesis changing on its own.

The TRICARE decision to cover Shield for eligible active-duty service members and families matters because it adds another large, institutional payer to Shield’s coverage footprint, alongside Medicare and the VA Community Care Network. For investors focused on Shield as a key growth driver, this announcement fits within the broader catalyst of expanding reimbursement and clinical adoption for blood-based colorectal cancer screening, and it provides another real world datapoint that major health systems are willing to fund this type of testing.

But despite this progress, investors should also be aware that ongoing high R&D and Shield spend could still...
