This modernization builds upon the hospital’s existing imaging resources, augmenting operational efficiency and expanding the diagnostic capabilities available to service members and their families.

“This upgrade considerably enhances our capacity to provide exceptional care,” remarked Capt. Rodney Scott, the Endodontist within the Directorate for Dental Services at USNH Rota.

“By advancing our imaging technologies in Rota, we ensure that our warfighters and their families receive the same high standard of accurate diagnostics and treatment planning found at leading facilities in the United States, thereby directly bolstering mission readiness and communal health abroad.”

The CBCT system is designed to generate intricate 3D images while simultaneously minimizing radiation exposure compared to traditional CT scans.

These advancements are pivotal for the early detection and more precise management of intricate dental, craniofacial, and maxillofacial conditions, consequently enhancing both warfighter readiness and family health.

This initiative aligns with the Defense Health Agency’s and Navy Medicine’s commitment to maintaining a medically prepared force through technological advancement, innovation, and collaboration.

The upgrade was a joint venture among Dental Services, Biomedical Engineering, and Facilities Management, in close cooperation with local vendors. Their collective effort exemplifies the Navy’s dedication to sustaining advanced medical capabilities for forces deployed abroad.

Strategically located on the Iberian Peninsula, USNH Rota plays an integral role in ensuring the health of approximately 8,400 service members and their families through reliable and mission-ready healthcare.

BWAY recently announced an expansion of insurance coverage for its Deep TMS therapy in adolescent depression. The update signals growing payer confidence in non-drug neurostimulation treatments and improves reimbursement visibility for a younger patient population.

The development follows Optum Behavioral Health expanding its medical policy to include eligible adolescents, adding a meaningful number of covered lives. For investors, the decision reinforces Deep TMS’ growing clinical acceptance and supports BrainsWay’s longer-term commercial opportunity.

Likely Trend of BWAY Stock Following the News

Following the announcement, BWAY shares gained 10.1% at yesterday’s market closing. Shares of the company have climbed 53.6% in the six-month period compared with the industry’s 5.5% growth and the S&P 500's 15.1% gain.

Over the long run, the coverage expansion strengthens BrainsWay by widening its reimbursable patient base at an earlier stage of the treatment journey, improving utilization and lifetime value per system. Broader insurer alignment reduces reimbursement friction, supports more predictable revenue growth and encourages clinics to invest in Deep TMS capacity, positioning the company to build durable demand and deepen its competitive moat in non-invasive depression treatment.

BWAY currently has a market capitalization of $334.8 million. The company projects an earnings growth of 100% for the current year.

More on the News

Deep TMS is a noninvasive brain stimulation therapy developed by BrainsWay that uses patented H-coil technology to stimulate deeper and broader regions of the brain associated with mood regulation. FDA-cleared for depression, including as an adjunctive treatment for adolescents, Deep TMS delivers magnetic pulses without surgery or systemic drug exposure, offering a well-tolerated option for patients who do not respond adequately to antidepressant medications.

BrainsWay announced that Optum Behavioral Health, part of UnitedHealth Group, has expanded its medical policy to cover Deep TMS™ therapy for adolescents aged 15 and older diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Optum’s network represents more than 48 million covered lives, making this one of the most meaningful single-policy expansions for BrainsWay to date. The decision reflects growing payer confidence in Deep TMS as a clinically proven, non-drug treatment option, particularly for younger patients who do not respond to or cannot tolerate traditional antidepressant medications.

Optum now joins a broad and expanding list of insurers covering Deep TMS for adolescent depression, including Evernorth Health Services, CVS/Aetna, Medi-Cal, PacificSource Health Plans, TRICARE, and several Blue Cross and Blue Shield organizations such as Health Care Service Corporation, Highmark, Regence, Florida Blue, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina.

Collectively, these payers cover roughly 180 million lives. The expansion is especially notable given the estimated 5 million adolescents aged 15-21 in the United States affected by major depression, a population with limited effective treatment options.

Favorable Industry Prospects for BWAY

Per a report by Grand View Research, the global neuromodulation devices market size was estimated at $5.80 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $10.39 billion by 2030, registering a CAGR of 8.51% from 2025 to 2030.

The increasing incidence of chronic pain, neurological disorders and mental health conditions is expected to drive the demand for effective and innovative treatment solutions.

BrainsWay Advances Beyond Depression With New AUD Trial

In November, BWAY announced the launch of a multicenter clinical trial evaluating its next-generation Deep TMS 360 system for the treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), a condition marked by high relapse rates despite existing therapies. The study represents the first multicenter trial using BrainsWay’s new multichannel TMS platform, underscoring a key milestone in expanding its clinical footprint and advancing its innovation pipeline beyond depression.

The recently signed 2026 defense spending bill authorizes over $900 million in spending on defense and military policies. The revised cyber budget and workforce provisions demonstrate the new priorities for the present administration.

The 2026 NDAA Includes a Cyber Budget Bump

The 2026 NDAA outlines a cyber budget of about $15.5 billion, which represents a 4 percent increase in cyber spending. Cybersecurity is the main recipient of those funds, with $9.1 billion going towards core operations and an additional $612 million earmarked for research to fortify digital defense tools in the future. The NDAA also broadens the Pentagon’s authority to dictate longterm cybersecurity strategies and advocates for more consistency in the acquisition process to standardize the process for contractors.

Many lawmakers are in favor of increasing the cyber budget, but others are less optimistic that more spending will automatically lead to stronger defenses. Much of that skepticism stems from previous lack of tangible metrics to measure the performance of network defenses. Without that clarity, it can be hard to evaluate the effectiveness of any cybersecurity program.

Hiring Practices for Civilian Workforce Have Also Been Revised

Another focus of the 2026 NDAA is several reforms to the hiring processes for civilian personnel. The bill allows the Defense Department to promote employees without having to meet minimum time-in-grade requirements for eligibility. Candidates are now measured on their skills and readiness for the role.

Significant cuts to the workforce are more complex under the new NDAA. The bill prohibits the DoD from reducing the workforce or reassigning functions if the changes involve 50 or more employees and take place outside of normal programming practices. Congress must be notified before any planned reductions occur. The NDAA also expands the number of positions the DoD can hire using special cyber authorities and increases the maximum pay for cyber roles by up to 150%.

Military Healthcare is Ex[anded in Some Ways, Restricted in Others

$234 billion of the NDAA’s budget is committed to military personnel and healthcare. Enlisted service members will receive a 3.8% pay raise as a result of the bill. In regards to health care, the NDAA extends the halt to medical billet cuts to 10 years amid several other benefits.

As noted by the Military Officers Association of America, the bill states that a Pentagon plan is required to prioritize an assignment of active duty medical and dental personnel at military treatment facilities (MTFs). The NDAA also drops the distance required for active duty service-members to access the TRICARE Prime Travel Benefit to access specialty care from 100 miles to 75. It also directs action plans to increase utilization and enrolled veteran access at MTFs with excess capacity or space.

The most controversial element of the NDAA is the removal of a provision mandating health care coverage for in vitro fertilization (IVF) for all active-duty service members. If signed, fertility services would only be covered through TRICARE if infertility was caused by a “serious or severe illness or injury while on active duty”.

The NDAA Removes Important Worker Protections

Another key aspect of the 2026 NDAA is drawing criticism for its lack of worker protections. The bill removed a provision that would have restored collective bargaining rights for hundreds of thousands of defense civilian personnel (removed by executive order) – and was seen as a potential precedent-setting step for broader restoration of union rights.

“Congress should not be in the business of weakening national security by weakening the workforce that makes national security possible,” wrote AFGE National President Everett Kelley. “DoD civilians are patriots. They serve this country with skill, honor, and sacrifice. Denying them collective bargaining rights is wrong, it is harmful to the mission, and it has no place in a defense bill.”

Galeotti of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division.
“Fraud schemes that siphon resources from TRICARE directly undermine the care promised to service members and their families.
Cox and his co-conspirators owned, controlled and operated DMERx, an internet-based platform that generated false and fraudulent doctors’ orders for these items.
In June 2025, Cox was convicted of conspiracy to commit health care fraud and wire fraud, three counts of health care fraud, conspiracy to pay and receive health care kickbacks and conspiracy to defraud the United States and make false statements in connection with health care matters.
Trial Attorneys Darren C. Halverson and Jennifer E. Burns of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section prosecuted the case.","An Arizona man was sentenced Friday to 15 years in prison and ordered to pay more than $452 million in restitution for conspiring to defraud Medicare and other federal health care benefit programs of more than $1 billion by operating a platform that generated false doctors’ orders used to support fraudulent claims for various medical items.

“This just sentence is the result of one of the largest telemarketing Medicare fraud cases ever tried to verdict,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Telemedicine scammers who use junk mailers, spam calls and the internet to target senior citizens steal taxpayer money and harm vulnerable populations. The Criminal Division will continue dedicating substantial resources to the fight against telemedicine and medical equipment frauds that drain our health care benefit programs.”

“Together with our partners, the FBI will aggressively pursue those who defraud taxpayer funded health care programs,” said Acting Assistant Director Rebecca Day of the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division. “Programs like Medicare are intended to help the most vulnerable among us, and fraud schemes like the one orchestrated by the defendant can jeopardize the delivery of critical care to those who need it the most.”

“This sentence sends a clear message: those who exploit telemedicine to prey on seniors and steal from taxpayer-funded health care programs will be held accountable,” said Deputy Inspector General for Investigations Christian J. Schrank of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG). “This scheme was a massive betrayal of trust, built on deception and greed. Our investigators, working with law enforcement partners, dismantled this billion-dollar fraud operation that targeted vulnerable patients and undermined the integrity of Medicare. We will not relent in our mission to protect the public and safeguard Medicare and other federal health care programs from fraud, waste, and abuse.”

“This investigation underscores the Defense Criminal Investigative Service’s (DCIS) commitment to protecting the integrity of the TRICARE program and ensuring that taxpayer-funded military health benefits are not exploited for personal gain,” said Special Agent in Charge Jason Sargenski of DCIS’s Southeast Field Office. “Fraud schemes that siphon resources from TRICARE directly undermine the care promised to service members and their families. As the criminal investigative arm of DoD’s Office of Inspector General, DCIS remains focused on disrupting these schemes and holding responsible parties accountable.”

According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, Gary Cox, 79, of Maricopa County, was the CEO of Power Mobility Doctor Rx, LLC (DMERx). Cox and his co-conspirators targeted hundreds of thousands of Medicare beneficiaries who provided their personally identifiable information and agreed to accept medically unnecessary orthotic braces, pain creams and other items through misleading mailers, television advertisements and calls from offshore call centers. Cox and his co-conspirators owned, controlled and operated DMERx, an internet-based platform that generated false and fraudulent doctors’ orders for these items. As part of the scheme, Cox connected pharmacies, durable medical equipment (DME) suppliers and marketers with telemedicine companies that would accept illegal kickbacks and bribes in exchange for signed doctors’ orders transmitted using the DMERx platform. Cox and his co-conspirators received payments for coordinating these illegal kickback transactions and referring the completed doctors’ orders to the DME suppliers, pharmacies and telemarketers that paid kickbacks and bribes for the orders.

The fraudulent doctors’ orders generated by DMERx falsely represented that a doctor had examined and treated the Medicare beneficiaries when, in fact, purported telemedicine companies paid doctors to sign the orders without regard to medical necessity, based only on a brief telephone call with the beneficiary or no interaction with the beneficiary at all. The DME suppliers and pharmacies that paid illegal kickbacks in exchange for these doctors’ orders billed Medicare and other insurers more than $1 billion, and Medicare and the insurers paid more than $360 million based on these claims. According to evidence presented at trial, Cox and his co-conspirators concealed the scheme through sham contracts and by eliminating from doctors’ orders what one co-conspirator described as “dangerous words” that might cause Medicare to audit the scheme’s DME suppliers.

In June 2025, Cox was convicted of conspiracy to commit health care fraud and wire fraud, three counts of health care fraud, conspiracy to pay and receive health care kickbacks and conspiracy to defraud the United States and make false statements in connection with health care matters.

The FBI, HHS-OIG, VA-OIG and DCIS investigated the case.

December 23, 2025 by Hadiyah Brendel

The annual Federal Service Dental Educators’ Workshop (FSDEW) serves as a critical nexus within the Military Health System, ensuring alignment and excellence across Tri-Service Graduate Dental Education (GDE) programs. Hosted each year by the Uniformed Services University’s (USU) Postgraduate Dental College (PDC) on the USU campus in Bethesda, Maryland, the workshop brings together senior dental educators to shape the future of military dental training.

The FSDEW is a highly coordinated event supported by a 12-month planning cycle that rotates annually among the Army, Navy, and Air Force. The 2026 collaboration is led in partnership with the U.S. Army.

Retired Air Force Col. (Dr.) Jay Graver, PDC associate dean for Faculty Affairs, emphasizes the importance of sustained coordination and early engagement among partners. “We begin planning the next workshop while the current one is still underway,” Graver said. “That continuity is essential to ensuring we remain responsive to emerging educational needs and advances in dental medicine.”

The workshop facilitates engagement across a broad network of federal partners, including the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which operates its own graduate dental education programs. VA participation in the upcoming workshop marks a renewed opportunity for federal collaboration and shared learning across agencies.

“FSDEW allows us to methodically review needs, requirements, and new and emerging technologies,” Graver explained. “From artificial intelligence and innovations in teaching and learning, to new or improved treatment techniques, this forum ensures our educators are aligned and forward-looking.”

Service Dental Educators Workshop. The event is hosted annually, and planning for the 2026

event is resuming after the government shutdown halted planning for this vital Tri-Service

educational alignment. (Photo credit Tom Balfour USU)

Breaking Silos and Strengthening the Tri-Service Mission

In-person engagement is central to the workshop’s success. FSDEW convenes program directors from 55 graduate dental education programs, including 19 Master of Science programs, 26 one-year programs across the Services, and 10 Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery programs.

Historically, collaboration across Services was limited. Today, FSDEW actively dismantles those silos through intentional programming, including service-specific and specialty-specific breakout sessions. These forums enable participants to share best practices, discuss inspection outcomes, and identify opportunities to improve efficiency, effectiveness, and resource stewardship across the GDE enterprise.

Service-specific sessions also provide a direct feedback loop to attending representatives from the Defense Health Agency (DHA), ensuring that challenges and opportunities identified by educators inform enterprise-level decision-making.

By fostering these connections, FSDEW ensures that dental educators—and the residents they train—are not only academically current but also operationally prepared. The workshop’s inclusion of operational dentistry training reinforces the unique role military dentists play in deployed and battlefield environments, distinguishing military dental practice from civilian care.

While attendees are well aware of the workshop’s stated mission—to review graduate dental education processes and facilitate an exchange of ideas across Services—Graver underscored the broader objective:

“The best trained educators provide the best trained residents, who provide the best care to our Department of War beneficiaries.”

In dual-vet divorces, there are often two retired pay streams.
VA Disability Compensation and Federal Preemption VA disability compensation adds another layer of instability.
To receive VA disability pay, a retiree generally must waive a corresponding portion of military retired pay.
Survivor Benefit Plan Deadlines that Quietly Erase Rights The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) is one of the most commonly mishandled aspects of military divorce.","Dual-veteran divorce is uniquely complicated because military retired pay, VA disability compensation, survivor benefits, and military health coverage are governed by separate federal systems that do not align with state divorce law or with one another. A state court can issue a divorce decree that appears equitable on paper and still produce outcomes that DFAS or the Department of Veterans Affairs cannot legally implement. When both spouses are veterans, these risks compound, creating a fragmented process with no single agency responsible for coordinating outcomes.

Military Retired Pay and the Limits of State Court Authority

Military retired pay is divisible in divorce only because Congress permits it under the Uniformed Services Former Spouses’ Protection Act, codified at 10 U.S.C. § 1408. The statute allows state courts to treat “disposable retired pay” as marital property, but only as federally defined. DFAS enforces these limits strictly and will not honor orders that exceed statutory authority or fail to meet technical requirements, regardless of a judge’s intent. DFAS guidance makes clear that it pays only what federal law authorizes and only when the former spouse submits a compliant order and application.

In dual-vet divorces, there are often two retired pay streams. This results in two DFAS enforcement processes and two chances for error. DFAS also caps direct payments to former spouses at 50% of a servicemember’s disposable retired pay under the Uniformed Services Former Spouses’ Protection Act. This cap applies regardless of what a state court orders and regardless of how many obligations the court attempts to satisfy through retirement pay. As a result, when courts try to use retirement pay to cover multiple property awards or financial obligations, DFAS will still enforce only up to the statutory limit, leaving the remainder unenforceable through DFAS and shifting collection back to the parties themselves.

VA Disability Compensation and Federal Preemption

VA disability compensation adds another layer of instability. To receive VA disability pay, a retiree generally must waive a corresponding portion of military retired pay. That waiver reduces the amount of divisible retired pay available to a former spouse. The Supreme Court held in Mansell v. Mansell that states may not divide the portion of retired pay waived to receive VA disability compensation.

In Howell v. Howell, the Supreme Court held that state courts may not remedy that reduction by ordering the veteran to reimburse or indemnify the former spouse for the lost amount. Even if the divorce assumed a stable pension or the disability rating occurs years later, federal law preempts state courts from restoring the former spouse’s share through offset or repayment orders.

Concurrent Receipt and Special Compensation

Some retirees qualify for Concurrent Retirement and Disability Pay, which allows receipt of both retired pay and VA disability compensation under 10 U.S.C. § 1414. Others receive Combat-Related Special Compensation under 10 U.S.C. § 1413a. These programs affect how money is characterized and paid, which matters because DFAS treats retired pay and special compensation differently for division and enforcement. Dual-vet couples face this classification problem twice, increasing the risk that income streams assumed to be divisible turn out not to be.

Survivor Benefit Plan Deadlines that Quietly Erase Rights

The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) is one of the most commonly mishandled aspects of military divorce. If a divorce decree requires former-spouse SBP coverage, the former spouse must submit a deemed election request to DFAS within one year of the court order. Missing that deadline can permanently eliminate SBP coverage, even if the decree clearly awarded it. Guidance emphasizes that SBP elections are deadline-driven and unforgiving.

Dual-vet divorces often involve two SBP decisions, doubling the administrative risk. A party can “win” SBP in court and still lose it entirely through a missed filing.

TRICARE Eligibility After Divorce

Health care assumptions frequently break down after dual-vet divorces. TRICARE eligibility for former spouses depends on statutory criteria such as the 20/20/20 and 20/20/15 rules, which turn on years of marriage overlapping creditable service. Eligibility does not automatically continue simply because both spouses served. TRICARE guidance and Title 10make clear that eligibility is status-based and time-dependent.

Spousal Support and VA Apportionment Confusion

VA disability compensation cannot be divided as marital property, but VA regulations allow limited apportionment to spouses or dependents in certain circumstances. These rules are administrative, not judicial, and VA evaluates them independently of state divorce orders. In dual-vet divorces, parties often misunderstand whether apportionment applies after divorce or assume it functions like pension division, which it does not.

Why There Is No Unified Support System

The difficulty is structural. DFAS processes division and direct payment of military retired pay only through the USFSPA framework and its application requirements, not simply because a divorce decree says so. VA disability compensation is governed under Title 38 as an administrative benefits program, separate from DFAS retired pay rules. TRICARE eligibility after divorce follows its own criteria and requires separate administrative steps through DEERS/DMDC. As a result, there is no single standardized “divorce process” across DoD and VA; dual-vet divorces require multiple agency-specific actions, each with its own deadlines and constraints.

Making the Minefield Survivable

Dual-vet divorce becomes manageable only when benefits are treated as a federal compliance problem, not just a family-law dispute. Decrees must track USFSPA requirements precisely, anticipate disability-related changes that federal law will not allow courts to fix later, and treat SBP and TRICARE deadlines as operational mandates. Federal law sets the boundaries, and ignoring those boundaries is what produces the most damaging surprises.

Skineez brings a truly differentiated solution to federal healthcare—one that addresses both compression therapy and skin integrity, which are critical for Veteran and military patient populations.”

— Chris Lovell, CEO of Lovell Government Services.

PENSACOLA, FL, UNITED STATES, December 22, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Lovell® Government Services and Skineez Skin-Reparative, a leading provider of medical-grade, skin-reparative compression garments, announced today a strategic partnership to expand access to Skineez® products across federal healthcare systems, including the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the Military Health System (MHS), and the Indian Health Service (IHS).

Under the partnership, Lovell Government Services will serve as Skineez Skin-Reparative’s Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) vendor, supporting federal customers through established government contracting channels.

Skineez® develops FDA-cleared, medical-grade compression garments that uniquely deliver continuous skin hydration and protection while providing targeted, consistent compression—a combination not available in traditional compression products. Each garment is infused with Skineez’s proprietary skin-reparative formulation and engineered to maintain uniform compression while helping protect the skin barrier, reduce dryness, and minimize irritation during extended wear.

Designed and manufactured in the USA by a Woman-Owned company, Skineez® products are clinically validated to reduce edema, support lymphatic flow, protect compromised skin, and improve patient adherence compared to traditional compression stockings and bandaging. The patented seamless construction eliminates pressure points and friction, reducing the risk of skin breakdown while improving comfort and ease of application.

Skineez® compression garments are used across post-surgical recovery, lymphedema management, wound care, and chronic condition support, demonstrating increased wear time, improved comfort, and enhanced clinical outcomes. The same hydration-infused, performance-driven design also benefits athletes, active individuals, and professionals who spend long hours on their feet by supporting circulation, reducing fatigue, accelerating recovery, and protecting skin during daily wear.

Skineez® is also the inventor of the first and only medical-grade reversible compression sock, featuring two wearable color options in a single pair without compromising clinical performance. This patented design delivers extended usability and greater value while maintaining consistent therapeutic compression—improving adherence, reducing the need for multiple garments, and increasing cost efficiency for both clinical and everyday use.

As Skineez Skin-Reparative’s SDVOSB vendor, Lovell Government Services will work to make Skineez® products available to federal healthcare providers through streamlined acquisition pathways.

“Skineez brings a truly differentiated solution to federal healthcare—one that addresses both compression therapy and skin integrity, which are critical for Veteran and military patient populations,” said Chris Lovell, Major, USMC (Ret.), CEO of Lovell Government Services. “We are proud to partner with Skineez to help expand access to innovative, evidence-based products that improve comfort, adherence, and clinical outcomes for those who have served our nation.”

“Veterans deserve the very best in care,” said Michelle Moran, CEO & Founder of Skineez. “Our goal is to improve healthcare outcomes by delivering innovative, evidence-based compression solutions that support both healing and skin health. We are honored to partner with Lovell Government Services to advance patient comfort and quality of care across the VA and DoD.”

Take steps to safeguard your growing family Marriage is a major life milestone—and it’s also a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event.","Getting married is an exciting milestone in your life! It’s also a time when many changes come along, including changes to your health coverage. Whether you’re a service member, a retiree, or marrying someone who is, it’s important to understand how marriage can affect your TRICARE eligibility and coverage.

“There is sometimes a misconception that TRICARE benefits will update automatically after you get married, but that’s not the case,” said Shane Pham, an analyst with TRICARE Policy and Programs at the Defense Health Agency. “If you don’t add your spouse to the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System, they won’t be able to use TRICARE. A small step makes a big difference.”

Marriage is a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event, meaning that you have 90 days from the date of marriage to make any changes to your TRICARE health plan. Spouses of service members are eligible for coverage, including active duty spouses, retiree spouses, and National Guard and Reserve spouses.

Stepchildren are also eligible for TRICARE if the parent of the child and the sponsor are married. The sponsor doesn’t need to adopt the stepchildren. But if the sponsor does adopt stepchildren, they may be eligible to keep their TRICARE coverage even if their parent divorces the sponsor.

Update DEERS After getting married, one of the most important steps is to update your information in DEERS in person. DEERS is a database that TRICARE uses to determine eligibility. You must update DEERS within 90 days of your marriage to make changes to your TRICARE plan.

Although there are many changes you can make online in DEERS, you must add your spouse in person. You can visit any Uniformed Services ID card office to add your spouse and any stepchildren to DEERS. Make sure that you bring your: ● Marriage certificate ● Spouse's birth certificate ● Spouse's Social Security card ● Spouse's photo ID

Choosing the right health plan for your family Once you’ve added your spouse and any stepchildren to DEERS, you can enroll them in a TRICARE plan. The options available depend on your status and where you live. Options include: ● TRICARE Prime ● TRICARE Select ● US Family Health Plan ● TRICARE Prime Demo (available only in Atlanta, Georgia and Tampa, Florida areas) ● TRICARE Select Overseas ● TRICARE For Life (Note: Enrollment isn’t required for TFL. Your coverage is automatic if you have Medicare Part A and Part B and you’re eligible for TRICARE.)

For active duty families, other options may include: ● TRICARE Prime Remote ● TRICARE Prime Overseas● TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas

If you and your spouse are both active duty service members, you’ll each have your own DEERS profile. If you and your partner have children, you’ll need to choose one parent to be their sponsor in DEERS.

Dental coverage Your spouse is also eligible for dental coverage. This isn’t automatically covered in TRICARE medical plans. As described in the TRICARE Dental Program Brochure, the TRICARE Dental Program is available for family members of ADSMs and National Guard and Reserve members. In some cases, retirees and their family members may be eligible for dental insurance through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program.

Vision options Eligible beneficiaries who are enrolled in a TRICARE health plan can also enroll in a vision plan through FEDVIP. Eligible beneficiaries include: ● Active duty family members ● National Guard and Reserve members and their family members ● Retirees and their family members

When marriage may mean loss of coverage In some cases, getting married may actually mean that you’ll lose TRICARE eligibility. In the following situations, getting married causes your eligibility to end: • A surviving (widowed) spouse remarries • A former spouse remarries • An adult child using TRICARE Young Adult gets married (unless they marry a service member)

If any of these applies to you or a family member, it’s important to plan ahead. Losing TRICARE eligibility means you’ll need to explore other health coverage options to avoid a gap in care. Take steps to safeguard your growing family Marriage is a major life milestone—and it’s also a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event. Within 90 days from your date of marriage, add your spouse in DEERS and make any necessary changes to your TRICARE plan. For more information, check out Marriage.

Getting married means building a life together, including making sure your spouse has health benefits. With a few simple steps, you can make sure that your TRICARE benefits support your growing family from day one.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2512/9457134/1000w_q95.jpg,N,,2025-12-23 12:56:48.383533

“We’re not going to be like everybody else, because everybody else doesn’t necessarily meet the mark for what military families deserve.","A sergeant major in the Marine Reserve is using decades of experience in and out of uniform to improve health care for service members, retirees, veterans and their families.

As the senior enlisted leader of Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron (HMLA) 773, Sgt. Maj. Ted Painter has spent years guiding fellow Marines through the challenges of balancing military service, civilian careers and family life. One case, recently resolved after years, stands out. Painter supported a SNCO on his staff who struggled to secure specialized health care for his children with special needs after transferring to the unit.

“It took them a good six years to get stable,” Painter said. “They even went out of pocket for respite care, even though they were eligible for coverage. His wife, from an employment perspective, struggled because she had to take care of the kids who weren’t getting the care they needed.”

With 23 years of service – 10 of them on active duty – a spouse, and five children of his own, Painter understood the pressure, compounded with the demands of the Marine Corps, this family was under. The sergeant major worked behind the scenes so the SNCO could extend his assignment, ensuring he wouldn’t receive new orders while still trying to stabilize his family’s care plan.

In his civilian role, Painter is the associate vice president of market operations for CareSource Military & Veterans™ (CSMV). From that vantage point, he said he knew even more could’ve been done to assist this family, who are enrolled in the Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP), with specialized health coordination.

“That’s always been a challenge, because the Marine Corps wants to move them, but they’ve got this situation at home that a move could be catastrophic,” Painter said. “We had to work through quite a bit, but an organization like CareSource could’ve come in for a situation like that, and sort of taken over from a care coordination perspective that the family is just not going to get from traditional TRICARE.”

CSMV recently announced its partnership with the Defense Health Agency (DHA), giving eligible TRICARE beneficiaries the option to select CSMV as their health plan during TRICARE’s 2025 Open Season (Nov. 10– Dec. 9). The TRICARE Prime® Demo by CSMV aims to maintain the comprehensive coverage TRICARE beneficiaries expect, while introducing some new features.

Holly Joers, CSMV market president, said the partnership with DHA is built on a shared commitment “to serve those who serve and to deliver high-quality care that meets families where they are.” The plan features referral-free access to in-network specialists, a single point of contact to assist with connecting beneficiaries to the right providers, and medical record transfers for seamless continuity of care.

“Military families deserve choices that reflect their lives,” Joers said. “That means support that is personal, communication that is clear and care that feels connected.”

CSMV is the military-focused division of CareSource, a nonprofit managed care organization. There is no additional cost to choose the TRICARE Prime® Demo by CSMV; standard costs apply based on a beneficiary’s respective coverage group. Nearly 150,000 TRICARE beneficiaries live in the pilot areas – Tampa, Florida, and Atlanta, Georgia, where the demo is set to launch. The pilot will test how the CareSource model performs in a community with military treatment facilities (Tampa), and one without (Atlanta). After the trial, DHA has the final say on whether to expand the program in other locations.

“CareSource Military & Veterans brings a community-first approach to military health care,” Joers said. “We understand that access is more than appointments. We combine our national expertise with deep local partnerships to make it easy for families to connect to trusted providers and support.”

After nearly a decade at CareSource, Painter said he’s excited to launch a program that allows him to stay connected and focused on the needs of the community he serves. He added that having a team made up of veterans, military spouses, and others who speak the language and whose shared experiences can inform the program, is critical to its success.

“This has to be authentic,” Painter said. “We’re not going to be like everybody else, because everybody else doesn’t necessarily meet the mark for what military families deserve. We have to know what we’re talking about, what they’re saying, and we have to understand what they’re experiencing. The more and more of our team that we can have with that shared experience, the better.”",https://reservenationalguard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00957-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-22 20:56:12.585083

“Foote then sold the signed doctors’ orders to others with whom he had kickback arrangements.","A Connecticut man has been sentenced to 30 months in prison for his role in a $7.8 million health care fraud and kickback scheme.

Jesse Foote, 60, of Fairfield faced sentencing on Wednesday in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.

He previously pleaded guilty to a two-count information charging him with conspiracy to violate the Federal Anti-Kickback statute and conspiracy to commit health care fraud.

Between December 2017 and March 2021, Foote conspired with overseas telemarking call centers, durable medical equipment suppliers, telemedicine companies and doctors to submit fraudulent claims to health care benefit programs like Medicare and TRICARE, federal officials said. The fraud was described by authorities as a “a circular scheme of kickbacks and bribes.”

Authorities said Foote controlled a marketing company through which he purchased patient “leads” from overseas telemarking companies. The leads consisted of information about Medicare and other beneficiaries and pre-written doctors’ orders for DME.

Officials said the call centers targeted Medicare beneficiaries and others with health insurance to persuade them to accept DME, including orthotic braces, whether they needed them or not. Authorities allege Foote paid bribes and kickbacks to telemedicine companies, which in turn paid bribes and kickbacks to doctors to obtain doctors’ orders for DME based on the leads.

“The doctors often approved the DME orders without having any contact with the beneficiary and without making a bona fide assessment that the DME was medically necessary,” the U.S. Attorney’s Office wrote. “Foote then sold the signed doctors’ orders to others with whom he had kickback arrangements. The doctors’ orders were ultimately submitted to DME suppliers, including DME suppliers controlled by Foote, which submitted fraudulent claims for reimbursement to health care benefit programs including Medicare, TRICARE, and private insurance companies.”

A total of more than $7.8 million worth of false and fraudulent claims were submitted to health care benefit programs through the scheme, officials said.

During his sentencing, Foote was ordered to serve three years of supervised release once he is released from prison and to pay about $7.8 million in restitution.",https://www.courant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/court_gavel.jpg?w=640&h=373,N,-1.0,2025-12-21 09:56:19.272177
