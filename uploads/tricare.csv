Choosing Mental Healthcare in New Mexico with Tricare So, does Tricare cover inpatient mental healthcare in New Mexico?","AUGUST 26, 2025 – If you or a loved one is stationed in New Mexico and having issues that require mental health support, you will likely face a crucial question when seeking behavioral health treatment: Does Tricare cover inpatient mental healthcare?

The answer is yes. Tricare does provide coverage for inpatient mental health treatment, including psychiatric hospitalization and residential care.

However, the details depend on the type of Tricare plan you have, your clinical needs, and the treatment facility.

In this latest resource on behavioral and mental health topics, MilitarySpot.com reviews these details and helps you and your family members navigate care more confidently and make informed decisions about accessing treatment in New Mexico.

Tricare and Mental Health Benefits

Tricare is the healthcare program serving uniformed service members, retirees, and their families. Mental health benefits are an essential part of its coverage, reflecting the recognition that mental well-being is as critical as physical health.

Tricare’s behavioral health benefits include outpatient therapy, intensive outpatient programs, partial hospitalization, and inpatient care for psychiatric conditions and substance use disorders. For individuals in New Mexico, this means access to a continuum of care at both civilian and military-approved facilities.

Inpatient Mental Healthcare Defined

Inpatient mental healthcare refers to treatment that requires a patient to stay at a hospital or residential facility. It is typically recommended for individuals experiencing acute psychiatric symptoms, severe depression, suicidal ideation, or conditions that cannot be safely managed in an outpatient setting.

In New Mexico, inpatient care can occur in general hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, or specialized residential treatment centers that meet Tricare’s credentialing and accreditation requirements.

How Coverage Works in New Mexico

Tricare covers inpatient mental healthcare in New Mexico when it is deemed medically necessary. Medical necessity is determined by a licensed provider and involves evaluating whether symptoms are severe enough to require a structured, 24-hour treatment environment.

Prior authorization is often required before admission, especially for non-emergency cases. For emergencies, individuals can seek immediate care and notify Tricare within a specified timeframe.

Costs depend on the beneficiary’s status and plan type. Active-duty service members generally have no out-of-pocket costs, while retirees and dependents may be responsible for copayments or cost-shares.

Facilities in New Mexico that accept Tricare must be certified and licensed to deliver inpatient mental healthcare. This ensures that patients receive evidence-based treatment in safe, regulated environments.

Facilities in New Mexico That Accept Tricare

New Mexico has several hospitals and treatment centers where Tricare beneficiaries can access inpatient psychiatric care. Larger metropolitan areas, such as Albuquerque, offer more options. This includes an accredited Albuquerque facility that takes Tricare. Rural areas tend to have fewer facilities. Some patients in rural areas may also access care in neighboring states if specialized services are unavailable locally.

Court-Ordered Mental Health Treatment

In some cases, individuals may be required by a court to undergo a mental health evaluation or treatment. Tricare generally covers medically necessary inpatient mental healthcare, but court-ordered treatment adds a layer of complexity.

If the recommended care aligns with clinical necessity and takes place at a Tricare-approved facility, coverage may apply. Families navigating court-ordered treatment in New Mexico should coordinate closely with both the court system and Tricare representatives to clarify coverage specifics.

Tricare Plan Types and Their Impact

The type of Tricare plan influences how inpatient care is accessed and what costs may apply. Tricare Prime members in New Mexico often need a referral from their primary care manager before admission to an inpatient facility, unless it is an emergency.

Tricare Select members have more flexibility in choosing providers but may face higher out-of-pocket expenses if care is received at an out-of-network facility.

Tricare For Life beneficiaries, often military retirees over 65, also have coverage for inpatient psychiatric care, coordinated with Medicare benefits.

When Inpatient Care is Recommended

Inpatient care that you will find at an evidence-based treatment center in Albuquerque is usually recommended for individuals experiencing psychiatric crises such as suicidal thoughts, severe mood episodes, psychosis, or the inability to perform daily activities safely.

Providers may also recommend inpatient care following a failed trial of outpatient therapy or when intensive stabilization is required.

For families in New Mexico, knowing that Tricare covers this level of care provides reassurance that support is available when it is most urgently needed.

The Role of Residential Treatment Centers

Residential treatment centers (RTCs) differ slightly from inpatient hospitals in that they offer structured therapeutic programs in live-in settings rather than hospital-based care. Tricare covers RTCs for adolescents and, in some cases, for adults when treatment is clinically appropriate and the facility meets Tricare’s certification standards.

This can be particularly valuable for families in New Mexico seeking longer-term, holistic treatment options such as equine therapy and adventure therapy, both of which can be helpful for teens struggling with mental health conditions or co-occurring substance use disorders.

Navigating Authorization and Referrals

For inpatient care in New Mexico, families should expect to engage in the authorization process. This involves the provider submitting documentation to Tricare demonstrating the medical necessity of inpatient treatment.

In urgent or emergency cases, this process is expedited, and notification to Tricare can be made after admission. Staying proactive with documentation and communication helps reduce delays and ensures smoother access to benefits.

Transitioning from Inpatient to Outpatient Care

Coverage does not end when inpatient treatment is complete. Tricare supports a continuum of care, which often includes step-down services such as partial hospitalization or outpatient therapy. This ongoing support helps reduce the risk of relapse or readmission.

In New Mexico, many providers coordinate with both the patient and Tricare to create aftercare plans that sustain recovery and stability.

Common Questions About Coverage

Families and individuals often ask whether Tricare covers inpatient stays of any length. The answer depends on medical necessity and provider recommendations. While Tricare does not impose arbitrary limits on inpatient days, ongoing reviews ensure that treatment remains clinically justified.

Another common question is whether beneficiaries must use military hospitals. In New Mexico, where military hospitals may not always be close by, civilian facilities that accept Tricare are typically available and covered when in-network.

Why Coverage Matters in New Mexico

New Mexico’s geography presents unique challenges in accessing mental healthcare. Many rural areas have limited behavioral health resources, making Tricare coverage critical for military families who may otherwise face barriers to care.

By covering inpatient treatment at approved facilities, Tricare reduces financial strain and ensures that beneficiaries receive timely, evidence-based support, even when facing severe mental health crises.

Choosing Mental Healthcare in New Mexico with Tricare

So, does Tricare cover inpatient mental healthcare in New Mexico? Yes, it does.

Coverage applies when treatment is medically necessary, occurs at a Tricare-approved facility, and follows required authorization processes. For military members, veterans, and their families, this means access to lifesaving psychiatric care during times of crisis.

Understanding plan requirements, being proactive with referrals and authorizations, and selecting in-network facilities help maximize benefits.

We hope that our resource from Military Spot has shown how, for service members and families navigating mental health challenges in New Mexico, Tricare provides an essential safety net that ensures care is within reach when it matters most.

Thanks,

Charles

Thank you for your great question, Charles. I appreciate your writing in. If you're 65, disability rated at 90% by the federal Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and already enrolled in Tricare for Life (TFL), you're in a situation in which Medicare Part B isn't just a ""should I."" It's a ""you have to"" if you want to keep your TFL coverage. The real question is probably whether you want to keep TFL if you have VA medical care available.

Related: What Is Tricare for Life?

Here are some things to consider in your decision.

Why Does Tricare for Life Require Medicare Part B?

For military retirees and their eligible family members, Tricare for Life works hand in hand with Medicare. Once you turn 65, TFL requires you to have both Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) and Medicare Part B (medical insurance) to stay covered. This isn't a suggestion. If you drop Part B, you lose your TFL coverage.

TFL isn't just ""extra"" insurance. It's what picks up most of the costs Medicare doesn't cover, making your out-of-pocket expenses extremely low or sometimes zero for covered services. The bottom line is, if you want to keep using TFL, you have to stay enrolled in Medicare Part B.

How Medicare Part B Works with Tricare for Life

Here's how the two work together:

Medicare pays first for Medicare-covered services.

TFL pays second, covering the remaining costs that Medicare didn't pay, such as deductibles, coinsurance and copayments.

You typically owe nothing out of pocket for Medicare-approved services.

It's a powerful combo. You get access to civilian providers through Medicare and backup coverage through TFL, without all the huge medical bill worries.

About VA Health Care

You mentioned your VA disability rating is 90%, which means you have access to VA health care. VA care is great for many veterans, but it works differently from Medicare and TFL:

VA health care can only be used at VA facilities or for VA-approved care such as Community Care.

VA and Medicare don't coordinate benefits; if you see a non-VA provider, the VA generally won't pay, even if Medicare would.

While the VA often does well for annual checkups, preventive care and prescriptions, it can take longer to get an appointment, especially for urgent needs.

For acute issues such as injuries or sudden illnesses, having Medicare and TFL means you can use your civilian doctor or urgent care to get seen quickly.

If you drop Medicare Part B and lose TFL, you could rely solely on the VA, but you'd give up the flexibility of seeing civilian providers quickly.

Why It Matters Even More if You Have Dependents

If you have eligible dependents, TFL also helps cover your health-care costs in coordination with Medicare (if you’re eligible) or as your primary Tricare coverage if you're younger than 65. Dropping Part B and losing TFL would affect not only your access to civilian care but also your family's coverage options. That's an important consideration for anyone supporting a spouse or dependents who may need care outside the VA system.

The Cost Side of the Equation

The main reason people consider dropping Part B is the monthly premium. In 2025, the standard Medicare Part B premium is $185 per month, though it could be higher if your income is above a certain level.

Here's how to think about it:

It's an ongoing cost, yes, but it also gives you the ability to see virtually any provider, with TFL covering what Medicare doesn't.

Without Part B, you lose TFL entirely. If you later re-enroll in Part B, you could face late enrollment penalties and long waits before coverage starts.

Given the high cost of medical care, most retirees find the premium is worth the peace of mind and the access it provides.

When You Might Reconsider

Suppose you had other equivalent employer coverage (not VA health care, but actual civilian employer insurance) that allowed you to delay Medicare Part B without penalty. In that case, you can postpone Part B temporarily. But for most people in your situation -- retired, on TFL, with VA care -- dropping Part B would mean giving up TFL, which is probably not worth it.

Since you're on Tricare for Life, it's probably best to stay enrolled in Medicare Part B to keep your TFL coverage. Doing so ensures you have:

Access to civilian care when and where you need it.

Minimal out-of-pocket costs for covered services.

The flexibility to use VA health care when it works best for you and civilian providers when you prefer or need them.

Think of it as three layers of protection: VA health care, Medicare and TFL. Together, they create one of the most comprehensive health coverage packages available to anyone in the U.S., and those are benefits you've earned.

Yet many beneficiaries face barriers when seeking care, whether it’s waiting weeks for an appointment or struggling to secure a referral.

These challenges add stress to already demanding lives and erode confidence in the military health care benefit, a core element of the support promised to those in uniform.

MOAA has been clear: These problems demand solutions. MOAA President and CEO Lt. Gen. Brian T. Kelly, USAF (Ret), addressed some of these solutions in a letter to key legislators urging them to preserve critical health care provisions in the FY 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).

This legislative effort is part of MOAA’s ongoing Summer Advocacy in Action (AiA) campaign, which mobilizes thousands of members to engage with their lawmakers. Health care access is one of our top priorities, and your voice can make a difference.

[TAKE ACTION: Improve TRICARE Access for Servicemembers and Their Families]

Two provisions in the NDAA could significantly improve TRICARE access:

Referral Flexibility for OB-GYN Care: A pilot program would eliminate the referral requirement for TRICARE Prime beneficiaries, including servicemembers, seeking OB-GYN care. Many patients wait weeks just for a referral before they can even schedule an appointment; removing this barrier ensures faster, more direct access to critical women’s health services.

Pregnancy as a Qualifying Life Event (QLE): Another provision would allow pregnancy to serve as a QLE, permitting families to adjust their TRICARE coverage outside the annual open season. Existing rules lock some expectant parents into plans that don’t meet their needs, with change impossible until months after critical care decisions must be made.

[ISSUE PAPERS: OB-GYN Care | Pregnancy as a QLE]

These improvements matter not only to individual families, but also to mission readiness. When servicemembers can’t access timely care for themselves or their dependents, readiness suffers. Barriers to care contribute to frustration and drive talent out of the uniformed services —undermining long-term retention.

Provisions like those outlined above will address this critical issue, but because they are less visible than other NDAA offerings, they risk being stripped as the bill moves forward. When Congress returns to Washington after Labor Day, passing a budget (or a continuing resolution) before the fiscal year ends Sept. 30 will be the top priority. In this environment, there will be pressure to pare back or eliminate “nonessential” provisions in the NDAA to secure passage.

Located at the Natick Soldier Systems Center in Natick, Massachusetts, USARIEM's mission is to research and deliver solutions to enhance Warfighter health, performance and lethality in all environments.","Lethal warfighters power the force of today, but the Army will employ a far more vigorous generation in the future. To support this evolution of warfighters, the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine is developing new scientific innovations, as revealed during the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium.

The Department of Defense's premier annual scientific conference invites DoD subject-matter experts, international partners and industry-related organizations to engage in conversation and spark new efforts that will enhance the future warfighters’ ability to serve and protect in response to evolving military needs.

This year, several U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine researchers, soldiers and Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education research fellows attended the four-day international event presenting seven oral presentations and eighteen poster presentations while moderating four warfighter-centric sessions to hundreds and thousands of the four thousand attendees.

“I’m excited to be here and very grateful for the opportunity to present and be immersed amongst others of expertise,” said Capt. Katelyn Culley, Occupational Therapy Researcher at USARIEM. “MHSRS grants our team the opportunity to showcase cognitive biomedical research which offers solutions to optimize and sustain Warfighter mental performance, lethality and readiness. Our work focuses on environmental exposures, readiness state monitoring, occupational epidemiology, injury risk mitigation, return to duty strategies and biomedical performance enhancement to sustain and improve Warfighter capabilities for present and future missions.”

Culley had the opportunity to present two research posters, one on the relationship between pain catastrophizing and pain sensitivity in Army basic trainees and the other on leveraging culturally relevant events for empirically supported suicide prevention training. Similar to Culley’s work, many attendees were drawn to USARIEM presentations, including Staff Sgt. Michelle Ott’s study on the diet quality of U.S military cadets across sexes, conducted by the Military Nutrition Division at USARIEM.

Ott and the research team found that the diet quality of U.S. military cadets could be improved, and future research will be needed to look at potential mediators of lower diet quality between men and women. “This was a very popular topic during my session; it opened up new doors to speak with others in the nutrition field,” Ott said.

But to make a difference, like the research Ott and Culley conducted, “it has to be actionable data,” said USARIEM Research Psychologist Bill Tharion during Wednesday’s human system and wearable oral presentation session, which he moderated. Tharion adds that the work USARIEM does to support the warfighter needs to have a keen sense of purpose that directly helps build the future of the U.S. Armed Forces.

In a previous operational health and performance session, moderated by Research Physiologist Holly McClung and Lt. Col. Bridget Owens, McClung delivered an oral presentation on the award-winning Army Comprehensive Body Composition Study, known as the ACBC. The ACBC study led to key updates to Army policy that modernized the way warfighters are measured under the Army Body Composition Program.

“We need to understand what the force looks like and make sure every warfighter is equally unbiasedly measured. At the time, the most current database we had was from the early 2000s and the equations we were using were 20 years old, and we know that the U.S. population has changed, the Army population has changed,” McClung said during her oral presentation. “So, the time was right for USARIEM to go out and answer these questions to inform Army Senior Leaders.”

As researchers shared innovative policy-changing research that benefits the future of warfighter fitness and long-term health in one session, on the other side of the conference in another session, Col. Laura McGhee, Acting Chief of the Military Performance Division, discussed how to translate research from the lab to experimentation — a concept that is used for operational testing of proposed warfighting concepts, technologies and conditions to meet the needs of the future force.

“Not everything a lab does results in something that can participate in experimentation,” McGhee said during Tuesday’s afternoon session.

For many experienced USARIEM researchers, like research physiologists Karl Friedl, Beth Beidleman and Gabrielle Giersch, MHSRS has become an annual place to present and collaborate with fellow associates. Other USARIEM researchers presented at MHSRS for the first time including Staff Sgt. Gabrielle Martinez and Lt. Col. Pierre Fabries, Ph.D., Research Physiologist.

“When I attended MHSRS last year, I observed confident and rehearsed scientists and applied that experience and knowledge to the presentation we get to see today,” Martinez said. “I took my mentorship from my officers and the investment I’ve been putting in myself to highlight this important work that I get to present this year.”

This research, Martinez suggests, has been a year-long study that she has helped conduct and complete from the beginning to the end. “I now get to see all that data that I helped collect come alive,” she said.

Each year at the Military Health System Research Symposium, researchers, fellows and soldiers showcase their warfighter-centric work with the promise to support the new generation of the military. At MHSRS, like-minded peers are forming a better, stronger and faster group of warfighters to be more lethal and optimized in all environments—a mission USARIEM strives for everyday.

“As a warfighter and as a researcher, I am part of the extraordinary team at USARIEM that uses science to support people like me,” Ott said. “The work we do positively impacts the warfighter that has already saved countless lives and will save more in the future.”

USARIEM is a subordinate command of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command under the Army Futures Command. USARIEM is internationally recognized as the DOD's premier laboratory for Warfighter health and performance research and focuses on environmental medicine, physiology, physical and cognitive performance, and nutrition research. Located at the Natick Soldier Systems Center in Natick, Massachusetts, USARIEM's mission is to research and deliver solutions to enhance Warfighter health, performance and lethality in all environments.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2508/9278168/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-26 13:56:17.695733

To learn more about referrals, visit TRICARE Referrals and Pre-Authorizations: https://tricare.mil/GettingCare/ReferralsPreAuth.","Do you have TRICARE Prime? If so, you likely get most of your routine health care from your primary care manager. But sometimes, you may need specialty care that your PCM can’t provide. This is when your PCM will give you a referral. Having a referral can reduce your out-of-pocket expenses. Referrals can also help reduce the time you need to wait to get specialty care.

“If you have TRICARE Prime, referrals are important because they help you get the right care from the right providers,” said Jacob Sanchez, referral management subject expert, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “Knowing how they work makes it easier to access the services you need and get the most out of your TRICARE benefit.”

In this article, you’ll learn about the TRICARE Prime referral process. We’ll highlight what’s new—and easier—for you and your family members if you’re moving this year.

If you used the West Region referral approval waiver to see a specialist between Jan. 1 and June 30 and need to continue seeing that specialist, you’ll need to get a new referral for your care before Oct. 1.

Keep reading to learn more and make the most of your TRICARE benefits.

How referrals work

Your provider starts the process by sending a referral request to your regional contractor. They review the referral request and, once processed, send you a notification in your beneficiary self-service portal. Then, you can contact the provider listed on the notification letter to make your appointment.

When to get a referral

Do you need a referral? It depends on your beneficiary category, your TRICARE plan, and the type of care you need.

• Active duty service members: You need a referral for any nonemergency care your PCM doesn’t provide. This includes specialty care and urgent care. If you get care without a referral, you may have to pay out of pocket.

• All others with a TRICARE Prime plan: You don’t need a referral for preventive care, urgent care, or most outpatient mental health care. You do need a referral for specialty care and some diagnostic services, as described in the TRICARE Plans Overview Fact Sheet: https://tricare.mil/Publications/Fact-Sheets/plans. If you get this care without a referral, you’ll be using the point-of-service option. You’ll pay more out of pocket if you use this option.

Note: Do you live in the West Region? You won’t have to pay point-of-service fees for care received from a non-network provider through Sept. 30, as long as the provider is TRICARE-authorized. DHA has issued a temporary waiver for POS fees, as long as the provider is TRICARE-authorized. Starting Oct. 1, if the provider remains a non-network provider and isn’t named on your referral or authorization, POS fees will apply. This doesn’t apply if you live in the East Region or overseas.

• TRICARE For Life: You don’t need a referral for most health care services. But you may need pre-authorization for certain services.

You don’t need a referral to get emergency care. However, you should contact your PCM the next business day after you get emergency care.

Other helpful referral tips

Second opinions

Do you have concerns or questions after seeing a specialist for care? Are you unsure about a diagnosis or treatment option? You have the right to request a second opinion. With TRICARE Prime, you should request a second opinion through your PCM.

Referrals expire

Don’t forget that referrals have expiration dates. Make sure to schedule your appointment and get care before your referral expires. You can find the expiration date on your notification letter. If your referral expires and you need a new one, contact your PCM.

When you get a referral for specialty care, you can expect to get an appointment within 28 days.

(Note: Do you have an active referral issued in the West Region before Jan. 1, 2025? You can keep seeing the specialist listed on the referral through its expiration date, or Sept. 30, whichever comes first.)

New in 2025: Transferring referrals within and between regions

Are you moving to another location in the U.S.? Whether your sponsor has recently gotten permanent change of station orders, or you’re moving for personal reasons—there’s good news about moving with your TRICARE coverage.

You can now transfer your active referrals within the same region, or between the East and West Region. You don’t have to see a new PCM to get a new referral first. This means fewer disruptions to your specialty care while you’re waiting to see a new PCM.

IMPORTANT: Before you move, call your current regional contractor and request that your valid, active referrals be transferred to your new regional contractor.

If you’re moving to a different region:

Do you have any active referrals? Your referrals will still be valid in your new location. (Note: This doesn’t apply if you have an active referral you received with the current referral approval waiver in the West Region.)

Before you move, call the regional contractor in your current location to request your active, valid referrals be transferred to the regional contractor for your new location. Your regional contractor will forward valid approved referrals to the regional contractor you’re moving to, when you or your provider requests your referrals be transferred.

Here are the steps you should follow:

1. After your move, update your enrollment within 90 days. Log in to milConnect and choose Beneficiary Web Enrollment from the Benefits menu. Update your enrollment based on your new address, so that DEERS shows that you’re in your new location

2. Once you’re enrolled in your new region, create a beneficiary portal account.

• East Region beneficiary portal: https://www.humanamilitary.com/beneficiary

• West Region beneficiary portal: https://tricare.triwest.com/en/beneficiary/

3. Contact your new regional contractor. Ask them to create a new specialty referral in your new location for the active specialty referrals that were transferred. This will help you continue your specialty care without delay.

4. Your new contractor will generate new specialty referrals to a new specialty provider based on your location. (Note: Your specialty referral may be assigned to a military hospital or clinic in your new location, if the military hospital or clinic is able to provide the care.)

5. You may view your authorization letter online in your beneficiary portal.

6. Call to schedule an appointment with the new specialty provider’s office.

Contact your regional contractor with questions about referrals:

• West Region: 888-TRIWEST (874-9378)

• East Region: 800-444-5445

Important: Did you use the referral approval waiver to see a specialist in the West Region from Jan. 1 through June 30? If TriWest Healthcare Alliance never processed your referral, you’ll need to get a new referral from a PCM in the East Region.

If you’re moving within the same region:

1. After your move, update your enrollment within 90 days. Log in to milConnect (https://milconnect.dmdc.osd.mil/milconnect/) and choose Beneficiary Web Enrollment from the Benefits menu. Your update will trigger the DMDC/DEERS Support Office to notify your regional contractor about your address change. NOTE: If you need help, contact your regional contractor.

2. Call your regional contractor. Ask them to create a new specialty referral in your new location, to see a new specialist. (Note: Your specialty referral may be assigned to a military hospital or clinic in your new location, if the military hospital or clinic is able to provide the care.)

Do you or a family member get services through the Autism Care Demonstration or Extended Care Health Option? You should contact your new regional contractor to let them know. Once your new contractor identifies a new case manager, your previous case manager will work with your new one to ensure a warm handoff of services.

Military life: 40% logistics, 60% existential dread.","At this point, waiting on orders has come down to lying to friends and hoping for divine intervention.

The purgatory between “should hear soon” and “nothing yet” is where military life earns its reputation. Hurry up and wait isn’t just a cute saying on a mug at the PX. It’s literally reality for so many of us.

You probably already know the calendar is a prop. Plans are theoretical. Every decision rests on the most fragile word in the English language: maybe.

Waiting on orders can feel like you’re hanging out in limbo with bad Wi-Fi, mismatched chairs, and a clipboard that never seems to have your name on it.

The hope phase

It always starts with a rumor. A passing comment. A cryptic text that says, “Should know by Friday.” No official paperwork, no confirmation. But you open Zillow anyway because you’re a glutton for hope. You know it’s a mistake, but you just can’t help yourself.

Inevitably, by Tuesday, the vision board is in full swing. Commute times calculated. Crime maps reviewed. Every coffee shop, bookstore, and gym within a 20-mile radius is evaluated like it’s a tactical asset.

Pinterest boards multiply. Potential school districts are ranked by test scores and proximity to a Chick-fil-A. The local spouse Facebook group is joined, lurked, and mentally judged.

All the while, you try to remind yourself that orders haven’t been cut. The RFO hasn’t even gone out. You rationalize this by saying you’re doing work that future you will thank you for. (Famous last words if ever they were spoken.)

Time for a refresh spiral

Orders could drop any minute. Any. Minute. Now.

Phone checks spike to medical-emergency levels. Email gets refreshed until the app freezes. Gmail starts asking if you’re human.

Zillow becomes a recreational contact sport as you wait for orders. Houses with wraparound porches, granite countertops, and yards you’ll never mow. Listings get bookmarked, screenshotted, and filed into two categories: Dream Homes and Fine, I Could Make It Work.

The spiral deepens when the “Dream Home” goes pending before the orders even exist. It feels personal.

Enter your lie-to-friends era

You know you’re in for it when the group chat stops asking for updates. The answer has been nothing yet for so long it’s become the military spouse version of “I’m fine.”

Instead, the lies start. “We should know soon.” “Probably late spring.” “After training wraps.”

It’s not malice. It’s survival. There are only so many times you can say “nothing yet” before you start to believe it means “never.” And really, how long does it actually take HRC to decide what the next three years of your life will look like?

Passive-aggressive packing

Still no location, but you know what? Let’s just pack these three boxes anyway. Of course, you won’t go for the essentials. Instead, you pack in the waffle iron, the Christmas mugs, the decorative pillows no one uses. A roll of tape gets yanked and slapped down on the cardboard like a mic drop because you have to do something.

Inevitably, those boxes sit in the hallway for six weeks as silent monuments to the absurdity of military timelines. They collect dust and passive-aggressive glares from anyone who trips over them (which is you, every morning).

The social media mirage

On Instagram, life is calm. The pictures are seasonal. The captions are neutral.

Offline, the fridge calendar is a fever dream of possible dates and tentative moves. Every conversation is an exercise in verbal gymnastics: saying enough to sound informed, but not enough to be wrong when the inevitable pivot happens. And really, are you even asking for much besides clarity? No. No, you are not.

Time to start bargaining

Somewhere between week three and week twelve of limbo, bargaining kicks in. Deals get cut with the universe like you’re negotiating a hostage release. If the orders drop by Friday, I’ll stop trash-talking battalion runs. If they come in before the weekend, I’ll finally organize the garage.

You start convincing yourself that the delay is a blessing. More time to save. Or to purge the linen closet. Even more time to “mentally prepare.”

It’s all a lie, of course. The only thing the extra time does is give you more days to check your email like a slot machine and spiral over Zillow listings you’ll never move into.

Finally, the RFO!

It never comes when you’re ready. It drops on a random Tuesday afternoon, right after you’ve made peace with the idea of dying at your current duty station.

And of course, it’s not to the city you’ve been Zillow-stalking for six months. That would make things far too simple. Instead, you’re suddenly panic-googling a place you’ve only ever heard mentioned on the way to somewhere else. There you are, once again frantically checking neighborhoods, schools, and whether the nearest Target is going to require driving.

The group text lights up: Finally! Then: Where to? You say the name, and everyone tilts their head like they’re trying to place it. The congratulations are sincere. The geography knowledge is not.

Cue immediate amnesia

Two weeks post-move, the agony of waiting is gone. It’s replaced by new problems: lost shipments, bad neighbors, and a base gym that smells like 2009.

But the cycle always restarts. A new rumor. Or a new Zillow tab. Maybe even a new stack of boxes taped shut in an act of quiet defiance.

Military families face unique healthcare situations, especially when it comes to mental health and addiction treatment. One common concern among service members is: Does TRICARE let me enroll a new spouse quickly so rehab is covered?

The answer is yes—TRICARE provides a window to enroll a new spouse after marriage, and coverage can begin as soon as the enrollment is complete. At Trinity Behavioral Health, the guiding approach makes it even clearer: Trinity Behavioral Health will sponsor as long as one is covered. This means if one partner already has active coverage, services like Couples Rehab remain accessible without interruption while the new spouse is added to TRICARE.

This article explores TRICARE enrollment rules, timelines, and how they intersect with urgent rehab needs for married couples.

Understanding TRICARE and Marriage Enrollment Rules

TRICARE is the Department of Defense’s healthcare program for active-duty service members, retirees, and their families. When a service member gets married, their new spouse becomes eligible for TRICARE benefits.

Key Rules for Spousal Enrollment:

Enrollment must occur within 90 days of marriage to avoid delays.

Documentation such as a marriage certificate and dependent information must be submitted.

Enrollment can be completed through DEERS (Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System).

Once processed, coverage is retroactive to the date of marriage.

This ensures that new spouses do not face long gaps in care, including essential services like addiction rehab.

Rehab Coverage Under TRICARE

TRICARE recognizes mental health and substance use treatment as essential healthcare services. This includes:

Inpatient rehab programs for substance use disorders.

Outpatient counseling and aftercare.

Medical detox services.

Couples counseling and family therapy sessions.

For couples navigating addiction together, having TRICARE coverage ensures that both partners can participate in rehab programs without financial strain.

Why Quick Enrollment Matters for Rehab

Addiction and recovery are time-sensitive. Waiting for months to add a spouse could result in:

Interrupted or delayed treatment.

Higher risk of relapse.

Emotional strain on the relationship.

Increased healthcare costs if services must be paid out of pocket.

TRICARE’s 90-day enrollment window, combined with Trinity Behavioral Health’s sponsorship approach, ensures that couples can begin treatment quickly and without unnecessary delays.

Trinity Behavioral Health’s Sponsorship Policy

Trinity Behavioral Health eliminates barriers by focusing on accessibility. The guiding principle is straightforward: “Trinity Behavioral Health will sponsor as long as one is covered.”

This means that if the service member or existing spouse already has TRICARE coverage, rehab services will continue uninterrupted while the new spouse is being added. This removes the fear of losing access to care during enrollment processing.

Step-by-Step Process to Enroll a New Spouse in TRICARE

To ensure smooth coverage for couples rehab, service members should:

Register the marriage in DEERS: Provide a marriage certificate and spouse’s identification.

Update TRICARE enrollment: Choose the appropriate plan (Prime, Select, or other available options).

Confirm retroactive coverage: TRICARE generally makes coverage effective from the marriage date.

Coordinate with Trinity Behavioral Health admissions: Verify benefits and ensure immediate access to care.

Continue treatment seamlessly: Begin or continue couples rehab without interruption.

Retroactive Coverage and Rehab Access

One of TRICARE’s strongest protections is retroactive coverage. If a spouse is added within 90 days of marriage, coverage dates back to the marriage date.

This means:

If the new spouse enters rehab shortly after marriage but before enrollment is processed, services can still be covered once enrollment is finalized.

Couples can avoid paying large out-of-pocket bills for rehab.

Trinity Behavioral Health helps couples with claims processing to ensure retroactive application of benefits.

Couples Rehab as an Essential TRICARE Service

Because TRICARE classifies mental health and substance use disorder treatment as essential benefits, services at Trinity Behavioral Health fall under covered care. This includes:

Joint therapy sessions for partners.

Individual counseling and relapse prevention.

Trauma-informed therapy for military families.

Aftercare planning for sustainable sobriety.

Couples can confidently enter treatment knowing their care is backed by TRICARE’s coverage.

Benefits of Couples Rehab for Military Families

Addiction affects not only individuals but also relationships. For military families, where stress and frequent relocations are common, couples rehab offers:

Stronger communication skills.

Trust rebuilding after addiction-related conflict.

Joint relapse prevention strategies.

Family healing, including support for children.

Trinity Behavioral Health integrates these elements into its couples-focused rehab programs.

Challenges with TRICARE Enrollment

While TRICARE offers generous protections, couples may face challenges such as:

Delays in DEERS processing.

Confusion about which TRICARE plan applies.

Short-term billing issues until enrollment finalizes.

Fortunately, Trinity Behavioral Health admissions staff are experienced in working with TRICARE and can guide couples through these challenges to ensure continuity of care.

Coordinating Rehab Coverage During Enrollment

Even while enrollment is being finalized, couples can:

Start treatment immediately through Trinity Behavioral Health’s sponsorship policy.

Work with admissions teams to submit pre-authorization requests.

Prepare documentation to avoid insurance claim denials.

This proactive approach reduces stress and ensures couples focus on healing instead of administrative issues.

How Rehab Helps Address Emotional and Behavioral Issues

For couples, rehab isn’t just about overcoming substance use—it’s about rebuilding the relationship. Inpatient programs help partners:

Address anger, mistrust, and communication breakdowns.

Heal from trauma that may contribute to addiction.

Build new routines that support sobriety.

Strengthen intimacy and emotional support.

These benefits are particularly valuable for military couples facing unique stressors.

Privacy and Confidentiality in TRICARE-Covered Rehab

Trinity Behavioral Health also emphasizes strict privacy protections. All services, including those covered by TRICARE, comply with HIPAA regulations. Couples can feel secure knowing that sensitive details about their rehab journey remain confidential.

Aftercare and Long-Term Support for Military Couples

Rehab is only the first step. TRICARE also supports ongoing outpatient care, which may include:

Continued therapy sessions.

Alumni programs for peer support.

Telehealth options for couples who relocate due to service requirements.

These services ensure that couples have the tools to maintain sobriety long after inpatient treatment ends.

Emotional Reassurance Through Quick Enrollment

Knowing that TRICARE allows quick spouse enrollment provides emotional relief for couples. It means:

No long waiting periods for coverage.

Confidence that rehab will be accessible when needed.

Reduced stress during a vulnerable time.

Stronger commitment to healing as a team.

Conclusion: TRICARE Ensures Rehab Coverage for New Spouses

When military service members marry, TRICARE provides a pathway for new spouses to gain immediate healthcare coverage, including rehab benefits. Because coverage can be retroactive to the marriage date, couples do not need to delay treatment.

At Trinity Behavioral Health, the guiding assurance remains: Trinity Behavioral Health will sponsor as long as one is covered. This ensures that even while TRICARE enrollment is being finalized, couples rehab services remain accessible, seamless, and supportive.

For couples navigating both addiction and the demands of military life, TRICARE’s quick enrollment process combined with Trinity Behavioral Health’s sponsorship policy provides a foundation of stability, continuity, and healing.

We are proud and privileged to support TRICARE East beneficiaries and providers.”","CHESAPEAKE, Va. (WAVY) — Growing pains and inadequate testing are just some of the possible roots of the problems that Humana Military is having processing claims for TRICARE, the health insurance provider for military members and their families, according to Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-2nd Dist.).

Humana started a new contract with TRICARE in January. Kiggans said that has been long enough for the company to get up to speed, and said Humana could have done more testing before they went live seven months ago.

“So now they’re having to start over, and especially in registering for early electronic payment or credentialing and recertification,” Kiggans said following Monday’s roundtable discussion. “So there’s a lot of starting over that’s creating some slowdowns in the reimbursement process.”

John and Joanne Demonte own Demonte Medical Billing Solutions, with dozens of provider clients who rely on timely reimbursement from TRICARE. They said ever since Humana took over, reimbursement has been unpredictable and riddled with mistakes.

“They’re denying for out-of-network, when the providers are in-network,” John Demonte said after he and his wife attended Kiggans’ roundtable. “Their data is just incorrect in the system, whereas our data and everything that’s being sent out on the provider’s end is correct.”

Kiggans is both a veteran and a health care professional herself.

“It really is in my wheelhouse to try to fix some of these procedural things that we can do to dictate to TRICARE how to take care of our military families,” she said.

Humana had representatives at the table Monday at the Regional Board Room in Greenbrier, along with Sentara, Riverside, Chesapeake Regional and several smaller provider groups. Kiggans said those providers and the military families they serve have waited long enough for Humana to make things right.

“We need to expedite those things. It’s now almost September. It’s been many months now.”

When we asked Humana for comment, a spokesperson sent this statement:

“We appreciated the opportunity to participate in today’s roundtable hosted by Congresswoman Kiggans and to hear from the provider community. Our priority is always TRICARE East Region beneficiaries and their ability to get access to care. We have worked closely with impacted providers, and will continue to do so, to ensure they continue to care for TRICARE East Region beneficiaries. This includes taking actions to quickly contact providers in the East Region who have expressed concerns about delayed claims payments to better understand their situations and support them. We are proud and privileged to support TRICARE East beneficiaries and providers.”",https://www.wavy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/08/snapshot-2025-08-25T174324.166.jpg?w=1280,N,0.0,2025-08-25 18:56:15.781182

The counties affected are Deschutes and Jefferson.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator: https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/find-pharmacy.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates: https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/notices/weather.

FORT HOOD, Texas – August is National Immunization Awareness Month, and it’s a prime time to ensure your family is fully protected.

Whether it’s keeping up with kids’ and teens’ shots, getting your booster as an adult, or making sure you’re ready for flu season and COVID-19 updates, vaccines are a simple and powerful way to keep yourself and your loved ones healthy.

“Vaccines are one of the simplest ways we can protect ourselves and our loved ones from preventable illness,” said Kelly Pitts, pediatrics registered nurse at Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center. “Making sure children are current on their shots helps prevent outbreaks and keeps classrooms safe.”

Why Immunizations Matter

Children & Adolescents: Vaccines protect against serious diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella, whooping cough, and polio. Additional immunizations like HPV and meningococcal are vital as children grow and get exposed to new environments.

Adults: Boosters for tetanus, shingles, pneumonia, and COVID-19 are key to reducing risk, especially as new variants circulate.

Community Impact: Keeping immunizations current isn’t just about individual health—it’s about building a healthier, stronger community.

It’s important to know that it can take several weeks after vaccination for the body to build full immunity. If you’re planning to visit a newborn — who cannot receive all their vaccines right away — be sure to get your immunizations well in advance of the visit, added Pitts.

“As the seasons change, so do the risks of illness,” said Lacy Kirkes, chief nurse of family and community medicine at CRDAMC. “We encourage adults not to overlook their own vaccines, especially flu shots, which are an important safeguard against serious complications.”

Please note: Keeping your family’s details updated in DEERS is essential for smooth scheduling and services. Visit the hospital immunization site for more information at https://darnall.tricare.mil/Health-Services/Preventive-Care/Immunizations or the clinics page at https://darnall.tricare.mil/Clinics.

How to Schedule Appointments

For children and adolescents: Schedule an appointment with the Pediatric Immunization Clinic to ensure shots are completed.

For travel-related vaccines or allergy services: Contact the Allergy & Immunization Clinic to book an appointment.

For adult vaccinations: Visit Thomas Moore Clinic during routine hours or walk in for COVID-19 vaccines at the Family Medicine Residency Clinic. See the table below for clinic locations and phone numbers with walk in immunization services.

Active-duty military personnel: Use the Soldier Medical Readiness Center as coordinated through your chain of command.

“Getting vaccinated isn’t just about protecting yourself,” added Kirkes. “It’s about protecting your family, your unit, and the community as a whole.” This Immunization Awareness Month, take advantage of the convenient clinics and diverse services offered at CRDAMC to keep your family—and your community—resilient and ready for the months ahead.

All counties are affected.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator: https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/find-pharmacy

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates: https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/notices/weather

VA Healthcare is VA. You may want to look into Community Care through the VA.
The problem isn’t contained to the VA. VA access wise is somewhat faster than the civilian side if you compare point of referral to intervention (surgery).
My VA system isn’t very good in Northern NJ.
A good option if the VA care sucks where you live, you have a family to cover and you can’t afford private health insurance.","You were told incorrectly. The only time a veteran can elect either Tricare or VA health care is if they retired from the military, either medical retirement, regular retirement, or reserve/national guard retirement with age requirements met.

The veterans who are 100% P&T but do not meet those standards cannot elect Tricare.

Tricare is DOD. VA Healthcare is VA.

You may want to look into Community Care through the VA.

The problem isn’t contained to the VA.

VA access wise is somewhat faster than the civilian side if you compare point of referral to intervention (surgery).

Basically the VA answers to congress and the executive branch, but hospital systems answer to shareholders and patients/insurance companies.

It’s largely why if you have an amazing PPO that pays well a lot of groups will find a slot for you to keep you in the system, whereas if you have Medicare solo or Tricare since it’s pretty much shit reimbursement depending on how shady the system is you might go in the regular line. Obviously if you have something urgent no one is doing anything unethical.

Example, I needed to see ENT for sinus problems. My local area healthcare system has a chronic problem of having enough surgeons, not enough OR time slots and way too many patients. It’s basically each surgeon getting a half day OR slot one day a week right now at multiple hospitals and surgery centers.

The VA has a problem with not enough surgeons, but a ton of OR time slots. So you get bogged down on the referral wait, but it eases up after the visit.

I still went to the regular health system though since my rule is anything close to the brain goes to the university and the VA didn’t offer stealth.

Also, most ROBUST VAs are staffed by your local academic hospital so you’re largely getting the same specialty care so it’s really just same doctors different scrubs. So a lot of the time it just makes no sense for me to pay a copay at the university and wait in the same line when I can just go to the VA, not pay a copay but wait in the same line.

I find that VA primary care does a better job than normal people family medicine. VA primary care has longer time slots, pharmacy takes more of an active role to prevent interactions instead of relying on your doctor to interface with Costco and hoping that they notice that one medication you got from Walgreens that interacts with one of your Costco medications.

Obviously a lot of this doesn’t apply to you with Tricare, but it paints the picture pretty well enough.

My VA system isn’t very good in Northern NJ. Thankfully, I have amazing private insurance through my employer and I can be seen the same day by a specialist if need be. My primary care physician is amazing and she has helped me way more than the VA has over the years.

The only thing I go to the VA for is to replace my hearing aids. I’m retired and honestly, my family gets great care and while not cheap, it’s totally worth it.

Edit: As for Tricare… I had it after returning from deployment and while it was cheap, the process of getting care from specialists was tedious. A good option if the VA care sucks where you live, you have a family to cover and you can’t afford private health insurance.",,N,0.0,2025-08-25 12:56:08.996766

It's crucial to understand the nuances: Emergency Care: If you experience a medical emergency while overseas, TRICARE will typically cover the necessary care.
Non-Emergency Care: TRICARE typically does not cover non-emergency medical care received internationally.
Even with TRICARE, purchasing supplemental travel insurance is highly recommended, especially for international travel.
Travel insurance can help cover expenses not included under TRICARE, such as: Non-emergency medical care: Routine check-ups or treatments for pre-existing conditions.","TRICARE, the health insurance program for military members, retirees, and their families, offers comprehensive coverage within the United States. However, its coverage for international travel is a complex issue, varying significantly depending on several factors. This guide will delve into the specifics, answering common questions and clarifying the intricacies of TRICARE's international health benefits.

What Does TRICARE Cover Overseas?

TRICARE's coverage for international travel is not a simple ""yes"" or ""no."" It depends heavily on the circumstances of the travel and the specific TRICARE plan you're enrolled in. Generally, TRICARE can cover emergency care received while traveling internationally, but this isn't automatic. It's crucial to understand the nuances:

Emergency Care: If you experience a medical emergency while overseas, TRICARE will typically cover the necessary care. However, you'll likely need to pay upfront and then file for reimbursement. The process and amount of reimbursement can vary.

Non-Emergency Care: TRICARE typically does not cover non-emergency medical care received internationally. Routine check-ups, elective procedures, and pre-existing condition treatment generally aren't covered under standard TRICARE plans when outside the U.S.

Authorized Travel: For individuals on authorized military assignments or deployments overseas, TRICARE coverage is usually more extensive and aligned with the specifics of the assignment. Coverage details should be addressed in orders or through the military chain of command.

Plan Variations: The different TRICARE plans (Prime, Select, Reserve Select, etc.) have varying levels of coverage and cost-sharing responsibilities for international care, even in emergencies. Understanding your specific plan's benefits is critical.

What if I Need Urgent Care While Traveling Abroad?

If you require urgent or emergency medical care while traveling internationally, here's what you should do:

Seek immediate medical attention: Your health is the priority. Go to the nearest appropriate medical facility.

Document everything: Keep copies of all medical bills, receipts, and documentation regarding the care received. This is vital for reimbursement claims.

Contact TRICARE: Once you're stable, contact TRICARE to initiate the claims process. Be prepared to provide detailed information about the incident and the medical care.

Understand your plan: Before traveling, review your TRICARE plan's international coverage details carefully. Understanding your responsibilities and limitations is crucial.

Does TRICARE Cover Evacuation from a Foreign Country?

TRICARE's coverage for medical evacuation from a foreign country is also dependent on the circumstances. In many instances, medical evacuation is covered under certain circumstances, particularly for emergency situations where the care isn't available locally. However, this is usually subject to certain pre-approvals and requirements. Again, contacting TRICARE directly before international travel is advisable to clarify the conditions under which medical evacuation is covered.

What About Travel Insurance for TRICARE Beneficiaries?

Even with TRICARE, purchasing supplemental travel insurance is highly recommended, especially for international travel. Travel insurance can help cover expenses not included under TRICARE, such as:

Non-emergency medical care: Routine check-ups or treatments for pre-existing conditions.

Trip cancellations or interruptions: Unexpected events that force you to cut your trip short.

Lost or stolen baggage: Protection against financial losses due to lost belongings.

Comprehensive travel insurance can offer peace of mind and protect you from significant out-of-pocket costs, supplementing the coverage you receive from TRICARE.

How Can I Learn More About TRICARE International Coverage?

The best source of information is the official TRICARE website. They provide detailed information on specific plan benefits, claims procedures, and international coverage guidelines. You can also contact TRICARE customer service directly to ask specific questions about your circumstances and plan.

Remember, proactive preparation is crucial. Understanding TRICARE's international coverage before you embark on your journey will save you time, stress, and potentially significant financial burden. Don't rely on assumptions—check the official information sources and plan accordingly.",https://www.mos.vwv.co.uk/image/does-tricare-cover-international-travel.jpeg,N,0.0,2025-08-25 12:56:26.446899

Health care coverage is critical to increasing long-term readiness and strengthening efforts to recruit and retain service members.
“The National Guard is continually on the front lines both at home and abroad.
“Our Guard members need this, and our nation needs them.
The bill would provide all service members with access to health services provided by network providers with no cost-sharing burden.","Legislation introduced last week by Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., would ensure premium-free medical insurance coverage is provided for all members of the National Guard and Reserve.

If passed, the Healthcare for our Troops Act would give Guard and Reserve members access to no-fee health care through TRICARE Reserve Select.

Currently, TRS charges a fee for medical and dental coverage.

Health care coverage is critical to increasing long-term readiness and strengthening efforts to recruit and retain service members.

“The National Guard is continually on the front lines both at home and abroad. Comprehensive healthcare is not a benefit; it’s a necessity for readiness,” said retired Maj. Gen. Francis M. McGinn, the NGAUS president.

“Our Guard members need this, and our nation needs them. I thank Senator Baldwin and her staff for their dedication to the National Guard and for their work on this effort.”

In remarks made at the 147th NGAUS General Conference & Exhibition in Milwaukee, Aug. 23, Baldwin noted that about 130,000 Guardsmen and Reservists lack private health insurance.

“I believe it is morally wrong. It is bad for preparedness and readiness. And, yes, we need to change it,” Baldwin told the audience.

Baldwin was the 2025 recipient of the Harry S. Truman Award, the association’s most prestigious honor. [Video of Baldwin’s remarks can be found here. They begin at 13:25.]

Besides expanding TRS, the bill would strengthen military readiness by ensuring access to needed physicals for no-notice deployments.

The bill also would incentivize employers to hire Guard and Reservists.

The bill would provide all service members with access to health services provided by network providers with no cost-sharing burden.

It would also facilitate more affordable access to critical preventive medical services as well as mental health care.",https://www.ngaus.org/sites/default/files/styles/max_1300x1300/public/2025-08/baldwin082425final1000.jpg?itok=BenVB1py,N,0.0,2025-08-24 18:56:07.759967

In addition to providing health insurance, the legislation would provide servicemembers with the option to complete annual medical readiness requirements with their preferred civilian provider – giving commanders back valuable training days and saving over $162 million annually in contracted medical assessments.
