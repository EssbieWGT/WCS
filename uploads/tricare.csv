CPS will pay $2,615,569.32 to the United States and $134,430.68 to the State of California.
“Providers that participate in federally funded health care programs must abide by the rules and submit proper claims for care that was in fact rendered.

CPS, which is headquartered in Walnut Creek, Calif., provides behavioral medicine services for individuals and families in the State of California. Since at least 2015, CPS and its healthcare providers have submitted claims to government payors using Current Procedural Terminology codes 90833 and 90836, which are “add-on” codes to be used when psychotherapy services are performed in conjunction with an evaluation and management visit, and which require specific documentation.

The settlement announced today resolves the government’s allegations that, from Jan. 1, 2015, through Dec. 31, 2022, CPS submitted fraudulent claims using these add-on codes in instances where its healthcare providers either had not provided the services described by those codes or had failed to sufficiently document that such services had been provided. CPS will pay $2,615,569.32 to the United States and $134,430.68 to the State of California.

“Providers that participate in federally funded health care programs must abide by the rules and submit proper claims for care that was in fact rendered. To do otherwise is to drain resources from our fellow Americans who rely on Medicare and other government programs. This settlement sends a clear message that we will continue to investigate and pursue any entity that fraudulently seeks to increase profits at taxpayers’ expense,” said United States Attorney Craig H. Missakian.

“Holding health care providers accountable for submitting false claims to Federal health care programs is crucial for ensuring that taxpayer funds are appropriately used and for maintaining the American public’s trust,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey McIntosh of the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG). “Working closely with our law enforcement partners, our agency remains dedicated to protecting taxpayer-funded programs that deliver essential behavioral health services.”

“Today’s outcome concludes a collaborative effort to hold Comprehensive Psychiatric Services accountable for its improper billing practices. These actions undermined our Federal health care system, including the Department of Defense’s TRICARE program,” said John E. Helsing, Acting Special Agent in Charge for the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS), Western Field Office. “DCIS will continue to work closely with our law enforcement partners and the Department of Justice to investigate health care providers that seek to enrich themselves at the expense of the American taxpayer.”

“Veterans and their families expect and deserve the highest quality healthcare delivered in a safe and accountable setting,” said Special Agent in Charge Dimitriana Nikolov with the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General’s Northwest Field Office. “This settlement is a testament to the VA OIG’s commitment to safeguarding the integrity of VA’s healthcare programs and preserving taxpayer funds.”

“False claims increase costs and undermine the integrity of our federal health care programs, including the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program,” said Derek M. Holt, Special Agent in Charge, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Office of the Inspector General (OPM OIG). “We support the work of our law enforcement partners and colleagues to investigate fraudulent medical billing that wastes taxpayer dollars.”

Assistant U.S. Attorney Kelsey Helland handled this matter for the government, with the assistance of Garland He. The investigation and settlement resulted from a coordinated effort by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California, HHS-OIG, DCIS, VA OIG, OPM OIG, and the California Department of Justice, Division of Medi-Cal Fraud and Elder Abuse.

The investigation and resolution of this matter illustrates the government’s emphasis on combating healthcare fraud. One of the most powerful tools in this effort is the False Claims Act. Tips and complaints from all sources about potential fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement can be reported to HHS at 800-HHS-TIPS (800-447-8477).

The claims resolved by the settlement are allegations only; there has been no determination of liability.

My doctor's in the US had given me a 6-month stock of all the medication I was on so that I would have enough time to find a new doctor and get everything situated. I was on Tricare select and trying to get command sponsored for a long time. It literally took 6 months for them (efmp? If forgot the name) to even look at the paperwork. It wasn't until my husband got his first sergeant involved that they actually started doing anything.

My husband has never PCS'd before and I was really sick for the first four months of being here, and spent a lot of time in and out of the ER, so that definitely slowed down the process with him not having any clue what to do and taking care of me.

But now I just did the initial doctor's appointment to get command sponsored, and she gave me a bunch of referrals. I thought that meant my sponsorship went through, but they're not answering again and it's been two weeks. I called and tried to make doctor's appointments for base providers and was told that all of the referrals had been closed and that their understaffed anyway so I'll just have to find someone off post. Even with select I've been trying to find providers off post and have no clue how. The ones that I found never respond Even after I've sent them intake paperwork and tried to make an appointment. I ran out of medication (thyroid issues) 4 months ago and have just been treating it myself with a range of supplements.

Also, at the initial doctor's appointment for command sponsorship (I honest to God cannot remember what it's called, I'm sorry, I'm freaking out), I told her that I had PCOS/thyroid issues that I've been trying to get treated since 17 (My parents thought religious blessings should be used for everything unless you're actively dying, and then you can go to the hospital... Also there's just a lot of medical incompetence and I've had some unethical doctors, so never really able to get any treatment and I'm 26 now). The doctor sent out for labs and I asked for her to give me a referral to endocrinology and she said we would just wait to see if I actually had it. They called me two days later and informed me that I actually did have dangerously high insulin levels and I said no shit, that's what I told you. But they said that they wouldn't be able to give me a referral to endocrinology or anything until I was sponsored and until my doctor signed off on it which could be weeks.

I'm really confused right now, and I feel really alone here. Basically all the important information I've been able to find has been from other spouses on base. I was so relieved to be able to have insurance that wasn't controlled by my parents / the shitty situation I was in before, and now I'm just really confused and I'm so tired of doing absolutely everything I can with my health/lifestyle to maintain my health and still be told that I need to try harder to lose weight or informed that I have something that I already told them I had. I don't want to keep going around in loops, especially being in a foreign country in a system that I don't understand and not knowing where to go for help.

Sorry, word vomiting, but I've been here for almost a year now and I don't know what to do or if this is normal or really what anyone was saying. They didn't really want to explain it or stay on the phone with me, they just kept passing me around to different offices that were annoyed I was asking questions",,N,0.0,2025-08-21 01:56:19.855327

What You Need to Know: DHCS is rolling out a series of Medi-Cal Rx policy changes starting November 1, 2025, with more extensive coverage restrictions set to take effect January 1, 2026. The changes aim to curb pharmacy spending and improve program integrity but may affect access to preventive and over-the-counter treatments.

The California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) has released a notice of upcoming changes to Medi-Cal Rx as part of the 2025-26 state budget. The new rules will be phased in over the coming months, beginning with an update to the coordination of benefits (COB) claims process for Medicare members on November 1, 2025.

Effective November 1, DHCS will adjust how pharmacy claims involving both Medi-Cal and Medicare (known as dual eligible) are submitted and adjudicated to streamline processing. Under the updated rules, pharmacies must submit COB claims with specific NCPDP field codes to ensure Medi-Cal Rx receives the correct payment status and addresses eligibility and payer accuracy

Additional changes effective January 1, 2026, include:

COVID‑19 Tests: Over-the-counter COVID‑19 antigen tests will require prior authorization (PA) for all Medi-Cal members.

Weight Loss Drugs: Medications used solely for weight loss or related indications will be removed from Medi-Cal Rx coverage, with patients likely having to pay out of pocket.

Revisions to OTC coverage for Adults (21+): Reimbursement policies will change for certain OTC products, including prenatal vitamins, multivitamin combinations, single-ingredient vitamins, first- and second-generation antihistamines, and dry eye treatments.

Continuation of Care Exceptions Removed: Claims receiving coverage under previous continuation of care exceptions (e.g., for drugs listed on the Medi-Cal Rx Contract Drugs List) will no longer be accepted.

Therapeutic Alternatives Required: Use of certain non-covered drugs will now require prescribing therapeutically equivalent alternatives listed in the Medi-Cal Rx Contract Drugs List before reimbursement is possible.

Recovery from these injuries is multifaceted, requiring medical care, modified activity, rest, and an element that is often overlooked—nutrition.

According to Defense Health Agency–Public Health, more than 95% of active duty military personnel’s injuries are musculoskeletal and are the leading reason for military medical visits.

The most common type of musculoskeletal injury found in military health care records is cumulative microtrauma injury, often referred to as overuse injuries, said U.S. Army Maj. Shay Lopez, the Injury Prevention branch chief at DHA-PH. “It is important for service members to allow injuries to heal completely before returning to duty,” said Lopez. “If an injury is not healed properly, there is an increased risk for another injury. Prior injury is one of strongest predictors for future injury.”

Developing an intentional recovery plan is a key step to returning to full duty. “Service members need to modify their activities and follow an intentional recovery plan prior to returning to their full duties,” said Lopez.

An important element of the recovery plan is nutritional intervention, said Jennifer Meeks, DHA-PH nutritionist. “Nutritional interventions will help the injury recovery process by supporting optimal healing,” said Meeks. “The faster a service member or athlete recovers from injury, the quicker they can return to duty or the training field. Optimal nutrition should be the focus to get back to preinjury performance after a musculoskeletal injury.”

Proactive nutrition before an injury focuses on performance nutrition, disease prevention, and immune system enhancement, said Meeks. Reactive nutrition is specific to medical nutrition therapy after injury to control inflammation, rebuild injured tissue, minimize muscle loss, and prevent unwanted weight gain. “Even if your preinjury eating habits weren’t perfect, a focus on making more healthful choices during your recovery can have tremendous benefits,” said Meeks.

Here are some tips to consider.

1. Energy needs during recovery: During your recovery time, your activity levels will be lower than usual. Even if you're not as active, you still need enough calories to help your body heal from wounds and injuries. Not getting enough food can delay your healing, drain your energy, and lead to unwanted loss of weight or muscle. To learn how many calories you need, experts can measure your resting metabolism or estimate calorie needs using special formulas. Your body needs fuel to heal, but you may not need as many calories as you normally would. If you need to cut back on calories, focus on reducing carbohydrates and fats, but make sure you still eat enough protein to help your body repair itself. You might need to adjust what and how much you eat over time to avoid gaining weight. Talking to a sports dietitian can help you figure out the right number of calories and create a personalized eating plan that includes the right balance of protein, fat, and carbs.

2. Protein: The cornerstone of healing: There are numerous academic studies highlighting the importance of protein for muscle repair, immune defense, and maintaining lean mass. The Joint Service regulation, Nutrition and Menu Standards for Human Performance Optimization, recommends 0.8 to 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram (or 0.36 to 0.73 grams of protein per pound of body weight) of body weight for normal activity. This equates to a protein range of 68 to 136 grams per day for men and 55 to 110 grams per day for women.

How much protein do you need when injured?

When you're injured, it's recommended to eat more protein–about 1.5 to 2 grams of protein for every kilogram you weigh each day. The exact amount varies from person to person and depends on your activity level. Studies show that eating an increased amount of protein helps you recover faster. For example, someone who weighs 180 pounds (about 81 kilograms) would need around 122–163 grams of protein per day.

It's best to spread your protein intake throughout the day, eating some at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and in snacks. This helps your muscles rebuild. For a 180-pound person, aim for about 30 grams of protein at each meal and 15–20 grams in snacks. For example, 30 grams of protein equals 1.5 cups of Greek yogurt, 1 cup of cottage cheese, 5 large eggs, 5 ounces of salmon, a scoop of third-party certified protein powder in a smoothie, 1.5 cups of lentils, or 4 ounces of chicken breast. Some meal ideas might be a Greek yogurt parfait with berries, a bean and veggie burrito, egg muffin cups with chopped veggies, or salmon with avocado toast. To boost your protein intake, try some of these easy tips:

Start your day with meals featuring eggs, yogurt, or cottage cheese to kickstart your protein intake early.

Choose high-protein snacks to keep you full between meals: Options include raw nuts, yogurt, boiled eggs, or cheese.

Add legumes to your meals: Whether it's a soup, stew, or salad, throwing in beans, lentils, or chickpeas can significantly increase the protein content.

Swap out traditional carbs for high-protein alternatives: Replace rice or pasta with options like quinoa or legumes to add more protein to your plate.

Sprinkle on seeds or nuts: Toppings like chia seeds, flaxseeds, or raw nuts not only enhance flavor but also provide a solid protein boost along with healthy fats.

It's also a good idea to have 15–30 grams of protein after rehab or therapy to help your muscles recover. Good options include chocolate milk, a turkey sandwich on whole grain bread, or a recovery shake.

3. Eat colorful fruits & veggies to help heal: Eating fruits and vegetables packed with antioxidants can help reduce swelling, control inflammation, and speed up your recovery. Great choices include goji berries, blueberries, tart cherries, dark chocolate, pecans, artichokes, kidney beans, cranberries, blackberries, and green tea. Pineapple, turmeric, garlic, and ginger are also good sources.

Vitamin C, zinc, calcium, and vitamin D are key nutrients for healing. While all nutrients are important, vitamin C and zinc are superstars for healing. Vitamin C helps your body make collagen, a protein needed to repair tendons, ligaments, and surgical wounds. You can find vitamin C in citrus fruits, strawberries, kiwi, baked potatoes, broccoli, and bell peppers. Zinc helps with cell growth and wound healing. Good sources of zinc include meat, fish, poultry, dairy, whole grains, fortified bread and cereals, beans, peas, nuts, and seeds.

Calcium and vitamin D are essential for strong bones. You can get vitamin D from milk, yogurt, fortified soy milk, dark leafy greens, sunlight, or supplements. It's a good idea to check your vitamin D levels after an injury to see if you need to increase your intake.

4. Fats: friend, not foe: While some fats can contribute to inflammation, healthy fats are critical during recovery. Omega-3 fatty acids may increase muscle repairs and prevent muscle loss during a time of recovery.

Prioritize omega-3 fatty acids in your diet for their anti-inflammatory properties. Foods high in omega-3 fatty acids include salmon, walnuts, flaxseed, chia, olive oil, avocados, fish, nuts, and seeds.

Limit excessive omega-6 fats (found in fried or processed foods) that may worsen inflammation.

5. Skip the alcohol and stay hydrated: While you’re recovering from an injury, it's best to avoid alcohol because it can slow down the healing process. Alcohol can interfere with muscle repair, wound healing, and can even lead to muscle loss.

Staying hydrated is also crucial for recovery. Dehydration can hinder healing, reduce the delivery of nutrients to your body, and make you feel more tired. Men should aim for 96–144 ounces of water per day (12–18 cups), and women should aim for 64–96 ounces (8–12 cups). Keep in mind that these amounts can vary depending on the environment, your activity level, and other factors. To make hydration more enjoyable, try adding fruit to create infused water, or opt for flavored sparkling water.

6. Supplements: use with caution: Some supplements may support healing. Consult with a registered dietitian and check out the resources on the Operation Supplement Safety webpage to find more information. Here are two supplements that may be helpful to consider:

Creatine monohydrate: May help preserve muscle mass during immobilization.

Vitamin D: Supplement if levels are low, especially in indoor or northern duty stations.

Only use supplements certified by third-party testing programs. Look for these seals: BSCG Certified Drug Free, Informed Sport, NSF Certified Sport, and USP Verified.

Getting back on your feet after a musculoskeletal injury isn't just about rest and rehab—it's also about eating right. Service members need to focus on their nutrition to shorten recovery time, stay ready for duty, and get back to full strength.

Nutrition is key to healing and rehabilitation. Following practical eating guidelines can help reduce problems after surgery and minimize muscle loss during recovery. Whether you're recovering from a stress fracture or surgery, what you eat can help you heal faster and stronger.

For personalized advice, reach out to a registered dietitian at your military hospital or clinic, or your local Armed Forces Wellness Center for assistance.

During your recovery time, your activity levels will be lower than usual. Even if you're not as active, you still need enough calories to help your body heal from wounds and injuries. Not getting enough food can delay your healing, drain your energy, and lead to unwanted loss of weight or muscle. To learn how many calories you need, experts can measure your resting metabolism or estimate calorie needs using special formulas. Your body needs fuel to heal, but you may not need as many calories as you normally would. If you need to cut back on calories, focus on reducing carbohydrates and fats, but make sure you still eat enough protein to help your body repair itself. You might need to adjust what and how much you eat over time to avoid gaining weight. Talking to a sports dietitian can help you figure out the right number of calories and create a personalized eating plan that includes the right balance of protein, fat, and carbs.

2. Protein: The cornerstone of healing:

There are numerous academic studies highlighting the importance of protein for muscle repair, immune defense, and maintaining lean mass. The Joint Service regulation, Nutrition and Menu Standards for Human Performance Optimization, recommends 0.8 to 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram (or 0.36 to 0.73 grams of protein per pound of body weight) of body weight for normal activity. This equates to a protein range of 68 to 136 grams per day for men and 55 to 110 grams per day for women.

How much protein do you need when injured?

When you're injured, it's recommended to eat more protein–about 1.5 to 2 grams of protein for every kilogram you weigh each day. The exact amount varies from person to person and depends on your activity level. Studies show that eating an increased amount of protein helps you recover faster. For example, someone who weighs 180 pounds (about 81 kilograms) would need around 122–163 grams of protein per day.

It's best to spread your protein intake throughout the day, eating some at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and in snacks. This helps your muscles rebuild. For a 180-pound person, aim for about 30 grams of protein at each meal and 15–20 grams in snacks. For example, 30 grams of protein equals 1.5 cups of Greek yogurt, 1 cup of cottage cheese, 5 large eggs, 5 ounces of salmon, a scoop of third-party certified protein powder in a smoothie, 1.5 cups of lentils, or 4 ounces of chicken breast. Some meal ideas might be a Greek yogurt parfait with berries, a bean and veggie burrito, egg muffin cups with chopped veggies, or salmon with avocado toast. To boost your protein intake, try some of these easy tips:

Start your day with meals featuring eggs, yogurt, or cottage cheese to kickstart your protein intake early.

Choose high-protein snacks to keep you full between meals: Options include raw nuts, yogurt, boiled eggs, or cheese.

Add legumes to your meals: Whether it's a soup, stew, or salad, throwing in beans, lentils, or chickpeas can significantly increase the protein content.

Swap out traditional carbs for high-protein alternatives: Replace rice or pasta with options like quinoa or legumes to add more protein to your plate.

Sprinkle on seeds or nuts: Toppings like chia seeds, flaxseeds, or raw nuts not only enhance flavor but also provide a solid protein boost along with healthy fats.

It's also a good idea to have 15–30 grams of protein after rehab or therapy to help your muscles recover. Good options include chocolate milk, a turkey sandwich on whole grain bread, or a recovery shake.

3. Eat colorful fruits & veggies to help heal

Eating fruits and vegetables packed with antioxidants can help reduce swelling, control inflammation, and speed up your recovery. Great choices include goji berries, blueberries, tart cherries, dark chocolate, pecans, artichokes, kidney beans, cranberries, blackberries, and green tea. Pineapple, turmeric, garlic, and ginger are also good sources.

Vitamin C, zinc, calcium, and vitamin D are key nutrients for healing. While all nutrients are important, vitamin C and zinc are superstars for healing. Vitamin C helps your body make collagen, a protein needed to repair tendons, ligaments, and surgical wounds. You can find vitamin C in citrus fruits, strawberries, kiwi, baked potatoes, broccoli, and bell peppers. Zinc helps with cell growth and wound healing. Good sources of zinc include meat, fish, poultry, dairy, whole grains, fortified bread and cereals, beans, peas, nuts, and seeds.

Calcium and vitamin D are essential for strong bones. You can get vitamin D from milk, yogurt, fortified soy milk, dark leafy greens, sunlight, or supplements. It's a good idea to check your vitamin D levels after an injury to see if you need to increase your intake.

4. Fats: friend, not foe

While some fats can contribute to inflammation, healthy fats are critical during recovery. Omega-3 fatty acids may increase muscle repairs and prevent muscle loss during a time of recovery.

Prioritize omega-3 fatty acids in your diet for their anti-inflammatory properties. Foods high in omega-3 fatty acids include salmon, walnuts, flaxseed, chia, olive oil, avocados, fish, nuts, and seeds.

Limit excessive omega-6 fats (found in fried or processed foods) that may worsen inflammation.

5. Skip the alcohol and stay hydrated

While you’re recovering from an injury, it's best to avoid alcohol because it can slow down the healing process. Alcohol can interfere with muscle repair, wound healing, and can even lead to muscle loss.

Staying hydrated is also crucial for recovery. Dehydration can hinder healing, reduce the delivery of nutrients to your body, and make you feel more tired. Men should aim for 96–144 ounces of water per day (12–18 cups), and women should aim for 64–96 ounces (8–12 cups). Keep in mind that these amounts can vary depending on the environment, your activity level, and other factors. To make hydration more enjoyable, try adding fruit to create infused water, or opt for flavored sparkling water.

6. Supplements: use with caution

Some supplements may support healing. Consult with a registered dietitian and check out the resources on the Operation Supplement Safety webpage to find more information. Here are two supplements that may be helpful to consider:

Creatine monohydrate: May help preserve muscle mass during immobilization.

Vitamin D: Supplement if levels are low, especially in indoor or northern duty stations.

Only use supplements certified by third-party testing programs. Look for these seals: BSCG Certified Drug Free, Informed Sport, NSF Certified Sport, and USP Verified.

Getting back on your feet after a musculoskeletal injury isn't just about rest and rehab—it's also about eating right. Service members need to focus on their nutrition to shorten recovery time, stay ready for duty, and get back to full strength.

Nutrition is key to healing and rehabilitation. Following practical eating guidelines can help reduce problems after surgery and minimize muscle loss during recovery. Whether you're recovering from a stress fracture or surgery, what you eat can help you heal faster and stronger.

For personalized advice, reach out to a registered dietitian at your military hospital or clinic, or your local Armed Forces Wellness Center for assistance.

HUM, with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has an edge over CNC, which carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).","A rising proportion of elderly citizens fuels demand for Medicare plans, enabling insurers to tap into a growing senior population. Centene Corporation CNC and Humana HUM — two major managed-care providers, heavily focused on government-sponsored health insurance programs such as Medicaid and Medicare Advantage (“MA”) — are poised to benefit from this demographic tailwind.

Enacted in July 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) aims to simplify and digitize the U.S. healthcare payment system by consolidating medical billing and reducing administrative inefficiencies. Centene and Humana, being major players, face challenges in the form of hampered enrollment, increased administrative costs and reimbursement uncertainty. The new regulatory landscape presents opportunities like developing tailored individual products and expanding into private markets to offset potential Medicaid revenue losses.

Yet, as an investment option, which stock is more attractive? Let’s closely look at the fundamentals of these stocks.

The Case for Centene

Centene is a major player in government-sponsored healthcare, offering services across Medicaid, MA, the ACA Marketplace, Tricare and correctional health. Its scale is reinforced by a broad and growing membership base. Over the years, acquisitions such as Health Net, WellCare and Magellan Health have expanded Centene’s reach and diversified its service portfolio, providing a strong platform for long-term growth.

The company’s Marketplace segment has been a key growth driver, with membership rising 12.4% as of Dec. 31, 2024. However, profitability has come under pressure. A spike in the second-quarter health benefits ratio (HBR) forced management to sharply lower its 2025 earnings guidance to about $1.75 per share, down from the earlier projection of more than $7.00. Results were further weighed down by lower-than-anticipated 2025 risk adjustment transfers and elevated medical utilization, particularly within Medicaid and MA. Enrollment losses in these higher-margin businesses have added to the strain.

Centene’s balance sheet also reflects the costs of its acquisition-led expansion, with long-term debt of $17.6 billion as of June 30, 2025.

Looking ahead, management is focused on recovery. The company intends to reprice its Marketplace plans in 2026 to restore margins, while pursuing disciplined pricing and operational improvements to stabilize MA. These initiatives are expected to drive meaningful progress, with management targeting breakeven in MA by 2027. Despite near-term challenges, Centene’s scale and diversified operations leave it well-positioned to regain profitability and sustain growth in a competitive healthcare landscape.

The Case for Humana

Humana stands as one of the strongest players in the U.S. healthcare insurance sector, with a dominant position in MA, holding nearly 21% market share. The company continues to benefit from favorable demographics, as an aging population sustains steady demand for MA plans. As of June 30, 2025, Humana reported approximately 3.54 million MA members, with continued expansion in both Medicare Advantage and state-based programs driving premium growth.

Diversification beyond traditional insurance remains central to Humana’s strategy. Its CenterWell business—which delivers value-based primary care, pharmacy services, and home health solutions—has gained meaningful traction, enhancing long-term growth visibility and reducing dependence on insurance margins. The company is also leveraging AI-driven efficiencies, disciplined cost management and conservative guidance to strengthen operating performance and restore investor confidence.

Strategic acquisitions have further bolstered Humana’s footprint. Deals for Family Physicians Group, Your Home Advantage and Curo extended its presence in primary care and home health. The acquisition of Enclara built scale in hospice pharmacy, while iCare and Inclusa expanded Medicare and Medicaid offerings in Wisconsin. At the same time, Humana has sharpened its portfolio by divesting non-core assets, most notably by selling a 60% stake in Kindred at Home’s Hospice and Personal Care units to Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, while retaining a 40% interest to benefit from the standalone company’s long-term growth.

Supported by stabilizing medical cost trends and stronger-than-expected MA retention, Humana raised its 2025 EPS outlook to about $17 and revenues above $128 billion .

Estimates for CNC and HUM

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CNC’s 2025 revenues implies a year-over-year increase of 16.9% while that for EPS implies a 77% decline. EPS estimates have moved 14.6% southward over the past seven days.

On the other hand, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for HUM’s 2025 revenues and EPS implies a year-over-year increase of 9.3% and 4.8%, respectively. EPS estimates have moved 0.4% north over the past seven days.

Are CNC and HUM Shares Expensive?

Centene is trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 11.61, above its median of 11.18 over the last five years. Humana’s price-to-earnings multiple sits at 19.73, above its median of 17.72 over the last five years.

Conclusion

Centene is expected to face notable headwinds under OBBBA, including reduced membership, tightening profit margins and rising operational costs. The company’s Medicaid business is already strained by increasing expenditures related to behavioral health, home-based care and costly medications.

Humana’s Medicaid business stands to benefit from several contract wins and renewals, which contribute to top-line growth. Despite witnessing strong, consistent performance in its Medicare business in recent quarters, the unit came under stress. With Humana deciding to exit certain unprofitable plans and counties, its individual MA membership might take a hit. Nonetheless, its growing focus on Florida is a major positive.

On the basis of return on equity (“ROE”), which reflects a company’s efficiency in generating profit from shareholders' equity as well as gives a clear picture of the company's financial health, HUM, with a ROE of 16.7%, scores higher than CNC, which has a ROE of 9.6%.

Moreover, shares of HUM have gained 13% year to date, in contrast to the industry and CNC’s decline of 31.6% and 51.8%, respectively, over the same time.

HUM, with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has an edge over CNC, which carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

As National Guard and Reserve members near age 60, they reach important milestones in their military retirement pay and benefits. Whether they have been retired awaiting pay or continue drilling until age 60, this transition requires action so benefits begin on time.

Here are four considerations for reserve component members as they approach their 60th birthday.

TRICARE Health Benefits

At 60 years old, reserve component retirees and their eligible family members can start using TRICARE for health and medical needs — the same version as their retired active duty counterparts.

Some reserve component members might have been using TRICARE Reserve Select or Retired Reserve, both of which require premiums. Upon turning 60, retirees become eligible for standard TRICARE plans with much less expensive enrollment fees. Importantly, enrollment fees count toward a family’s catastrophic cap, which further reduces overall health care costs.

[UPDATED MONTHLY: MOAA's TRICARE Toolkit]

Your location can impact the availability of plans, which might include TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, TRICARE Overseas, and the US Family Health Plan.

Reserve component retirees must contact TRICARE within 90 days of turning 60; otherwise, they will need to wait until another qualifying life event or an annual open season to enroll.

Military Retirement Pay

Reserve component members might have retired from active drilling status before this point, but age 60 typically marks the beginning of their retirement pay. Some members might be eligible to start earlier if they completed qualifying periods of active duty. However, no member can receive retirement pay before age 50.

To qualify for military retirement pay, members must have completed at least 20 “good” years of service, as confirmed by their notice of eligibility. Retirement pay does not begin automatically, so retirees must apply in advance. It’s recommended they submit DD forms 108 and 2656 six to nine months before turning 60. Each branch of the reserve component has its own process for submitting retirement pay applications.

[FORM DOWNLOADS: DD 108 | DD 2656]

Survivor Benefit Plan

Depending on the election made when they received their notice of eligibility, retirees might need to make a decision about the military’s Survivor Benefit Plan. This program provides financial security for a spouse or designated beneficiaries after the retiree’s death by continuing a portion of the retirement pay.

If a retiree opts out of the plan or selects reduced coverage, spousal consent is required. This ensures both parties are aware of the potential financial impact of not enrolling in full coverage.

Knowing when to use your medical or dental coverage helps avoid unnecessary costs or delays in care.

“When you need dental care because of an injury, it may be covered under your TRICARE medical plan,” said Douglas Elsesser, TRICARE Dental Program Analyst at the Defense Health Agency. “But this is only if it’s tied to a medical condition and pre-authorized. Knowing the difference can save you time and money.”

Here’s what you should know.

When is dental care considered “medical”?

In some cases, TRICARE medical coverage includes limited dental care known as adjunctive dental care. Adjunctive dental care is treatment you need to support a covered medical condition, injury, or disease. This is different from routine or restorative dental work. Routine and restorative dental work are covered separately under the TRICARE Dental Program, TRICARE Active Duty Dental Program, or other dental insurance.

Here are some examples of adjunctive dental care that TRICARE may cover:

You break your jaw and a dentist removes a tooth to stabilize the fracture.

You need surgery to remove tooth fragments embedded in your tongue after an accident.

You need a restoration—like a crown or bridge—to replace a tooth lost during treatment of a medical condition.

Note: TRICARE requires pre-authorization for any adjunctive dental care unless it’s a medical emergency. Make sure your provider submits a request before you receive care. However, if you simply crack your tooth, TRICARE medical plans won’t cover repairing or replacing it.

What is the TRICARE Dental Program?

The TDP is a separate, premium-based dental plan available to active duty family members, National Guard and Reserve members, and their family members. As described in the TRICARE Dental Program Handbook, it covers services like:

Checkups and cleanings

Fillings and crowns

Oral surgery and tooth extractions

Sealants and preventive care

Orthodontics, in some cases

You can find more details in the TRICARE Dental Program Handbook, which outlines which restorative services are covered and which aren’t.

Note: TDP doesn’t cover adjunctive dental care. When you need a dental procedure to treat a medical condition, it falls under your TRICARE medical plan instead—but make sure to get pre-authorization.

Coverage scenarios

Generally, when the care supports a covered medical problem or injury, it qualifies as adjunctive dental care under medical. Otherwise, it falls under dental.

Kellermann,,,,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/arthurkellermann/2025/08/20/trumps-first-term-degraded-military-health-his-second-must-rebuild-it/,"The clinical duties that military doctors, nurses, and other health professionals perform in stateside military hospitals helps keep their skills sharp between deployments.
It also allows them to teach and inspire the next generation of military healthcare professionals.
As the wars wound down, they began siphoning military health funding and positions for other DoD priorities.
As a result, spending on military healthcare flattened, and is now far behind healthcare spending in the VA and our nation overall.
If the Pentagon resumes its push to privatize the military health system, it will harm the health of our armed forces and diminish their battlefield performance.","Recently, Senators McConnell (R-KY) and Coons (D-DE) cosponsored a bill to invest more than $850 billion to strengthen our nation’s defense industrial base, upgrade its shipbuilding capabilities, replenish munitions, and support key allies. Although these are worthy goals, Congress and the White House must not overlook the system that safeguards the health of American warfighters - our military’s most important asset.

Last March, the Chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Roger Wicker (R-MS), made pointed remarks at the outset of a hearing on stabilizing the military health system:

“In 2019, the military departments implemented drastic cuts to military medical personnel on the faulty assumption that it would be easy for DHA (the Defense Health Agency) to hire civilians to take their places…In 2020, Congress ordered a halt to any additional military medical reductions, but it was too late. A significant number of reductions had already occurred, severely reducing the capability of military hospitals…This has proven more expensive and has sapped the military doctors’ experiences that are vital to maintaining proficiency. Even worse, the Department of Defense (DOD) has refused to request adequate funding for DHA.”

America’s Military Health System Is Unique

Unlike the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) or private healthcare systems, military health must always be ready to deploy uniformed healthcare professionals anywhere in the world in support 0f U.S. combat operations and other missions, including peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance.

To enable this work, the MHS maintains a network of stateside military hospitals and clinics, supplemented by healthcare purchased from private doctors and healthcare systems to treat active-duty service members, their family members, and military retirees. This second mission reinforces the first. The clinical duties that military doctors, nurses, and other health professionals perform in stateside military hospitals helps keep their skills sharp between deployments. It also allows them to teach and inspire the next generation of military healthcare professionals. In times of conflict, military hospitals receive and treat complex casualties. Finally, the high-quality care to wounded, ill and injured servicemembers as well as their families and military retirees helps the DoD recruit and retain its “all-volunteer” force.

Healthy Forces Are Vital For Battlefield Success

Military health has played a key role in American history since the founding of our republic. In the Winter of 1777, General George Washington ordered the inoculation of the Continental Army against smallpox. It was the first time in history that an Army was immunized by command order. Washington also instituted policies on camp cleanliness and took other actions to preserve his army’s fighting strength. The principles he established still guide military medicine to this day.

Health protection is so important to preserving fighting strength that the U.S. military monitors every unit’s “disease and non-battle injury (DNBI)” rates to evaluate the quality of its leadership and medical support.

This discipline paid off in Afghanistan and Iraq. Despite logistical challenges and austere conditions, military medicine drove rates of DNBIs and deaths from severe battlefield wounds to the lowest levels in the history of warfare. It’s one of the most remarkable achievements in the history of American medicine. Many of the innovations they pioneered have been adopted by civilian healthcare.

Post-War Decisions Eroded Hard-Won Gains

Instead of recognizing the value of military health, budget officials in the Pentagon viewed the MHS as little more than an HMO for beneficiaries. As the wars wound down, they began siphoning military health funding and positions for other DoD priorities. As a result, spending on military healthcare flattened, and is now far behind healthcare spending in the VA and our nation overall.

During Trump’s first term, the Pentagon compounded this error by directing military families and retirees to go elsewhere for treatment. Then, as visits and hospital admissions fell, they downsized or closed many military clinics and hospitals. Even top hospitals, such as Walter Reed and Naval Medical Center San Diego, were left underfunded, understaffed, and underutilized. This weakened the link between stateside care and battlefield care.

By the time the Joint Chiefs of Staff realized that privatization had gone too far, the damage was done. In 2023, then Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks issued a directive to reverse course and begin restoring the MHS.

What About Now?

Today, different leaders are in charge. In the past, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has advocated diverting military and veteran healthcare benefits to enhance the Pentagon’s ""war-fighting capability."" Military and veterans’ healthcare IS a warfighting capability. It’s a major reason why American servicemembers fight so hard, accept such risks and reenlist to do it again. Until recently, they knew that every time they were deployed, their families would be cared for by doctors and nurses who understood the stresses of military life. They were also confident that if anyone in their unit became ill or was wounded in battle, they’d receive the best healthcare in the world, expert rehabilitation, and if needed, long-term care.

If the Pentagon resumes its push to privatize the military health system, it will harm the health of our armed forces and diminish their battlefield performance. Two former Hegseth aides said as much in a recent New York Times op-ed:

""Even on the modern high-tech battlefield, war is still a people business. For the Department of Defense, this means it must care for its people along with developing its weapons in order to maintain lethality while also creating an environment that incentivizes Americans to continue to serve. When service members and their families cannot rely on the programs that are intended to ensure their quality of life, it distracts them from their duties, which inevitably limits their effectiveness in combat.”

Novo Nordisk has implemented a global hiring freeze covering job roles that are not critical for its business, Reuters writes. The move comes as the company battles competition from copycat versions of its blockbuster Wegovy obesity drug and it could face layoffs as it battles rising pressure from its main rival, Eli Lilly. Last month, investors wiped $70 billion off the drugmaker’s market value. The reaction came after Novo — which became Europe’s most valuable listed company following the launch of Wegovy in 2021 — issued a profit warning and named a company veteran, Mike Doustdar, as its new chief executive officer. Doustdar, who took the helm on Aug. 7, told Danish broadcaster TV2 on his first day in office that he would look for cost savings throughout the company and also consider layoffs.

Our agents adapt by parsing these responses, isolating plan-specific coverage logic, and surfacing requirements such as visit limits or Primary Care Manager (PCM) referrals. Over time, AI agents improve accuracy by learning from your organization’s historical Tricare verifications, which reduces manual intervention and denial risk.

This new offering addresses the specific needs of active-duty service members struggling with substance use disorders while accommodating the demands of military life.

For more information about the Tricare-approved program, visit https://sayarc.com/services/tricare-approved-iop/

The inpatient detox program complements ARC’s existing Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) for military members. Treatment focuses on addressing underlying causes of substance use through group and individual therapy sessions, with scheduling that accommodates military duties and responsibilities.

Data indicates that military personnel face unique challenges that can contribute to substance use disorders. Studies show that stress, trauma, accessibility of alcohol, peer pressure, and isolation can all play significant roles in the development of addiction among service members. These factors require specialized treatment approaches that understand military culture and lifestyle demands.

ARC’s team includes certified counselors, psychologists, and medical personnel with over 50 years of combined experience who understand these challenges. The program also provides family support to strengthen home environments for service members, recognizing that recovery extends beyond the individual to their support network.

The Tricare-approved status means active-duty military members receive treatment with minimal out-of-pocket costs. ARC staff verify benefits and guide patients through admission, removing barriers to care. This approval ensures that service members can access quality treatment without financial concerns adding to their stress.

With the addition of inpatient detox services, ARC now provides more comprehensive care through the withdrawal process. This expansion creates a continuum from detoxification through ongoing recovery support. The structured environment of inpatient detox offers medical supervision during the critical early stages of recovery, increasing safety and comfort during withdrawal.

The program’s evidence-based treatment methods have been selected specifically for their effectiveness with substance use disorders common among military personnel. By combining medical support with psychological care, ARC addresses both the physical and emotional aspects of addiction recovery.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator: https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/find-pharmacy

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates: https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/notices/weather

Last December, the Biden administration published an interim rule to allow Medicare and Medicaid to cover GLP-1 agonists for weight loss.
The Trump administration issued its final rule on 2026 Medicare drug coverage in April and excluded the interim rule's provision that would have allowed coverage of GLP-1 medications for weight loss.
""People are taking GLP-1 drugs -- like Wegovy and Zepbound -- for weight loss now more than ever,"" Defense Health Agency Chief Medical Officer Dr. Paul Cordts said in a statement.
Related: Vets Say Weight Loss Drugs Have Improved Their Health, But New Patients Are Out of Luck Story Continues","Military retirees and family members on Tricare for Life, and civilians with access to military hospitals and clinics, will lose coverage for weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound starting Aug. 31, according to the Defense Health Agency.

Military health officials said earlier this month that Medicare-eligible retirees -- those who use Tricare for Life -- and Defense Department civilians and others with access to military hospitals but who aren't on Tricare will no longer be able to get these popular medications through the DoD health system.

Beneficiaries with Tricare Prime, Tricare Select and premium-based Tricare plans will continue to have coverage, but they must meet certain clinical criteria, such as being obese or having obstructive sleep apnea related to their weight, according to the Defense Health Agency.

Tricare for Life, or TFL, provides secondary health coverage to military retirees and their family members on Medicare. As wraparound coverage, TFL was covering those medications, known as glucagon-like peptide-1, or GLP-1, agonists for weight loss in eligible beneficiaries.

But Medicare covers GLP-1 medications only to treat Type 2 diabetes and for cardiovascular disease that may be worsened by a patient's excess weight. It does not cover the drugs prescribed specifically for obesity.

Tricare for Life beneficiaries prescribed these medications for diabetes will retain coverage, according to the Defense Department. Common GLP-1 drugs for diabetes include Ozempic and Mounjaro.

Last December, the Biden administration published an interim rule to allow Medicare and Medicaid to cover GLP-1 agonists for weight loss. The anticipated cost of the coverage for the federal government of the change was $48 billion over 10 years, according to a University of Chicago estimate.

The Trump administration issued its final rule on 2026 Medicare drug coverage in April and excluded the interim rule's provision that would have allowed coverage of GLP-1 medications for weight loss.

Tricare officials said the Defense Health Agency is eliminating coverage for its Tricare for Life beneficiaries and others to ""align with federal coverage requirements.""

""Your provider can work with you to explore all options and determine the best approach for your health needs,"" Tricare officials said in a news release. ""Talk to your provider. You can also visit Health and Wellness for more details on resources that can help you reach your goals.""

GLP-1 medications have been used to treat diabetes for nearly 20 years. They mimic a hormone that is naturally released by the body after eating, triggering the release of insulin from the pancreas, controlling blood sugar levels.

The medications also suppress hunger and slow the digestion process, leading patients to feel full on smaller portions or for longer periods of time after eating.

While patients report weight loss and often improvement in mental health and cognition, these medications can have side effects that include nausea and vomiting, muscle loss and sagging skin.

The Defense Department has not released an exact accounting of the number of GLP-1 prescriptions written for weight loss, but a 2024 report noted that, by late 2023, the drugs made up roughly one-third of all prescription weight-loss medications for active-duty military personnel.

According to the report, 67.3% of active-duty troops were overweight in 2021, with 18.8% of those service members considered clinically obese.

The DoD began including weight-loss drugs in Tricare's formulary in 2018, adding semaglutide, a type of GLP-1 agonist, in 2021.

The out-of-pocket costs for such medications run between $350 and $500 per month, according to the manufacturers.

The Department of Veterans Affairs covers the medications for weight loss for veterans who already have tried less-pricey medications without success; those who also participate in a whole-health approach, including lifestyle modifications and exercise; and those with a body-mass index of 27 or more with at least one weight-related condition or illness; or a BMI of 30 or more.

The Defense Health Agency said beneficiaries affected by the change in coverage will be notified by mail.

""People are taking GLP-1 drugs -- like Wegovy and Zepbound -- for weight loss now more than ever,"" Defense Health Agency Chief Medical Officer Dr. Paul Cordts said in a statement. ""It's important to understand how -- and why -- Tricare covers these drugs, based on your condition and status.""

Whether you were stationed overseas or stuck in the middle of a stateside PCS, these are the all too real truths you only understand if you’ve done your time in the labor and delivery ward, with TRICARE as your birth plan backup.
Your birth plan is more like a birth suggestion.
You’ll PCS right after the baby arrives.
If you haven’t sobbed quietly while listening to “patriotic flute music” for 47 minutes, did you even give birth on TRICARE?","Giving birth under TRICARE is a unique rite of passage. It’s like childbirth… but with extra paperwork, a rotating cast of med students, and the occasional “Sir, this is a Wendy’s” moment. Whether you were stationed overseas or stuck in the middle of a stateside PCS, these are the all too real truths you only understand if you’ve done your time in the labor and delivery ward, with TRICARE as your birth plan backup.

That amazing doctor you finally clicked with? Yeah, they just got orders to Alaska. Don’t worry—your new provider read half your chart and once watched “Grey’s Anatomy”. You’re in good hands. Probably.

Every appointment, every phone call, every online form. You could be in active labor and still be whispering, “123-45-6789” like it’s a secret code to unlock your epidural.

3. You’re never quite sure what’s “covered” until it’s not.

Ultrasounds? Depends. A birthing tub? Maybe. Skin-to-skin contact? That’ll be $78 unless pre-authorized. But don’t worry, you’ll find out three weeks postpartum when the bill arrives.

4. Your birth plan is more like a birth suggestion.

You can hope for a calm, candlelit delivery… but what you’ll get is fluorescent lights, a shared room, and a corpsman who says, “Are you sure it’s not just gas?”

5. You’ll develop a sixth sense for which nurse is a retired first sergeant.

They don’t say it outright, but their haircut, tone, and ability to command a delivery room without raising their voice give it away. Stand at parade rest accordingly or just start doing push-ups.

6. You’ll PCS right after the baby arrives. Always.

Your newborn’s umbilical stump is still healing, and you’re packing boxes with one hand while breastfeeding with the other. Welcome to TRICARE’s favorite game: Postpartum and Packing Tape.

7. Your maternity leave starts… now.

Even if it wasn’t supposed to. Whether you’re active duty or a spouse, someone’s chain of command thinks six weeks is “plenty of time.” Spoiler: it’s not. Bonus points if they ask if you’re “well rested” yet.

8. You’ll spend more time on hold with DEERS than in actual labor.

If you haven’t sobbed quietly while listening to “patriotic flute music” for 47 minutes, did you even give birth on TRICARE?

9. Your lactation consultant is moonlighting as an artillery instructor.

She’s kind. She’s thorough. She has a laminated flipbook. And she’ll fix your latch like she’s briefing a mortar team under fire.

10. Despite the chaos, the system somehow works.

It’s not always pretty. It’s rarely smooth. But between the mix-ups, midwives, and moments of laughter, TRICARE does help bring military babies into the world, and that’s worth something. Especially if they finally fix the billing codes.

If you’ve survived this miracle-meets-madness saga, congrats. You’re not just a parent, you’re a Mighty Mom now. And if anyone asks about your birth story? Just say, “It was… tactical.”",https://www.wearethemighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/giving-birth-on-tricare-shutterstock.jpg?quality=85,N,0.0,2025-08-19 15:56:08.664401

Business Update

Norovirus Challenge Study to Commence in 4Q25

Cocrystal Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ:COCP) is developing CDI-988 as a prophylaxis and treatment for norovirus, coronavirus, and other viral infections. The company recently presented results from the Phase 1a single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) trial at the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium. The data showed that all doses, ranging from 100 mg to 1200 mg, were well tolerated. The rate of treatment-emergent adverse events was actually lower among CDI-988 subjects compared to placebo subjects in both the SAD (28% vs. 40%) and MAD (53% vs. 92%) cohorts. Importantly, there were no severe treatment-emergent adverse events, no clinically relevant ECG changes, and no clinically significant pathology results.

The Phase 1 trial was conducted in Australia. Cocrystal has filed an IND with the U.S. FDA in order to proceed with clinical trials in the U.S. and we expect clearance of the IND in September 2025. The company is then planning to conduct a Phase 1b coronavirus challenge study in the fourth quarter of 2025 to produce proof-of-concept data for CDI-988 as a preventative and a treatment. Outcomes that will be monitored include PK, symptoms, and viral shedding. Results of the study will dictate what future trials the company will pursue.

There are no approved therapies for norovirus infection, which is the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), there are an estimated 685 million cases and 200,000 deaths caused by norovirus infection each year worldwide. In the U.S., norovirus infection causes over 2 million outpatient clinical visits annually and approximately 100,000 hospitalizations. Norovirus prevention and/or therapy is particularly relevant for the military, where a pathogen of that nature can result in significant operational risks. There are multiple military installations, for instance on navy vessels, where norovirus could spread rapidly and possibly hinder combat readiness. Due to this, work on CDI-988 may qualify for various military-sponsored grants or other funding mechanisms, however we are unaware of any specifics at this point.

CDI-988 was developed using Cocrystal’s proprietary drug discovery platform technology. It binds to a highly conserved region in the active site of noroviruses and coronaviruses 3CL viral proteases and exhibits pan-viral activity against pandemic norovirus and coronavirus strains.

Phase 2a Trial of CC-42344 Extended

In December 2024, Cocrystal announced that the Phase 2a clinical trial of its oral PB2 inhibitor, CC-42344, will be extended due to unexpectedly low infection rates among trial participants that were challenged with a H3N2 influenza strain. The Phase 2a trial initiated in December 2023 and completed enrollment in May 2024 with 78 total participants. It is a single center study being conducted in the U.K. designed to test the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), antiviral activity, and clinical measurements of CC-42344.

The results of the trial showed that CC-42344 had a favorable safety and tolerability profile as no participants had serious adverse events or discontinued the trial due to drug-related adverse events, however due to the low infectivity rate the virology results were not interpretable. The company will be working with the contract research organization to amend the trial protocol to help ensure that there is a higher infectivity rate during the rest of the study. We anticipate updates from the company on the trial as warranted.

Background on CC-42344

CC-42344 is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of pandemic and seasonal strains of influenza A. It targets subunit PB2, which along with PA and PB1 forms the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This enzyme is essential for viral replication in cells by replicating the viral RNA segments and transcribing their genes, which makes it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. The following figure shows CC-42344 binding to the highly conserved active site of the PB2 protein in different influenza strains.

Binding to this conserved active site leads to broad-spectrum antiviral activity against multiple Influenza A strains, including both pandemic and seasonal strains. The following table shows the strains that CC-42344 is active against, which includes strains that are resistant to oseltamivir and baloxavir.

Financial Update

On August 14, 2025, Cocrystal announced financial results for the second quarter of 2025. As expected, the company did not report any revenues in the second quarter of 2025. R&D expenses in the second quarter of 2025 were $1.1 million, compared to $4.3 million in the second quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the timing of clinical trial costs. G&A expenses in the second quarter of 2025 were $1.0 million, compared to $1.1 million for the second quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in salaries and wages.

As of June 30, 2025, Cocrystal had approximately $4.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, which we estimate is enough to fund operations through the end of 2025. As of August 12, 2025, Cocrystal had approximately 10.3 million shares outstanding and, when factoring in stock options and warrants, a fully diluted share count of 11.0 million shares.

Conclusion

Following the successful Phase 1 SAD and MAD studies of CDI-988, we look forward to the results from the norovirus challenge study, which if the study is able to initiate in the fourth quarter of 2025 we anticipate in the first quarter of 2026. Next steps for the program will be dependent on the results obtained from that study, thus it could serve as a large inflection point for the company. With no changes to our model our valuation remains at $8 per share.

Musculoskeletal injuries, such as strains, sprains, fractures, and overuse injuries, are leading causes of limited duty or training restrictions among military personnel. Recovery from these injuries is multifaceted, requiring medical care, modified activity, rest, and an element that is often overlooked—nutrition.

According to Defense Health Agency–Public Health, more than 95% of active duty military personnel’s injuries are musculoskeletal and are the leading reason for military medical visits.

The most common type of musculoskeletal injury found in military health care records is cumulative microtrauma injury, often referred to as overuse injuries, said U.S. Army Maj. Shay Lopez, the Injury Prevention branch chief at DHA-PH.

“It is important for service members to allow injuries to heal completely before returning to duty,” said Lopez. “If an injury is not healed properly, there is an increased risk for another injury. Prior injury is one of strongest predictors for future injury.”

Developing an intentional recovery plan is a key step to returning to full duty.

“Service members need to modify their activities and follow an intentional recovery plan prior to returning to their full duties,” said Lopez.

An important element of the recovery plan is nutritional intervention, said Jennifer Meeks, DHA-PH nutritionist.

“Nutritional interventions will help the injury recovery process by supporting optimal healing,” said Meeks. “The faster a service member or athlete recovers from injury, the quicker they can return to duty or the training field. Optimal nutrition should be the focus to get back to preinjury performance after a musculoskeletal injury.”

Proactive nutrition before an injury focuses on performance nutrition, disease prevention, and immune system enhancement, said Meeks. Reactive nutrition is specific to medical nutrition therapy after injury to control inflammation, rebuild injured tissue, minimize muscle loss, and prevent unwanted weight gain.

“Even if your preinjury eating habits weren’t perfect, a focus on making more healthful choices during your recovery can have tremendous benefits,” said Meeks.

Here are some tips to consider.

1. Energy needs during recovery: During your recovery time, your activity levels will be lower than usual. Even if you're not as active, you still need enough calories to help your body heal from wounds and injuries. Not getting enough food can delay your healing, drain your energy, and lead to unwanted loss of weight or muscle. To learn how many calories you need, experts can measure your resting metabolism or estimate calorie needs using special formulas. Your body needs fuel to heal, but you may not need as many calories as you normally would. If you need to cut back on calories, focus on reducing carbohydrates and fats, but make sure you still eat enough protein to help your body repair itself. You might need to adjust what and how much you eat over time to avoid gaining weight. Talking to a sports dietitian can help you figure out the right number of calories and create a personalized eating plan that includes the right balance of protein, fat, and carbs.

2. Protein: The cornerstone of healing: There are numerous academic studies highlighting the importance of protein for muscle repair, immune defense, and maintaining lean mass. The Joint Service regulation, Nutrition and Menu Standards for Human Performance Optimization, recommends 0.8 to 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram (or 0.36 to 0.73 grams of protein per pound of body weight) of body weight for normal activity. This equates to a protein range of 68 to 136 grams per day for men and 55 to 110 grams per day for women.

How much protein do you need when injured?

When you're injured, it's recommended to eat more protein–about 1.5 to 2 grams of protein for every kilogram you weigh each day. The exact amount varies from person to person and depends on your activity level. Studies show that eating an increased amount of protein helps you recover faster. For example, someone who weighs 180 pounds (about 81 kilograms) would need around 122–163 grams of protein per day.

It's best to spread your protein intake throughout the day, eating some at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and in snacks. This helps your muscles rebuild. For a 180-pound person, aim for about 30 grams of protein at each meal and 15–20 grams in snacks. For example, 30 grams of protein equals 1.5 cups of Greek yogurt, 1 cup of cottage cheese, 5 large eggs, 5 ounces of salmon, a scoop of third-party certified protein powder in a smoothie, 1.5 cups of lentils, or 4 ounces of chicken breast. Some meal ideas might be a Greek yogurt parfait with berries, a bean and veggie burrito, egg muffin cups with chopped veggies, or salmon with avocado toast. To boost your protein intake, try some of these easy tips:

• Start your day with meals featuring eggs, yogurt, or cottage cheese to kickstart your protein intake early.

• Choose high-protein snacks to keep you full between meals: Options include raw nuts, yogurt, boiled eggs, or cheese.

• Add legumes to your meals: Whether it's a soup, stew, or salad, throwing in beans, lentils, or chickpeas can significantly increase the protein content.

• Swap out traditional carbs for high-protein alternatives: Replace rice or pasta with options like quinoa or legumes to add more protein to your plate.

• Sprinkle on seeds or nuts: Toppings like chia seeds, flaxseeds, or raw nuts not only enhance flavor but also provide a solid protein boost along with healthy fats.

It's also a good idea to have 15–30 grams of protein after rehab or therapy to help your muscles recover. Good options include chocolate milk, a turkey sandwich on whole grain bread, or a recovery shake.

3. Eat colorful fruits & veggies to help heal: Eating fruits and vegetables packed with antioxidants can help reduce swelling, control inflammation, and speed up your recovery. Great choices include goji berries, blueberries, tart cherries, dark chocolate, pecans, artichokes, kidney beans, cranberries, blackberries, and green tea. Pineapple, turmeric, garlic, and ginger are also good sources.

Vitamin C, zinc, calcium, and vitamin D are key nutrients for healing. While all nutrients are important, vitamin C and zinc are superstars for healing. Vitamin C helps your body make collagen, a protein needed to repair tendons, ligaments, and surgical wounds. You can find vitamin C in citrus fruits, strawberries, kiwi, baked potatoes, broccoli, and bell peppers. Zinc helps with cell growth and wound healing. Good sources of zinc include meat, fish, poultry, dairy, whole grains, fortified bread and cereals, beans, peas, nuts, and seeds.

Calcium and vitamin D are essential for strong bones. You can get vitamin D from milk, yogurt, fortified soy milk, dark leafy greens, sunlight, or supplements. It's a good idea to check your vitamin D levels after an injury to see if you need to increase your intake.

4. Fats: friend, not foe: While some fats can contribute to inflammation, healthy fats are critical during recovery. Omega-3 fatty acids may increase muscle repairs and prevent muscle loss during a time of recovery.

• Prioritize omega-3 fatty acids in your diet for their anti-inflammatory properties. Foods high in omega-3 fatty acids include salmon, walnuts, flaxseed, chia, olive oil, avocados, fish, nuts, and seeds.

• Limit excessive omega-6 fats (found in fried or processed foods) that may worsen inflammation.

5. Skip the alcohol and stay hydrated: While you’re recovering from an injury, it's best to avoid alcohol because it can slow down the healing process. Alcohol can interfere with muscle repair, wound healing, and can even lead to muscle loss.

Staying hydrated is also crucial for recovery. Dehydration can hinder healing, reduce the delivery of nutrients to your body, and make you feel more tired. Men should aim for 96–144 ounces of water per day (12–18 cups), and women should aim for 64–96 ounces (8–12 cups). Keep in mind that these amounts can vary depending on the environment, your activity level, and other factors. To make hydration more enjoyable, try adding fruit to create infused water, or opt for flavored sparkling water.

6. Supplements: use with caution: Some supplements may support healing. Consult with a registered dietitian and check out the resources on the Operation Supplement Safety webpage to find more information. Here are two supplements that may be helpful to consider:

• Creatine monohydrate: May help preserve muscle mass during immobilization.

• Vitamin D: Supplement if levels are low, especially in indoor or northern duty stations.

Only use supplements certified by third-party testing programs. Look for these seals: BSCG Certified Drug Free, Informed Sport, NSF Certified Sport, and USP Verified.

Getting back on your feet after a musculoskeletal injury isn't just about rest and rehab—it's also about eating right. Service members need to focus on their nutrition to shorten recovery time, stay ready for duty, and get back to full strength.

Nutrition is key to healing and rehabilitation. Following practical eating guidelines can help reduce problems after surgery and minimize muscle loss during recovery. Whether you're recovering from a stress fracture or surgery, what you eat can help you heal faster and stronger.

For personalized advice, reach out to a registered dietitian at your military hospital or clinic, or your local Armed Forces Wellness Center for assistance.

Knowing when to use your medical or dental coverage helps avoid unnecessary costs or delays in care.

“When you need dental care because of an injury, it may be covered under your TRICARE medical plan,” said Douglas Elsesser, TRICARE Dental Program Analyst at the Defense Health Agency. “But this is only if it’s tied to a medical condition and pre-authorized. Knowing the difference can save you time and money.”

Here’s what you should know.

When is dental care considered “medical”?

In some cases, TRICARE medical coverage includes limited dental care known as adjunctive dental care. Adjunctive dental care is treatment you need to support a covered medical condition, injury, or disease. This is different from routine or restorative dental work. Routine and restorative dental work are covered separately under the TRICARE Dental Program, TRICARE Active Duty Dental Program, or other dental insurance.

Here are some examples of adjunctive dental care that TRICARE may cover:

You break your jaw and a dentist removes a tooth to stabilize the fracture.

You need surgery to remove tooth fragments embedded in your tongue after an accident.

You need a restoration—like a crown or bridge—to replace a tooth lost during treatment of a medical condition.

Note: TRICARE requires pre-authorization for any adjunctive dental care unless it's a medical emergency. Make sure your provider submits a request before you receive care. However, if you simply crack your tooth, TRICARE medical plans won’t cover repairing or replacing it.

What is the TRICARE Dental Program?

The TDP is a separate, premium-based dental plan available to active duty family members, National Guard and Reserve members, and their family members. As described in the TRICARE Dental Program Handbook, it covers services like:

Checkups and cleanings

Fillings and crowns

Oral surgery and tooth extractions

Sealants and preventive care

Orthodontics, in some cases

You can find more details in the TRICARE Dental Program Handbook, which outlines which restorative services are covered and which aren’t.

Note: TDP doesn’t cover adjunctive dental care. When you need a dental procedure to treat a medical condition, it falls under your TRICARE medical plan instead—but make sure to get pre-authorization.

Coverage scenarios

Generally, when the care supports a covered medical problem or injury, it qualifies as adjunctive dental care under medical. Otherwise, it falls under dental.

Scenario Type of Coverage Routine tooth cleaning or filling Dental Root canal due to infection Dental Braces for cosmetic reasons Dental Tooth removal after facial trauma Medical—with pre-authorization Surgery for a jaw fracture Medical—with pre-authorization Removal of tooth fragments from soft tissue Medical—with pre-authorization

Know before you go

For military service members, veterans, and their families, finding specialized and accessible addiction and mental health treatment can feel like a mission with a complex set of orders. You've served our nation with honor, and now it's time to find a program that serves you and your loved ones with the same dedication and understanding. In the vast and vibrant landscape of Orange County, California, numerous treatment centers provide world-class care, but the process of navigating insurance—especially Tricare West and its partner, TriWest Healthcare Alliance—is a critical first step. This comprehensive guide, forged from decades of experience in the field, will cut through the confusion, providing a clear and compassionate roadmap to finding the right rehab that accepts Tricare West and ensuring you get the comprehensive, people-first care you've earned.

The journey to recovery is deeply personal and requires a treatment plan as unique as your own experience. It's not about a one-size-fits-all solution; it's about finding a facility that understands the specific challenges faced by military families, from combat-related trauma and PTSD to the stresses of deployment, relocation, and reintegration. Our goal here is to empower you with the knowledge to make an informed decision, leading to a long-lasting, successful recovery. We'll delve into the intricacies of coverage, the types of programs available, and the essential questions to ask, all while demonstrating the core principles of E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness).

Understanding the Foundation: Tricare West and TriWest Healthcare Alliance

One of the most common points of confusion for those seeking care is the distinction between Tricare West and TriWest Healthcare Alliance. Understanding this relationship is foundational to finding a treatment center that can work seamlessly with your benefits. Think of it as a crucial chain of command for your healthcare.

Tricare West is the actual health insurance program. As a component of the broader Tricare system—the healthcare program of the U.S. Department of Defense—it provides comprehensive health coverage for active-duty and retired military personnel, their families, and other eligible beneficiaries in the western United States, which includes all of California. It is your benefit, the promise of care.

TriWest Healthcare Alliance is the private company contracted by the Department of Defense to manage and administer Tricare's healthcare services in the West Region. When you're searching for a provider, you are essentially looking for a facility that is ""in-network"" with or ""authorized by"" TriWest Healthcare Alliance, as they are the administrative bridge that connects you to the Tricare benefits you've earned. They are the logistics arm, ensuring smooth operations.

In short: Tricare West is your insurance. TriWest Healthcare Alliance is the administrator that connects you to the care. They are the gatekeepers to the network of civilian providers.

The Scope of Coverage: A Full Spectrum of Care

The great news is that Tricare West offers robust, comprehensive coverage for addiction and mental health treatment. This isn't a basic, bare-bones benefit; it's designed to provide a full spectrum of care, from initial crisis intervention and medical detox to long-term aftercare and relapse prevention. The core principle is that if a treatment is medically necessary and provided by an authorized, in-network provider, it is covered. This includes a wide array of services that address not just the physical aspect of addiction but the psychological and emotional components as well.

Finding the Right Fit: A Step-by-Step Guide to a Successful Search

Your search for a Tricare West drug rehab center in Orange County should be methodical and purpose-driven. Simply finding a list of centers isn't enough; you need to find the right facility that aligns with your specific and deeply personal needs. This process requires a bit of introspection and a lot of due diligence.

Step 1: Deeply Understand Your Unique Needs

Before you even start looking at websites or making phone calls, ask yourself some crucial, honest questions:

What is the primary substance or issue? Are you seeking outpatient alcohol rehab programs Tricare West Orange County or treatment for a different substance? Are you dealing with a substance use disorder that is intertwined with a trauma history? Be specific. The more you know, the better you can find a tailored program.

What level of care do you truly need? This is perhaps the most important question. Choosing the wrong level of care can be a setback.

Inpatient/Residential Treatment: This is a live-in program where you receive 24/7 care in a structured, therapeutic environment. It is the highest level of care and is ideal for severe addiction, those with unstable living situations, or individuals with significant co-occurring mental health disorders. If this is your need, you'd be looking for a TriWest Healthcare Alliance inpatient treatment facility in Orange County.

Partial Hospitalization Programs (PHP): A step down from residential care, PHP offers intensive daily treatment (often 5-6 hours a day, 5 days a week) while allowing you to return home at night. It provides a bridge between residential and less intensive care.

Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOP) & Outpatient Programs (OP): These provide the most flexibility, allowing you to live at home and maintain work or family responsibilities while attending therapy sessions multiple times a week. This is where you would find outpatient rehab programs accepting TriWest Healthcare Alliance in Orange County. These are perfect for those with a strong support system at home and less severe addiction.

Are there co-occurring mental health conditions? This is a critical factor, especially for military personnel and veterans. Many people, particularly those with combat or service-related trauma, struggle with dual diagnosis treatment Tricare West Orange County. This means treating both addiction and an underlying mental health disorder like PTSD, depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder. A quality program must be equipped to handle both simultaneously, as treating only one without the other significantly increases the risk of relapse.

A Deeper Look at the Types of Treatment Covered by Tricare West

The scope of services covered is impressively broad, ensuring a complete and integrated path to recovery. This reflects a deep understanding of the complexity of addiction and mental health.

Comprehensive Detoxification Services

The first and most critical step for most individuals is medical detox. A Tricare West detox center in Orange County provides a medically supervised environment where the body is safely and comfortably cleared of substances. This is a vital stage, as withdrawal can be dangerous and extremely uncomfortable without professional medical oversight. Tricare West covers both inpatient and outpatient detox services when they are deemed medically necessary by a qualified professional. A reputable center will not only manage the physical symptoms but also provide comfort and psychological support during this vulnerable time.

The Power of Residential and Inpatient Care

This level of care is the most intensive and offers a structured, supportive environment away from the triggers of daily life. An inpatient rehab covered by Tricare West near Orange County typically includes a holistic suite of services:

Individual Therapy: One-on-one sessions with a licensed therapist to address the root causes of addiction, including past trauma, unresolved grief, and negative coping mechanisms.

Group Therapy: These sessions are professionally facilitated and build a vital sense of community. They provide a safe space for shared understanding, accountability, and peer support.

Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT): The use of FDA-approved medications combined with counseling and behavioral therapies is a powerful, evidence-based approach for opioid and alcohol use disorders, and Tricare West fully supports it. This is not a crutch, but a proven tool that dramatically improves outcomes.

Specialized Therapies: Look for centers that offer modalities like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) for trauma, and other evidence-based practices.

Holistic and Wellness Programs: Many top-tier centers include yoga, mindfulness, art therapy, and nutritional counseling to heal the mind, body, and spirit.

Flexibility and Community: Outpatient and Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOP)

For those who have completed a higher level of care or have a less severe condition, outpatient programs offer a crucial bridge to long-term recovery. Tricare West covers both standard and intensive outpatient programs. The key here is finding a program with a structured curriculum, a robust aftercare plan, and a blend of individual, group, and family therapy. These programs allow you to re-integrate into your daily life while still receiving consistent, professional support.

Specialty Programs for Military and Veterans

Given the unique population it serves, it's vital to find a facility that understands military culture and the specific traumas associated with service. Look for programs that specialize in treating:

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): Many veterans and military members use substances to self-medicate the crippling symptoms of PTSD. A comprehensive program will offer trauma-informed care and therapies designed to address the underlying trauma, such as EMDR or Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT).

Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI): TBI can often co-occur with substance use and requires a specialized, neuro-informed approach.

Family & Dependent Programs: The stress of military life impacts the entire family unit. Does TriWest Healthcare Alliance cover addiction treatment for military dependents? The answer is a resounding yes. Finding a program that offers family therapy is a crucial part of the healing process for everyone involved, addressing issues of codependency, communication breakdowns, and shared trauma.

The E-E-A-T Principle: Vetting Your Potential Provider

When you're searching for the perfect TriWest Healthcare Alliance mental health rehab in Orange County, you're looking for more than just a name on a list. You're looking for a facility that demonstrates Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T). This isn't just a buzzword; it's a measure of quality and reliability.

Experience: A clinic with a proven track record of successfully treating military members and veterans will have a deep understanding of your unique challenges. Ask about their history and their success rates.

Expertise: Look for a multidisciplinary team of licensed professionals, including doctors, psychiatrists, therapists, and certified addiction counselors. Ask about their specialized training in military-specific issues and their use of evidence-based therapies.

Authoritativeness: A reputable center will be accredited by a respected third-party organization like The Joint Commission or CARF (Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities). These accreditations are a gold standard for quality and safety.

Trustworthiness: Read testimonials and independent reviews on platforms like Google or Psychology Today. Call the facility and talk to an admissions specialist. Do they sound knowledgeable? Are they empathetic? Do they seem genuinely invested in your recovery, or are they simply trying to get you in the door? A trustworthy provider will be transparent about their program, staff credentials, and financial policies.

Verifying Your Benefits: The Crucial Next Step for Peace of Mind

After you've identified a few potential addiction treatment centers that accept Tricare West in Orange County, the next step is to verify your benefits. This is a simple but essential process that a reputable center's admissions team should be able to handle for you, free of charge.

Contact the Center's Admissions Team: Call the facility's admissions line. A human connection is always better than an online form.

Provide Your Information: They will need your name, date of birth, and your Tricare ID number. This allows them to access your benefit information.

Wait for Verification: Their team will contact TriWest Healthcare Alliance to verify your coverage, including your specific plan, co-pays, deductibles, and any pre-authorization requirements. This ensures you know exactly what to expect financially before you begin treatment, eliminating any unexpected costs.

Conclusion: A Path to Healing and Hope

The road to recovery is a testament to strength and resilience. For those who have served, it's an act of courage as profound as any on the battlefield. Finding the right residential rehab facilities that take Tricare West near Anaheim or anywhere else in Orange County is about finding a sanctuary where you can heal from the invisible wounds of service and addiction.

Remember, you don't have to navigate this alone. By understanding your Tricare West benefits and partnering with a trusted and experienced treatment center, you can successfully complete your mission to reclaim your life. The time for healing is now.

On August 4, Pugh won an Outstanding Research Accomplishment award at the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium for her TBI research. The award recognizes individual investigators who have recently made outstanding contributions to medical research via work funded by the Department of Defense. Pugh is one of only two investigators nationwide to receive this honor.

Pugh’s work revealed that TBI is associated with many long-term health consequences that were previously unknown, including dementia, substance use disorder, and even cardiovascular disease. TBI is also linked to higher risk of suicide and cancer. Uncovering these patterns of risk is a first step toward preemptive interventions to help veterans with TBI stay healthy.

Key to her work is Pugh’s ability to uncover patterns hidden within big data. Her work helped integrate health data between the VA and the Department of Defense—an essential step to understanding how TBI acquired during military service can impact health after someone leaves the military.

“This linkage is invaluable because it allows us to analyze long-term health outcomes while incorporating crucial details from military service—such as injury characteristics and blast exposures—that are missing from VA data alone,” Pugh says.

“This ‘gold mine’ of data has enabled rapid and critical surveillance of Military Occupational Blast Exposure (MOBE) from large weapons,” she adds, “which is vital because many service members with MOBE do not have a specific documented injury or diagnosis, which is essential to demonstrate service connection for disability claims.”

To spot new patterns within this data, Pugh uses a strategy called complexity theory. This method of data analysis allows her to disentangle the effects of concussion from other contributors to health, finding long-term health outcomes that other analyses don’t detect.

“This is a voluntary program and Network Directors retain authority to approve or disapprove of requests,” the DHA official said.","The Defense Health Agency is granting voluntary buyouts to certain employees on a job-by-job basis as the Trump administration’s large-scale government workforce reduction campaign plows on.

After approving more than 1,000 officials to exit through the Voluntary Early Retirement Agreement (VERA), Deferred Resignation Program (DRP) and other methods extended by the Defense Department to date, DHA leadership has “authorized Network Directors to offer the Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment or VSIP” options to interested personnel, an agency official told DefenseScoop on Monday.

DHA delivers health care for service members and their families and is a combat support agency. The organization manages the Military Health System and supports its infrastructure for DOD, and also steers a range of other research, training and modernization initiatives.

Notably, DHA has reported recent progress in its pursuits to strategically set the foundation for the integration, adoption and deployment of reliable artificial intelligence in military medicine. Last year, agency officials produced an inventory of AI use cases, new planning guidance and a digital health strategy. Among other activities, they also completed an exercise to identify potential vulnerabilities, biases and risks associated with emerging generative AI capabilities.

According to DHA’s official website, 130,000-plus staff members operate more than 700 facilities worldwide.

At the beginning of his second term, President Donald Trump launched a disruptive initiative known as DOGE, to uncover “waste, fraud and abuse” across the federal government and slash some spending and staff positions to spur savings.

Per Trump’s directions, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth swiftly ordered a “strategic reduction” of 5-8% of DOD’s civilian personnel, through incentive opportunities such as DRP and VERA, and other means of cutting the workforce.

By early August, defense officials confirmed that roughly 55,000 applications had been approved for DRP across the department.

In an email to DefenseScoop on Monday, a DHA official said: “As of Aug. 8, 2025, 972 employees within all DHA-administered properties opted for the Deferred Resignation Program (both the [White House Office of Personnel Management] and DOD programs), and 49 persons opted for the Voluntary Early Retirement Agreement option.”

The agency also moved to authorize network directors the option to offer “the Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment or VSIP incentive as they deem necessary to shape their workforce to continue to provide safe, high-quality health care for our beneficiaries and sustain our critical readiness support mission,” they confirmed.

VSIPs essentially refer to specific financial incentives — typically in the form of lump-sum payments — that the federal government can present to encourage federal employees to make the choice to leave their positions, through retirement or resignation.

Pharmacy benefit managers serve as intermediaries between health plans, drug manufacturers, and pharmacies.
The practices of pharmacy benefit managers have been under scrutiny in recent years at both the state and federal levels.
Arkansas lawmakers enacted legislation in 2015 to regulate pharmacy benefit managers’ payments to pharmacies, and in 2020 the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the law.
On July 31, the Arkansas State Board of Pharmacy filed notice that it will appeal the order blocking Act 624.","A federal judge recently issued a preliminary injunction blocking enforcement of Arkansas Act 624 of 2025, a law that would have prohibited pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from owning or operating pharmacies in the state.

Pharmacy benefit managers serve as intermediaries between health plans, drug manufacturers, and pharmacies. When a person with prescription drug coverage fills a prescription, the PBM reimburses the pharmacy at a negotiated rate, and the insurer pays the PBM. Some PBMs, such as CVS, own their own pharmacies.

Supporters of Act 624 have said the law is needed because PBM ownership of pharmacies creates conflicts of interest, is anti-competitive, and can lead to higher prices for consumers. A group of PBMs and the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, which represents PBMs, is challenging the law, arguing it is unconstitutional. CVS

After a hearing on July 23, 2025, U.S. District Judge Brian Miller granted motions for a preliminary injunction blocking the law, which was set to take effect January 1, 2026. Miller found that the law would likely violate the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution by unfairly discriminating against the plaintiffs as out-of-state businesses and failing to show that this would be the only way to advance the state’s interest. The judge also found that the law would likely violate the Supremacy Clause by interfering with the ability of TRICARE, the federal health benefits program for military personnel and retirees, to contract with PBMs. Under the Supremacy Clause, state laws that interfere with or are contrary to federal laws are invalid, Miller noted.

The practices of pharmacy benefit managers have been under scrutiny in recent years at both the state and federal levels. Arkansas lawmakers enacted legislation in 2015 to regulate pharmacy benefit managers’ payments to pharmacies, and in 2020 the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the law. In June 2022, the Federal Trade Commission decided to launch an examination into the business practices of PBMs.

On July 31, the Arkansas State Board of Pharmacy filed notice that it will appeal the order blocking Act 624. Litigation will continue in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. Because Arkansas is the first state to enact a ban on ownership of pharmacies by PBMs, Act 624, if upheld, could serve as a model for other states seeking to rein in these prescription drug middlemen.",https://achi.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AdobeStock_181683115.jpeg,N,0.0,2025-08-18 14:56:08.889984

Lt. Gen. Brian T. Kelly, USAF (Ret), urged lawmakers to ensure important servicemember- and military family-focused provisions remain intact as the FY 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) moves toward floor consideration. The letter was sent to every member of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees – panels that play a pivotal role in shaping defense policy.

[GET INVOLVED: Visit MOAA's Legislative Action Center]

The Aug. 12 letter came after both committees passed versions of the NDAA but before either chamber has taken floor action. This pre-floor period is a critical opportunity for lawmakers to add, amend, or protect provisions before the legislation advances to the next phase of the congressional process.

Kelly’s letter identifies several priority items from both the House and Senate committee-passed NDAA bills:

House

Presentation by a Veterans Service Organization (VSO) in Transition Assistance Program (TAP) Counseling: Supports transition by requiring approved VSO involvement to help navigate and access benefits.

Family Separation Allowance (FSA) Increase: Increases FSA to $400 per month, improving support for families while servicemembers are away from home in service of our country.

In her current dual roles, she faces the additional challenge of integrating DHA’s patient health care mission with the Army’s medical readiness mission.
She wants her two organizations to be focused on supporting their subordinate units, integrating solutions to optimize healthcare delivery and medical readiness, while avoiding confusion and frustration.
U.S. Army Col. James “Jimmy” Watts is the director of Madigan Army Medical Center at Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington, as well as the commander of the medical readiness unit there.","Military medicine in the Indo-Pacific region took a major leap forward during a strategic offsite conference August 11-13 as more than 80 leaders from the Defense Health Agency’s Defense Health Network Indo-Pacific and the Army’s Medical Readiness Command, Pacific met to establish a common governance framework. The resulting framework will help the two organizations combine the separate missions of health care and medical readiness into an integrated process, enhancing both access to health care for patients and medical readiness for soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines.

U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Deydre S. Teyhen used her extensive governance experience to lead the conference. She currently serves as the director of DHN IP, which oversees military medical facilities in Washington, California, Hawaii, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. She is also the commanding general of MRC, P, which provides command and control to medical department activities, medical centers, dental health commands, Public Health Command, Pacific, and soldier recovery units in Washington, Alaska, Hawaii, Japan, and the Republic of Korea.

Assuming both roles in April, she brought important lessons about governance from her previous assignment as the director of DHN National Capital Region, which treats the military community as well as the President of the United States, members of Congress, and the Supreme Court.

“We often focus on the 5W’s: who, what, when, where, and why—but in the NCR, we focused on the ‘how,’” said Teyhen as she departed the East Coast. “How we lead, how we build trust, and how we treat our people and patients. How is critical in leading the joy and soul back to medicine. Governance gave us the foundation to transform this network into an integrated healthcare system that focused on making it better for our patients and our staff.”

During Teyhen’s NCR tour, she saw governance help the network increase patient enrollment and access, expand virtual health, increase operating room utilization, and make many other improvements. In her current dual roles, she faces the additional challenge of integrating DHA’s patient health care mission with the Army’s medical readiness mission. As the leader of two staffs in different agencies, she saw the need to bring them together by creating a shared mission, vision and values. Teyhen also knew that two separate processes would create confusion and inefficiencies, which could be alleviated by a shared governance model.

“We aim to adopt an integrated approach, ensuring unifying governance and decisions within MRC, P, and DHN IP, while also promoting empowered leaders who drive effectiveness and efficiency,” stated Teyhen.

She wants her two organizations to be focused on supporting their subordinate units, integrating solutions to optimize healthcare delivery and medical readiness, while avoiding confusion and frustration.

Teyhen also noted there is record burnout in both the military and civilian healthcare systems. Reducing the burden on healthcare providers is critical to providing quality health care for patients, and increasing efficiency and standardization can help.

To assist with creating a combined governance model for DHN-IP and MRC, P, Teyhen brought in an expert team from DHN NCR to facilitate the strategic offsite, led by John Gardner, DHN NCR’s assistant director for network operations.

According to Gardner, governance is “a structured framework of roles, processes, and mechanisms that empowers leaders to set direction, establish priorities, and drive effective change. It ensures accountability, effectively manages risk, and aligns actions with strategic goals, enabling agility.”

Many of the world’s largest and most effective organizations utilize a governance model, said Gardner, including Apple, Microsoft and premiere healthcare systems like Johns Hopkins, Cleveland Clinic and the Mayo Clinic. Yet, some people are hesitant to embrace governance, and misconceptions persist. For instance, some think “governance” means an increase in bureaucracy, more meetings, wasted time, and decreased flexibility.

“The truth is just the opposite,” said Gardner. Governance increases efficiency and clarifies responsibilities. At NCR, governance reduced more than 130 meetings to just a few. It can help align priorities and share best practices, uphold common standards of care, and build trust among stakeholders, including patients and providers.

Some people look at governance as an opportunity. U.S. Army Col. James “Jimmy” Watts is the director of Madigan Army Medical Center at Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington, as well as the commander of the medical readiness unit there. According to Watts, prior to the offsite he “was optimistic about the opportunity to align and integrate the efforts of both organizations into a cohesive and coherent effort.”

During the three-day offsite, Gardner’s team instructed attendees about the need for governance and guiding principles, then led them through case studies to illustrate how effective governance can prevent or solve problems. For instance, in one case study, the business resources division in a fictional health system reduced funding for environmental services staff without consulting clinical leaders, which resulted in increased infection rates in the hospital and tension between the business and clinical teams. In another example, unclear appointing and booking protocols led to miscommunication between medical offices, causing a cancer patient to hang in administrative limbo and delaying his treatment.

Effective governance could have prevented both by creating processes for different offices to coordinate prior to making decisions that could affect others. In another example, governance would have provided standardization for medical carts, which would have helped a nurse find correct medication in a timely manner after she moved from one hospital to another.

Gardner’s team also led offsite participants as they developed the committees that form the foundation of the governance structure. With representation from medical, dental, veterinary, public health, human resources, business resources, and senior enlisted leaders, they developed a Board of Directors, which oversees a Medical Affairs Committee, Network Regional Operations Committee, Resource Management Committee, and Senior Enlisted Leader Committee. Each of those committees will ultimately be supported by multiple councils, working groups and sprint team. For instance, the MAC will include a council of nurses, and the RMC will include a human resources council.

Teyhen emphasized throughout the process that collaboration is key. In each committee, there are voting members from DHN IP and MRC, P as well as each of the network’s major medical facilities and the readiness command’s direct reporting units.

With the committees established, participants next determined each committee’s authorities and responsibilities as well as voting and non-voting members. Finally, the committees developed proposed priorities for the next few months.

With proposed priorities scribbled on paper on the wall, Gardner allowed all the participants to vote on initial priorities, such as operating room optimization and standardization of medical services across facilities, before leading the participants through the first Board of Directors meeting where the board approved the proposed authorities, membership team and initial priorities.

“The next step is to put this in motion,” said Gardner. “There is a lot of work to do and a lot to figure out, but I’m happy to help you put this into effect.”

Watts is optimistic that the new governance structure will be beneficial. “I believe the conference was positively reinforcing, because we have taken concrete steps towards hardwiring critical organizational processes,” said Watts. “This will increase information and knowledge sharing, as well as decision transparency.” He also believes “the newly established governance system will help MAMC streamline its headquarters and organizational structure.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9260343.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-18 15:56:31.448642

Teyhen also noted there is record burnout in both the military and civilian healthcare systems. Reducing the burden on healthcare providers is critical to providing quality health care for patients, and increasing efficiency and standardization can help.

To assist with creating a combined governance model for DHN-IP and MRC, P, Teyhen brought in an expert team from DHN NCR to facilitate the strategic offsite, led by John Gardner, DHN NCR’s assistant director for network operations.

According to Gardner, governance is “a structured framework of roles, processes, and mechanisms that empowers leaders to set direction, establish priorities, and drive effective change. It ensures accountability, effectively manages risk, and aligns actions with strategic goals, enabling agility.”

Many of the world’s largest and most effective organizations utilize a governance model, said Gardner, including Apple, Microsoft and premiere healthcare systems like Johns Hopkins, Cleveland Clinic and the Mayo Clinic. Yet, some people are hesitant to embrace governance, and misconceptions persist. For instance, some think “governance” means an increase in bureaucracy, more meetings, wasted time, and decreased flexibility.

“The truth is just the opposite,” said Gardner. Governance increases efficiency and clarifies responsibilities. At NCR, governance reduced more than 130 meetings to just a few. It can help align priorities and share best practices, uphold common standards of care, and build trust among stakeholders, including patients and providers.

Some people look at governance as an opportunity. U.S. Army Col. James “Jimmy” Watts is the director of Madigan Army Medical Center at Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington, as well as the commander of the medical readiness unit there. According to Watts, prior to the offsite he “was optimistic about the opportunity to align and integrate the efforts of both organizations into a cohesive and coherent effort.”

During the three-day offsite, Gardner’s team instructed attendees about the need for governance and guiding principles, then led them through case studies to illustrate how effective governance can prevent or solve problems. For instance, in one case study, the business resources division in a fictional health system reduced funding for environmental services staff without consulting clinical leaders, which resulted in increased infection rates in the hospital and tension between the business and clinical teams. In another example, unclear appointing and booking protocols led to miscommunication between medical offices, causing a cancer patient to hang in administrative limbo and delaying his treatment.

Effective governance could have prevented both by creating processes for different offices to coordinate prior to making decisions that could affect others. In another example, governance would have provided standardization for medical carts, which would have helped a nurse find correct medication in a timely manner after she moved from one hospital to another.

Gardner’s team also led offsite participants as they developed the committees that form the foundation of the governance structure. With representation from medical, dental, veterinary, public health, human resources, business resources, and senior enlisted leaders, they developed a Board of Directors, which oversees a Medical Affairs Committee, Network Regional Operations Committee, Resource Management Committee, and Senior Enlisted Leader Committee. Each of those committees will ultimately be supported by multiple councils, working groups and sprint team. For instance, the MAC will include a council of nurses, and the RMC will include a human resources council.

Teyhen emphasized throughout the process that collaboration is key. In each committee, there are voting members from DHN IP and MRC, P as well as each of the network’s major medical facilities and the readiness command’s direct reporting units.

With the committees established, participants next determined each committee’s authorities and responsibilities as well as voting and non-voting members. Finally, the committees developed proposed priorities for the next few months.

With proposed priorities scribbled on paper on the wall, Gardner allowed all the participants to vote on initial priorities, such as operating room optimization and standardization of medical services across facilities, before leading the participants through the first Board of Directors meeting where the board approved the proposed authorities, membership team and initial priorities.

“The next step is to put this in motion,” said Gardner. “There is a lot of work to do and a lot to figure out, but I’m happy to help you put this into effect.”

Watts is optimistic that the new governance structure will be beneficial. “I believe the conference was positively reinforcing, because we have taken concrete steps towards hardwiring critical organizational processes,” said Watts. “This will increase information and knowledge sharing, as well as decision transparency.” He also believes “the newly established governance system will help MAMC streamline its headquarters and organizational structure.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2508/9260343/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-18 13:56:09.937619

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator: https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/find-pharmacy

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.
