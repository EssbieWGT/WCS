We live on base right now and use the base pharmacy for most of my meds.
The base pharmacy here is small and can’t always get my meds quickly so it’s just easier to go off base.
On a side note…needing medical care is not being a “leech”.
You, like everyone else, deserves proper medical care.","There are 2 main levels of tricare: prime and select.

Prime: free if overseas, minimal cost if stateside (someone correct me if I'm wrong). You don't everything through your pcp and need a referral for everything. That can get super annoying/frustrating. The tradeoff is no co-pays ever.

Select: you never need a referral, but there are co-pays. If living stateside, but remote, this is the better option.

As far as diabetic supplies, when I had gestational diabetes, they didn't cover the cost of my glucometer since it's an iver the counter thing, but reading their website, they should cover a cgm if necessary. I also had a copay on insulin and supplies to check my levels. I have select, so that may have been part of the reason.

Tricare is really cheap for insurance (we pay less than $300/months for a family of 5) and the coverage is great for the price. I have never had anything denied that was medically necessary, but i have had it take forever to get approved. I have had to fight to get the doctors I wanted, but they've always been approved in the end. Sometimes you have to do the work for tricare because they dont always update their database of doctors. I was assigned a doctor once that had retired 2 years earlier.

Vision and dental are separate, but still super cheap.

I’m a very high utilizer and can tell you that tricare prime, as long as you have the right referrals and documentation, covers absolutely almost everything and costs us $0 as long as my husband is active duty. Prescriptions filled off base but still within network costs $16. I was medically retired before I married my husband (who is still active duty) and had tricare select. I had a $3000 catastrophic cap and I hit that every year due to my chronic illness.

I am also a type 1 diabetic and 100% of my supplies are available on base, through the pharmacy, with zero cost to me. If you use Express Scripts, the mail order, then there is usually a copay. The only limits when it comes to covered meds is that anything identified as a maintenance medication(diabetic supplies are) is required to be filled on base or through mail order or you have to pay a higher copay. We live on base right now and use the base pharmacy for most of my meds. Our last base I used express scrips.

As I mentioned, I’m a very high utilizer due to my chronic illness and I am in palliative care. I have a large amount of medical supplies and specialty medications that are all fully covered. I do pay a copay for my palliative meds because they’re filled through a local specialty pharmacy. The base pharmacy here is small and can’t always get my meds quickly so it’s just easier to go off base. My medical supplies for my port, tube feeding, IV, etc is all covered 100%. I have a home nurse and aides that are all paid by tricare. My specialists are all covered as long as they’re in network and I’ve never had a hard time finding amazing doctors who take tricare.

Honestly, it sometimes takes some effort but ultimately everything we need has been covered. It’s just about making sure you have the right paperwork and getting it pushed through.

As someone else said, you will also need to enroll in EFMP. It’s a program to insure your spouse isn’t sent to a base that won’t have proper services for you. In your case, needing an endocrinologist will be the requirement so it shouldn’t be a huge issue getting assignments. EFMP is not optional and you do have to enroll but it’s for your benefit.

On a side note…needing medical care is not being a “leech”. Having a chronic illness isn’t a moral failing. You, like everyone else, deserves proper medical care.

If you or anyone else have any questions then I’m absolutely happy to answer from my experience. I’ve been using tricare for my medical care almost my entire life and got sick while I was active duty myself so I’m well versed in what care is available. I’m very lucky to have this and always want to make sure others get the proper care they need too.",,N,0.0,2025-07-05 18:56:19.989413

Yes, Tricare covers HRT which includes TRT with some exclusions. See your Primary Care Manager for a referral if you have Prime. If you have Select you can go to a Specialist without a referral. It depends on how the Specialist decides you need care. If your problem falls under the issues included in the things that are covered then yes, Tricare pays.If its not, they won't. This is determined when the doctor bills Tricare. Now, when they ask for preauthorization, they will send in a request, permission to perform this thing.

-- Ona Treatment Center, a premier inpatient treatment facility in Yuba County, Northern California, is now accepting TRICARE insurance for active-duty military personnel seeking alcohol rehabilitation services. This development makes essential inpatient and outpatient treatment options more accessible to service members who need specialized care for alcohol use disorders.

More information is available at https://onatreatmentcenter.com/tricare-approved-alcohol-rehab-facility/

A spokesperson for the facility explained that choosing a TRICARE-approved rehabilitation facility offers significant advantages for military members and their families. ""The level of coverage it gives reduces the financial burden of alcohol rehabilitation, which is often a long-term process if one is after lasting results.""

""And by choosing Ona Treatment Center, enlisted personnel are assured that they will receive the highest quality, evidence-based care that follows established medical protocols,"" they added.

The facility spokesperson further stated that increasing military access to alcohol rehab services is paramount, as active-duty personnel are prone to alcohol abuse. This was reported by the US Army itself in a 2023 post, which found that 22% of service members reported being engaged in “hazardous or heavy drinking”, with related symptoms such as sleep disorders being identified.

Ona Treatment Center implements a clinical program that adheres to guidelines established by the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM), which emphasizes treatment plans tailored to the individual's needs and regularly adjusted.

ASAM-based treatment plans include both detoxification services and a 28-day dual-diagnosis residential treatment program, which addresses both substance use disorders and co-occurring mental health conditions simultaneously. This integrated approach equips clients with necessary skills for long-term recovery from alcohol and substance use disorders.

The dual-diagnosis treatment model recognizes that many individuals struggling with alcohol use also experience mental health challenges that require concurrent treatment. By addressing both aspects, Ona Treatment Center provides a more comprehensive path to recovery that addresses multiple addiction factors and issues.

Ona Treatment Center's location also aids in the recovery of military personnel. The facility is on a 250-sqm secluded property close to nature, which makes it conducive for counseling, meditation, group therapy, and other activities that assist in recovery.

-- Addiction Resource Center (ARC) is proud to announce the launch of its TRICARE-approved Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) in Yuba City, specifically designed to support active duty military personnel struggling with alcohol use disorders. This program offers evidence-based care tailored to meet the unique demands of military life—allowing service members to maintain responsibilities while actively engaging in treatment and recovery.

Further details can be found at https://sayarc.com/services/tricare-approved-iop/

Alcohol misuse remains a serious concern within the military community. According to a report from the U.S. Department of Defense, nearly one in three active-duty service members were classified as engaging in hazardous drinking or possible alcohol use disorder in recent years. The pressures of deployment, reintegration, trauma, and military culture can all contribute to increased alcohol consumption—and effective, accessible care is essential to long-term recovery.

ARC’s TRICARE-approved IOP addresses this need with a flexible and clinically robust treatment structure. Clients typically attend 3 to 5 sessions per week, including individual counseling, group therapy, and educational workshops. Sessions are scheduled around work shifts, family commitments, and duty rosters, ensuring that service members can participate in treatment without compromising their roles in their units or homes.

“Our goal is to make high-quality, culturally competent care available to those who serve,” said a spokesperson for Addiction Resource Center. “We understand the challenges faced by military personnel—whether it’s the stigma of asking for help, the unpredictability of schedules, or the weight of unseen trauma. That’s why we’ve created a program that is flexible, supportive, and directly aligned with their lived experience.”

ARC’s IOP is rooted in evidence-based treatment methods proven to support long-term sobriety and relapse prevention. The program includes trauma-informed care, PTSD support, and military-focused therapy facilitated by clinicians who have experience working with service members.

In addition to clinical services, ARC offers family support, recognizing that successful recovery often involves strengthening the home environment and support systems around the client.

One of the key benefits of this program is TRICARE coverage, which means that active duty members, veterans, and their families may access care with no out-of-pocket costs. ARC staff assist with benefit verification and provide a smooth admissions process to minimize barriers to entry.

This development makes essential inpatient and outpatient treatment options more accessible to service members who need specialized care for alcohol use disorders.

More information is available at https://onatreatmentcenter.com/tricare-approved-alcohol-rehab-facility/

A spokesperson for the facility explained that choosing a TRICARE-approved rehabilitation facility offers significant advantages for military members and their families. ""The level of coverage it gives reduces the financial burden of alcohol rehabilitation, which is often a long-term process if one is after lasting results.""

""And by choosing Ona Treatment Center, enlisted personnel are assured that they will receive the highest quality, evidence-based care that follows established medical protocols,"" they added.

The facility spokesperson further stated that increasing military access to alcohol rehab services is paramount, as active-duty personnel are prone to alcohol abuse. This was reported by the US Army itself in a 2023 post, which found that 22% of service members reported being engaged in “hazardous or heavy drinking”, with related symptoms such as sleep disorders being identified.

Ona Treatment Center implements a clinical program that adheres to guidelines established by the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM), which emphasizes treatment plans tailored to the individual's needs and regularly adjusted.

ASAM-based treatment plans include both detoxification services and a 28-day dual-diagnosis residential treatment program, which addresses both substance use disorders and co-occurring mental health conditions simultaneously. This integrated approach equips clients with necessary skills for long-term recovery from alcohol and substance use disorders.

The dual-diagnosis treatment model recognizes that many individuals struggling with alcohol use also experience mental health challenges that require concurrent treatment. By addressing both aspects, Ona Treatment Center provides a more comprehensive path to recovery that addresses multiple addiction factors and issues.

Ona Treatment Center's location also aids in the recovery of military personnel. The facility is on a 250-sqm secluded property close to nature, which makes it conducive for counseling, meditation, group therapy, and other activities that assist in recovery.

-- Addiction Resource Center (ARC) is proud to announce the launch of its TRICARE-approved Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) in Yuba City, specifically designed to support active duty military personnel struggling with alcohol use disorders. This program offers evidence-based care tailored to meet the unique demands of military life—allowing service members to maintain responsibilities while actively engaging in treatment and recovery.

Further details can be found at https://sayarc.com/services/tricare-approved-iop/

Alcohol misuse remains a serious concern within the military community. According to a report from the U.S. Department of Defense, nearly one in three active-duty service members were classified as engaging in hazardous drinking or possible alcohol use disorder in recent years. The pressures of deployment, reintegration, trauma, and military culture can all contribute to increased alcohol consumption—and effective, accessible care is essential to long-term recovery.

ARC’s TRICARE-approved IOP addresses this need with a flexible and clinically robust treatment structure. Clients typically attend 3 to 5 sessions per week, including individual counseling, group therapy, and educational workshops. Sessions are scheduled around work shifts, family commitments, and duty rosters, ensuring that service members can participate in treatment without compromising their roles in their units or homes.

“Our goal is to make high-quality, culturally competent care available to those who serve,” said a spokesperson for Addiction Resource Center. “We understand the challenges faced by military personnel—whether it’s the stigma of asking for help, the unpredictability of schedules, or the weight of unseen trauma. That’s why we’ve created a program that is flexible, supportive, and directly aligned with their lived experience.”

ARC’s IOP is rooted in evidence-based treatment methods proven to support long-term sobriety and relapse prevention. The program includes trauma-informed care, PTSD support, and military-focused therapy facilitated by clinicians who have experience working with service members.

In addition to clinical services, ARC offers family support, recognizing that successful recovery often involves strengthening the home environment and support systems around the client.

One of the key benefits of this program is TRICARE coverage, which means that active duty members, veterans, and their families may access care with no out-of-pocket costs. ARC staff assist with benefit verification and provide a smooth admissions process to minimize barriers to entry.

If you don't select the Prime option, you still can use any combination of benefits under Extra and Standard.

The following charts outline basic TRICARE costs by option and beneficiary category: Story by Douglas J. Gillert, American Forces Press Service","With TRICARE now up and running worldwide, every eligible DoD health care beneficiary has to answer one question: Which care option is right for me?

The DoD health plan offers three primary choices: Prime, Extra and Standard. Under these exist various other options, but your first choice has to be one of these three. If you're an active duty service member, you are automatically enrolled at no cost in TRICARE Prime. If you're an active duty family member, military retiree or retiree family member, you must enroll to get into Prime. If you don't select the Prime option, you still can use any combination of benefits under Extra and Standard. Neither requires enrollment.

Health care officials said you should consider carefully each option before deciding what's best for you. Factors to consider include costs, services available in your area and other health insurance programs you may already be enrolled in.

Here's an overview of each option:

TRICARE Prime

In this plan, most of your health care, including prescription medicine, comes from a military treatment facility, augmented by a local network of preferred providers. You'll be assigned to a primary care manager -- a physician or group of health care providers who supervise your care.

Your primary care manager will provide all nonemergency medical care and refer you to medical specialists as needed. Active duty family members also can enroll in Prime at no cost, and your copayments are lower than under the other two options. Eligible retirees and their families may enroll in Prime at a cost of $230 a year for one person or $460 for more than one.

Enrollment in Prime limits your choice of who will provide your health care. However, where Prime is available, it provides members distinct advantages of guaranteed appointments, away-from-home coverage and smaller fees per visit (no fee for active duty members) to authorized civilian providers than under Extra or Standard.

TRICARE Extra

You don't enroll in Extra. You have to pay CHAMPUS deductibles, and other CHAMPUS rules apply as well. You must select an authorized civilian network provider and make copayments for care received that equal 15 percent of the negotiated fee.

Advantages to Extra include no enrollment fee, no deductibles when you use the retail pharmacy network and no forms to file. On the downside, you have only a limited choice of providers and you pay deductibles and copayments. You may need a nonavailability statement from the military hospital nearest you before receiving inpatient care in a civilian hospital.

TRICARE Standard

Remember CHAMPUS? This is it, under a new name. CHAMPUS rules and costs apply. You don't enroll for Standard either. Treat the Extra and Standard options as interchangeable and use the one best for you in a given instance.

Standard's advantages are it gives you the broadest choice of providers and it's widely available. However, in addition to the CHAMPUS deductible and copayments, you will be charged for the balance of your medical bill if it exceeds allowable charges and the provider doesn't participate in Standard but agrees to bill Standard for the care provided. As with Extra, you may need a nonavailability statement from the military hospital nearest you before receiving inpatient care in a civilian hospital.

""The Department of Defense immediately initiated vaccination of selected service members,"" he noted.
While military service members are healthier than the general public, our experience should serve as a guide to the civilian community, and you should take this message back home.""
You also enrolled more than 100,000 seniors into TRICARE Plus, providing a health system far superior to the previous 'space-available runaround.'""
In a final note on TRICARE, Winkenwerder said new contracts were released during summer 2002 that will change the way the program is administered -- for the better.","Noting that the nation is experiencing ""very serious times,"" Dr. William Winkenwerder Jr., assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, told more than 3,000 attendees at the National TRICARE Conference that ""there's much to be done in the coming year across the military health system.""

Winkenwerder pointed out that, ""Tens of thousands of Americans have deployed to the Gulf region; families have bid farewell to their loved ones from almost every naval harbor in the country; 37,000 American soldiers are sitting on point at Camp Bonifas at the Demilitarized Zone and throughout the Korean Peninsula; our reserve component service members continue to join their active duty counterparts in significant numbers as one fighting force.""

He noted that military medical professionals at last year's conference set four major goals for the military health system: to improve force health protection and readiness; improve TRICARE; further outreach, coordination and collaboration; and to improve provider recruitment and retention.

Reflecting on performances in achieving these goals and outlining what needs to be done this year, the secretary said, ""The most important step we took in 2002 was to restart a strategic planning and governance process for the entire military health system.""

Crediting the surgeons general and senior DoD leaders with spending a lot of time putting together a shared vision and strategy for the coming years, Winkenwerder said, ""We took a fresh look at what it is we do, those we service, and the values that our service represents and then redefined what is expected of us.

""Much has been accomplished,"" he added. This, he said, includes the resumption of the anthrax vaccination and initiation of smallpox immunizations.

DoD's top doctor emphasized that only a few critics remain since anthrax vaccinations were resumed in June 2002. ""Bad information has been beaten by a military force, including a DoD leadership, better informed about the threats posed by biological agents and a communications effort that has been second to none,"" he said.

Winkenwerder stood with President Bush on Dec. 13, 2002, when the president announced smallpox vaccinations for military members and first responders in the civilian medical community.

""The Department of Defense immediately initiated vaccination of selected service members,"" he noted. ""As a physician, I know that the smallpox vaccine has a risk profile that merits heightened awareness. But as your assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, I know that our experience with this vaccine sets a standard for safety for the rest of the country and the world. There's no other medical system in the country or on the planet with the documented experience and successful outcomes that we have.""

From 1945 to 1990, DoD immunized millions of service members against smallpox and didn't experience any deaths, the doctor emphasized.

""How?"" he asked, then answered, ""With great professional attention and the finest basic medical care -- careful screening before vaccination and close monitoring after the sticks. While military service members are healthier than the general public, our experience should serve as a guide to the civilian community, and you should take this message back home.""

To critics who argue that the threat isn't clear, therefore, the vaccination program isn't necessary, Winkenwerder said, ""I can' tell you whether the likelihood of a smallpox attack is 1/10th of 1 percent or 75 percent, but we know that the former Soviet Union weaponized smallpox and produced it in significant quantities.

""We don't know if it's all accounted for,"" he said. ""Others may also have produced and stored it.""

Consequently, Winkenwerder said, DoD made the right choice in taking pre-emptive action to protect American troops. ""We've attacked and neutralized the top two biological threats against the forces of freedom,"" he said. ""But the work doesn't end with vaccination against anthrax and smallpox. We have much more to do in the coming year to improve protection against a number of biological, chemical and other threats from weapons of mass destruction.""

The secretary said the successes were significant in the improvement of TRICARE. Last year's successes include kicking off the TRICARE for Life benefit, fixing computer glitches, and data sharing with Medicare. As a result, he said, ""the TRICARE for Life program truly represents and industry benchmark for how to reach out to consumers, including sitting down with people, ""one-by-one and telling them how their benefits work.

""This is about trust,"" he continued, ""and you restored that trust. You also enrolled more than 100,000 seniors into TRICARE Plus, providing a health system far superior to the previous 'space-available runaround.'""

Winkenwerder told the audience that quality improvement in TRICARE and patient safety are paramount. More than 50,000 potentially life-threatening adverse drug interactions were prevented in the Pharmacy Data Transaction Service.

""It's fast, accurate and saves lives,"" he said.

""Another program we're closely monitoring is the TRICARE On-Line initiative,"" the secretary said. ""We're out in front of much of the industry on providing our enrollees and other beneficiaries with quality Web-based support. In the year ahead, we'll deploy TRICARE On-Line to almost all of our military treatment facilities.""

The secretary also said TRICARE is launching an obstetrics initiative. ""Congress has amended nonavailability statement requirements for women not enrolled in TRICARE Prime, providing expanded patient choice,"" the doctor said. ""We have a story to tell about the high-quality of our obstetric care and about the customer-oriented services we pledge to deliver.""

He said DoD is studying the possibility for patients to e-mail and consult electronically with their healthcare providers.

In a final note on TRICARE, Winkenwerder said new contracts were released during summer 2002 that will change the way the program is administered -- for the better. This includes simplifying administration, increasing accountability and improving customer service. TRICARE is also moving from seven contracts to three contracts and from 11 regions in the U.S. to three regions.

""Every one of the issues I raised here is about our leadership responsibility -- greater accountability for performance in quality and optimized facilities; greater simplicity in management and patient administration; and in patients that are pleased with getting their care from their military health system,"" Winkenwerder said.

""Our beneficiaries also have expectations that their private medical information is secure,"" he said. Winkenwerder said DoD is tightening security and accountability for all sensitive information, particularly health information.

""We must remember that here in the Department of Defense, electronic and physical security is required to protect our patients, and to promote national security,"" he said. ""We all have responsibilities.""

My wife who never served is currently on Medicare and tfl the only thing I’ve paid for is her rx every threee months.
In order for my wife to get access to tfl I had to sign up and pay a monthly premium for Tricare prime.
If you are satisfied with the VA and use it for your health care there's probably no point.","If you ever wanna use Medicare, I highly recommend that you have the $180 deducted from your Social Security check to pay for Medicare part B. If you do not decide to sign up for it, after a certain amount of time, there’s no going back. I’d highly recommend that you check with a professional on this.

I am pretty sure you have tri care for life since you are a retired military...my friend who is retired air force was telling me that while we were both in the doctors office , he had his three choices still VA, Tri-care and Medicare and he and his wife whom he was waiting on while we were having this conversation were in their 70's...I would however recommend that you do opt in for Medicare when the time comes. Through him and through others, having told me it has been a major blessing at various times...I would talk to knowledge base here for any and all specifics of each...but yes if you want all three the options are there for you...I wish I was wise and stayed in so I could have my military retirement and your options, it's blessing to many I know...you deserve it

To get/keep TFL you will have to sign up for Medicare at 65 (you will also get a new forever retired ID)- if you don't sign up for Medicare and do so later, hefty penalty. You will keep eligibility for free at VA. I use Medicare for most things and VA for eyes/ears -- I assume you either have Prime or standard/Select Tricare currently

At your rating, your VA medical/health care is free for life...I am still employed and have employer provided health insurance, which in no way affects my VA health benefits/care...so essentially for the time being I have my low cost employer health coverage AND my VA health care (which is not to be confused with 'insurance'). In your case, your option would be having Medicare at a cost AND your free VA Healthcare

Like others have said yes you will have to pay for Medicare out of your social security. That said you can also enroll in Tricare for life which wraps around Medicare. Additionally you can sign up for a Medicare advantage plan that you don’t pay for but in turn it gets paid for by Medicare and gives you money back at no additional cost!

This is exactly what I’m planning on doing next year when I turn 65. My wife who never served is currently on Medicare and tfl the only thing I’ve paid for is her rx every threee months. Also tfl has an option for overseas applications free of charge! In order for my wife to get access to tfl I had to sign up and pay a monthly premium for Tricare prime. Im currently at 60 percent and retired.

Dm me if you need further details.

Bottom line it’s worth it !

There is no requirement to sign up for medicare.

You should sign up for medicare part A which covers hospitalization and does not cost anything because it was paid for by deductions from your pay during the time you worked.

You can sign up for Part B which is totally voluntary and requires a monthly payment, but as you are totally covered by the VA that is a financial decision for you to make. If you are satisfied with the VA and use it for your health care there's probably no point. If you do not sign up for Part B when eligible, and later decide you want coverage there's a 2% penalty for every year you didn't get the coverage.",,N,0.0,2025-07-04 14:56:26.832143

The indictment against Osukoya was announced on Tuesday, July 1, 2025, by the U.S. Department of Justice as part of a nationwide healthcare fraud takedown that resulted in criminal charges against 324 individuals across 50 federal districts. The operation targeted schemes involving a total of over $14.6 billion in alleged intended losses.

Osukoya, a Nigerian citizen and the owner of Ayo Biometrics, LLC, operating under the name Cambridge Diagnostics, is accused of conspiring to commit health care fraud by recruiting individuals with private and public health insurance plans to undergo electroencephalogram (EEG) testing.

Prosecutors allege that he paid illegal kickbacks and bribes to physicians and others to secure patient referrals for the testing.

To support the claims, Osukoya and unnamed co-conspirators allegedly falsified diagnoses and misrepresented the kickback payments as legitimate business expenses, such as loans, medical directorships, and consultation fees.

According to the indictment, Cambridge Diagnostics received over $5 million in payments from Medicare, TRICARE, and other insurance providers as a result of the alleged fraudulent submissions.

Osukoya is also accused of paying over $450,000 in illegal kickbacks to facilitate the scheme.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Dallas Field Office and the Department of Health & Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG) conducted the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorney Renee Hunter is prosecuting the case in the Northern District of Texas.

In a statement, Acting U.S. Attorney Nancy Larson for the Northern District of Texas said, “These individuals lined their own pockets, egregiously stealing beneficiaries’ identities and pillaging the coffers of federal programs. We will never tolerate this behaviour and will relentlessly pursue prosecution of these offenders to the fullest extent possible.”The broader operation, referred to as the 2025 National Health Care Fraud Takedown, saw the seizure of over $245 million in cash, luxury vehicles, cryptocurrency, and other assets across the United States. According to the Centres for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), over $4 billion in fraudulent payments were prevented, and 205 providers had their billing privileges suspended or revoked in advance of the operation.

Commenting on the national effort, Attorney General Pamela Bondi stated, “This record-setting Health Care Fraud Takedown delivers justice to criminal actors who prey upon our most vulnerable citizens and steal from hardworking American taxpayers.”

The charges against Osukoya form part of the Department of Justice’s ongoing initiative to dismantle complex healthcare fraud schemes and recover funds stolen from government programmes.

Osukoya was indicted in “connection with the submission of over $25 million in false and fraudulent medical claims to Medicare, TRICARE, and other insurers for electroencephalogram (EEG) testing”.

EEG testing is a diagnostic test that involves measuring the electricity activity in the brain using sensitive equipment.

A statement published on Tuesday by the US justice department said Osukoya was part of the 324 defendants it had preferred charges against in the 2025 national health care fraud takedown.

The US justice department said the defendants allegedly participated in “various health care fraud schemes involving over $14.6 billion in intended loss”.

The defendants include 96 doctors, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and other medical professions across the US.

The US justice department filed a one-count charge bordering on conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud against Osukoya.

According to the charge sheet, Osukoya, the manager of Cambridge Diagnostics, allegedly committed the healthcare fraud between 2020 and 2023 using the company.

“As part of the scheme and artifice to defraud, Osukoya sought out individuals with insurance plans to undergo expensive ambulatory EEG testing through Cambridge Diagnostics,” part of the charge sheet reads.

“To incentivize individuals to undergo the testing, Osukoya offered to pay, and did pay, kickbacks and bribes in varying amounts, typically between $500 and $2000.

“Osukoya also sought out a network of physicians, including Coconspirator One and Coconspirator Two, and others, to order EEG testing through Cambridge Diagnostics.

“Osukoya sent individuals he directly recruited to these physicians to order the testing.

“Additionally, Osukoya encouraged the physicians to refer their own patients to Cambridge Diagnostics for EEG testing.

“In return for referring patients, Osukoya promised to pay, and did pay, kickbacks and bribes to physicians and their representatives in the form of a percentage of the reimbursement Cambridge Diagnostics received from the claims.

“Before any testing was performed, Osukoya sent the individual’s insurance information to his ‘biller’, to ensure Cambridge Diagnostics would receive reimbursement for the claim.

“Osukoya targeted individuals with out-of-network benefits that would reimburse higher for the tests and avoided benefit plans that were known to pay little or nothing for the tests.

“If the patient had no insurance or did not have insurance that covered the testing, the testing was not performed.

“Once Osukoya confirmed the insurer would pay, Osukoya performed a routine EEG on the patient and would then instruct the coconspirator physician to order ambulatory EEG testing.

“To conceal the fraudulent billing scheme and to justify payment for the testing. Osukoya and his co-conspirators frequently listed false or exaggerated diagnoses to make it appear that the service was medically necessary, when in fact, it was not.

“For instance, Osukoya and his co-conspirators would falsely represent that the patient had epilepsy or seizures when the patient had no such condition.”",https://www.thecable.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/judge-gavel-court-e1634298698292.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-04 12:56:26.702876

Authorities said Cambridge Diagnostics received over $5 million in payments for the claims, with Osukoya allegedly disbursing more than $450,000 in illegal kickbacks.
Osukoya’s indictment is part of a broader federal crackdown on healthcare fraud, which U.S. officials say continues to strain public resources and endanger patients.","The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) has indicted a Nigerian, Olatunbosun Osukoya, in connection with a sweeping healthcare fraud operation valued at over $14.6 billion in intended losses described as one of the largest in US history.

Osukoya, 67, who resides in Plano, Texas, was among 324 individuals charged in the 2025 National Health Care Fraud Takedown spanning 50 federal districts and 12 State Attorneys General’s Offices across the United States. The DOJ said the defendants include 96 doctors, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and other licensed medical professionals.

In a statement released on Thursday, the DOJ disclosed that the alleged perpetrators “exploited patients and taxpayers” through various schemes involving fraudulent claims and medically unnecessary procedures.

“The Justice Department today announced the results of its 2025 National Health Care Fraud Takedown, which resulted in criminal charges against 324 defendants… involving over $14.6 billion in intended loss,” the statement read.

Osukoya, owner of Ayo Biometrics, LLC, which operates as Cambridge Diagnostics, was indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud. According to court documents, he is accused of submitting more than $25 million in fraudulent claims to Medicare, TRICARE, and other insurers, primarily for electroencephalogram (EEG) testing.

The DOJ said Osukoya actively sought out individuals with insurance plans for costly lab testing and paid kickbacks to medical professionals to funnel patients to his diagnostic center.

“As alleged in the indictment, Osukoya… sought out individuals with insurance plans to undergo expensive EEG testing and recruited and paid kickbacks and bribes to physicians and others to refer patients to Cambridge Diagnostics,” the DOJ stated.

To disguise the illicit nature of the transactions, the indictment alleges that Osukoya and his co-conspirators falsified diagnoses and misrepresented illegal payments as legitimate business expenses — labelling them as loans, medical directorships, and consultation fees.

“To conceal the scheme and to make it appear that the services were necessary… kickback payments were falsely labelled,” the DOJ added.

Authorities said Cambridge Diagnostics received over $5 million in payments for the claims, with Osukoya allegedly disbursing more than $450,000 in illegal kickbacks.

Osukoya’s indictment is part of a broader federal crackdown on healthcare fraud, which U.S. officials say continues to strain public resources and endanger patients.

Meanwhile, in a related development, another Nigerian, Newton Ofioritse Jemide, was sentenced to three years and five months in prison by Judge Deborah K. Chasanow of a U.S. District Court. Jemide, who was extradited from France, was convicted of fraudulently obtaining $8 million in disaster relief grants intended for vulnerable American citizens.",https://leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/United-States.jpeg,N,0.0,2025-07-04 06:56:17.446381

Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed Arkansas Act 624 into law, she put access to medications at risk for the thousands of active-duty and retired military service members living in Arkansas.
This law will have life-threatening consequences for thousands of Arkansas military beneficiaries and many other Arkansans who get their medications through a home-delivery specialty pharmacy.
If this goes forward or other states follow Arkansas' lead, expect catastrophic consequences for millions of military beneficiaries.
U.S. Army Col. Douglas House (retired) is an attorney and a former Arkansas state representative.","I have dedicated my life to service of my country, Arkansas, and our veterans. I always strive to ensure that our eligible active, reserve, National Guard warriors, veterans, military retirees, and their families receive the medical care promised by Congress for their service. However, Arkansas is about to implement a law that will deny them--and thousands of other patients--access to their prescription medicines.

Health coverage for military members is managed by the Department of Defense's TRICARE program. It is important to have TRICARE's pharmacy benefits supported by a national company to ensure that active-duty military members can get their medications reliably and affordably, no matter where they are.

Like many large employers and other health plans, TRICARE contracts with the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) Express Scripts and its affiliate specialty pharmacy Accredo. Express Scripts sends prescribed medications to beneficiaries for common medical conditions like high blood pressure. Accredo ships specialty medications such as chemotherapy or biologics for medical conditions such as cancers, blood diseases, and inflammatory organ diseases, which are generally more complex and expensive. Most of these medicines are not stocked by neighborhood pharmacies because they require specific temperature controls and other special handling that they can't afford to provide.

But when Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed Arkansas Act 624 into law, she put access to medications at risk for the thousands of active-duty and retired military service members living in Arkansas. The law requires the state Pharmacy Board to revoke existing pharmacy licenses and refuse to issue licenses to PBMs that also maintain pharmacies, including congressionally mandated and TRICARE-contracted PBMs and pharmacies. Governor Sanders may claim ignorance of the effect of this law, but I personally delivered a letter to her office warning her about them before she signed the bill.

This law will have life-threatening consequences for thousands of Arkansas military beneficiaries and many other Arkansans who get their medications through a home-delivery specialty pharmacy. Not only in Arkansas, but if other states pass similar legislation as Governor Sanders is urging, military beneficiaries scattered or retired across our country where there is no military base or a full-service pharmacy would be at risk.

I am no friend of PBMs. As a state representative, I supported laws to bring transparency and fairness to how PBMs hired by insurance companies reimburse pharmacies, ensuring that patients were not overcharged for their medications. We carefully considered the potential consequences of these laws to ensure they would not affect access to medications for TRICARE beneficiaries or other patients.

Even after the PBMs filed lawsuits, the state laws were upheld by the United States Supreme Court. These laws were the foundation of our efforts to ensure pharmacies get paid fairly, insurance companies are not overcharged, and consumers can access the medications they need.

Now, the state Legislature has rushed to pass Act 624 with little time for public comment or discussion of the potential harm it could cause.

It's true some veterans may be eligible to use the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical system for service-connected illnesses and injuries. But the VA is overwhelmed with patients, and military pharmacies also operate under budget constraints. I was told by the VA to wait three months for a primary-care doctor appointment and to wait three months for a referral to a specialist, in hopes that the specialist will prescribe the medicine that works rather than try other alternatives.

This is not just a matter of policy for me; it is a matter of life and death. I have Crohn's disease, a chronic and debilitating condition that requires an expensive specialty injection called Stelara. Accredo ships refrigerated Stelara directly to my home every four weeks, and I pay a set $38 co-pay established by Congress. Without it, I can expect abdominal resection surgeries and the resulting infection and sepsis. When I was an employee of the state, their employee benefits managers refused to pay for it. When I asked our local active-duty base pharmacy if they could supply this medication, they referred me to Express Scripts and Accredo.

In 2024, Express Scripts Pharmacy sent over 700,000 common prescriptions, while Accredo shipped over 72,000 specialty prescriptions to patients in Arkansas. If this law goes into effect in January 2026, Arkansans military beneficiaries and many other patients would lose access to mail-delivered prescriptions that are a lifeline for many, including me.

The government of Arkansas has made it clear: They do not care about military people. The consequences for military families and thousands of Arkansans who may lose access to their medications will be devastating. If this goes forward or other states follow Arkansas' lead, expect catastrophic consequences for millions of military beneficiaries.

Our country made a promise to our men, women and families in uniform. I believe in fairness, transparency and oversight, but all this law does is seek to preserve an antiquated business model.

According to a DoD press release, health care costs for these three contracts are estimated to range between $19.5 billion to $20.5 billion over the next five years.
With the new contracts, Tricare is moving from the current 11 regions involving four companies that operate under seven contracts to three regions with three healthcare companies under three contracts.
Winkenwerder also announced that Navy Rear Adm. James A. Johnson has been appointed as the new Tricare West regional director.
Johnson, a 37-year veteran, will be responsible for the administration of health care contracts in the west region; providing support to military medical facility commanders there; sustaining quality care, and improving customer satisfaction.","The Defense Department got the ""best value"" for its money when new Tricare contracts were awarded in late August to three healthcare companies to manage care for more than 8 million military personnel and their family members, the Pentagon's leading health official said here Sept. 10.

During a meeting with reporters in his office, Dr. William Winkenwerder Jr., assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, said, ""We've made a good program (Tricare) even better. The changes that we've implemented in this new set of contracts put customer satisfaction first.""

DoD health officials announced Aug. 21 that Humana Military Healthcare Services, Louisville, Ky.; Health Net Federal Services, Rancho Cordova, Calif.; and TriWest Healthcare Alliance Corp, Phoenix, Ariz., were awarded the contracts for its managed care system.

According to a DoD press release, health care costs for these three contracts are estimated to range between $19.5 billion to $20.5 billion over the next five years. The new contracts will be phased in over the next year, and will replace seven contracts currently in place, according to the release.

Winkenwerder told reporters that Tricare is restructuring its managed care system. With the new contracts, Tricare is moving from the current 11 regions involving four companies that operate under seven contracts to three regions with three healthcare companies under three contracts.

Humana received a $2 billion contract for the Tricare South region. That region covers healthcare for beneficiaries in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and the eastern portion of Texas.

TriWest received a $2.1 billion contract for the Tricare West region, which covers Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, west Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.

Health Net was awarded a $2.2 billion contract for the Tricare North region that includes Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

Sierra Military Health Services, Las Vegas, which had covered the Northeast, filed a formal protest Aug. 29 with the Government Accounting Office on its unsuccessful bid. A press release by the company stated that company representatives met with DoD health officials to discuss the evaluation process used to award the contract and the evaluation findings. ""Subsequently, the company determined there were serious and material errors in the evaluation process and findings, warranting a formal protest,"" the release said.

Winkenwerder told reporters, ""We were not surprised that there was a protest based on the size of these contracts and the importance to the bidders."" And he added that healthcare services for beneficiaries will not be interrupted and, ""will move forward.""

Winkenwerder said the contracts were carefully evaluated based on several factors, such as clinical quality, customer satisfaction, past performance and price. These factors, he said, helped determine which contracts offered the ""best value"" to the government and its beneficiaries. He said cost is ""least important in the 'best value' package.""

Winkenwerder also announced that Navy Rear Adm. James A. Johnson has been appointed as the new Tricare West regional director. Johnson, a 37-year veteran, will be responsible for the administration of health care contracts in the west region; providing support to military medical facility commanders there; sustaining quality care, and improving customer satisfaction.

Winkenwerder, who came on board Oct. 16, 2001, also praised the quality of healthcare TRICARE provides to its 8.3 million beneficiaries.
The quality and the energy of the military medical team are superb, he said, and could be even better.
Harnessing digitized, Web-based data collection and information services will help improve customer service and provide increased efficiencies for TRICARE, Winkenwerder said.","Senior DoD leaders Feb. 4 praised improvements made to TRICARE, the military's healthcare system, and also noted the need for new methods and efficiencies to meet anticipated challenges ahead.

Hundreds of military and civilian health care professionals heard remarks by David S.C. Chu, undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness; Dr. William Winkenwerder Jr., assistant secretary of defense for health affairs; and Thomas F. Carrato, TRICARE Management Activity executive director, at the first day of the Feb. 4-7 TRICARE conference here.

The consensus of Chu, Winkenwerder and Carrato was that TRICARE was living up to its 2002 conference theme: ""Getting the Job Done for America.""

""Nobody does it better than you,"" Carrato said to the audience. He became TMA executive director on June 7, 2001.

TRICARE has accomplished a lot in the past year, such as establishing TRICARE For Life coverage for beneficiaries over age 65, Carrato noted. At the same time, TRICARE professionals have fixed long-time customer irritants by improving claims processing, establishing a toll-free information line, simplifying pharmacy program co-payments, and more, he said.

Carrato then read a letter from a 75-year-old widow who praised the TRICARE coverage for her breast cancer treatment:

""Thank you so much, thank you to the American taxpayers and to the people who worked so hard to get this assistance measure through Congress. … I cannot express how much I truly appreciate this help, but I hope this letter gives you some idea,"" the woman wrote.

The woman's letter, Carrato noted, ""represents the promise that we've kept, the trust that we've restored, and the vision we've achieved to deliver this kind of high-quality healthcare benefit (to) all of these deserving men and women, these truly great Americans.""

Winkenwerder, who came on board Oct. 16, 2001, also praised the quality of healthcare TRICARE provides to its 8.3 million beneficiaries. He noted some challenges for the coming year.

The attacks of Sept. 11 and the anthrax attacks that followed the hijackings ""have mobilized our country and the Department of Defense,"" he said. Military medics and healthcare workers, he noted, ""continue to be on the front lines"" in today's wartime environment. The quality and the energy of the military medical team are superb, he said, and could be even better. He then outlined his priorities:

o Improve force health protection and medical readiness.

o Improve performance of the TRICARE program.

o Strengthen relationships outside of DoD, such as with the Department of Veterans Affairs.

o Ensure the services recruit the best medical professionals in the world.

""Biological warfare is no longer a theoretical possibility,"" Winkenwerder said. Consequently, the nation's vaccine policies and programs need to be ""greatly bolstered and refocused,"" he noted.

The Food and Drug Administration recently certified the anthrax vaccine made by Bioport of Lansing, Mich., Winkenwerder remarked. Vaccine production will resume soon, he said.

""We will soon announce our policy within DoD on how we will prioritize the resumption of vaccine efforts,"" he said, adding, ""One thing is certain … the vaccine is safe and it is effective.""

DoD's medical readiness training programs for biological, chemical and radiological warfare ""demand significant attention,"" Winkenwerder said. ""My goal is that all military health personnel will be trained to recognize and manage chemical and biological agents, depending upon their level and their position.""

Winkenwerder added that military medical personnel will also be trained to deal with the consequences of biological or chemical attack on both individuals and entire populations.

Though TRICARE has come a long way, ""We've got an opportunity to get (the job done) even better,"" he noted. He pledged faster identification and solution of problems within the system; better, integrated communications with beneficiaries; and solutions ""that put the responsibility on us, not on the beneficiaries, our customers.""

Harnessing digitized, Web-based data collection and information services will help improve customer service and provide increased efficiencies for TRICARE, Winkenwerder said.

Addressing efficiency and cost-effectiveness, Chu noted that DoD medical professionals in the future could expect to work with the Department of Veteran Affairs in a DoD outreach effort of working with other federal agencies. For instance, he said, key areas of DoD-VA coordination would include joint procurement of pharmaceuticals and other materials and joint facility use.

Veterans And Addiction: What’s the Connection?

Many veterans face addiction due to combat-related trauma, PTSD, chronic pain, and difficulty transitioning to civilian life. Substance use often begins as a coping mechanism, especially with alcohol, opioids, or prescription drugs. Co-occurring mental health disorders further complicate recovery. Early intervention, trauma-informed care, and veteran-specific treatment programs are essential for effective support and long-term recovery.

The House voted 218-214 almost entirely along party lines on Thursday afternoon to pass the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act, sweeping legislation to enact Trump's agenda on everything from immigration to taxes. The House passage, which followed the Senate's narrow approval on Tuesday, closed a week of Congress sprinting to get the bill to Trump's desk by his self-imposed deadline of July 4.

In addition to bulking up defense funding, which includes a few billion dollars for service member quality-of-life improvements, the bill will slash social safety net programs, including food assistance that military families and veterans rely on.

""The One Big, Beautiful Bill makes a historic and long overdue investment of $150 billion to achieve President Trump's Peace Through Strength agenda and restore American deterrence,"" House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., said in a statement after the bill's passage. ""We can't afford to wait any longer to begin rebuilding our military capacity, launching the future of American defense, and supercharging American manufacturing.""

The Pentagon has been banking on passage of the bill to bring its budget next year to a record nearly $1 trillion. Without passage of the bill, the department has been planning a roughly $848 billion budget for fiscal 2026, essentially the same amount of funding it has this year.

The Pentagon's budget gimmickry irked some GOP defense hawks in Congress who had intended for the $150 billion in the One Big Beautiful Bill to supplement a regular $1 trillion defense budget. But the House, at least, has so far followed the Pentagon plan in its regular appropriations process.

The Pentagon has said the funding in the Trump agenda bill could be used to make up for holes caused by pulling some existing funding for operations on the U.S.-Mexico border.

The bill approved Thursday includes about $1 billion for military operations on the border, compared to about $5 billion in border funding being planned for at the Pentagon.

The Army has already moved about $1 billion from facilities maintenance, including for dilapidated barracks, to border operations.

The One Big Beautiful Bill has $1 billion for barracks restoration -- but that money is intended to be divvied up between the Army, Air Force, Navy and Space Force.

The bill separately provides about $350 million specifically for the Marine Corps' housing improvement initiative known as Barracks 2030.

The bill also provides temporary authorization for more widespread barracks privatization, an idea that has gained steam in recent years as the services have struggled with maintenance backlogs.

The bill's biggest pots of defense funding are $29 billion for shipbuilding, $25 billion for munitions and $25 billion for the Golden Dome, Trump's still hazy proposal for a space-based missile shield over the United States.

The barracks funding in the bill is part of an overall $9 billion set aside for military quality-of-life issues, including $2 billion for military health care programs, $2.9 billion to help cover Basic Allowance for Housing costs, $50 million for special pay and bonuses, $100 million for child care fee assistance, and $10 million for military spouse professional licensure fee assistance.

Meanwhile, the bill makes deep cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly referred to as food stamps.

Specifically, the bill will cut federal funding and force states to make up the difference. While the burden on states is not quite as heavy in the final bill as originally proposed, state government officials and anti-hunger advocates have still warned that the burden-sharing will overwhelm state budgets and force them to make cuts that will affect everyone on the program, including veterans and military families.

SNAP is a lifeline for many military families, which face food insecurity at higher rates than the civilian population. About 1.2 million veterans are also estimated to be on SNAP.

The bill also revives SNAP's work requirements for veterans, reversing a change made in a bipartisan deal in 2023 that exempted all veterans from work requirements regardless of their disability status. The reversal has elicited fierce pushback from some veterans groups.

""Cutting SNAP exemptions for veterans is an unacceptable betrayal,"" Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America said in a statement last week. The bill's cuts ""ignore the unique challenges veterans face, from service-connected disabilities to navigating the transition to civilian life. SNAP isn't a handout; it's a vital lifeline that keeps food on the table for those who serve.""

Republicans have defended reviving work requirements for veterans by pointing to continued exemptions for people with disabilities and framing the mandate as an ""opportunity.""

""The One Big Beautiful Bill restores work, volunteer and training opportunities for veterans on SNAP -- rolling back a Biden-era carveout that denied them the dignity of work,"" House Agriculture Committee Republicans posted on social media Friday. ""Veterans who qualify for exemptions remain fully protected.""

Republicans pushed the bill through Congress using a process known as reconciliation, which allowed the bill to pass without any Democratic support. But wrangling enough GOP support to pass was also a battle.

In the Senate, Republicans added several provisions meant to spare Alaska from harsh benefits cuts in order to win support from Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. Still, Vice President JD Vance needed to break a tie in order for the bill to pass the upper chamber because three other Republicans -- Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky -- opposed it.

In the House, members of the hard-line conservative Freedom Caucus spent Wednesday threatening to tank the bill over what they viewed as insufficient spending cuts, while some more moderate Republicans balked at Medicaid cuts. But ultimately, they voted for the bill Thursday without any changes.

Just two House Republicans, conservative Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and moderate Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, voted against the bill.

HUM as one of five insurers to administer services through its new Humana Healthy Horizons plan. All Virginia Cardinal Care members are now eligible to choose this as a new Medicaid plan option.

Cardinal Care offers health coverage to low-income individuals, children, seniors, people with disabilities and pregnant women. Rather than paying healthcare providers directly, the program partners with private insurance companies known as Managed Care Organizations, which manage medical services, prescriptions and overall care coordination for members.

Humana Healthy Horizons is poised to deliver comprehensive care to individuals and families across the state, focusing not only on physical and mental health but also on the social factors that often hinder better overall well-being. With existing service to Medicare Advantage and TRICARE members in the state, the expansion into Cardinal Care allows Humana to extend its human-centred approach to Medicaid recipients, aiming to offer innovative solutions, address complex needs, and improve both health outcomes and quality of life.

This move opens a valuable opportunity for Humana’s growth. By managing care for enrolled members, the company can increase memberships and receive regular payments from the state, offering a steady and scalable source of revenue. Through Humana Healthy Horizons, the company already serves 1.5 million Medicaid members in the country. Expanding into Virginia’s Medicaid broadens Humana’s reach beyond Medicare and TRICARE.

HUM’s YTD Price Performance

In the year-to-date period, Humana’s shares have lost 3.9% compared with a 24% decline across the broader industry. Due to rising healthcare costs, increased service utilization, and operational inefficiencies, Humana continues to face pressure on its profitability and long-term margins.

Humana’s Zacks Rank & Key Picks

HUM currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

CNC’s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the last three of four quarters, the average surprise being 25.5%. The consensus estimate for Centene’s current-year revenues is pegged at $179.5 billion, implying 10.1% year-over-year growth.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cigna’s current-year earnings is pegged at $29.68 per share, implying 8.6% year-over-year growth. Cigna’s earnings surpassed estimates in three of the last four quarters. It has witnessed eight upward revisions in the last 60 days against no movement in the opposite direction. The consensus estimate for Cigna’s current-year revenues is pegged at $258.2 billion, implying 4.5% year-over-year growth.

Dr. Jonathan Woodson, assistant secretary of defense for health affairs and director of the TRICARE Management Activity, addressed 3,000 attendees at the conference.

“Our people have always exhibited great personal courage over the years, and this has been shown many times on the battlefield,” he said. “There is no shortage of personal courage. Now, it’s about exhibiting organization courage -- specifically, the courage to change.”

To keep pace with the future, Woodson said, the military health system must have the courage to become more joint, more collaborative and integrative, and broader in focus to leverage all the talent in the system, irrespective of service or rank.

“We need the courage to [re-examine] how we incentivize behavior in our system. … We need to face up to the shortcomings of our information systems, our patient engagement strategies and our approaches to changing the behavior of our population in terms of health risks,” he said.

The system also must engage in a strategy of collaboration with all of its federal partners, Woodson said, particularly the Veterans Affairs Department.

The $53 million military health system includes more than 133,000 military and civilian doctors, nurses, medical educators, researchers, health care providers, allied health professionals, and health administration personnel around the world. Woodson said the system must assess its performance and relevance in terms of value and not cost alone, and must communicate this value to its stakeholders, especially the larger Defense Department community.

“On Feb. 13, [President Barack Obama’s] budget will be released, and as you would expect, … there will be a significant focus on the numbers. The budget’s numbers are important, but they don’t convey the story that was described to you this week by so many speakers,” Woodson told the conferees. “The story of the MHS is not about $53 billion or how many prescription drugs were purchased or [the number of] co-pays or deductibles. It’s about the value we provide to the people we serve. That’s the story we need to tell over and over again in all of our communities.”

Fiscal challenges should not be allowed to distract the men and woman of the military health system, he said. “Instead,” he added, “we should seize upon the opportunity to become stronger, better and more relevant.”

From the conference presentations, Woodson said, he’s taking away messages about leadership development, knowledge sharing and innovation.

“In most eras, the military has never been wanting for leaders, because that is what we do. … [But] the development of good leaders with updated competencies requires constant attention,” he said. “Military health system leaders need special competencies to manage health care issues effectively in the 21st century.”

During a conference session with senior enlisted advisors from each service, the assistant secretary said, he learned that one of their critical concerns is that the skills acquired by enlisted medics who performed so brilliantly on the battlefield not be allowed to atrophy as the kinetic wars subside and they return to peacetime duties.

“The integration of enlisted medics could be the critical shaping factor for our future,” Woodson said, “and may provide the answer to how we establish and staff effective patient-centered medical home teams with extended capabilities to meet our patients’ needs.”

The military health system also must focus on leadership development of officers in the post-war environment, he added.

“Our military treatment facility commanders and staff have borne a substantial burden in trying to balance the needs of deployment, readiness, training and running garrison health systems over the past decade,” Woodson said.

In addressing knowledge sharing and innovation, the assistant secretary described the need for a broader strategy of developing a culture of innovation, nurturing the innovative spirit and “rewarding the innovators in our midst.”

Woodson said he is convinced that MHS expertise is comparable to the best expertise anywhere in the world, “but we need to improve the access to this expertise.”

During one of the conference sessions, Dr. Denis A. Cortese, director of the Arizona State University Healthcare Delivery and Policy Program and a former Mayo Clinic chief executive officer, talked about internal knowledge-sharing systems in use at premier institutions such as Mayo, the Cleveland Clinic, the Intermountain system of hospitals and Johns Hopkins University.

“We have to do this, too,” Woodson said, “and we will.”

The conference has been not just an opportunity to share information and distribute knowledge across the enterprise, Woodson said.

“It’s also how we cull innovation and how that feeds into the generation of new knowledge,” he added. “This year and in the coming years, we will have the opportunity to change. The years will be challenging, the tasks will be hard, and we have the responsibility to get it right.”

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

By AMAC Certified Social Security Advisor Russell Gloor, Association of Mature American Citizens

Dear Rusty: In your answer to the retired U.S. Navy veteran about why he is forced to enroll in Medicare, you focused on military TriCare’s requirement for the member to enroll in Medicare. But you said nothing about regular VA health care. If a non-career veteran is eligible for VA health care, couldn’t that be used in place of Medicare? Signed: Veteran Advocate

Dear Veteran Advocate: Thank you for your feedback. FYI, I have previously explained numerous times that veterans who rely on the VA for 100% of their healthcare can, indeed, disenroll from Medicare Part B (thus saving the monthly Part B premium). I don’t personally recommend it because of my personal experience, but it certainly is possible to do so.

Get the latest headlines sent to you

Personally, I use the VA for some of my healthcare needs – usually an annual checkup and optometry services – at my local VA clinic which is only a mile away from where I live. But for any extensive treatment needs (medical tests, etc.) I must travel about 40 miles to the nearest VA hospital facility. For contrast, I have numerous private healthcare services, specialists and hospitals very near where I live, but to use them under the VA I must get VA preapproval and use only certain VA-approved providers, which is inconvenient for me. Personally, I prefer the freedom to go to any healthcare service provider I choose, without restriction, at any time I need to. So, I use my VA coverage when it is convenient for me but rely also on non-VA, Medicare-approved specialists who I can choose to use (or not) at will. For me, it’s a matter of convenience and the freedom to use whichever healthcare provider I want. That said, I fully understand that some veterans rely exclusively on the VA for their healthcare needs, and I have explained to many who have written to me that they have that option. I have also published several public articles about this as well. Here is one such article:

socialsecurityreport.org/ask-rusty-why-should-a-veteran-pay-for-medicare/

So, please rest assured that we regularly advise our veterans about their healthcare options under Medicare, including the ability to decline Medicare Part B coverage if they have full VA healthcare coverage. FYI, free Medicare Part A (inpatient hospitalization coverage) is mandatory to collect Social Security after age 65, but Medicare Part B coverage is always optional because there is a premium associated with Part B. A veteran can decline Medicare Part B coverage and save that monthly premium, but they would need to contact Social Security to do so. Social Security will want to interview the veteran to ensure they are aware of the potential financial consequences of not having Medicare Part B. And they may need to file form CMS-1763 (Request for Termination). But a non-career veteran can opt out of Medicare Part B if they get all of their healthcare services through the Veterans Administration.

As always, officials noted, TRICARE beneficiaries still are covered by TRICARE Standard.
For those living within 100 miles of a remaining Prime service area, re-enrolling in Prime may be an option, depending on availability.
Prolonged protests resulted in a staggered transition, they added, and all Prime service areas were retained until all three new regional contracts were in place.
To provide affected beneficiaries with enough time to plan, Defense Department officials elected to delay the Prime service area reductions until Oct. 1.","The Defense Department will reduce the number of TRICARE Prime service areas in the United States beginning Oct. 1, affecting about 171,000 retirees and their family members.

Those beneficiaries, who mostly reside more than 40 miles from a military clinic or hospital, received a letter earlier this year explaining their options. They will receive a second letter later this month.

TRICARE Management Activity officials said changing the location of Prime service areas has been planned since 2007 as part of the move to the third-generation of managed care support contracts and will allow them to continue their commitment to making high-quality health care available while supporting DOD efforts to control the rising cost of health care for 9.6 million beneficiaries.

Health care under TRICARE Prime costs about $600 more annually per enrollee, but on average, each member of a family of three using TRICARE Standard will pay only about $20 more per month than if they were using Prime.

“The first thing TRICARE beneficiaries should know about the reduction in the number of Prime service areas is that it doesn’t mean they’re losing their TRICARE benefit,” said Dr. Jonathan Woodson, assistant secretary of defense for health affairs. “Next, it’s important to remember this change does not affect most of the more than 5 million people using TRICARE Prime, and [it affects] none of our active duty members and their families.”

All affected beneficiaries will receive a letter this month following up on their initial notification to ensure they have the time and information to make important decisions about their future health care options, officials said.

Current details on Prime service areas and the option for beneficiaries to sign for email updates are available at http://www.tricare.mil/PSA. A ZIP code tool is available on the site to help beneficiaries determine if they live in an affected area.

As always, officials noted, TRICARE beneficiaries still are covered by TRICARE Standard. For those living within 100 miles of a remaining Prime service area, re-enrolling in Prime may be an option, depending on availability. To do this, beneficiaries must waive their drive-time standards, and they may have to travel long distances for primary and specialty care.

“I urge all impacted beneficiaries to carefully consider their health care options – they should talk them over with family members and their current health care provider,” Woodson said. “Many beneficiaries may be able to continue with their current provider using the Standard benefit. Being close to your health care team usually offers the best and safest access to care.”

Those enrolled in TRICARE Prime are assigned a primary care provider who manages their health care. Retirees pay an annual enrollment fee and have low out-of-pocket costs under this plan. TRICARE Standard is an open-choice option with no monthly premiums and no need for referrals, but it has cost shares and an annual deductible.

The Prime service areas being eliminated are not close to existing military treatment facilities or base realignment and closure sites, officials said. Prolonged protests resulted in a staggered transition, they added, and all Prime service areas were retained until all three new regional contracts were in place. The West region completed the transition April 1.

To provide affected beneficiaries with enough time to plan, Defense Department officials elected to delay the Prime service area reductions until Oct. 1.

The facility spans approximately 20,000 square feet and integrates sports medicine physicians, athletic trainers, and allied health professionals in a state-of-the-art environment focused on returning injured School of Infantry-East students to full mission readiness.

“The Camp Geiger SMART Clinic brings targeted, performance-based care to our Marines,” said Lt. Cmdr. Matthew Miles, DHA health facilities planning and project officer. “Every decision–from design to delivery–focused on getting warfighters back to full strength faster. It’s rewarding to see the clinic now open and fulfilling that mission.”

The Camp Geiger SMART Clinic/SOI-East Human Performance Center is part of the Marine Centered Medical Home project which began in 2013. The focus is modernizing all of Camp Lejeune’s various branch clinic services in a joint effort between the Defense Health Agency, the Navy and Marine Corps.

“We're coming from a 6,500 square feet [facility] to 20,000 square feet, so the scalability is there to take bigger groups on and not have to break our companies or platoons into smaller groups; which allows us to work with and educate more people with the same amount of resources,” said Darin Peterson, the Human Performance Center director for SOI-East.

According to Peterson, the new facility is an elite hub for physical education, training, and getting warfighters back in the fight. “It might sound cliché but walking in and seeing a facility that rivals any divisional and college facility creates an immediate buy-in from the warfighter,” Peterson said. “This investment in the Marines and the sailors is about giving back to the warfighter, the actual person with boots on the ground, that has always been the main effort.”

In addition to the updated facilities for the Camp Geiger SMART Clinic, the MCMH initiative has already modernized services at Hadnot Point, Wallace Creek, New River, and French Creek clinics with construction on the Camp Johnson clinic underway.

MCMH French Creek celebrated its grand reopening on June 10. The upgraded facility boasts multiple services under one roof, serving approximately 7,000 Marines and sailors attached to 2nd Marine Logistics Group. Services include primary care, readiness, laboratory, pharmacy, radiology, and immunizations among others.

“It’s been a privilege to serve as the Project Officer for the French Creek Medical Clinic,” said Miles. “This facility reflects the teamwork, precision, and commitment it takes to deliver a modern healthcare environment in direct support of operational forces. From design through activation, every step of this project has been about readiness, access, and ensuring Marines receive the care they need where it matters most.”

""Health care for military families is one of the most important things for recruitment and retention.
Addressing concerns about potential downsizing or changes to IACH's mission, Ferrara was clear in his support for the facility.
Despite acknowledging the financial challenges facing military healthcare, Ferrara expressed admiration for the innovation and adaptability he consistently observes at military treatment facilities.
Ferrara’s visit affirmed what those on the front lines already know: readiness begins with care, and care begins here.","FORT RILEY, Kansas – What does it mean to be mission-ready—medically, operationally, and as a team? For the Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, Dr. Stephen Ferrara, the answer lies not in policy memos or PowerPoint decks, but in the work happening inside military hospitals like Irwin Army Community Hospital.

On June 30, Ferrara walked the halls of IACH to understand firsthand how the Military Health System can better support the 1st Infantry Division and its families. He spent the day engaging with healthcare providers, leadership, and staff to assess the facility's capabilities and address concerns about the future of military healthcare at Fort Riley, home to the oldest continuously serving active-duty division in the U.S. Army.

Ferrara, who serves as what he describes as ""the CEO of the Military Health System,"" brings a unique perspective to his role as principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense on all health-related matters. His purview includes oversight of the Defense Health Agency (DHA), which now manages all military treatment facilities across the globe, serving 9.5 million beneficiaries worldwide.

""It's really important for me to get to the deck plate, to get to where people are doing the work, so that I can understand it,"" Ferrara said during his visit. As a former Navy officer, he understands that each military installation has its own unique mission and character. ""I find that each site, whether it's a hospital or whether it's an operational unit, is incredibly unique. It has its own mission. It has its own texture, so to speak.""

This hands-on leadership approach drives Ferrara's frequent visits to military installations. Rather than relying solely on reports and briefings from the Pentagon, he prioritizes direct engagement with the medical professionals and support staff who deliver care daily. ""When you're back at the Pentagon, information that comes to you is always highly curated, highly filtered,"" he said. ""I don't like to think of Fort Riley or Irwin Army Community Hospital as a line on a spreadsheet or a slide on a PowerPoint. I want to see the work that's being done.""

Ferrara's visit to Fort Riley was particularly significant given the critical role the Big Red One plays in deploying forces to fight and win the nation’s wars. ""The First Division is incredibly important to the Army and to our national security,"" he said. ""So how we can support the healthcare here in rural Kansas is really important.""

The Acting Assistant Secretary recognized IACH's vital role in supporting military families, particularly through its robust obstetrics and gynecology program. He highlighted how quality healthcare for military families directly impacts recruitment, retention, and mission readiness. ""Health care for military families is one of the most important things for recruitment and retention. It also is really critical to ensuring that our soldiers are able to stay focused on their mission when they know that they or their family are getting high quality healthcare.""

Ferrara stressed the importance of maintaining a ""medically ready force"" while ensuring deployed soldiers have confidence their families receive excellent care in their absence. ""If they go downrange, they know that their family is in excellent hands,"" he said, referring to the trust soldiers must have in their military treatment facility.

Addressing concerns about potential downsizing or changes to IACH's mission, Ferrara was clear in his support for the facility. ""I don't want to downsize IACH. That's not my goal,"" he said. Instead, his focus is on enhancing the hospital's capabilities and ensuring it operates at maximum capacity. ""To me, the definition of success for a hospital is a busy hospital doing high volume, high complexity care,"" Ferrara said. ""My goal is to figure out how I can make IACH even more successful. That is the reason I'm here.""

The Acting Assistant Secretary acknowledged that IACH represents a significant investment as a relatively new facility that must be optimized for patient care and military readiness training. His vision focuses on ensuring medical personnel maintain their skills through consistent, complex patient care that will prepare them for potential deployment scenarios.

The visit reinforced Ferrara's philosophy that healthcare delivery is fundamentally about trust – what he called ""the compact that we form with those families and with those service members."" This compact represents a promise to provide the resources, personnel, equipment, and supplies necessary to deliver exceptional care.

Despite acknowledging the financial challenges facing military healthcare, Ferrara expressed admiration for the innovation and adaptability he consistently observes at military treatment facilities. ""This is a resource constrained environment. That's not a mystery to anyone,"" he said. ""What I'm always impressed by is people's ability to innovate and to adapt and to solve problems either through sweat equity or through great ideas.""

This perspective reflects his understanding that the Military Health System operates as ""a giant team sport,"" where best practices developed at one facility can benefit the entire system. His visits help identify successful innovations that can be shared across the network of military treatment facilities.

As the 1st Infantry Division trains to fight and win the nation’s wars, IACH stands ready, not just with beds and equipment, but with the trust of soldiers and the care of families.

The agency is “an important reform in the Military Health System [and] a needed reform in this era of significant challenges for [DOD] in American health care at large,” Woodson said.
“Our national security and defense strategies must be supported by a strong, relevant, agile and forward-leaning Military Health System,” he said.
“There is dramatic change occurring in American health care that will affect how we do business,” Woodson said, “and require us to refresh our thinking of health, health care, and health care delivery systems.” Rising costs, technology sub-specialization, information management access and workforce issues challenge the American health care system, he said.","The Defense Department’s new health care organization has exceeded its goals since standing up five months ago, top health care officials told the House Armed Services Committee’s personnel subcommittee here Feb. 26.

Dr. Jonathan Woodson, assistant secretary for defense for health affairs, and Air Force Lt. Gen. (Dr.) Douglas J. Robb, director of the new Defense Health Agency, appeared before subcommittee members to update them on DHA’s progression.

Both officials said the agency is ahead of expectations and goals.

DHA was established after defense leaders organized a task force three years ago to look at how to make military medicine more efficient, more effective and more affordable.

The agency is “an important reform in the Military Health System [and] a needed reform in this era of significant challenges for [DOD] in American health care at large,” Woodson said.

“Our national security and defense strategies must be supported by a strong, relevant, agile and forward-leaning Military Health System,” he said.

Good evidence exists that joint integrated care improves results in combat, Woodson said. If a service member is wounded in combat, a Navy corpsman will often be the first to treat the patient, who is then transported while receiving critical care to a military medical center staffed by all three services, where “definitive, advanced care will be given by a multiservice health care team, he explained.

The synchronized system “transcends service and command distinction [and] has resulted in the highest survival rates and the lowest case fatality rates in recorded warfare,” Woodson said.

“[Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel] has outlined his priorities for managing the significant change needed in the coming years,” Woodson said.

“These include introducing institutional reforms, re-evaluating military force planning construct, preparing for prolonged readiness challenges, protecting investments in emerging military capability, balancing forces between active and reserves and reforming personnel and compensation policies.”

Woodson said he has six lines of effort to support Hagel’s priorities:

-- Modernizing Military Health System management with an enterprise focus;

-- Defining and delivering medical capabilities needed in the 21st century;

-- Investing in and expanding strategic partnerships;

-- Assessing the balance of DOD’s medical core structure;

-- Modernizing the TRICARE health program, and

-- Defining the Military Health System’s global health engagement requirement.

Those efforts will help DOD meet its “overwhelming” aims of readiness, improve the health of people it serves, improve the experience of care in the military and responsibly manage costs, Woodson said.

By modernizing management structure, DHA represents a major DOD milestone and is a starting point for comprehensive enterprise-wide reform, he said.

“There is dramatic change occurring in American health care that will affect how we do business,” Woodson said, “and require us to refresh our thinking of health, health care, and health care delivery systems.”

Rising costs, technology sub-specialization, information management access and workforce issues challenge the American health care system, he said.

“Health systems across the country -- including ours -- are focused on ways to reduce variation in care, improve patient safety and more effectively use health information technology to improve clinical decision-making and outcomes,” Woodson said. “Within the military, there are additional imperatives for designing an integrated health system which includes more joint phasing, joint operations and maintaining readiness.”

DOD Health Affairs, the Military Health System and DHA are partnered in such a process, he said.

“We have created agile governance for policy and enterprise-wide operational decision-making,” Woodson said. “We are holding ourselves accountable using a disciplined process for identifying opportunities in using comments [and] enterprise-wide performance measures to see and check what we are doing.”

DHA uses the Government Accountability Office’s approach to conduct business case analyses and business process re-engineering efforts, Woodson said.

DHA director Robb said his agency “stands as a supporting organization, ensuring that the combatant commanders and the service medical departments have the resource support” to meet their missions.

“We have made significant progress in the first 150 days of this reform effort. And we are in-track with most of our major milestones,” he said.

The discipline and rigor necessary to “do business” also has given DHA insight into its most-challenging issues and in some cases has allowed it to “rapidly introduce new processes,” Robb told legislators.

“We have accelerated timelines for implementation and achieved savings, reduce variation and streamlined processes earlier than initially projected,” he said.

One role of DHA is managing numerous “shared services” that combine activities like medical information technology, medical logistics and TRICARE for the Army, Navy and Air Force.

For example, Robb said, identifying and changing buying behaviors in medical logistics is putting DOD’s health care on a path “to cover our investment costs and save over $10 million when we previously projected no savings for this year.”

Another $25 million in savings this fiscal year has been identified by consolidating service medical chief information officers into DHA, he added.

“The most significant cost savings potential for the department still remains in the purchase health care sector,” Robb said. “Our efforts to improve the execution of the TRICARE health plan are focused on the long-term systemic challenges, and how we better integrate our direct care and private-care health services delivery and contract for health care support.”

As the existing generation of TRICARE contracts expires, DOD is looking at reshaping contracts to take advantage of strategic sourcing, improving integration with military medical facilities, reducing unnecessary overhead, and achieving more simplicity and flexibility for its patients and the government, the DHA director said.

“[We’re] proud of the work we have accomplished,” Robb said, “But [we’re] even more eager to identify ways we can integrate our system on behalf of the incredible people that we are privileged to serve.”

KAISERSLAUTERN, Germany — Defense Department civilian workers and contractors stationed overseas can once again undergo rape kit exams at U.S. military medical facilities, following a reversal of a short-lived policy that had restricted their access to such care.

In recent weeks the Military Health System rescinded a March 13 directive to medical providers that limited rape test kits at overseas military treatment facilities to people enrolled in Tricare, the military’s health insurance program.

That policy effectively excluded most DOD civilian workers who aren’t spouses or dependents of service members.

It required those civilians to seek forensic evidence collection at foreign clinics, which have different standards for processing evidence. Such evidence would be easier to discredit at court-martial, according to defense attorneys who spoke with Stars and Stripes in April.

On June 20, the acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, Dr. Stephen Ferrara, reversed the policy.

The updated guidance permits adult civilians who aren’t enrolled in Tricare to receive emergency medical treatment, including forensic exams and limited follow-up care, for up to 30 days after a sexual assault. Tricare will cover the cost and the patient will not be billed for services.

“This will ensure non-beneficiaries seeking care at an MTF have access to the care they need following a sexual assault,” a Military Health System officials said in response to questions Wednesday.

About 35,000 federal civilian employees support 172,000 active-duty service members stationed overseas, according to Defense Department data from December 2024, with the largest civilian populations living in Germany, Japan and South Korea.

The U.S. military has detailed protocols for handling evidence after an assault allegation, including rules about the chain of custody.

But outside the military, collection methods can vary by country, and different cultural attitudes around sexual assault could dissuade victims from seeking help off base.

The Military Health System is working on additional implementation guidance, according to the command.",https://www.stripes.com/incoming/tfcho6-040725testkitsphoto01.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/040725TESTKITSphoto01.jpg,N,1.0,2025-07-03 12:57:11.481046
