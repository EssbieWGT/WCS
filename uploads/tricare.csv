What you need to know about rabies:

‒ It is an infection caused by a virus that is transmitted in the saliva of infected animals.

‒ It is transmitted by a bite or contact with infected saliva through open wounds, nose or mouth.

‒ Wild animals are the most likely potential source of rabies for both humans and pets.

‒ If you are bitten or scratched by an animal, it is critical you seek medical care immediately. Without proper treatment, rabies is almost always fatal.

All Active Duty and Tricare beneficiaries can be seen at the Medical Group. If you are seen off base, please follow-up with your Primary Care Manager because we still need to track the incident.

If you are a civilian, and it happened while at work, you can be evaluated at Operational Medicine Services, building 207. If you are a contractor, please seek care at your approved medical facility.

How to protect yourself and your pet:

‒ Vaccinate your pets against rabies.

‒ Avoid contact with stray or wild animals or any animal exhibiting unusual behaviors.

‒ Bat-proof your home.

‒ Teach your children how to protect themselves.

‒ Do not feed stray pets or wildlife.

Redirecting Funds to Strengthen Military Power Rather than simply cutting costs, the Pentagon plans to reinvest the saved $5.1 billion into critical defense projects.
For years, critics have pointed to excessive defense spending on consultants and nonessential programs as evidence of mismanagement.
Hegseth’s plan aims to tackle those critiques head-on, signaling a culture shift within the Pentagon toward leaner and smarter governance.","In a significant move to curb unnecessary spending and refocus its priorities, the U.S. Department of Defense has announced it will slash $5.1 billion worth of contracts. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, spearheading the initiative, said the cuts are designed to reduce reliance on outside consultants and redirect those resources to core military functions, high-tech innovation, and national security.

With a staggering annual budget of $850 billion and nearly two million employees, the Pentagon is the largest federal agency. However, it has also come under repeated scrutiny for its sprawling expenditures and opaque budget practices. Hegseth’s latest cost-cutting push marks one of the boldest efforts in recent years to tackle these longstanding concerns.

Big Consulting Contracts Get the Axe

A major target of these cuts: high-dollar consulting agreements. Prominent firms like Accenture, Deloitte, and Booz Allen Hamilton will feel the impact, especially those providing services to the Defense Health Agency.

Hegseth took to social media platform X to explain that canceling these deals alone will save $1.8 billion. These contracts, he emphasized, often added little strategic value and duplicated tasks that could be handled internally.

Among the biggest cuts:

A $1.4 billion contract for cloud software reselling

A $500 million business consulting deal with the U.S. Navy

A $500 million DARPA contract for IT help-desk services, which Hegseth bluntly called “completely duplicative”

Bringing the Work Back Home

Hegseth’s message is clear: the Pentagon’s own personnel are capable of doing much of the work currently outsourced. In an internal memo, he stated that civilian employees and existing government systems can manage many of the services currently farmed out to consultants.

For example, the Air Force’s contract with Accenture for cloud IT procurement could be handled by in-house procurement experts, he argued. To put that plan into action, Hegseth has directed the Pentagon’s Chief Information Officer to team up with Elon Musk’s task force over the next month. Their mission: craft a strategy to shift IT consulting and management work back inside the department and ensure more competitive pricing on cloud services.

Cutting Back on Non-Military Spending

The cuts don’t stop at IT contracts. Hegseth has also axed several agreements tied to programs that he says stray from the Pentagon’s core mission. Funding for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, climate programs, and COVID-19 response efforts has been pulled.

“These issues might matter in other spaces, but within the Department of Defense, our job is to ensure military readiness and national security,” Hegseth said. “We can’t afford to be distracted or stretched thin.”

This stance marks a shift in how the Pentagon prioritizes spending, signaling a move away from broader policy initiatives and toward a laser focus on defense and preparedness.

Redirecting Funds to Strengthen Military Power

Rather than simply cutting costs, the Pentagon plans to reinvest the saved $5.1 billion into critical defense projects. The money will now support programs aimed at enhancing the country’s defense capabilities and technological edge.

Priority investments include:

Missile defense systems to counter emerging global threats

Hypersonic weapons development to stay ahead in strategic warfare

Artificial intelligence (AI) to improve logistics, decision-making, and battlefield intelligence

Cybersecurity enhancements to guard against increasing digital threats from foreign adversaries

According to Hegseth, these are the areas that will define the future of warfare—and where the U.S. must maintain an undisputed edge.

A Strategic Shift in Defense Thinking

This overhaul reflects a larger shift in how the Department of Defense is thinking about its operations and responsibilities. Instead of outsourcing tasks that its own people can do, the department is embracing a model of self-reliance, efficiency, and accountability.

For years, critics have pointed to excessive defense spending on consultants and nonessential programs as evidence of mismanagement. Hegseth’s plan aims to tackle those critiques head-on, signaling a culture shift within the Pentagon toward leaner and smarter governance.

Looking Ahead

In the coming weeks and months, the Pentagon will begin the process of transitioning responsibilities from contractors to internal staff. This will involve restructuring, retraining, and reevaluating how key functions are managed.

Meanwhile, negotiations with tech vendors and cloud providers are expected to result in more favorable contract terms, ultimately saving taxpayers even more money while ensuring the military gets what it needs.

While some experts caution there could be short-term disruptions, others see this shift as necessary and overdue. The long-term goal is a more focused, transparent, and agile defense force.",https://techstory.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-15-at-3.05.39-PM-125x125.png,N,0.0,2025-04-15 11:56:21.101916

Swanson started her career as a staff psychologist at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, Texas. After nearly a decade working as a mental health provider, Swanson was selected for the Department of the Air Force Legislative Liaison Fellowship program, launching her on a journey to learn more about the operational health care policies that impact fellow medics.

Swanson transitioned from patient care to supporting health care policy in June 2022, serving as an executive officer for retired U.S. Air Force Maj. Gen. Sharon Bannister, the former director of medical operations for the Office of the Surgeon General. During that time, Swanson contributed to strategic policy execution, gaining firsthand experience in the operational aspects of Air Force Medical Service and assisting in the transfer of medical treatment facilities administration and management to the Defense Health Agency.

In the summer of 2023, Swanson began her DAF Legislative Fellowship, completing a six-month tour at the Department of State in the East Asian Pacific Bureau within the Legislative Affairs department. This was followed by a year-long fellowship in the U.S. House of Representatives with Congressman Rick McCormick (GA-06), a role in which she provided support for his work with the House Armed Services Committee.

Swanson viewed her role as a bridge between Airmen and policymakers, leveraging her experiences as an Air Force medic to foster an informed environment in drafting legislation related to the TRICARE health care program and gathering information about suicide prevention efforts within the AFMS community.

“It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience,” she said of her fellowship, and the unique opportunity to serve as the first defense policy fellow for McCormick’s office.

Swanson’s leadership experiences extend beyond policy to include community-building initiatives. She played a crucial role in the ONE Fairchild Initiative at Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington, fostering a sense of belonging for Airmen by creating support networks through interest-based clubs. Swanson led similar community efforts as chief of the disaster mental health team at Osan Air Base, Korea, and at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico.

“People everywhere just want to feel like they belong and that they are connected,” she explained. “It’s never just one person. It’s the people who become part of that community who continue to make it work.”

Reflecting on her career, Swanson emphasized the importance of leadership in driving meaningful change.

“I love leading people because I love understanding people, finding ways to bring people together and helping them meet their full potential,” she said. “In my career, the more I develop that skill, the better able I will be at ensuring that we take good care of our health care beneficiaries and our medics.”

Swanson provided advice, urging early and mid-career Airmen and Guardians to seek mentors who can share their wisdom and, most importantly, to view failure as a lesson for growth.

“Everybody's journey is different. Be willing to admit when you're wrong. Be willing to make changes and give yourself grace. And have fun along the way because it goes by very quickly.”

As Swanson continues to bridge the gap between military health and policy, her pursuit of enhancing health and readiness in the AFMS community exemplifies the Air Force’s principles of integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all they do.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2504/8974325/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-15 10:56:26.087749

Zynex’s Disappointing Fourth Quarter Results

ZYXI share price depression stems from its disastrous 4Q 2024 earnings release. The Englewood, Colorado-based firm reported fourth-quarter 2024 revenue of $46.0 million, a roughly 2% year-over-year decline, falling short of Wall Street's expectations. The company also swung to a net loss of $0.02 per share, a stark contrast to the $0.04 net income per share reported in the same period last year.

The disappointing results reportedly prompted RBC Capital Markets to downgrade Zynex to Sector Perform from Outperform. According to news outlets, in a report to its clients, RBC analyst Shagun Singh cited a ""lack of visibility"" into the company's operations and commercial outlook, particularly concerning its relationship with Tricare, the military health program that represents a significant portion of Zynex's revenue.

Singh reportedly noted that Tricare, Zynex's largest customer, has temporarily suspended payments amid an ongoing review of prior claims. Singh added that the company's decision to withhold 2025 guidance and implement a 15% workforce reduction further compounded investor concerns. Singh revised RBC’s price target for Zynex shares to $5.50, down from $11.00, warning of a potential ""domino effect"" stemming from Tricare's payment suspension.

Zynex Securities Class Action

Adding to Zynex’s woes, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the District Court of Colorado, alleging that the company made false and misleading statements regarding its revenue recognition practices and its relationship with Tricare. The suit, captioned Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., et al., seeks to represent investors who purchased Zynex securities between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

The complaint alleges that Zynex engaged in “oversupplying” customers with products, including electrodes, leading to inflated revenue figures. It further claims that this practice drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare, and that Zynex failed to disclose the potential for adverse consequences, such as removal from insurer networks and government penalties.

According to the complaint, revelations of Zynex's alleged practices surfaced with a June 4, 2024 report by medical journal STAAT detailing an ""oversupplying scheme"" involving excessive shipments of supplies and subsequent inflated billing. The report also indicated that insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

The truth allegedly emerged on March 11, 2025, when Zynex reported its dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The complaint highlights Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard’s attributing the fourth-quarter revenue shortfall to ""slower than normal payments from certain payers"" and the Tricare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. “We are examining Zynex's financial reporting and business practices. We believe investors deserve a complete and transparent understanding of these events,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Beneficiaries of Treatment, Resources, and Insurance for Active-Duty and Retired Military Personnel and their Families, or TRICARE, in the affected counties can obtain emergency prescription refills at any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. The charge was made in hopes of assisting people in maintaining access to necessary medications.

The counties affected by the waiver include Bartholomew, Brown, Clark, Crawford, Dearborn, Delaware, Gibson, Hamilton, Harrison, Lake, Madison, Marshall, Martin, Owen, Perry, Posey, Spencer, and Warrick.

Beneficiaries are being advised to bring their prescription bottles to the pharmacy where the original prescription was filled. If the prescription bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged, they should contact Express Scripts Inc. or their retail network pharmacy for assistance. To locate a network pharmacy, beneficiaries can call Express Scripts at 877-363-1303 or use the network pharmacy locator online.

Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be refilled at any store in the same chain.

TRICARE beneficiaries, excluding active duty service members, can receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider without needing a referral. This allows them to seek nonemergency care if their primary care provider is unavailable due to the storm.

On Thursday, the Department of Defense announced that Hegseth had signed a memorandum directing the “termination” of $5.1 billion in “wasteful Defense Department contracts.” “That’s with a ‘B’—$5.1 billion in DOD contracts for ancillary things like consulting and other nonessential services,” Hegseth said in a video message on Thursday.
Hegseth explained that the Pentagon’s new cuts include $1.8 billion in consulting contracts previously awarded by the Defense Health Agency to Accenture, Booz Allen, Deloitte, and other private firms.

The cuts also include a $1.4 billion contract for cloud information technology services that was awarded to a software reseller and a $500 million U.S. Navy contract for business process consulting.

“We need this money to spend on better health care for our warfighters and their families, instead of $500 an hour business process consultant,” Hegseth said. “That’s a lot of consulting.”

In the video message, Hegseth announced that the Pentagon is terminating a $500 million Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency contract for “IT help desk services that are completely duplicative services” provided by the Department of Defense’s Defense Information Systems Agency.

Additionally, Hegseth said the Department of Defense found 11 more diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) contracts, including the Pentagon’s COVID-19 response, climate change initiatives, and “nonessential activities,” that will be terminated.

“We are committed to rooting out DEI — root and branch — throughout this department,” Hegseth said. “And we found 11 more contracts, and we’re going to keep looking.”

Later in Thursday’s video, Hegseth added, “So if you’re keeping score at home, today’s cuts bring our running total to nearly $6 billion in wasteful spending over the first six weeks of the DOD-DOGE effort here at the Defense Department.”

Hegseth emphasized that DOGE’s “job” at the Department of Defense is to identify the “stuff” that the Pentagon can eliminate to better use the American taxpayers’ money for “war-fighting capabilities.”

The defense secretary concluded his video, saying, “We’re excited to make these cuts on behalf of you, the taxpayer, and the warfighters here at the department.”",https://americanmilitarynews.com/wp-content/uploads/16502572780_3c0cfd60ca_z.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-14 19:56:26.636613

These changes focus on improving access to services, modernizing facilities, and addressing staffing shortages within the U.S. Department of Defense.

Enhancing Military Readiness

The MHS is implementing reforms aimed at enhancing military readiness by ensuring that service members receive timely and effective medical care.

This initiative underscores the importance of maintaining a healthy and prepared military force capable of responding to various challenges.

Stephen Ferrara, performing the duties of the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, emphasized that readiness cannot be secondary.

He stated,

You cannot do readiness at the last minute. You cannot cram for readiness. When it comes to mission success, readiness is everything.

Modernizing Facilities

The FY 2025 budget allocates funds for modernizing military health facilities.

Improved infrastructure aims to provide better care environments for service members and their families.

These upgrades are essential for maintaining high standards in military healthcare delivery.

TRICARE Developments

TRICARE, the health program serving military personnel and their families, has undergone significant changes with new regional contractors.

These adjustments aim to improve access to specialized care and streamline healthcare services across different regions.

Addressing Staffing Challenges

The MHS is actively working to address staffing shortages within its facilities.

This effort includes recruiting qualified healthcare professionals to meet growing demands.

Adequate staffing levels are crucial for delivering timely medical attention worldwide.

MHS GENESIS Implementation

The implementation of MHS GENESIS, an advanced electronic health record system, is a critical component of ongoing reforms.

This system aims to enhance data management capabilities and improve patient care coordination across all branches of the military health system.

Parting Shot

The ongoing reforms within the Military Health System are vital for ensuring that U.S. service members receive top-notch medical care while maintaining operational readiness.

By focusing on modernization efforts and addressing staffing challenges, these initiatives contribute significantly to national security by supporting a resilient military force ready to face global challenges effectively.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills."" The report claimed Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

If they now live more than 30 minutes but less than 100 miles away, they won't have to do anything to keep their Tricare Prime coverage and primary care manager.
If patients have moved more than 100 miles away from a Tricare Prime Service Area, they must decide within 90 days to switch to another plan.
""The Defense Health Agency to their credit has worked diligently with me, with the contract, to have those bills paid as quickly as possible.
But as we are continuing through this transformation, we are finding more and more places that we are challenged [to find] health care providers,"" Honea said.","Beneficiaries who live within 100 miles of a military hospital or clinic but at least 30 minutes away by car no longer need to request a waiver to stay with Tricare Prime, the Defense Department's managed-care health program.

Under the next-generation Tricare contracts that went into effect Jan. 1, patients who move to a location outside that access standard for primary care can choose to receive care at the DoD facility or, if they already receive care there, keep their primary care manager without seeking a waiver.

According to the Defense Health Agency, beneficiaries who meet the criteria will receive a letter notifying them that their homes are outside the access-standard measure, but if they don't respond, they will remain with their current primary care managers, or PCMs, at their military treatment facility.

Those who want to change primary care managers, however, can do so by following instructions in the letter.

""This new approach will help prevent unnecessary coverage gaps and ensure families keep access to their PCMs,"" said Shane Pham, a DHA management and program analyst, in a news release last week.

The change was among the requirements of the new contracts, known as T-5, which were issued to TriWest Healthcare Alliance in the Tricare West Region and Humana Military in the Tricare East Region on Jan. 1.

The allowance also coincides with an effort at the Defense Department to bring family members and military retirees back into military hospitals and clinics to ensure that the facilities have enough patients to maintain provider proficiency and curb the rising costs of private-sector care.

According to a memo issued Dec. 6, 2023, by then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks, the DoD hopes to increase the number of patients seen at military treatment facilities by 7% by the end of 2026, or a total of 3.3 million patients.

In a speech to uniformed and civilian federal health officials in March, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Dr. Stephen Ferrara said the DoD is pursuing the efforts in order to create a high-functioning medical system.

""The last thing that a family or that service member needs is to be worried about whether their family is getting adequate or high-quality care,"" Ferrara said.

According to Tricare officials, the decision to drop the drive time waiver was made based on patient satisfaction surveys showing that many beneficiaries are willing to drive more than 30 minutes to keep their primary care doctors and would prefer not to switch physicians.

If a Tricare Prime beneficiary moves more than 30 minutes from their PCM, their Tricare regional contract will contact all adult patients in the household by phone, text, mail and email to provide options for continuing their health coverage.

Patients will have 90 days to decide what to do. If they now live more than 30 minutes but less than 100 miles away, they won't have to do anything to keep their Tricare Prime coverage and primary care manager. Or they can switch health plans -- to Tricare Select or the U.S. Family Health Program, if it is available in their region.

If patients have moved more than 100 miles away from a Tricare Prime Service Area, they must decide within 90 days to switch to another plan. They will be dropped from Tricare Prime after 90 days and will be able to be seen at a military hospital or clinic only if space is available.

Defense Health Agency officials urge all beneficiaries to ensure that their addresses are updated in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System, or DEERS, and they also should check the email addresses and phone numbers the DoD has on file for accuracy.

Since the contract changeover Jan. 1, Tricare providers and patients have experienced disruptions to patient care and payments, resulting in patients having to switch providers or delay care and prompting providers to take out loans to pay staff while they wait for reimbursements.

The problems have caught the eye of lawmakers on Capitol Hill as well as military leadership, including the services' top enlisted leaders.

During a hearing last week before the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees military construction, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy James Honea said he personally has received complaints from providers about the reimbursement delays.

""The Defense Health Agency to their credit has worked diligently with me, with the contract, to have those bills paid as quickly as possible. But as we are continuing through this transformation, we are finding more and more places that we are challenged [to find] health care providers,"" Honea said.

Last month, Republican Reps. John Rutherford and Aaron Bean of Florida wrote to David Smith, the acting DHA director, asking him to explain the delays and fix them.

""It would be unacceptable for military families to lose access to critical care coverage. This crisis must be immediately rectified,"" they wrote.

As Teyhen departs to serve as Director of Defense Health Network Indo-Pacific and Commanding General of Medical Readiness Command, Pacific, her blueprint for leadership remains.","After nearly two years of visionary leadership, U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Deydre Teyhen relinquished directorship of the Defense Health Network–National Capital Region on April 14, leaving behind a health system that is a benchmark for integration, innovation, and operational readiness within the Military Health System.

While the outcomes speak for themselves—higher patient satisfaction, increased virtual care, streamlined access, and a stronger, more connected workforce—Teyhen attributes it all to one essential ingredient: ‘how’.

“We often focus on the 5W’s: who, what, when, where, and why—but in the NCR, we focused on the ‘how,’” said Teyhen during her final remarks. “How we lead, how we build trust, and how we treat our people and patients. How is critical in leading the joy and soul back to medicine. Governance gave us the foundation to transform this network into an integrated healthcare system that focused on making it better for our patients and our staff.”

Teyhen championed a robust governance model that ensured every facility, specialty, and stakeholder had a seat at the table. Leaders from hospitals and clinics in the network were voting members on the Board of Directors, four systemwide committees, and 14 functional councils. The result was a culture of shared decision-making that accelerated alignment and eliminated roadblocks to execution.

This approach focused on bringing the joy and soul back to medicine enabled:

• 98% of capability and capacity changes to be implemented through formal governance pathways.

• Elimination of stand-alone decision-making, ensuring consistent follow-through across all sites.

• 2600+ missions processed, distributed, and closed—a testament to the network’s operational efficiency.

“Our governance process wasn’t a checkbox,” said Teyhen. “It was a strategy. It’s what enabled execution, collaboration, and ownership at every level.”

Dr. David Smith, Acting Director of the Defense Health Agency, underscored the far-reaching impact of this model.

“Brig. Gen. Teyhen embodies what effective, decisive leadership looks like,” said Smith. “She built a system where facilities weren’t just part of the network; they were the engine of it. Her leadership proves that when you empower those who are delivering health care every day, results follow.”

With governance guiding every initiative, the NCR reached historic highs across multiple operational fronts:

• Enrollment and Access: 12,000 additional patients enrolled; thousands of new primary care appointments added monthly. The improvements in access to care resulted in decreased use civilian urgent care clinics.

• Virtual Health: Expanded across the DHN-NCR from 22 to 154 clinics; 495 providers offering over 3,000 virtual visits per week.

• Surgical Optimization: Operating room utilization exceeded 81%, reaching the highest case volumes since 2022.

• Accreditation: Six successful Joint Commission surveys—including both Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and A.T. Augusta Military Medical Center—were completed without major findings.

• CMS Recognition: A.T. Augusta Military Medical Center earned 5-star status from CMS, placing it in the top 8% of hospitals nationwide.

• Graduate Medical Education: 98% first-time board pass rate across 51 programs.

Using governance to align specialties and streamline care delivery, DHN-NCR improved both internal operations and patient outcomes:

• Horizontal integration initiatives such as “mammograms while you wait,” over-the-counter prenatal vitamin access, and remote pharmacy activation removed barriers to care and improved health outcomes.

• Vertical integration across product lines like orthopedics and pulmonary ensured patients moved more seamlessly between their primary care and specialty care providers.

• A standardized bed report improved real-time patient flow, while credentialing and privileging processes were harmonized, reducing time to complete the privileging process by 34%.

Governance also played a role in transforming the region’s culture. Under Teyhen’s leadership:

• Burnout dropped 4% in less than 1 year, supported by frontline leadership training for more than 450 personnel and the launch of My Military Health huddle programs.

• Well-being was 39% higher among staff engaged in effective daily team huddles.

• Engagement survey participation rose to 67%, far exceeding the industry standard.

In communications, all 34 MTFs focused on improving our patients’ ability to navigate the healthcare system. A redesigned patient guidebook served as the foundation for beneficiary education, while outreach campaigns for MHS GENESIS and My Military Health helped staff and patients transition confidently to new digital platforms.

As Teyhen departs to serve as Director of Defense Health Network Indo-Pacific and Commanding General of Medical Readiness Command, Pacific, her blueprint for leadership remains.

“I’ve had many incredible roles, but the NCR was special,” Teyhen said. “Because here, I got to lead a team that believed the ‘how’ matters—that excellence, trust, and compassion aren’t just values, but ways of doing the work. We worked hard to bring the joy and soul back to medicine. And we did it together.”",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,1.0,2025-04-14 16:56:20.175644

Steele Sr. Chapter in Arlington, Va., hosted a “Financial Readiness Bootcamp” for 25 Arnold Air Society students, Airmen from the 317th Recruiting Squadron, and more on April 2, 2025. The event was held in recognition of National Financial Literacy Month, observed each April to promote smart money habits and lifelong financial well-being.

Military members face unique financial challenges including frequent moves, complex pay structures, and the stress of deployments, all of which can all lead to financial strain. Many young Airmen and Guardians enter service with limited financial education and are vulnerable to predatory lending or poor money habits. This makes early financial readiness training critical for both individual well-being and mission success.

Among the 25 attendees was a strong turnout from the Arnold Air Society squadrons at the University of Maryland and Howard University. Members of the Steele Chapter and the 317th Recruiting Squadron were also in attendance, including Brig. Gen. Houston Cantwell, USAF (Ret.), a senior resident fellow at the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies.

The event was hosted at Nighthawk Pizza, a Community Partner of the Steele Chapter located downstairs from AFA’s national operations center.

Chapter Secretary Bob Hill, a 25-year Air Force veteran and former financial advisor for 24 years, led the workshop. His session focused on military-specific financial topics such as basic pay, special pay, allowances, TRICARE, SGLI, and the Thrift Savings Plan. He then introduced key personal finance principles: budgeting, saving, debt management, and long-term investing.

“You need to focus the same Airman’s discipline expected of you as a professional to your personal finances,” Hill emphasized. He encouraged cadets to “pay yourself first,” live below their means, and always plan for the unexpected. Hill also reminded participants that the most important word in the event’s title is “Readiness.”

“The Air Force and Space Force expect you to lead, to serve, and to complete the mission. You can’t do that if financial stress is holding you back,” he said.

Programs like the Financial Readiness Bootcamp equip future Airmen and Guardians with the tools to make smart decisions, reduce stress, and stay mission-ready. As one student said, “Every cadet needs to hear this important information and take action.”

The chapter plans to offer more Financial Readiness Bootcamps in the future to support the next generation of Airmen and Guardians.",https://www.afa.org/app/uploads/2025/04/Steele-Financial-Bootcamp-1.jpeg,N,0.0,2025-04-14 18:56:29.366188

""We are the only U.S. health care system that goes to war,"" said Ferrara, who deployed four times when he served as an active-duty Navy surgeon.
Ferrara said his priorities for the Military Health System are increasing the lethality of the warfighter, sustaining the skills of the medical force and ensuring accessible, high-quality and sustainable care.
""We do this by having a ready medical force so we can provide strong battlefield care and keep guns in the fight.""

""Readiness cannot be secondary,"" he said. ""You cannot do readiness at the last minute. You cannot cram for readiness. When it comes to mission success, readiness is everything.""

Ferrara, appointed in January 2025, has delivered that message at speaking engagements, visits to military hospitals and clinics, town hall forums and interviews.

""We are the only U.S. health care system that goes to war,"" said Ferrara, who deployed four times when he served as an active-duty Navy surgeon.

""When America's sons and daughters go downrange and go into harm's way, we honor the pact we made with them and with their parents, that should they become ill or injured, they will receive prompt and effective medical attention anywhere in the world,"" he said. ""That is the trust that we have. That's something that our adversaries don't always have, and it gives us an incredible strategic edge.""

Ferrara said his priorities for the Military Health System are increasing the lethality of the warfighter, sustaining the skills of the medical force and ensuring accessible, high-quality and sustainable care.

""We have to support the warfighter, sustain our skills and strengthen our chain,"" he said, adding that the chain is the continued evolution and modernization of the health care system to improve access, quality and safety.

""If we support, sustain and strengthen, that is how we build a system that will fight and win because fundamentally, this is what our job is: to fight and win,"" Ferrara said. ""We do this by having a ready medical force so we can provide strong battlefield care and keep guns in the fight.""

Referring to readiness as both a medical and moral imperative, Ferrara noted that part of his role is conveying to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth how the MHS is aligned with his priority of force lethality. He said the MHS optimizes warfighter performance by sustaining the readiness of the military force and those charged with their care and recovery.

This year, the Defense Health Program budget is approximately $61 billion, about 7% of the Pentagon's topline budget. Ferrara said he uses that budget to make the force more lethal and more ""fit to fight and win.""

""It starts with maintaining the ready medical force,"" he explained. ""We must ensure that every member of the team — from the surgeon who wields a scalpel, to the logistician who procured the scalpel; from the nurse who transfuses the blood, to the team who runs the blood bank — is at the top of their game.

“And that’s where it causes that really characteristic, painful rash.” What are the first signs of shingles?
How does the shingles vaccine work?
And the shingles vaccine could help prevent dementia.
If you’ve recently had shingles, Felley said most doctors will wait for a year before giving you the vaccine.","About one in three people in the United States will get shingles during their lifetime, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

It’s not deadly, but there is a painful rash that lingers for two to four weeks. The most common complication is postherpetic neuralgia, which is long-term nerve pain that lasts for months to years after the rash clears.

Dr. Laura Felley is an infectious disease physician at Emplify Health in La Crosse. She treats the most serious cases of shingles where the virus has traveled to the central nervous system, causing meningitis or encephalitis.

WPR’s “The Larry Meiller Show” recently talked about shingles with Felley. Here are the biggest takeaways from the discussion.

What is shingles, and what causes it?

The Varicella zoster virus causes shingles, Felley said. It’s a herpes virus — the same one behind chickenpox and meningitis.

After you’ve had chicken pox, the virus takes root in your nerves. There, it can stay dormant for decades until a change or stress to your immune system awakens the virus.

“When the virus wakes back up, it travels down along the nerve root to the skin,” Felley said. “And that’s where it causes that really characteristic, painful rash.”

What are the first signs of shingles?

There are a few warning signs of shingles before the rash appears on the skin. You might experience prodromal pain, Felley said. That’s pain or tingling under the skin where the rash will eventually develop, typically in stripes on one side of the body.

Additionally, the CDC website says you might also run a fever.

Felley said it’s important to get to the doctor as soon as you notice the beginning of the painful rash. Taking prescribed oral antivirals within 72 hours of the rash’s appearance might clear the rash quicker and reduce the amount of pain you experience.

“Being vigilant and not being shy about talking to your doctor, [that] things just aren’t feeling right is really the way to go,” Felley said.

How does the shingles vaccine work?

Essentially, the shingles vaccine bolsters your immune system’s response to the virus. The CDC says the Shingrix formulation is 90 percent effective at preventing shingles and postherpetic neuralgia in adults ages 50 and older with healthy immune systems.

Felley recommended getting the vaccine after age 50 because you lose your immunity to the initial chicken pox infection you suffered as a child. If you have a weakened immune system, you might get the vaccine earlier than 50.

The vaccine is a series of two shots, Felley said. Get the second dose within two to six months of receiving the first. You only need to get it once — it’s not needed annually like the flu shot.

The shot might cause irritation or swelling at the injection site. Felley said up to 10 percent of people experience systemic reactions like muscle pain, fatigue or a headache.

“I view it as just a very small investment of your time overall to prevent some real misery later on,” Felley said.

And the shingles vaccine could help prevent dementia. A study out of Wales shows that people who received an older formulation of the vaccine were 20 percent less likely to develop dementia over time than those who were unvaccinated.

If you’ve recently had shingles, Felley said most doctors will wait for a year before giving you the vaccine.

What about taking care of the rash?

Keep the rash clean, covered and don’t let anyone touch it, Felley said. The open sores provide a way for the virus to spread to others.

The rash will crust over in seven to 10 days.

“It can take a little while for the scabs to fall off after that,” Felley said. “Do not pick at them. Just leave them be. They will fall off on their own, even if they’re itchy.”",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/town-center-pharmacist-angelina-cox-prepares-a-dose-9b14d7.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-14 15:56:36.028502

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

The Army's Medical Center of Excellence, which developed the EFMB tests, describes their purpose as measuring ""a Soldier's physical fitness and ability to perform to standards of excellent in a broad spectrum of critical medical, evacuation and warrior skills.""

The EFMB is notoriously hard to earn; the overall pass rate is typically less than 30%. Earning the badge is a demonstration of the recipients’ achievement of a high standard of readiness.

“EFMB testing is designed to be stressful,” says Choi, a research biochemist who earned the EFMB on his first attempt. “It’s often just you and a stone-faced grader while you navigate and perform the tasks in front of you. It could be warm and sunny outside, but the air is cold and stiff, the testing area is completely silent, and you find yourself second-guessing your approach, your knowledge, and your instincts. There’s almost no room for error, and any little mistake could potentially be your last.”

The competitors singled out the cadre for praise for their support throughout the training and competition weeks. The sharing of knowledge and expertise among peers is an important technique for improving Warfighter resilience, adaptability, and lethality.

“The instructors really wanted all of us to succeed,” says Terrell, a research biochemist for whom this was his second attempt to earn the badge. “They spent lots of extra time with us in study halls, and if anybody had any questions, they were out there with us. They were also at the testing site 24/7. It's not like they went to a hotel or back to their house every night. They were going through it with us, which was really cool.”

Fantone, a microbiologist who earned the EFMB on her first attempt, says that having a good attitude, being open to learning and putting in a lot of effort are crucial for improving the odds of success – characteristics that are vital for meeting the Army’s high standards of readiness for both individuals as well as at the unit level.

“The EFMB will humble you and find your weaknesses,” says Fantone. “But that's what I like about it. It was fun because you actually learn your weaknesses as well as your strengths out there, and discover what you need to work on.”

A common theme among EFMB competitors is how the experience energizes them to tackle the next career challenge and continue honing and improving their Warfighter and medical skill sets, such as pursuing Air Assault, Airborne, or Ranger badges.

“You get such a drive to do it while you're there, you have to forget about everything else,” says Anandzi, the NCO In Charge of USAMRIID’s Pathology Division. “There is so much to remember in such a short period of time that once you start to realize that you can actually do this, then it's like oxygen. You just want to go back and just keep it. You practice so much that you can’t get it out of your head afterward!”

Following the award ceremony, MRDC’s Command Sgt. Maj. Michael Dills presented Anandzi, Choi, Fantone, and Terrell with the Sergeant Major’s and Commander's Coins for their accomplishments.

“I think everybody who went through the competition had a rewarding experience,” says Terrell. “It didn't seem to me like any of the Soldiers who didn’t earn the badge had any reservations about going again. All of them had the shared mentality of, ‘I will definitely be back!’”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2504/8972752/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-14 12:56:21.295736

What are common upper extremity injuries?
Military injury data indicate that among the upper extremities, the shoulder is the most commonly injured body area.
Shoulder injuries can be more severe and require a longer recovery period than lower extremity injuries.
Over two-thirds (69%) of military injuries are cumulative microtraumatic injuries that result from overuse.","Service members experience 25 million limited duty days annually due to injuries, most of which are musculoskeletal injuries, also known as MSKI.

When on limited duty status, a service member may not be able to maintain required training activities and may not be deployable. As a result, the combat readiness of the U.S. military forces is substantially reduced by MSKI, costing the Department of Defense billions of dollars annually.

“For decades, the data have consistently shown that MSKI are the primary reason for service members’ medical visits,” says Dr. Bruce Jones, a retired Army physician and current senior advisor to the Defense Health Agency-Public Health Clinical Public Health and Epidemiology Directorate in Aberdeen, Maryland. “Though MSKI most commonly occur in lower body areas such as the knees, legs, ankles and feet, approximately 20% of all military medically reported injuries are to upper extremity areas, such as to shoulders, elbows, wrists, hands and fingers.”

Upper extremity injuries require unique recovery treatments that are most effective when tailored to an individual’s injury, as well as their specific work and personal activities. This treatment is provided by military Occupational Therapists Practitioners, known as OTPs, who are trained to treat service members’ upper extremity injuries from shoulders to fingertips.

“The treatment of an upper extremity injury depends on many factors: how long ago the injury occurred, the overall health of the service member, and compliance with the treatment plan,” says U.S. Army Maj. Amanda Hetzler, an OTP currently assigned to DHA-Public Health in Aberdeen.

She points to evidence that early access to OT is the leading factor in reducing a patient’s recovery time.

“The sooner we can start working with an injured service member, the better outcomes can be,” says Hetzler.

What are common upper extremity injuries?

Military injury data indicate that among the upper extremities, the shoulder is the most commonly injured body area.

Some units may be at higher risk of these injuries. For example, an analysis of medical data found that compared to other service members, military paratroopers have been treated for more acute shoulder injuries, such as fractures, sprains or dislocations of the shoulder or acromioclavicular joint (where the shoulder and collarbone meet). The data also showed paratroopers were more likely to develop shoulder overuse injuries than non-paratroopers. Shoulder injuries can be more severe and require a longer recovery period than lower extremity injuries.

While Hetzler says she also often sees acute, or single incident, pain injuries to the wrist or hand caused by a fall on outstretched hands while a service member is running and carrying gear, most injuries she has seen in the military population are the result of overuse.

Overuse injuries occur from a repeated, low-intensity force over time that damages tendon, joint, ligament, muscle and/or skeletal tissue, overwhelming the tissue’s normal ability to recover. Over two-thirds (69%) of military injuries are cumulative microtraumatic injuries that result from overuse.

Hetzler describes other upper extremity overuse injuries commonly treated by OTs:

Thumb and wrist pain, including de Quervain's Tenosynovitis and Gamer’s thumb: Also sometimes called de Quervain's tendinosis or de Quervain's tendinitis, this condition occurs when thumb tendons become inflamed and cause pain and swelling at the base of thumb into the side of the wrist or lower arm. Symptoms can include numbness and/or a sensation that your thumb is sticking when you try to move it.

Elbow and forearm pain, especially Lateral Epicondylitis: Also referred to as elbow tendonitis or sometimes tennis elbow, this condition causes pain in the affected forearm when you’re trying to complete ordinary movements such as gripping or holding even relatively light objects, turning knobs, driving, typing, or shaking hands.

What causes upper body injuries?

“Overuse injuries can be attributed to various activities that require repetitive motion such as pushing, pulling, and lifting and can also be impacted by ergonomics, tool use, and the overall strength and condition of a person,” says U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr. Emmy Hartley, an OTP currently assigned to Naval Hospital Pensacola, Florida.

Some upper body diagnoses such as ‘Gamer’s thumb’ are commonly given due to the many cases in the U.S. that are caused by excessive use of video game remote control devices and cell phones. The term ‘tennis elbow’ is frequently used because of the popularity of racquet sports that contribute to repetitive strain on the wrist, causing the condition. Although the condition ‘tennis elbow’ may be diagnosed for service members, it is rarely caused by tennis play within the military population.

“More relevant to the military, evidence has shown that certain occupations that require intense repetitive physical activity, such as shooting rifles, performing mechanic work, or carrying objects during military tasks, can increase the risk of certain upper body injuries,” says Hartley.

In addition to unique mission activities such as paratrooper duties, Hetzler recalls patients describing some examples of triggering military activities:

Pushups

Weightlifting (especially ‘snatching,’ which involves taking a wide grip on a weighted barbell, pulling it off the floor rapidly, and lifting the barbell over the head with arms outstretched in one continuous motion, placing stress on the wrist.)

Lifting of gear (loading and unloading)

“While these activities are often critical to military training or duties, the patient can often not perform them while injured,” says Hetzler. “In addition, a key part of most OT treatment plans will require a recovery period where these activities should not be performed.”

What can you do to minimize the impact of an upper extremity injury?

“The best way to reduce the impact of an injury is to prevent it from occurring. Most injuries, especially overuse injuries, are preventable,” says Jones. “Various military resources are available to help service members target key injury risk factors and improve service member readiness by reducing injury risk.”

These resources can help service members avoid injuries while maximizing fitness, and allow early accessibility to an OTP. For example, some Army units are including Holistic Health and Fitness, known as H2F, teams into their brigade formations, while Navy and Marine units have the Navy Operational Fitness and Fueling System, or NOFFS.

“If you develop a MSKI or experience painful symptoms not yet limiting you, seek immediate care,” says Hetzler. “With delayed care or a lack of proper intervention, injuries can result in reduced readiness of the unit, limited military career progression or worse—permanent disability.”

Hetzler and Hartley also highlight that OTPs can provide activity analysis of specific tasks, such as lifting, pushups, and body mechanics, while the task is being performed. These analyses result in preventive education and training that can further reduce the risk of MSKI.

“The most important step is early diagnosis and referral to an OT who will help develop and monitor your treatment plan. Especially, don’t ignore pain in joints,” says Hetzler. “Once you are under the care of an OT, of course, you need to follow the treatment plan. This is the best way to reduce your chance of a longer recovery or permanent condition.”

A memo from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on reducing the department’s spending on contracts stresses using the department’s own employees instead—so-called “contracting in.”

The memo lists several contracts recently terminated including ones with the Defense Health Agency for consulting services “that can be performed by our civilian workforce”; one with the Air Force for cloud IT procurement “which we can already fulfill directly with existing procurement resources”; and a DARPA contract for IT helpdesk services “that are duplicative with service capabilities of our existing DISA workforce.”

Hegseth’s memo follows by days one in which DoD set policies on consolidating and eliminating offices and civilian jobs under a directive telling components to conduct a review of their organizational structures and workforces.

Among numerous other provisions, that guidance says that “all functions that are not inherently governmental ( e.g., retail sales and recreation) should be prioritized for privatization.”

Want to learn more about our Stafford Lakes Village or any of our Retirement Living Communities?","The Holt Bolt program at TriCare Stafford Lakes is bridging generations, giving young people of all abilities real-world work experience while enriching the community.

At TriCare’s Stafford Lakes Retirement Community, something wonderful is happening. Every Thursday morning, a group of bright, enthusiastic young people arrive, ready to roll up their sleeves and get to work. But these aren’t just any workers – they’re part of The Holt Bolt School Leavers Employment Support Program, a life-changing initiative that helps young people with disabilities gain real-world work experience. And let’s just say, the TriCare residents have taken them in as their own.

It all started with a simple conversation. Andrea Lambie, the Village Manager at Stafford Lakes, recalls the day Toni Sutherland walked into her office. Toni, a mentor with The Holt Bolt, was looking for local area opportunities for a group of school leavers to gain work experience.

“She explained how the program works and we spoke about the kinds of tasks they could help with, and soon enough, we had three young people joining us every week.”

Now, the program has grown to four participants, and the impact has been enormous – not just for The Holt Bolt trainees, but for the entire Stafford Lakes Retirement Community.

What is The Holt Bolt School Leaver Employment Support Program Program?

Originally starting as a personal training facility, The Holt Bolt has evolved into something much bigger. Offering exercise physiology sports programs and personal training, the NDIS-approved service is also dedicated to helping young people with disabilities transition from school into the workforce. Over two years, participants develop essential life and employment skills in real-world settings, setting them up for greater independence and future job opportunities.

Their mission is to identify the talents of the people they work with and create pathways and opportunities for them to share their talents and passions with their community.

Each week, Holt Bolt trainees are placed in various workplaces, including cafés, opportunity/ thrifts shops, and businesses like TriCare, where they get hands-on experience in different roles. For many, this is the first step toward long-term employment, and as Andrea points out, “They just bring so much joy and energy to the place.”

Meet The Holt Bolters

At Stafford Lakes, The Holt Bolt participants take on a range of jobs – and it turns out they’ve got some serious skills.

Take Hannah, for example. “She’ll try anything,” Andrea says. “She’s been cleaning the fountain, planting flowers, working in the salon – she’s just so happy to give everything a go.”

Then there’s Cooper, who quickly revealed a knack for attention to detail. “On his very first day, he was spotting all the fire exits and defibrillators. He just remembers everything,” Andrea says. “So now, I’m thinking of getting him involved in some of our safety audits because he’s an exceptional eye for detail.” He is excellent with supporting our office administration work.

There’s Tommy who helps in the café, serving coffees and chatting with the community. He is passionate about delivery excellent customer service and with his social personality has made him a hit with the residents.

Josh is the newest recruit. He’s a car and fitness enthusiast and really has enjoyed hand on tasks and working with tools.

The ripple effect

What makes this program truly special is the impact it has on both sides of the generational divide. For The Holt Bolt trainees, it’s a chance to build confidence, develop skills, and gain a sense of independence. But for the residents, it’s a source of joy, connection, and a reminder of the vibrancy of youth.

“Our residents absolutely love them,” Andrea says. “They stop and chat, they share stories. It’s not just about the work they do – it’s about the relationships they build. Having young people around creates such a wonderful energy in the community.”

Beyond that, the trainees are genuinely very helpful in our busy environment. “They take on real jobs,” Andrea points out. “They’re collecting bottles and cans for recycling, putting together sales brochures, delivering mail, helping in the café – they’re making a real contribution to our community at Stafford Lakes .”

Looking to the future

As the current cohort continues on their two-year program, we look forward to seeing the team grow their passions and gain skills for their future employment. Programs like this aren’t just about training – they’re about connection, belonging, and proving that everyone has something valuable to contribute. And at Stafford Lakes, that’s something they’ve embraced wholeheartedly.

When it comes to caring for ageing loved ones, families can sometimes find themselves navigating a complex array of care choices. At TriCare, we understand the emotional journey of finding the right support, whether that’s considering home care packages or exploring Residential Aged Care options.

Understanding care options

Many families initially explore home care packages as a first step. While these services can provide temporary support, they aren’t always the comprehensive solution that seniors with increasing care needs may require.

Home care: Limitations and challenges

Home care packages may be helpful in the early days of needing extra support, but they come with significant considerations that may come into play in the longer term:

1. Limited support

Home care services typically offer intermittent assistance, which may not provide the comprehensive continued support needed as care requirements intensify. Seniors might receive just a few hours of support per week, leaving significant gaps in care.

2. Mounting home modifications

As care needs increase, homes often require costly modifications, such as:

Safety railings

Stair lifts

Bathroom adaptations

Specialised equipment.

These modifications can quickly become expensive and may not ultimately solve increasing care challenges.

3. Carer fatigue

Families attempting to manage home care often experience significant emotional and physical strain. The responsibility of coordinating care, managing rosters, and supporting a loved one can be overwhelming.

SELMA, TX, April 14, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Anthony J. Marchi, DHSc, CPHQ, CPTD, has been included in Marquis Who's Who. As in all Marquis Who's Who biographical volumes, individuals profiled are selected on the basis of current reference value. Factors such as position, noteworthy accomplishments, visibility, and prominence in a field are all taken into account during the selection process.

With nearly three decades of experience holding leadership positions in the military and private sectors, Dr. Marchi has developed expertise in his industry. In his current role as the technical director of healthcare sustainability and environmental health at Ecompex Inc., where he has been employed since 2024, he has been leveraging his skills to successfully meet his responsibilities. At Ecompex, Dr. Marchi leads enterprise-wide sustainability and performance improvement initiatives across military treatment facilities (MTFs), building structured, high-impact programs to meet objectives. This includes creating and implementing data-driven, quality strategies, developing training frameworks, optimizing team performance to enhance operational efficiency and patient outcomes, and standardizing best practices to promote consistency and innovation.

Dr. Marchi's additional responsibilities include developing and implementing sustainability policies throughout the Military Health System to ensure compliance with the Defense Health Agency (DHA) and collecting, analyzing and presenting sustainability data using inferential statistics for the DHA annual report. Dr. Marchi designs health promotion initiative workshops to establish sustainability teams at MTFs, driving innovative solutions that minimize environmental and social impacts while maintaining fiscal responsibility. Additionally, he leads risk assessments, strategic reports and cost-saving initiatives to enhance mission readiness and ensure regulatory compliance. By applying principles of the triple bottom line (people, planet and profit) framework, Kaizen, and Lean methodologies, Dr. Marchi consistently improves company performance while remaining within the budget.

Before accepting a position at Ecompex, Dr. Marchi was employed as a knowledge management analyst for the U.S. Army Medical Center of Excellence (MEDCoE) in 2023. From 2018 to 2021, he served as a U.S. Army Critical Care at 1Prospect Technologies. Dr. Marchi gained valuable experience during his 21-year military career and held several positions while serving in the U.S. Army, working as a flight paramedic and critical care program manager from 2016 to 2018, a combat medic training program manager from 2014 to 2016, the director of clinical practice for the Army air ambulance unit from 2006 to 2014 and health clinic manager and treatment coordinator from 1997 to 2006.

Dr. Marchi holds a Doctor of Health Sciences in leadership in clinical practice and education from The George Washington University, a Master of Science in occupational safety and health from Columbia Southern University and a Bachelor of Science in health science from Purdue University Global. An avid learner, Dr. Marchi has supplemented his university education by engaging in several continuing studies programs. The American Hospital Association awarded him designations as a Certified Professional in Healthcare Risk Management (CPHRM). He received a Certified Professional in Talent Management (CPTD), certification from the Association for Talent Development and is a Certified Professional in Healthcare Quality (CPHQ), a designation granted by the National Association for Healthcare Quality. From the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI Program), Dr. Marchi received certifications in health information privacy and security for clinical investigators and social and behavioral research. He also completed a responsible conduct of research course through the CITI Program.

Dr. Marchi has taken several courses through the LinkedIn Corporation. These include Become an L&D Professional; Project Management: Healthcare Projects; Systems Thinking; Using Neuroscience for More Effective L&D; Construction Management: Safety & Health; Flipping the Classroom; and The Neuroscience of Learning. From the Board of Certified Safety Professionals, he received certifications as an instructional trainer and graduate safety practitioner. He holds flight paramedic certification from the International Board of Specialty Certification and licensure as a basic life support instructor from the American Heart Association. The Federal Emergency Management Agency granted him certification in National Incident Management Systems ICS-100, ICS-200, ICS-700 and ICS-800. Finally, Dr. Marchi received his paramedic license and emergency medical services (EMS) instructor certification from the Texas Department of State Health Services and is listed on the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians.

In addition to his professional and academic accomplishments, Dr. Marchi donates his time as a volunteer at the San Antonio Food Bank and as a court-appointed special advocate for Child Advocates of San Antonio. He maintains memberships with the National Association for Healthcare Quality, the Board of Certified Safety Professionals, the American Hospital Association and the National Association of EMS Educators. He has published articles in journals associated with EMS World and the Medical Center of Excellence.

Dr. Marchi's most notable career achievement occurred while working with a service that facilitated an international collaboration between aeromedical evacuation paramedics and nurses. The goal was to enhance the combat efficiency of the current U.S. Black Hawk helicopter platform, which is capable of accommodating six litter patients and utilizing one U.S. flight paramedic. The team established new policies to support this collaboration and clarified jurisdiction over pharmaceuticals and liabilities between U.S. and Norwegian forces. Dr. Marchi collaborated closely with the Commanders to successfully plan and implement a groundbreaking joint international initiative. This initiative entailed deploying a UH-60 aeromedical evacuation platform, staffed with one U.S. flight paramedic and one Norwegian flight nurse, to enhance support combat operations in Afghanistan. The collaboration extended to Norwegian forces, with General David H. Petraeus visiting the location to observe the efforts. The Secretary of Defense of Norway and the Chief of the Swedish Air Force also came to witness the collaboration. This was significant for Sweden because, at the time, discussions were underway regarding the purchase of either UH60 Black Hawk or NH90 helicopters.

For his accomplishments while in the U.S. Army, Dr. Marchi was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal, five Air Medals, six Army Commendation Medals and a Combat Medical Badge. These experiences sharpened his ability to lead dynamic teams, implement resilient performance strategies, and drive high-stakes decision-making.

Dr. Marchi attributes his success to his resilience and tenacity. He is firmly convinced that achieving the highest quality of patient care is not only possible but essential when healthcare professionals are empowered with the necessary knowledge, resources, and institutional support to uphold rigorous standards of practice, continuously improve their skills, and cultivate a culture of compassionate, evidence-based care. Looking toward the future, Dr. Marchi hopes to secure a role in shaping healthcare policies that will lead to enhanced community health outcomes and an improved healthcare system, particularly in the context of Veterans' Affairs. Dr. Marchi is also developing a leadership philosophy called the Learning Leader, which integrates education and leadership.

That’s because non-compliance can result in business disruption, productivity losses, fines, penalties, and settlement costs, among other factors that come with a hefty price tag. Even data breaches are more expensive if an organization is non-compliant.

In recent years, organizations across various sectors have faced significant fines for non-compliance with regulations such as HIPAA, GDPR, and CCPA.

The high cost of regulatory non-compliance

Regulatory non-compliance can result in financial penalties ranging from thousands to millions of dollars.

European regulators imposed €4.48 billion in fines across 2,086 cases, mainly targeting insufficient legal grounds for data processing and inadequate security measures. Companies lacking comprehensive data governance frameworks were hit hardest. For example, the GDPR can impose fines of up to 4% of a company’s annual global revenue for violations. This was the case for Meta, which was fined €1.2 billion in 2023 for having an insufficient legal basis for data processing. This remains the largest GDPR fine to date.

Regulatory bodies may take legal action, leading to lawsuits or criminal charges. For instance, companies that commit financial fraud under SOX may face criminal prosecution, and executives can be personally held liable.

In June 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued more than $500,000 in SOX penalties and fines to the former chief financial officer at Synchronoss Technologies for allegedly falsifying financial statements and lying to the company’s auditor. This came after Synchronoss reached a $12.5 million settlement with the SEC for engaging in “long-running accounting improprieties” in June 2022.

Contracts and funding depend on regulatory compliance

Businesses may face restrictions, such as losing the ability to process transactions or operate in certain markets. For example, a payment processor found in violation of PCI DSS requirements may be prohibited from handling credit card transactions, impacting revenue and customer trust.

Organizations that fail to comply with government regulations may lose contracts or funding opportunities.

For example, in February 2025, the military health benefits administrator Health Net Federal Services (HNFS) agreed to pay $11.2 million to settle allegations that the company falsely certified compliance with cybersecurity requirements for three years in a contract with the U.S. Department of Defense to administer the TRICARE program. In addition to paying that fine, they also lost their TRICARE West Region contract.

Many businesses require their partners and vendors to maintain strict compliance standards, and these often go beyond regulatory requirements to include commercial frameworks like SOC 2. Enterprises that have strong security and privacy standards may refuse to work with vendors who fail to meet those standards, resulting in lost revenue and missed growth opportunities.

HIPAA penalties linked to data protection failures

According to the US Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Enforcement Highlights, they have received nearly 375,000 complaints since the compliance date of the Privacy Rule in April 2003. Analysis of $144.9 million in HIPAA fines reveals that inadequate safeguards for electronic protected health information (ePHI) were the primary cause.

Multiple breaches exposing sensitive patient data, such as Montefiore Medical Center’s $4.75 million settlement, resulted in the largest penalties.

California’s increasing focus on privacy led to substantial fines for companies that failed to provide required consumer opt-out mechanisms or mishandled data access requests. This signals a trend toward stricter enforcement in the future.

In March 2025, the California Privacy Protection Agency fined Honda $632,500 for making it unnecessarily difficult for consumers to exercise their privacy rights, such as opting out of data sharing.",https://img.helpnetsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/26142115/compliance.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-14 01:56:18.391241

A new reallocation plan seeks to reduce dependence on outside contractors and shift resources toward in-house operations.

United States Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has cut $5.1 billion in defense contracts for consulting and nonessential services. The move targets redundant agreements, with plans to shift much of the work to in-house personnel.

The cuts include a range of consulting deals with major firms like Accenture, Booz Allen Hamilton, and Deloitte, which have been providing services to the Defense Health Agency. Hegseth noted in a video posted to X that these terminations alone will save $1.8 billion. Other notable reductions include a $500 million US Navy contract for business process consulting and a $1.4 billion cloud software reseller agreement.

Hegseth also cut a $500 million DARPA contract for IT help-desk services, calling it ""completely duplicative."" Additional terminations target contracts supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, climate initiatives, and coronavirus response efforts – areas Hegseth described as peripheral to core defense operations.

In an internal Pentagon memo, Hegseth said the Defense Department's civilian workforce could take over many consulting services currently outsourced to third-party firms. For example, he identified the Air Force's contract with Accenture to resell enterprise cloud IT services as a need that existing government procurement resources could directly fulfill.

In addition to terminating contracts, Hegseth directed the Pentagon's chief information officer to work with Musk's task force over the next 30 days on a plan to insource IT consulting and management services across the department. The memo also called for negotiating more favorable rates on cloud computing.

The cancellations, initiated by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, are part of a larger cost-efficiency campaign aligned with the Trump administration’s broader fiscal tightening goals. Major consulting firms, including Accenture, Deloitte, and Booz Allen Hamilton, are directly impacted. The restructuring dovetails with guidance from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), headed by Elon Musk. While the move aims to curb waste and reallocate funds to essential services, critics question its long-term implications for expertise and governance.

Inside the Pentagon’s $5.1 Billion Contract Cuts

The terminated contracts include several high-value engagements that were previously awarded to third-party consulting giants for services ranging from health IT to cloud solutions. These include:

A $1.8 billion consulting contract with the Defense Health Agency involving Accenture, Deloitte, and Booz Allen Hamilton.

A $1.4 billion Air Force contract with Accenture for enterprise cloud IT reselling services.

A $500 million Navy business process consulting agreement.

A $500 million DARPA IT helpdesk contract deemed duplicative with internal capabilities.

Secretary Hegseth emphasized that the initiative is expected to yield nearly $4 billion in savings by eliminating services that could be provided by in-house teams or existing systems.

Consulting Firms Take a Hit on Wall Street

The financial fallout from the announcement was swift. Notable stock declines included:

Accenture: Down 2% to $279.52.

Booz Allen Hamilton: Dropped 2.4% to $106.30 during early trading in New York.

While Deloitte, as a privately held firm, does not report stock prices, the implications for its federal consulting practice are significant. None of the firms have issued public responses thus far.

Trump’s Austerity Doctrine and Musk’s DOGE Restructuring

The Pentagon’s decision reflects the larger government-wide cost reduction strategy led by DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency), under the leadership of Elon Musk. The Trump administration aims to cut federal expenditure by $2 trillion over time through:

Elimination of redundant programs

Closure of agencies like USAID

Reduction of federal workforce by approximately 60,000 employees

Programs tied to diversity, climate policy, and COVID-19 have also faced steep cuts. Hegseth’s directive to the Pentagon is to leverage internal resources wherever feasible, reflecting Musk’s operational philosophy of minimal bureaucracy and maximum optimization.

Elon Musk: Cost-Cutter or Conflict of Interest?

Elon Musk has played a pivotal role in the efficiency audit, offering strategic input on defense IT restructuring. Under his leadership, DOGE has:

Drafted a 30-day roadmap to “in-source” IT consulting services.

Proposed new cloud contract frameworks with reduced pricing.

Conducted audits of DoD software licenses for usage-to-cost alignment.

Musk’s dual role—as an architect of federal cost reform and CEO of SpaceX, which holds multibillion-dollar contracts with the U.S. Space Force—has sparked debate over conflict of interest. Critics argue that his simultaneous influence in defense policy and private-sector contracts may pose ethical concerns.

Political Undertones: DEI and Climate Initiatives on the Chopping Block

Part of the canceled expenditure includes contracts linked to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), environmental sustainability, and public health response services. These were labeled as “non-essential” by Hegseth and deprioritized in the Pentagon’s realignment strategy.

Supporters argue that eliminating these programs aligns with defense priorities. Detractors contend the cuts reflect a political bias that could marginalize underrepresented communities and weaken preparedness in future crises.

Can the Pentagon’s In-House Team Fill the Gap?

A key risk now is whether the Pentagon’s internal workforce is equipped to take on the technical and strategic consulting tasks formerly outsourced. Areas of concern include:

Cybersecurity management

Cloud migration expertise

Enterprise software support

The move may strain Pentagon personnel or delay project timelines unless accompanied by upskilling, new hires, or public-private hybrid models.

Where Will the $4 Billion in Savings Go?

The defense budget savings will reportedly be redirected toward:

Enhanced healthcare services for active-duty military and their families

Technology upgrades in defense systems

Cyber and infrastructure resilience programs

The goal is to align defense spending with mission-critical areas while reducing administrative overhead and external dependency.

Bottomline: A Paradigm Shift in Defense Spending Strategy

The Pentagon’s $5.1 billion contract cancellation signals more than just fiscal conservatism—it represents a shift in how the U.S. military views consulting, technology services, and operational self-sufficiency. The involvement of Elon Musk as both strategist and stakeholder raises legitimate questions about governance and transparency in defense procurement.

As federal agencies recalibrate under budget constraints, the long-term success of this initiative will depend on execution: Can the Pentagon maintain efficiency and innovation without the deep expertise of its former partners? And can fiscal savings translate into measurable improvements for the armed forces?

The answers will shape the future of defense policy—and perhaps the contours of government itself.",,N,0.0,2025-04-13 11:56:36.389465

For veterans who qualify for Medicare, enrolling in Parts A and B can help expand coverage beyond VA facilities, providing access to a broader range of doctors and hospitals. Medicare Advantage, Medigap, and ancillary benefits—such as dental, vision, and hearing coverage—can help fill coverage gaps. Additionally, critical illness policies, including cancer, heart attack, stroke, and accident coverage, can provide financial protection for unexpected medical events, helping to manage out-of-pocket costs.

In a memo, Hegseth said the DoD would be cutting a Defense Health Agency contract ""for consulting services from Accenture, Deloitte, Booz Allen, and other firms that can be performed by our civilian workforce.""

The department is also scrapping a $500 million Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) contract for IT help desk services, which Hegseth called “completely duplicative” of services already provided by the Defense Information Systems Agency.

""We need this money to spend on better health care for our warfighters and their families, instead of $500 an hour business process consultant,"" Hegseth explained. ""That's a lot of consulting.""

Hegseth also confirmed the department is terminating 11 contracts related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), climate change initiatives, the Pentagon’s COVID-19 response, and related “nonessential” activities.

""We are committed to rooting out DEI — root and branch — throughout this department … [And] I'm going to keep looking,"" Hegseth added. The announcement follows an initial pledge by Hegseth made in March to cut $580 million in programs, contracts and grants.

""If you're keeping score at home, today's cuts bring our running total to nearly $6 billion in wasteful spending over the first six weeks of the Department of Government Efficiency effort here at the Defense Department,"" Hegseth said.

From an enrollment of more than 5 million, crude prevalence of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease was 67.3 per 100,000 persons.

Prevalence was lowest for Native American and Alaska Native populations.

BOSTON — Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease rates in the Military Health System are comparable to the general population, but with variability among certain groups, according to a speaker.

“It is an interesting study because the military health system is a universal health care system, so it looks at a group of patients who do not have the barriers to care that the general population in the United States does,” Rachael Silverberg, MD, of the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, told Healio.

Researchers used the Military Health System Data Repository, employing ICD-10 codes for autosomal dominant PKD diagnosis. The data were presented at the National Kidney Foundation Spring Clinical Meetings.

From an enrollment of 5,028,667 patients, 3,382 were diagnosed with autosomal dominant PKD, with a crude prevalence of 67.3 per 100,000 people. Patient eGFR was calculated from serum creatinine using the 2021 CKD-EPI equation. Median age was 47 years, 3.3% of patients were on dialysis and 8.5% had renal transplants.

Prevalence was highest in women, Black and non-Hispanic patients, according to Silverberg and colleagues. Meanwhile, Native American and Alaska Native populations had lower rates. When excluding patients on dialysis or those who underwent a transplant, 908 patients had available measurements of both eGFR and albuminuria, according to the study.

Of this group, 42% had an elevated risk for chronic kidney disease progression, indicated by an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or albuminuria levels greater than 30 mg/g.

In autosomal dominant PKD, patients are often identified based on genetic testing, according to Silverberg. “Either they have a family member that tests positive, or they come to care, and they are identified with an abnormality … but there is a whole period of time when people are asymptomatic, so they are at risk for progression.”

In all, autosomal dominant PKD rates were similar to the general population, with some variability in sex, race and ethnicity. More than 40% of patients with autosomal dominant PKD are at increased risk for CKD progression. Further investigation is needed, Silverberg said.

The study “can [SC1] provide some information in terms of how we can identify these patients who are actually being treated,” Silverberg added. “It is the beginning of what I think could be the future.”

I was warned it might take longer because of potential back and forths between East and West.

I’m TDY right now. It’s a long TDY, over 15 weeks away from home station, clear across the country. So while I’d usually use Tricare East/Humana Military for my needs, it seems everything is upside down trying to get care in Tricare West.

I was injured at the start of March. Nothing that requires going home, but something that still needs physical therapy and a specialist to examine, and since I’m here until mid-June, my PCM decided it best to get me authorizations now and get me referred to to practices here.

3-4 weeks pass. Okay. I was warned it might take longer because of potential back and forths between East and West. Finally I hit week 4, and both authorizations go through. One of them goes to a PT practice out here.

The other ends up being referred to a specialist back near home station. Okay …

I call Humana Military. They say they can’t change the location of the referral because I am out of region. Can’t explain how physical therapy managed to be referred out here despite that. Then tell me to contact my PCM and start another referral with notes that it must be assigned to my TDY location. I do that.

Two days later Humana approves it … and again refers me to a specialist near home station.

I call Humana again. This time it’s someone who says I need to change my Tricare region because, again. They can’t change the referral to where I am, and like before can’t explain how the PT referral had no issues at the same time.

I’m tired of this. This seems super unnecessary but I’m just so frustrated.

I go ahead and contact Tricare West and start the process of moving under their system hoping it will be a quick procedure and they can see my prior referral and adjust it to a location here. The rep I speak to very strongly implies it’s a quick little process. I’ll just switch back to East when the TDY is over.

It’s now two days later and no one in West can help me each time I call because, in their words, until everything transfers over from the East region, they can’t work with it. And trying to schedule with my new temporary PCM to get brand new referrals out here will take even more time to the point of being moot.

Again. No idea if anyone here will be able to give me some advice. But I’m just at my wit’s end with being unable to get the care I should have started getting nearly a month ago now.

Thanks in advance.",,N,-1.0,2025-04-12 19:56:34.210332

Specifically, the canceled contracts include $1.8 billion in consulting, $1.4 billion enterprise cloud IT services and a $500 million Navy contract for business process consulting.
""That's with a 'B' -- $5.1 billion in DOD contracts for ancillary things like consulting and other nonessential services,"" Hegseth said in a video Thursday from his office at the Pentagon, calling the contracts non-essential spending.

The memo's subject line Thursday was ""Continuing Elimination of Wasteful Spending of the DoD.""

The memo, signed on Thursday, canceled Defense Health Agency contracts for consulting services from Accenture, Deloitte and Booz Allen, among other firms, as well as an Air Force contract with Accenture to resell third-party enterprise cloud IT services.

Specifically, the canceled contracts include $1.8 billion in consulting, $1.4 billion enterprise cloud IT services and a $500 million Navy contract for business process consulting.

Hegseth said the work can be performed by the Pentagon's civil workforce.

""That's with a 'B' -- $5.1 billion in DOD contracts for ancillary things like consulting and other nonessential services,"" Hegseth said in a video Thursday from his office at the Pentagon, calling the contracts non-essential spending.

Hegseth directed the DOD chief information officer, in coordination with the Department of Government Efficiency, to prepare a plan within 30 days for how the department will in-source IT consulting and management services to its civilian workforce and negotiate most favorable rates on software and cloud services.

""We need this money to spend on better health care for our warfighters and their families, instead of $500 an hour business process consultant,"" he said in a statement announcing the cuts. ""That's a lot of consulting.""

He also noted cutting a $500 million contract to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency for IT help desk services that are ""completely duplicative"" of services that the Defense Information Systems Agency already provides.

In addition, the Pentagon is cutting 11 contracts related to diversity, equity and inclusion, climate change, the department's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and related nonessential activities across the DOD.

He also announced pausing $500 million in funding to two universities -- Northwestern University and Cornell -- that ""tolerate antisemitism and support divisive DEI programs."" This is in addition to the $70 million already cut at Columbia, Penn, Brown and Princeton in past weeks.

Hegseth attended Princeton and Harvard.

""We are committed to rooting out DEI -- root and branch -- throughout this department ... I'm going to keep looking,"" Hegseth said.

The memo said $4 million can be directed to ""re-allocate to our mission-critical priorities to Revive the Warrior Ethos, Rebuild the Military, and Reestablish Deterrence.""

On March 20, he announced $580 million would be cut in programs, contracts and grants.

""If you're keeping score at home, today's cuts bring our running total to nearly $6 billion in wasteful spending over the first six weeks of the Department of Government Efficiency effort here at the Defense Department,"" Hegseth said.

On Feb. 20, Hegseth first announced that DOGE would be working on cutting excess and refocusing the department's budget.

""We're excited to make these cuts on behalf of you, the taxpayer and the warfighters here at the department,"" he said.

On March, 29, he directed the Pentagon to reduce its civilian workforce by 5% to 8 percent over the next several months. This would total 50,000 to 60,000 jobs.

This can be done through early retirement and buyouts with full pay and benefits until Sept. 30. Also probationary workers with less than two years on the job have been let go from federal agencies.

A hiring freeze was ordered on Feb. 28 by Hegseth after President Donald Trump issued a broad civilian hiring freeze over most of the federal government on his first day in office on Jan. 20 as part of efforts to slash the size of the government.

In the DoD, there are some exceptions, including 18 classes of jobs. They include teaching positions at Department of Defense Education Activity schools and on-post day care, medical facilities, immigration enforcement, public safety, recruiting and readiness.
