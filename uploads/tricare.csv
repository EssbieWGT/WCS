They are accused of running a pill mill that generated millions of dollars.

RELATED STORIES

Stephen Burklow has been monitored by the FDLE since 2013, long before his ownership of Pace Pharmacy. They say he had a ""continued pattern of questionable behavior throughout his pharmacy career.""

Stephen and Monique Burklow own Pace Pharmacy. Both are charged with conspiring to traffic prescription pills.

The FDLE says Stephen defrauded TRICARE -- a federal healthcare program for active and retired military members -- out of $30 million in just 10 months. That was in 2015 at ""Burklow Pharmacy.""

Stephen sold the pharmacy in 2016. That's when the new owner saw financial records that didn't add up. Stephen then went to work for Pace Pharmacy in 2017.

In 2020, authorities learned narcotics were sold without a prescription for cash through the back door and drive thru there. In 2021, investigators convinced an informant to go undercover and he purchased narcotics from Pace Pharmacy.

The informant secured hundreds of bottles of prescription drugs with labels saying they were dispensed by Stephen.

Pharmacist David Winkles worked at Pace Pharmacy. Investigators say he sold 20,000 oxycodone pills for $35 a pill to a single person every week. That would fetch him $70,000 every week.

When Stephen and Monique bought Pace Pharmacy in 2022, the previous owners had already noticed finances weren't adding up.

Investigators say Stephen sold codeine, Percocet, oxycodone and hydrocodone for cash. He is also believed to have made his own stronger version of oxycodone to sell, using pill pressers at home.

Authorities say Monique also sold prescriptions without authorization, some narcotics packaged and labeled as ""COVID-19 kits.""

Investigators believe the scheme used half a dozen doctors' identities that produced thousands of fraudulent prescriptions.

Stephen is also accused of laundering money through seven different banks.

Pace Pharmacy remains open. Apart-time pharmacist continues to fill prescriptions.

The Extremity Trauma and Amputation Center of Excellence, otherwise known as EACE, leads the advancement of extremity trauma-related research and clinical practice in the Military Health System—aiming to ensure a better future for those with extremity trauma. The center is run by the Defense Health Agency.

For answers, we turned to Andrea Crunkhorn, who applies her doctorate in physical therapy and status as the chief of clinical programs for EACE to support our injured warfighters and the clinicians who care for them. She had this to say.

EACE serves as the Defense Health Agency’s center of excellence for limb trauma and limb loss. We focus on the best-supported scientific and medical data and health care for service members and other Department of Defense community members with these injuries. We foster clinical practice and provide support tools to clinicians, patients, families, and caregivers. We help the clinicians who work with these patients be as efficient and effective as possible.

EACE assists our providers as they rehabilitate our wounded warriors and create a new normal for all patients with extremity trauma and amputation. Our specialists and staff work with the Department of Veterans Affairs to create internationally recognized clinical practice guidelines, so all limb rehabilitation follows the same best evidence.

The DOD and VA published the current upper limb amputation clinical practice guideline in 2022. These documents are regularly reviewed and updated to add new treatments and programs that improve patient care. DOD-VA published our revised clinical practice guideline for lower limb amputation rehabilitation in January 2025.

EACE offers every patient like your husband a guide called “Within Reach: The Journey After Upper Limb Amputation.” The guide provides information on coping skills, pain management, caring for your remaining limb, physical rehabilitation, and artificial limbs. The guide is available digitally on the EACE website under clinical affairs.

For soon-to-be parents, parents, families, and caregivers, we have a helpful handout, “Pregnancy, Childcare and Parenting after Upper Limb Amputation Rehabilitation.” It includes tips such as how to manage child care tasks.

The DOD Amputation Prosthetics Clearinghouse is a new portal for advice, discussion, and referral to one of the three Advanced Rehabilitation Centers in the DHA. The three ARCs are located at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, where I work; Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas; and Naval Medical Center San Diego, in San Diego, California.

These programs lead to advances in treating and restoring function after limb trauma and amputation. The centers are the only military hospitals that fabricate and modify artificial limbs. They also provide high-quality care from before surgery until you can return to your community.

You and your military hospital or clinic providers can reach out to me and my staff with questions at either of these emails: dha.ncr.Medical-Affairs.mbx.amputation-prosth-coe@health.mil. Additionally, phone numbers for contacts at each ARC are available on the fact sheets.

Other resources include the VA’s Amputation System of Care or its Polytrauma/TBI System of Care.

EACE also has information on surgeries such as directly attaching an artificial limb to the patient’s bone. This surgery can help patients who have difficulty tolerating a socket.

EACE focuses on research that can save injured limbs, avoid amputations, and preserve and restore injured limb function. We work to make our patients return to the highest possible level of physical, mental, and emotional function. Our warfighters deserve no less. We truly appreciate all that you do.

Justine,

As you can tell, you and your husband have a lot of support in this recovery. Stay safe out there.",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/8763232.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-17 12:56:42.262577

The $660 is probably all of your copays totaled up for your wife and baby after tricare paid their portion. You probably will hit your catastrophic cap this year and have no more out of pocket costs for wife and baby. You should always view your EOB for tricare and compare it to the hospital bill just to make sure no errors were made, but you probably just had a lot of small copays add up to a large bill.

Tricare select is still so much easier than dealing with tricare prime for spouses, so I’d recommend sticking with select vs prime for the family if you are using civilian healthcare providers. I’m switching from prime to select once my husband’s current orders are up so I don’t have to deal with getting a referral for literally everything.

I would recommend calling Tricare (tbh, they’ve been insane on wait times tho. They messed up bad switching who covered claims, and haven’t been paying out their share to drs, to the point where some people lost providers (myself included) and asking what’s going on.

We are also select and about to hit our catastrophic cap, I was looking at the EOB on the Tricare website literally yesterday because I was adding up our costs (including prescriptions) for the year. Once you hit that cap, even cost shares should be covered (unless the dr is out of network).

This bill; one of the drs could have been out of network (you can always have that happen. A dr will work somewhere but that specific dr might not take insurance. Happened to me years ago, with an emergency surgery and insurance didn’t cover the anesthesia/doctor (not tricare)). I agree with whoever said get an itemized bill of charges, sometimes they’ll charge an insane amount for Tylenol or some OTC stuff. Or add in charges because people rarely ask for itemized, esp. if insurance is covering it all.

Also adding in, sometimes tricare isn’t caught up and will bill you. We’ve gotten refund checks (albeit, end of year) from Tricare in recent years because they charged, we paid, and had overpaid.

Best of luck to you, your spouse and the new baby! Congratulations!!

We are getting told the same cost-share BS from Tricare that our hospital “actually isn’t in network.” Our hospital is literally listed on Tricare’s website as being in-network. We have called the hospital and OB office multiple times and they have confirmed they are in-network, too. We’ve escalated our case pretty high up and are waiting to hear back. Aside from the deductible and copay, you shouldn’t have to pay anything else for your baby. We’re in the thick of it too. Just keep fighting! It absolutely sucks but it’s all you can do.

Definitely look at the EOB and see if it matches up. Take diligent notes every time you call Tricare. Get names, reference numbers, etc. And be prepared to get contradictory information depending on who takes your calls. Ask to speak to supervisors if at all possible. It is a full-time job battling them. And it especially sucks battling while having a newborn. It’s not right.",,N,0.0,2025-05-16 20:56:17.575757

NEW YORK, May 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Zynex, Inc. (""Zynex"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: ZYXI) and reminds investors of the May 19, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills."" The report claimed Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex further revealed ""Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims."" Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military.

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Zynex's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

To learn more about the Zynex, Inc. class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/ZYXI or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

This is a success story.” That’s Dan Cnossen, a seven-time Paralympic medalist, former Navy SEAL and keynote speaker at the 2025 Military Health System Conference in Cleveland, Ohio.
“It’s steep, it’s too dark, it’s too rocky.
Speaking on how Ferrara saved his life, Cnossen said, “I owe him more than I can say.
Unparalleled Care, Perspective, and Focus Recalling his experience under the compassionate care of the doctors and nurses throughout the MHS, Cnossen wouldn’t have wanted to receive care anywhere else.","“Your mission is vital. I think you're going to see in my story that I'm alive here, up on this really high platform, because of the Military Health System. This is a success story.”

That’s Dan Cnossen, a seven-time Paralympic medalist, former Navy SEAL and keynote speaker at the 2025 Military Health System Conference in Cleveland, Ohio.

Cnossen delivered his powerful story of perseverance and overcoming extraordinary challenges to nearly 2,000 conference participants, inspiring the audience with his captivating ability to set goals and shift perspective—even when it feels impossible.

In September 2009, Cnossen led a platoon in Taliban-controlled Helmand Province in Afghanistan. As he and his team moved into position on top of a hill overlooking the platoon’s target compound, everything changed in a flash of an instant.

“We got to the designated point and proceeded up the hill. It was about a 20-minute walk. We got to the top. I remember taking a step, and cautiously taking another step. I paused. Next thing I know, I saw a flash of light under my goggles,” he said.

Cnossen stepped on an improvised explosive device. “I needed my teammates. I remember feeling a rising sense of internal panic. I couldn’t do anything,” he said.

The details, he recalls, are few and far between. “It’s steep, it’s too dark, it’s too rocky. I remember landing on sharp rocks. It was slow and damaging to my body. [My team] dragged me by shoulder straps, rocks cutting into my body like knives. The medic was telling me to stay awake. That was my personal fight. I lack the words to describe this experience in detail. But for my teammates, it’s very tiring to do a body drag. It’s like a 60-second sprint.”

‘I Owe Him More Than I can Say’

As his teammate dragged him down the hill and into a helicopter, Cnossen blacked out. Thanks to the fast action of his team in Helmand, Cnossen was airlifted to Kandahar where a team of U.S. military doctors were ready to act. One of those doctors was Dr. Stephen Ferrara, now the acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs.

Eleven days later, Cnossen awoke from a medically induced coma at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland, now known as Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. His legs were gone, but he was alive.

Speaking on how Ferrara saved his life, Cnossen said, “I owe him more than I can say. He could have gone anywhere in the world to serve, but he accepted the call to serve in Afghanistan.”

A National Hero

A testament to his character, Cnossen recalls the worst part of his experience. Even after losing his legs, shattering his pelvis, and enduring seven-to-10 hours of painful surgeries week after week throughout his two-year recovery, the worse thing, he said, was “dealing with lying in an ICU bed, stuck. The platoon is going to deploy. I’m not there to share the risk. I’m here in this bed and I cannot get out. That was corrosive.”

Cnossen’s inspirational character and commitment to his team and mission were not lost on Ferrara. “We have a national hero and all-around amazing person here. A true American hero in every sense of the word,” said Ferrara of Cnossen during his opening remarks at the conference.

Enduring two years of pain, rehabilitation, and emotional distress, Cnossen did not give up. He made a conscious effort to change his mindset and overcome what many would consider unbearable.

""There’s this notion of perspective,” he said. “The way you look at a moment, there are many angles to look at a scenario. Ultimately, I had to look at the totality of the situation. Challenge yourself—there’s at least one good thing to find. My arms could work. My legs were long enough for prosthetics. My limbs were long enough. Maybe, I’ll get to run. That’s another thing I can look forward to. That was motivating.”

Bringing humor to his story, Cnossen shared that, as a double leg amputee, he would finally be over six feet tall. “Humor can really help,” he said.

Unparalleled Care, Perspective, and Focus

Recalling his experience under the compassionate care of the doctors and nurses throughout the MHS, Cnossen wouldn’t have wanted to receive care anywhere else. “All this care I was getting, this is the best place to be. The prosthetics I’m going to get, they’re the best. There’s no better place to be in this condition,” he said.

By intentionally shifting his perspective and focus, Cnossen found a path forward, first in rehabilitation at WRNMMC and eventually as a Paralympic athlete representing Team USA. He shifted his focus from what was lost to what remained: his functioning arms, his gratitude, and his life. This generated psychological momentum, driving him toward recovery and eventually, athletic excellence.

He also focused on making small steps: getting out of bed, meeting visitors, getting his wheelchair and eventually prosthetics, and just making it through the day. This gave him renewed purpose.

“That bomb in Afghanistan took my legs. Ultimately, it had to be up to me if it would take my life,” he said.

Cnossen was awarded a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star with Valor from the Secretary of the Navy. He is currently training to compete with Team USA in the 2026 Paralympic Games.

His captivating speech kicked off the four-day annual MHS Conference, hosted by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, which convened to share knowledge, advance innovation, and highlight new initiatives within the MHS. In his closing remarks on May 1, Dr. Ferrara emphasized the quality of the stories and information shared to improve the health care of the warfighter, saying the conference was “moving and inspiring, and helped bring us back to the center of what the nature of our mission is all about.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2504/9004779/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-16 12:56:25.340847

Two, it should be easy to find care if you’re in a military town (town with a large base) as most places will advertise in large lettering TRICARE ACCEPTED on a sign outside their business. Otherwise going to MilConnect can help u find dentists that are in network. Also we just called down to the closest one (we can walk to it) and asked them if they took tricare. He’s been our dentist for years now. Millconnect will use your DEERS login. Calling the tricare west or tricare east line is also helpful as the wait isn’t long but I wouldn’t recommend them to find care. Only to change PCM. I find calling dentists and just asking to be the easiest. I used to work in medical reception and that was our most common call. If we took their insurance. So it’s completely normal and they’ll know the answer.

The overall DEFENDER 25 exercise is taking place across the European theater throughout the month of May and early June.

The focus of the medical portion of the exercise is to sustain a ready medical force that is prepared to provide resources forward into a theater of operation, manage the movement of wartime casualties to include military working dogs, manage the movement of blood products to forward areas and execute bed expansion requirements during the simulation of Large-Scale Combat Operations.

“Having a prepared and relevant medical force to deliver combat ready care is critical for success in Large-Scale Combat Operations,” said U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Roger Giraud, commander of Medical Readiness Command, Europe and command surgeon for U.S. Army Europe and Africa. “Their ability to rapidly deploy resources forward into the theater is paramount for immediate combat casualty care. Effective casualty management and evacuation ensures timely and appropriate treatment. Maintaining a reliable blood product supply chain to forward areas is vital for hemorrhage control and resuscitation. Furthermore, the capacity to execute rapid bed expansion during surges in casualties is essential to prevent overwhelming medical facilities. A ready and responsive medical force directly impacts survivability and mission success in a complex and demanding operating environment.”

DEFENDER 25 is the Army’s largest annual opportunity to exercise moving personnel and equipment into theater across modes for initial and follow-on operations critical to Large Scale Combat Operations.

Led by U.S. Army Europe and Africa, the exercise focuses on the strategic deployment of CONUS-based forces, employment of Army Prepositioned Stock and follow-on exercises demonstrating lethality and interoperability with Allies and partners.

The exercise is the largest annual U.S. Army deployment into the European Theater consisting of approximately 25,000 U.S Allied and Partner service members, 29 Allied and partner nations, 18 host nations, 14 different aerial ports of embarkation in the U.S., movement of 3,000 pieces of equipment and more than 5,000 U.S. based troops processed into the European Theater.

Also, as part of DEFENDER 25, the 68th Theater Medical Command provided command and control of approximately 500 Soldiers who participated in a field hospital exercise (HOSPEX) during Swift Response 25 at multiple locations in Lithuania during the month of May to train, rehearse, and build operational readiness. This event demonstrated the U.S. Army's ability to rapidly deploy U.S. based combat power in Europe, showcasing the command-and-control synchronization between U.S. and NATO forces.

HOSPEX units included the 519th Field Hospital, with U.S. Role 3, NATO Role 2 Enhanced capabilities, the 30th Medical Brigade, the 173rd Airborne Brigade Support Medical Company with Role 2 capabilities, 7384th Blood Support Detachment, and the 160th Forward Resuscitative Surgical Detachment.",https://api.army.mil/e2/c/images/2025/05/16/8eea356d/max1200.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-16 06:56:24.578041
,,2025-05-16 10:02:56+00:00,CNN,Abrupt insurance changes rattle many military families and their medical providers - CNN,Ashley Killough,,,,,https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/16/us/tricare-military-health-insurance-problems,"Denise uses Tricare, a military program that provides health insurance for active-duty service members, National Guard members, and many retirees — like Denise.
This resulted in an avalanche of problems for both health care providers and patients, according to 37 providers and patients from 15 states who’ve shared their stories with CNN.
It also authorizes access to civilian networks of providers for those who need care outside of military hospitals or bases.
“It has changed the way that we deal with Tricare patients,” she said.
“Our priority is always TRICARE East Region beneficiaries and their ability to get access to care.","When Denise learned in February that she might have to pay out of pocket for her weekly therapy sessions, the military veteran from Virginia started to panic.

She’d been seeing her psychologist weekly in Norfolk for over a year and was finally making progress in resolving some buried trauma. Denise, who doesn’t want CNN to use her last name for privacy reasons, calls her therapist her “lifeline,” as she fears taking her own life if she can’t continue the care.

The therapist informed her that Denise’s insurance had stopped paying for her sessions. Denise uses Tricare, a military program that provides health insurance for active-duty service members, National Guard members, and many retirees — like Denise. It services about 9.5 million people.

Her therapist, flustered by the abrupt halt in reimbursements, said she sought to get payment for weeks — not only for Denise’s care but for all her other Tricare patients whose claims were suddenly going unprocessed as of January 1. Without success, she finally had to hold uncomfortable conversations, telling her patients in February that to stay afloat financially, she may need them to pay full price up front — or else pause their care until Tricare could start paying again.

“Panic. Absolute panic,” Denise told CNN, recalling how she felt when she heard the news. Her cost for therapy would increase from her copayment of $50 to roughly $200 per week if she had to pay out of pocket — a cost she couldn’t afford. “It scares me a lot. If I don’t have someone to lean on, it won’t end up well.”

Denise’s therapist, Dr. Libby Cutshall, has continued treating Denise for just the cost of her copayment. But she had to make the painful decision to pause care for about 30 other Tricare patients, as she couldn’t afford to stay in business without receiving reimbursement for their care.

Similar conversations happened in medical offices across the country when Tricare fell behind on reimbursing hordes of medical claims after major changes and technical glitches at the start of the year. This resulted in an avalanche of problems for both health care providers and patients, according to 37 providers and patients from 15 states who’ve shared their stories with CNN. They say those hit hardest were smaller outpatient clinics near military installations that operate on referrals and frequent appointments for mental health, speech therapy, physical therapy, and treatment for autism. For many, it’s caused life-altering financial stress and disruption in care.

Tricare is a complicated system, split between East and West regions, but it’s a mainstay for military families. It’s overseen by the Pentagon’s Defense Health Agency, and, like benefit packages at private companies, it offers various coverage plans for medical, dental, mental health, and prescription drugs. It also authorizes access to civilian networks of providers for those who need care outside of military hospitals or bases.

In the West, a new contractor, TriWest Healthcare Alliance, took over administering the health care program this year with its network of providers, adding to similar work it had done for the Department of Veterans Affairs. In the East, Humana Military continued the role it’s had as the region’s contractor for nearly 30 years but changed its claim processing partner. Six states moved from East to West, and the entire network had its annual Medicare rate update.

TriWest said some of the problems were caused by the previous contractor not sending provider information in a timely manner — a claim the previous contractor strongly denies. Humana Military said technical issues made it difficult to process claims, but those issues are now resolved and they’re working to clear the backlog.

Clinics in both regions reported missing reimbursements for months. In the West, many providers said they found themselves out of the network entirely in January and some are still trying to get recredentialed to return. Patients have had issues finding out if the same providers they saw last year are still in-network, or whether their appointments will be covered. Providers and patients alike have spent hours on the phone trying to get answers.

“It’s really halted my whole life,” said Shawn Manvell, the founder of Achievement Center for Therapy and owner of three large clinics — two in California and one in Nevada — that offer a wide range of therapies, with a special focus on treating people with autism. She said more than half of their patients come from Tricare families.

Manvell has received about $70,000 in reimbursement checks recently from TriWest, and another $100,000 in cash advancements that she’ll have to pay back. But she’s still owed an estimated $350,000, she said. To keep treating patients and employing her staff of nearly 30, she’s taken out $500,000 in high-interest loans, along with liquidating some of her own personal assets, she said.

Now five months into the year, progress has been made in both regions, but those who follow Tricare closely say the overall issues and their rippling effects still linger, creating trust issues with Tricare that could leave long-lasting ramifications.

Charlotte Cuestas, a 31-year-old military spouse in Florida, had been seeing a therapist for postpartum depression after a traumatic birth experience. She couldn’t afford the $200 per session out of pocket that her therapist was needing after lack of reimbursement from Humana Military, so Cuestas decided to suspend her sessions. “My fear is that it’s going to get to a point where no therapists are going to want to take Tricare at all because of this issue,” she said.

In several instances, providers near military bases who mostly serve Tricare beneficiaries say they have reduced the number of Tricare patients they’ll accept, have left the network entirely, or plan to close their practice — ultimately resulting in less access to care for active-duty military members, retirees, and their families.

Desperate for help, patients and providers made TikToks or took to military-centric Facebook and Reddit groups to post their experiences. Mission Alpha Advocacy, a non-profit group that focuses on military families with special needs, says it heard from nearly 400 providers who’ve reported insufficient payment and over 500 families who’ve reported disruption in care.

Tricare has gone through turnovers and other hiccups in the past, but this one stands out, said John Letaw, a former Navy lieutenant commander who spends his retirement days helping people navigate the system.

“What we’re seeing this time is way beyond. It’s really inexplicable,” he told CNN in April. Letaw has written a book, “The Ultimate Guide to TRICARE” and runs a Facebook group with nearly 20,000 members, where he’s seen stories of struggle from patients who say they’ve been affected this year.

“It’s pretty catastrophic to a lot of military families,” he said.

‘Domino effect’ leads to possible bankruptcy

Cutshall told CNN she continued treating four other Tricare patients, in addition to Denise, whom she described as her most vulnerable. She said she was too worried about the consequences if they had to suspend their sessions, and she feared they wouldn’t find care elsewhere amid the Tricare struggles.

“(Denise) is at risk for dying if she doesn’t have care. That’s not hyperbole,” Cutshall said of Denise. “She served in the military, and she should get that care — and she shouldn’t have to worry.”

Cutshall said she went nearly three months without receiving any reimbursement at her clinic near Naval Station Norfolk, the largest naval installation in the world. With 80% of her patients using the military benefit, her practice was hit hard by the disruption.

By her count, Cutshall said she’s still owed an estimated $30,000 by Tricare. She hasn’t paid herself at all this year, leaning entirely on her partner’s income at home, and she said she’s taken $20,000 from savings to help pay the three other therapists at her practice.

Since early April, with help from a Tricare representative, reimbursements have started trickling in for small amounts of $115 or $120 — a few as large as $600 — but the payments don’t explain which patients they cover, Cutshall said, so she has no way of reconciling her books.

She said she was getting five to 10 calls each day this spring from people seeking care — many of them active-duty military. But she’s had to turn them away, as she seeks to diversify and take clients who have other insurance coverage instead.

“It has changed the way that we deal with Tricare patients,” she said. “And that’s unfortunate because (they make up) so many people in our area, but we cannot continue to do this and sustain and help the people that we want to help.”

The gradual trickling in of reimbursement checks — one provider in Texas said one of her initial checks was for 63 cents — is a sign of progress for many, but it’s hardly relief for those who’ve been hit the hardest.

And for some, the lag in reimbursement has been completely insurmountable. On April 30, Elizabeth Brown-Miller closed her applied behavior analysis clinic for children with autism near Fort Cavazos in Texas. She said the “domino effect” created by a range of payment issues with TriWest this year was too crippling, and she’s now meeting with lawyers about possible bankruptcy and ways to avoid it.

“There’s no hope for us. There’s no way,” she said. “We have to shut down.”

When she opened the clinic in 2021, it was part of the East region with Humana Military. But Texas was one of the six states that migrated to the West this year, and while Brown-Miller’s clinic was still listed as in-network, her 16 therapists were suddenly out-of-network.

Billing became a nightmare, she said, and reimbursement payments weren’t coming through. She had to reduce pay for her therapists and cut back on services for her patients. To further maintain overhead and payroll, Brown-Miller said she took out $182,000 in high-interest loans, expecting the Tricare issues to be resolved soon. TriWest also sent her $70,000 in advance payments to help while they processed the backlog of her claims, she said, but she’ll have to pay that back.

In late April, after crunching the numbers, Brown-Miller decided she couldn’t sustain her business. She was in too much unexpected debt, a hole too deep to climb out.

“A lot of my parents (of patients) are angry. They’re upset. They’re sad. They’re grieving,” she said, growing emotional. “I feel like I failed them. And they tell me I didn’t. But at the end of the day, I did. Because I couldn’t keep my doors open for them.”

She said she reached out to 17 clinics in her area to see who was willing and financially able to take on her Tricare patients. Only four said they could.

Meanwhile, in the East, Natasha Lachapelle has been a speech therapist for 22 years and finally opened her own practice three years ago in the military town of Columbus, Georgia, near Fort Benning Army Base. About 95% of her patients used Tricare.

Six weeks into the new year, she emailed her clients to tell them that due to the lack of income from Tricare – she said she was owed thousands — she was cutting back her hours and taking a part-time position at a hospital instead. “It was an absolute cluster,” said Lachapelle.

As a small, solo practitioner who burned through her savings to deal with a cancer diagnosis last year, Lachapelle said she didn’t have enough money to keep afloat while she saw patients for free.

Humana Military had fully reimbursed her by mid-April, she said, but going months without payment and having to take on another part-time job simply became too much. She emailed her patients again on April 24, this time to say she was shutting down her practice by July, a decision she calls “excruciating.”

She said she feels so burned by Tricare that she can’t risk putting her financial future at stake.

“I can’t trust it,” she said. “I can’t trust it ever again.”

‘We apologize for the inconvenience’

In a message to beneficiaries on March 26, David Smith, the acting director of the Defense Health Agency, which oversees Tricare, acknowledged that the new contractors have “experienced challenges” since January 1 and that beneficiaries and providers “are understandably frustrated” by the delays in payment processing.

Smith wrote that initial technical problems have been addressed and “claims payments are now being processed closer to required standards.”

As of mid-May, Humana Military has adjudicated 6.25 million claims in the East, totaling $1.3 billion, with fewer than 7% of its claims pending beyond 60 days, according to DHA officials and a Humana Military spokesperson. Meanwhile, TriWest has processed and paid more than 7.3 million claims, totaling $1.5 billion, with about 2.6% of its claims outstanding beyond 60 days, according to TriWest.

“We take our commitment to TRICARE East Region beneficiaries and providers very seriously, and apologize for the inconvenience and frustration this problem has caused,” a Humana Military spokesperson said in a statement. “Our priority is always TRICARE East Region beneficiaries and their ability to get access to care. We are working closely with impacted providers to ensure they continue to care for TRICARE East Region beneficiaries.”

In the West, a spokesperson from TriWest said in a statement: “All major health care transitions of this size and scale bring challenges, and while we are currently processing and paying out claims to providers, we recognize that even one provider who has not been paid in a timely fashion is too many.”

TriWest said “it’s making progress every week” and continues to improve processing times. A TriWest spokesperson also said the company hired hundreds of additional customer service staff to handle the massive influx of calls and complaints and reduce the hold time. Both regions said they’re placing a special focus on clinics that treat patients with autism.

With so many providers showing up out-of-network in the West, Tricare and TriWest have sought to assure military families that they don’t need to wait for TriWest approval if they’ve been referred by their primary care manager — usually a physician on base — to see an outpatient provider. Tricare has issued a blanket waiver for patients to reference.

David J. McIntyre, Jr., the president and CEO of TriWest, issued a letter to providers on April 29, apologizing for any disruptions at their practices and reiterated that Tricare patients don’t need approval from TriWest if they’ve been referred for outpatient care at their clinics. McIntyre also addressed the issue of providers being out of network, saying, “Tricare patients may continue to seek care from their existing providers, regardless of whether the provider has joined the TriWest network.”

But patients say they run into providers who don’t trust the waiver. “The problem is medical specialists are reluctant to take those waivers because they’re still not sure that they’ll ever be paid,” said one retired Marine and combat veteran in California, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation.

He said he’s lost more sleep trying to resolve questions about his wife’s care than he lost during combat. After getting a partial mastectomy last year to remove a breast lesion, his wife is scheduled for several follow-up appointments with a variety of doctors this year. Her mother died of breast cancer, so it’s a top-of-mind concern for him and his wife. But they can’t get solid assurances that their appointments will be covered.

“The continual non-answers … they start to dominate your thoughts, your feelings. It increases anxiety, puts you on edge,” he said. “It makes you question your own service and sacrifices that you made.”

In Missouri, Danielle Gist was in her first trimester when she learned her obstetrician was no longer in network when TriWest took over. A military spouse who uses Tricare, Gist was suddenly getting large bills that she normally doesn’t get for maternal care.

At an appointment this month, now in her third trimester, she learned her obstetrician was finally back in network. The news “felt like a bit of weight off the shoulders,” she said, but the stress and anxiety of trying to get answers over the past few months still leave her nervous.

“It still feels really uncertain,” she said. “And I still have all the other bills to reconcile, so it’s still looming over me. It just feels overwhelming and exhausting, like a job I didn’t sign up for.”

Christy Collins, a military spouse in Kansas, said Tricare has usually worked well for her family. But this year, she’s spent hours trying to get an appointment scheduled for her 8-year-old daughter to be tested for autism and trying to get ADHD medications renewed for her 12-year-old daughter. She’s also seeking a referral for a breast cancer screening for herself but said she keeps getting the runaround after making multiple phone calls.

“I have a PhD, and I can’t manage to solve this,” she said.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/8711554.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,-1.0,2025-05-16 08:56:27.679381

Ever had one of those mornings where you’re half-awake and feeling every ounce of yesterday’s regrets? This is it. A young man—let’s call him James—wipes a trembling hand across his forehead, mind buzzing with what-ifs and a creeping sense of panic. Yet in that same hand rests a military ID and a TRICARE insurance card, like two small lifelines he’s not sure he deserves. But he dials the number anyway. Because sometimes, hope is a series of tiny steps.

On the other end of the call: Firm Foundation Treatment Center—a local, faith-centered drug rehab program that’s got him thinking, “Maybe I’m not as alone as I thought.”

Why TRICARE Is More Than Just Insurance

Once you realize TRICARE can cover major chunks of addiction treatment for veterans, military members, and their families, you start seeing how that little plastic card can offer something huge: a shot at real healing.

TRICARE drastically lowers the financial hurdle that often keeps people stuck in addiction. Instead of draining your life savings (or worse, dodging treatment entirely), you can tap into this coverage and focus on the actual work of recovery—therapy, community support, maybe even reconciling with loved ones. If you’ve got TRICARE, you’re already ahead of the game.

TRICARE isn’t just about a quick detox. In fact, it provides coverage for different levels of care—like partial hospitalization, outpatient therapy, counseling, and spiritual guidance. That’s like opening a door to a continuum of support that can see you through the tough times, from withdrawal symptoms to long-term relapse prevention. It’s not a magic wand, but it can be your safety net.

Levels of Care: from Intensive to Flexible

Healing from addiction isn’t about a single “aha!” moment. It’s a progression—a journey with setbacks, breakthroughs, and everything in between. That’s why Firm Foundation Treatment Center in Woodstock has multiple levels of care, all covered by TRICARE.

Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP)Welcome to a daytime world of structured therapy, skill-building, and group support, while you still get to sleep in your own bed (or a sober living facility) at night. Think of it like pressing pause on outside chaos to focus on healing. You’ll participate in group discussions about triggers, coping mechanisms, and your emotions. Afternoon one-on-one sessions might delve into underlying traumas. By evening, you’ll be back home or in a supportive living arrangement, reflecting on what you learned.

Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP)After you’ve tackled the core issues in PHP, IOP is the next step. You’ll still show up for therapy and group activities, but on a lighter schedule—maybe three days a week. There’s a bit more breathing room to start re-entering work or family life without losing the safety net of professional guidance.

Outpatient Program (OP)This is where you really test-drive the new normal. One or two days a week, you’ll drop in for check-ins and ongoing counseling. Some folks underestimate how vital these sessions can be. Having that consistent touchpoint keeps you honest about cravings, emotional swings, or daily pressures that could affect you. You’re busy rebuilding your life—that’s the focal point.

(Relapse? Yes, it’s possible. Sometimes it sneaks up on you. But even if you slip, Firm Foundation Treatment Center encourages stepping back into more intensive support until you’re stable again. No shame. Just keep going.)

Therapies That Actually Work

If you’ve ever wondered, “Can therapy really battle something as powerful as addiction?” you’re not alone. Addiction rewires the brain’s reward system. It hijacks your ability to feel normal pleasure without substances. That’s why Firm Foundation Treatment Center employs evidence-based strategies (all generally covered by TRICARE) that work to unscramble the chaos in your head:

Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)EMDR might sound high-tech, but it’s surprisingly intuitive. You revisit painful memories (trauma that might be fueling your substance use) while following a therapist’s finger or another stimulus. Somehow—like a bizarre mental balancing act—your brain processes these memories in a less distressing way. It won’t erase the past, but it often takes away its power.

Trauma-Informed CareTrauma-informed means nobody’s going to shove you into a corner and demand you spill your darkest secrets right away. The entire clinical team acknowledges how trauma shapes your reactions, your trust issues, even your sense of safety. They create a supportive environment that respects your limits.

Hazelden-Based PsychoeducationKnowledge is power. These sessions help you understand why your brain craves substances, what triggers look like, and how you can outsmart them. It’s like a roadmap for your own mind.

Dual Diagnosis TreatmentStruggle with anxiety, depression, or PTSD on top of substance use? You’re not alone—lots of people do. The good news is, TRICARE covers co-occurring mental health disorders, so you won’t be referred out to some separate program. At Firm Foundation Treatment Center, you address both issues together, which is vital. Because you can’t truly fix one if the other’s screaming for attention.

The Faith Factor: Why a Men’s-Only, Christian Approach Matters

Sometimes, the spiritual dimension is the missing piece of the puzzle. Firm Foundation Treatment Center is Christian in its outlook, offering prayer circles, Bible-based teachings, and a men’s-only environment that feels more like a brotherhood than a clinical setting. For many, faith becomes this wellspring of hope—like a constant reminder that you’re more than your worst day.

You’ll find that staff simply encourage you to see faith as another tool in your arsenal. If it resonates, lean into it. If you have questions, bring them. It’s about feeling whole again, bridging the gap between mind, body, and spirit.

What Happens to the Family?

Addiction has a ripple effect. It hits parents, partners, siblings—everyone who cares about you. Firm Foundation Treatment Center understands that family healing is crucial. The treatment center offers family therapy sessions where loved ones can learn about boundaries, enabling behaviors, and practical ways to support (not sabotage) recovery.

Janey Macey, owner of Janey Macey and Associates, provides behavioral therapy to children on the autism spectrum — many of whom are from military families. Her clinic has long relied on payments from TRICARE, the military’s healthcare program. But in the first four months of 2025, she's not received any payments.

""TRICARE has always been a big part of our revenue, and it’s always been easy to work with,” Macey said. “Usually, we submit a claim and within two to three days we’re being paid. But that hasn’t happened this year.”

The issue began after Louisiana was moved from the TRICARE East region to TRICARE West in 2025. TRICARE West is managed by the TriWest Healthcare Alliance, and providers like Macey say the transition has caused major disruptions in payments and customer service.

""I joined a group of TriWest ABA providers on Facebook,” said Macey. “So many of them have had to shut down their doors, lay off staff, or turn TRICARE families away.”

When contacted by KTBS, the TriWest Healthcare Alliance acknowledged the problem in a statement:

“The challenges that Janey Macey is facing are unacceptable, and we are working to address them promptly. We are focusing our processing teams on outstanding ABA claims to help ensure no further payment delays to providers, or disruption of care to beneficiaries. We are also staffing up our dedicated customer service line with additional employees trained to address these challenges. This Autism Care Demonstration Customer Service line can be reached at 833-818-2525. Lastly, we are also reviewing escalations cases daily to help ensure providers experiencing financial distress receive advance payment.

We recognize that any provider who has not been paid in a timely fashion is one too many. We are deeply committed to the providers and military families in Shreveport and Barksdale Air Force Base.

Area(s) of Interest: Cyber Security

What You Need to Know: More than a year after the Change Healthcare cyberattack, physician practices are still facing timely filing denials and financial fallout. Despite state guidance calling for flexibility, some health plans continue to deny claims, and practices are urged to contact CMA for support.

More than a year after the massive cyberattack on Change Healthcare, a subsidiary UnitedHealth Group’s Optum unit, many physician practices are still grappling with the fallout. Though UnitedHealth Group reported that claims began flowing again in late March 2024, serious disruptions persisted into late 2024, putting significant financial strain on some physician practices.

The major challenge continues to be timely filing denials by health plans, which is threatening the financial viability of some practices. Several practices who utilized Optum as their revenue cycle management (RCM) vendor were especially impacted, reporting that Optum RCM was unable to submit claims until October 2024, which led to large volumes of timely filing denials. While Optum provided temporary loans to help bridge the revenue gap during the outage, some practices are struggling to repay those loans without having received the revenue those claims should have generated.

The California Medical Association (CMA) worked with the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) to ensure physician practices would still be able to be paid for services, even if claims didn’t meet the timely filing requirements under law or contract. As a result, DMHC issued All Plan Letter 24-005, laying out flexibilities it expected plans to offer to ensure delivery system stability following the cyberattack, one of which was a removal or relaxation of timely filing limits. The DMHC guidance also advised that plans should not require providers to appeal under the “good cause” exception under law, as doing so would further delay claims processing and reimbursement to practices.

Despite this guidance from DMHC, CMA and the American Medical Association are both receiving reports of practices impacted by the cyberattack receiving timely filing denials.

If your practice has been affected, CMA is committed to supporting practices.

Practices still experiencing timely filing denials or struggling to repay temporary loans due to unpaid claims from the cyberattack are encouraged to contact CMA’s Center for Economic Services at (800) 786-4262 or economicservices@cmadocs.org.

(“Zynex” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: ZYXI) securities between March 13, 2023 and March 11, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”).

What Happened?

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled “How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills.” The report claimed Zynex engaged in an “oversupplying scheme” by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to “bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could.” The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were “kicking the company out of network.”

On this news, Zynex’s stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue “shortfall” in the quarter “due to slower than normal payments from certain payers.” Zynex further revealed “Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.” Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military.

On this news, Zynex’s stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

What Is The Lawsuit About?

The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company’s practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

If you purchased or otherwise acquired Zynex securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than May 19, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Timothy Jenkins, flight chief of diagnostics and therapeutics for the 319th MDG.","GRAND FORKS AIR FORCE BASE, N.D. — The integration of the 28th Medical Group personnel to the 319th Medical Group has been an integral part of supporting the ongoing beddown of 17 B-1B Lancers from Ellsworth AFB, S.D., to Grand Forks AFB. With the influx of approximately 800 additional airmen to support B-1 operations, the 319th MDG required a plus-up of manpower to ensure top quality medical care for assigned airmen, their families and local TRICARE beneficiaries.

Ellsworth AFB is undergoing a $129.5 million runway repair as a major step in preparing to receive the U.S. Air Force’s newest global strike platform, the B-21 Raider. The projected 11-month temporary beddown at Grand Forks AFB allows the 28th BW to deliver decisive bomber airpower wherever ordered by the commander-in-chief.

“With the support of Grand Forks AFB, our aviators can continue the B1-B Lancer mission and maintain long-range strike capabilities at all times,” said Staff Sgt. Brianna Middel, independent duty medical technician for the 28th MDG. “The teamwork and collaboration between the innovators and problem solvers from both bases has allowed the transition to go very smoothly from a medical standpoint.”

Middel noted the two teams worked closely together to maximize the space, equipment and resources in the 319th MDG to fit the need of the increase in daily patient care. “To accommodate the medical readiness needs of the 28th MDG, the 319th MDG has adjusted clinical space to ensure 28th MDG has office space, patient care rooms, and necessary equipment,” said Middel. “The close daily collaboration between the two medical groups has optimized care and allowed for issues to be identified and addressed without delay.”

Through collaboration, the 28th MDG is postured to provide a range of treatments and services for their personnel that include walk-in services, treatment of minor medical concerns, mental health treatment, occupational health exams and aeromedical dispositions of members on flying status. “Whenever there’s been problems or questions about differences in procedures, we’ve been able to come together and collaborate on the solution in a positive way to achieve the best outcomes for our patients,” said Tech. Sgt. Timothy Jenkins, flight chief of diagnostics and therapeutics for the 319th MDG.

While the B-1 beddown continues, so do the 24/7 missions of the 319th RW to operate the high altitude, long endurance Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance aircraft the RQ-4 Global Hawk Block 40; the High Frequency Global Communications System and deliver operations support to their mission partners that include Customs and Border Protection, the Test and Resource Management Center and the Space Development Agency.

Sustaining consistent mission output, supporting an influx of over a dozen aircraft and hundreds of airmen and executing the first RQ-4 operations directly tasked by the U.S. Secretary of Defense in three years requires healthy, mission ready airmen and dependable, trusted medical care.

“The mission won’t sustain itself, it’s the people who sustain the mission,” said Lt. Col. Bryan Payne, commander for the 319th Operational Medical Readiness Squadron. “We could not be more appreciative to the 28th MDG for making this sacrifice and putting the mission first to allow our airmen to receive the care they need.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/28thMedicalGroup.png,N,0.0,2025-05-15 17:56:27.273125

Donham is currently the commander of the U.S. Army Medical Department Activity-Alaska.
“Every single success in military medicine is a shared achievement,” Brown said.","Champions in military medicine were honored during the annual Henry Jackson Foundation’s Heroes of Military Medicine awards ceremony held on May 8, 2025, at the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C.

The awards recognized outstanding contributions by senior leaders, medical professionals, and civilians who distinguished themselves through excellence and dedication to advancing military medicine and enhancing the lives and health of our nation’s wounded, ill, and injured service members, veterans, their families, and civilians, according to the foundation.

“The Military Health System is no doubt recognized as a world-class medical force, “ said Dr. Stephen Ferrara, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, in his opening remarks. “Medical readiness is combat readiness. This is not just a slogan—it is a reality. A force that is not medically ready is a force that is not mission ready. Taking care of our warfighters will always be our number one priority.”

Medical professionals from the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, and U.S. Public Health Service received awards, as well as an ambassador and a civilian provider. “There are many heroes in the Military Health System that take care of patients daily all over the world, support the readiness of the force, spend hours in research in many aspects of our systems too numerous to mention, and we have the opportunity to recognize the best of the best,” said Ferrara.

U.S. Army Honoree: U.S. Army Col. (Dr.) Benjamin Donham. Donham is currently the commander of the U.S. Army Medical Department Activity-Alaska. Before his current assignment, he served at the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Cavazos, Texas; and at Fort Bragg, N.C., as commander of the 261st Multifunctional Medical Battalion and command surgeon for XVIII Airborne Corps.

Donham recognized his family for their dedication and sacrifice for his military career. “I get to do what I love because of their sacrifice, their patience, and their unwavering support. I share this recognition,” said Donham. “To the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines I've served with, your shared sense of mission and purpose continues to make the journey work.”

U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Mary Izaguirre, U.S. Army surgeon general, said Col. Donham has served as a battlefield surgeon, a combat veteran, a special forces operator, scholar, commander, and pioneer in military medical innovation. “His contributions go so far beyond his operational excellence,” she said.

U.S. Navy Honoree: U.S. Navy Capt. (Dr.) Matthew Tadlock. As a trauma and general surgeon with 23 years of active duty experience, Tadlock currently serves as the officer in charge, Surface Medical Group-Pacific, where he prepares fleet surgical teams for deployment on U.S. Navy amphibious assault ships. Since 2021, he’s led the Maritime Surgery Quality Improvement program, an initiative focused on tracking, improving, and standardizing all surgical care performed on U.S. combatant vessels. He is also an attending surgeon at Naval Medical Center San Diego and an associate professor of surgery through the Uniformed Services University.

U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Walter Brafford, commander, Naval Medical Forces Development Command, commended Tadlock, saying, “Under immense threat and pressure, often far from traditional medical facilities, Capt. Tadlock has relied not just on his own exceptional skills as a trauma and critical care specialist, but through his visionary leadership in shaping the very landscape of how we prepare and sustain our operational medical teams.”

“He doesn’t just maintain the status quo; he forges a new path.”

Tadlock thanked his family and fellow military medical professionals, saying, “Many of the accomplishments that led to this recognition, myself, or others, started at the grassroots level. To be recognized for being a part of these grassroots efforts and to see some of them become how we do business is incredibly rewarding.”

U.S. Air Force Honoree: U.S. Air Force Col. (Dr.) Daniel Brown. “Every single success in military medicine is a shared achievement,” Brown said. “Especially true in the care and transport of those injured, a mission that has helped shape my career.”

Brown is an emergency services master clinician at Wright-Patterson Medical Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, where he serves as the senior advisor to a 90-person emergency services flight and directs clinical operations for 13,000 emergency patients per year.

U.S. Air Force Brig. Gen. Jason Lennen, director of policy and resources at the Office of the Surgeon General, U.S. Air Force, told the audience, “Col. Brown's profound impact will be forever felt by the patients and staff he has directly touched, as well as the county centers that were built with the firm foundation that he has led to treat, heal and save, to enable our Air Force to fly, fight and win, and our joint force to deter, defend and defeat.”

U.S. Public Health Service Honoree: USPHS Capt. (Dr.) John Iskander. Iskander, currently assigned to the Food and Drug Administration, most recently served as chief of the immunization healthcare division for the Defense Health Agency and previously was chief of preventive medicine and population health for the U.S. Coast Guard.

U.S. Public Health Service Rear Adm. Denise Hinton, deputy U.S. Surgeon General, said Iskander, “is a distinguished leader whose contributions have profoundly advanced military and veteran medicine.” “His career has been defined by excellence in clinical care, his groundbreaking medical research, and an unwavering dedication to those who serve as a physician leader within the United States Public Health Service Commission Corps.”

Iskander thanked those in attendance for the recognition for his service to the USPHS and emphasized the importance of the work of the agency, saying, “It is my privilege to accept this award with thanks to all my fellow United States Public Health Service officers who have and continue to serve our warfighters and veterans.”

Civilian Provider Honoree: Dr. Troy Akers. Akers is the civilian chief of emergency medicine at Dwight D. Eisenhower Army Medical Center, a position he transitioned into following his military retirement in 2018.

Dr. David Smith, acting director, Defense Health Agency, introduced Akers and talked about his heroic efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in 2024 that ravaged many communities in Georgia, including the area that relies on the Eisenhower Army Medical Center for medical care. In the immediate hours of the destruction resulting from the storm, Smith said Akers went to the center and quickly began to respond to the needs of the community, patients, and his staff. “This is what leadership is in crisis,” said Smith. “These are the actions of an individual who captures all the qualities we seek in our line of work: calmness, confidence, and compassion for those they serve.”

Akers said his job is “to make sure that the men and women that wear that uniform—the most precious resources this country has—have everything they need to make sure that they can fight America's wars, taking care of their family members when they're deployed, making sure they're medically ready, has been the honor of my life, and I thank every single day I get to do this job.”

Ambassador Honoree: Sal Gonzalez. Gonzalez enlisted in the Marines in 2004 and was assigned to the 2nd Battalion. While serving in Iraq, his vehicle was hit by an improvised explosive device, leaving him with a traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, and a below-the-knee amputation. While recovering from his injuries, he was introduced to many programs that offer rehabilitation and recovery of injured service members, including music. Since, he has performed at the Grand Ole’ Opry in Nashville, Tennessee, and is about to release his first full-length album.

He “turned his healing journey into a mission, proving that music can give bridge to recovery, resilience, and renew purpose,” said Joseph Caravalho, president and CEO of the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine.

Gonzalez told the audience, “The only reason I am alive today is because of people like those who are being honored tonight. Because if I had been injured as grievously as I was injured in Iraq, just a couple of decades before—I do not think I would have survived.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9035512.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-15 16:56:22.593381

Mellinger pleaded guilty to wire fraud and assisting in the preparation of false tax returns, impacting TRICARE and the IRS.

The scheme involved disguising illegal profits as royalties and leveraging client investigations for personal gain.

The broader Mississippi pain cream fraud case involved over $1.5 billion in fraudulent claims across multiple states.

A Florida man who pleaded guilty in Mississippi to orchestrating a scheme to promote an illegal tax shelter and commit wire fraud was sentenced to eight years in prison and ordered to pay nearly $40 million in restitution.

Stephen Mellinger in 2017 was named as a person connected to what would become known as the Mississippi pain cream scheme that netted more than 20 arrests and unveiled approximately $515 million in health-care fraud in Mississippi alone.

Mellinger also pleaded guilty to assisting in the preparation of false tax returns for tax shelter clients. He must repay over $35.6 million to the IRS and $2.1 million to TRICARE.

Mellinger pleaded guilty to the charges in February at the William M. Colmer Federal Courthouse in Hattiesburg. He was sentenced Wednesday, May 14.

In late January 2016, several pharmacies and businesses throughout Mississippi were raided by law enforcement, leaving people wondering what was going on.

It took time for the case to unfold, but the fraud, which had its beginnings in Hattiesburg, had tentacles across the country, from California to Connecticut and many states in between, totaling over $1.5 billion in fraud.

TRICARE was the main target of the pain cream fraud, involving high-priced compounded pain creams, scar creams, weight-loss remedies and vitamins. Compounded formulas are meant to be tailored to individual patients, but in this case, were formulated to maximize profit.

Mellinger's fraudulent tax shelters also took time to unfold — nearly a decade, according to court documents.

Mellinger, according to court records, was helping some of the perpetrators of the pain cream fraud avoid paying income tax on illegally obtained profits by claiming them as royalties paid for using intellectual property rather than reporting the money as revenue.

He had other clients for which he orchestrated investments in similar tax shelters, but when he learned his clients involved in the pain cream scheme were under investigation by the federal government and a civil forfeiture issued, he began using that as leverage to get even more money from those clients.

What Happened?

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled “How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills.” The report claimed Zynex engaged in an “oversupplying scheme” by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to “bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could.” The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were “kicking the company out of network.”

On this news, Zynex’s stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue “shortfall” in the quarter “due to slower than normal payments from certain payers.” Zynex further revealed “Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.” Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military.

On this news, Zynex’s stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

What Is The Lawsuit About?

The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company’s practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

If you purchased or otherwise acquired Zynex securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than May 19, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Hi Justine,

The Extremity Trauma and Amputation Center of Excellence, otherwise known as EACE, leads the advancement of extremity trauma-related research and clinical practice in the Military Health System—aiming to ensure a better future for those with extremity trauma. The center is run by the Defense Health Agency.

For answers, we turned to Andrea Crunkhorn, who applies her doctorate in physical therapy and status as the chief of clinical programs for EACE to support our injured warfighters and the clinicians who care for them. She had this to say.

EACE serves as the Defense Health Agency’s center of excellence for limb trauma and limb loss. We focus on the best-supported scientific and medical data and health care for service members and other Department of Defense community members with these injuries. We foster clinical practice and provide support tools to clinicians, patients, families, and caregivers. We help the clinicians who work with these patients be as efficient and effective as possible.

EACE assists our providers as they rehabilitate our wounded warriors and create a new normal for all patients with extremity trauma and amputation. Our specialists and staff work with the Department of Veterans Affairs to create internationally recognized clinical practice guidelines, so all limb rehabilitation follows the same best evidence.

The DOD and VA published the current upper limb amputation clinical practice guideline in 2022. These documents are regularly reviewed and updated to add new treatments and programs that improve patient care. DOD-VA published our revised clinical practice guideline for lower limb amputation rehabilitation in January 2025.

EACE offers every patient like your husband a guide called “Within Reach: The Journey After Upper Limb Amputation.” The guide provides information on coping skills, pain management, caring for your remaining limb, physical rehabilitation, and artificial limbs. The guide is available digitally on the EACE website under clinical affairs.

For soon-to-be parents, parents, families, and caregivers, we have a helpful handout, “Pregnancy, Childcare and Parenting after Upper Limb Amputation Rehabilitation.” It includes tips such as how to manage child care tasks.

The DOD Amputation Prosthetics Clearinghouse is a new portal for advice, discussion, and referral to one of the three Advanced Rehabilitation Centers in the DHA. The three ARCs are located at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, where I work; Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas; and Naval Medical Center San Diego, in San Diego, California.

These programs lead to advances in treating and restoring function after limb trauma and amputation. The centers are the only military hospitals that fabricate and modify artificial limbs. They also provide high-quality care from before surgery until you can return to your community.

You and your military hospital or clinic providers can reach out to me and my staff with questions at either of these emails: dha.ncr.Medical-Affairs.mbx.amputation-prosth-coe@health.mil. Additionally, phone numbers for contacts at each ARC are available on the fact sheets.

Other resources include the VA’s Amputation System of Care or its Polytrauma/TBI System of Care.

EACE also has information on surgeries such as directly attaching an artificial limb to the patient’s bone. This surgery can help patients who have difficulty tolerating a socket.

EACE focuses on research that can save injured limbs, avoid amputations, and preserve and restore injured limb function. We work to make our patients return to the highest possible level of physical, mental, and emotional function. Our warfighters deserve no less. We truly appreciate all that you do.

Justine,

As you can tell, you and your husband have a lot of support in this recovery. Stay safe out there.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2411/8763232/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-15 12:56:38.608579

About the webinar

Medicaid has played a vital role in providing health coverage for individuals and families with low incomes and special care needs. For military-connected families, Medicaid can serve as a valuable complement to TRICARE, particularly for those caring for family members with special healthcare needs.

Additionally, Medicare may become a critical source of coverage for individuals transitioning out of military service due to separation or retirement.

The webinar will be led by Christopher Plein, Ph.D., Eberly Family Professor for Outstanding Public Service Emeritus at West Virginia University.

Learning objectives

Identify how Medicaid supports military-connected families, including those on active duty, in the National Guard and Reserve and those who are retired or separated from service.

Describe the interaction between Medicaid and TRICARE in providing healthcare coverage.

Explore the role of Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services waivers in supporting dependents with special care needs.

Review current policy developments and proposed changes in Medicaid that may impact military-connected families.

The company also provided updates on its business and clinical programs.

Financial Highlights

For the first quarter of 2025, BiomX reported a net loss of $7.7 million, a significant improvement from the $17.3 million net loss in the same period of 2024. The decrease in net loss is primarily attributed to changes in the fair value of warrants issued in previous financings. Research and development expenses increased to $5.3 million from $4.1 million in the first quarter of 2024, driven by preparations for the Phase 2b clinical trial of BX004 and increased expenses related to the Phase 2 trial of BX211. General and administrative expenses slightly decreased to $2.5 million from $2.7 million in the same period last year.

Business and Operational Highlights

BiomX announced positive topline results from its Phase 2 trial evaluating BX211 for the treatment of diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO). The trial demonstrated that BX211 was safe, well-tolerated, and produced statistically significant improvements in ulcer size and depth compared to placebo. Additionally, the company is on track to report topline results for its BX004 Phase 2b study in cystic fibrosis (CF) in the first quarter of 2026.

Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments

In April 2025, BiomX shareholders approved the exercise of warrants issued in the $12 million financings announced in February 2025. These funds are expected to support the company's activities through the anticipated Phase 2b results for the BX004 trial. The company also highlighted the significant non-dilutive funding of approximately $40 million from the U.S. Defense Health Agency (DHA) for the BX211 program.

Management's Perspective

Jonathan Solomon, Chief Executive Officer of BiomX, expressed satisfaction with the company's progress, particularly the positive Phase 2 results from the BX211 program. He emphasized the importance of these results in reinforcing the potential of phage therapy to address serious, resistant infections. Solomon also highlighted the company's focus on the upcoming Phase 2b readout of BX004 in cystic fibrosis, supported by recent financings.

Future Outlook

BiomX anticipates reporting topline results for the BX004 Phase 2b study in cystic fibrosis in the first quarter of 2026. The company is also planning a Phase 2/3 clinical trial for BX211, pending feedback from the FDA.

During the first quarter, BiomX initiated the exploration and analysis of real-world evidence in people with CF on the relationship between P. aeruginosa reduction and clinical outcomes. Regulatory discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and other regulatory authorities are expected in the second half of 2025, during which we intend to present our plans to analyze real-world evidence and seek endorsement that supports potential future regulatory filings.

Business Update

On April 21, 2025, a BiomX Special Meeting of stockholders took place during which shareholders approved the exercise of certain warrants issued as part of the Company’s $12 million financings announced in February 2025. The completed financings will provide runway expected to support the Company’s activities into the first quarter of 2026, when the Company anticipates the readout of topline Phase 2b results for BX004 for the treatment of CF patients with chronic pulmonary infections caused by P. aeruginosa.

First Quarter 2025 Financial Results

Cash balance and restricted cash as of March 31, 2025, were $21.2 million, compared to $18.0 million as of December 31, 2024. The increase was primarily due to funds raised in the February 2025 financings, partly offset by net cash used in operating activities. BiomX estimates its cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are sufficient to fund its operations into the first quarter of 2026.

Research and development expenses, net were $5.3 million for the first quarter of 2025, compared to $4.1 million for the first quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily due to the following factors: preparations for the Phase 2b clinical trial of the Company’s CF product candidate, BX004; an increase in expenses relating to the Phase 2 clinical trial of the Company’s DFO product candidate, BX211; and an increase in rent and related expenses following the March 2024 acquisition of Adaptive Phage Therapeutics (APT). This increase was partly offset by higher grants BiomX received.

General and administrative expenses were $2.5 million for the first quarter of 2025, compared to $2.7 million for the first quarter of 2024. The decrease is primarily attributed to expenses incurred during 2024 in connection with the acquisition of APT completed in March 2024, partially offset by increased salaries and share-based compensation expenses.

Net loss was $7.7 million for the first quarter of 2025, compared to $17.3 million for the first quarter of 2024. The decrease is mainly due to the change in the fair value of the warrants issued as part of the Company’s financing completed in March 2024.

Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2025, was $8.7 million, compared to $11.4 million for the same period in 2024.

About BX211

BX211 is a phage treatment for the treatment of DFO associated with S. aureus. DFO is a bacterial infection of the bone that usually develops from an infected foot ulcer and is a leading cause of amputation in patients with diabetes. In March 2025, BiomX announced positive topline results from the Phase 2 trial in which BX211 was demonstrated to be safe and well-tolerated and patients receiving BX211 exhibited statistically significant1 and sustained reduction of ulcer size (PAR)(p = 0.046 at week 12; p=0.052 at week 13), with a separation from placebo starting at week 7 and a difference greater than 40% by week 10. In addition, BX211 also produced statistically significant1 improvements in both ulcer depth at week 13 (in patients with ulcer depth defined as bone at baseline, ulcer depth was classified according to deepest tissue involved as measured by swab) (p=0.048), and in reducing the expansion of ulcer area (p=0.017). Over the 12-week treatment period, all patients (treatment and placebo) were treated in accordance with standard of care, including with systemic antibiotic therapy as appropriate. BiomX is currently planning a Phase 2/3 trial, pending discussions and feedback from the FDA.

About BX004

BiomX is developing BX004, a fixed multi-phage cocktail, for the treatment of CF patients with chronic pulmonary infections caused by P. aeruginosa, a main contributor to morbidity and mortality in patients with CF. In November 2023, BiomX announced positive topline results from Part 2 of the Phase 1b/2a trial where BX004 demonstrated improvement in pulmonary function associated with a reduction in P. aeruginosa burden compared to placebo in a predefined subgroup of patients with reduced lung function (baseline FEV1<70%). BiomX expects to initiate a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase 2b trial in CF patients with chronic P. aeruginosa pulmonary infections. The trial is designed to enroll approximately 60 patients randomized at a 2:1 ratio to BX004 or placebo. Treatment is expected to be administered via inhalation twice daily for a duration of 8 weeks. The trial is designed to monitor the safety and tolerability of BX004 and is designed to demonstrate improvement in microbiological reduction of P. aeruginosa burden and evaluation of effects on clinical parameters such as lung function measured by FEV1 and patient reported outcomes. Pending progress of the trial, topline results are expected in the first quarter of 2026. The FDA has granted BX004 Fast Track designation and Orphan Drug Designation.

(NYSE American: PHGE) (“BiomX” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage company advancing novel natural and engineered phage therapies that target specific pathogenic bacteria, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025, and provided program and business updates.

“The first quarter of 2025 was a period of exceptional progress for BiomX, both on the corporate front and across our clinical pipeline,” said Jonathan Solomon, Chief Executive Officer of BiomX. “The strength of the positive Phase 2 results from our BX211 program in diabetic foot osteomyelitis exceeded our expectations and received resounding endorsement from key opinion leaders and industry experts. These positive results represent a significant milestone for the field of bacteriophage therapy and further reinforce our platform’s potential to address serious, resistant infections. Notably, the BX211 program has been supported to date by approximately $40 million in non-dilutive funding from the U.S. Defense Health Agency (DHA), which has identified an urgent need for new treatments to combat antibiotic-resistant infections in current and future conflict environments. The work received DHA and Department of Navy funding under an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) award through the Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium (MTEC) and managed by the Naval Medical Research Command (NMRC) – Naval Advanced Medical Development (NAMD). We are currently in discussions regarding potential next steps in partnership with the DHA to further advance this program. Looking ahead, we remain focused on our next major catalyst, which is the anticipated Phase 2b readout of BX004 in cystic fibrosis in the first quarter of next year, supported by the recent financings we secured to advance this program and extend our operational runway.”

BX211 – phage for the treatment of DFO associated with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)

In March 2025, BiomX announced positive results from the Company’s DFO Adaptive Novel Care Evaluation (DANCE™) Phase 2 trial evaluating its BX211 phage treatment for DFO associated with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus).

Key highlights from the Phase 2 trial results included:

BX211 was found to be safe and well-tolerated.

BX211 produced sustained and statistically significant1 Percentage Area Reduction (PAR) of ulcer size (p = 0.046 at week 12; p=0.052 at week 13), with a separation from placebo (standard of care) starting at week 7 and a difference greater than 40% by week 10.

Compared to placebo, BX211 also produced statistically significant1 improvements in both ulcer depth at week 13 (in patients with ulcer depth defined as bone at baseline) (p=0.048), and in reducing the expansion of ulcer area (p=0.017), compared to placebo.

BX211 demonstrated favorable trends compared to placebo across several additional clinical parameters, including: proportion of visits with no clinical evidence of infection; evidence of resolving DFO by MRI/X-ray at week 12; proportion of patients with abnormal C-Reactive Protein at baseline that achieved a reduction of CRP of at least 50% at any point in the study; and greater Wagner scale improvement2.

Through week 13, BX211 demonstrated comparable efficacy against both Methicillin-susceptible and resistant strains, as well as against high and low biofilm producers—consistent with the orthogonal mechanism of phage therapy to antibiotics and its inherent anti-biofilm capabilities.

A key opinion leader (KOL) event discussing the Phase 2 results took place on April 3, 2025. A replay of the webcast is available here, the content of which does not form a part of this press release.

Pending feedback from the FDA, BiomX is planning for a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of BX211.

BX004 – fixed phage cocktail for the treatment of CF in patients with chronic pulmonary infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa)

During the first quarter, BiomX initiated the exploration and analysis of real-world evidence in people with CF on the relationship between P. aeruginosa reduction and clinical outcomes. Regulatory discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and other regulatory authorities are expected in the second half of 2025, during which we intend to present our plans to analyze real-world evidence and seek endorsement that supports potential future regulatory filings.

Business Update

On April 21, 2025, a BiomX Special Meeting of stockholders took place during which shareholders approved the exercise of certain warrants issued as part of the Company’s $12 million financings announced in February 2025. The completed financings will provide runway expected to support the Company’s activities into the first quarter of 2026, when the Company anticipates the readout of topline Phase 2b results for BX004 for the treatment of CF patients with chronic pulmonary infections caused by P. aeruginosa.

First Quarter 2025 Financial Results

Cash balance and restricted cash as of March 31, 2025, were $21.2 million, compared to $18.0 million as of December 31, 2024. The increase was primarily due to funds raised in the February 2025 financings, partly offset by net cash used in operating activities. BiomX estimates its cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are sufficient to fund its operations into the first quarter of 2026.

Research and development expenses, net were $5.3 million for the first quarter of 2025, compared to $4.1 million for the first quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily due to the following factors: preparations for the Phase 2b clinical trial of the Company’s CF product candidate, BX004; an increase in expenses relating to the Phase 2 clinical trial of the Company’s DFO product candidate, BX211; and an increase in rent and related expenses following the March 2024 acquisition of Adaptive Phage Therapeutics (APT). This increase was partly offset by higher grants BiomX received.

General and administrative expenses were $2.5 million for the first quarter of 2025, compared to $2.7 million for the first quarter of 2024. The decrease is primarily attributed to expenses incurred during 2024 in connection with the acquisition of APT completed in March 2024, partially offset by increased salaries and share-based compensation expenses.

Net loss was $7.7 million for the first quarter of 2025, compared to $17.3 million for the first quarter of 2024. The decrease is mainly due to the change in the fair value of the warrants issued as part of the Company’s financing completed in March 2024.

Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2025, was $8.7 million, compared to $11.4 million for the same period in 2024.

Conference Call and Webcast Details

About BX211

BX211 is a phage treatment for the treatment of DFO associated with S. aureus. DFO is a bacterial infection of the bone that usually develops from an infected foot ulcer and is a leading cause of amputation in patients with diabetes. In March 2025, BiomX announced positive topline results from the Phase 2 trial in which BX211 was demonstrated to be safe and well-tolerated and patients receiving BX211 exhibited statistically significant1 and sustained reduction of ulcer size (PAR)(p = 0.046 at week 12; p=0.052 at week 13), with a separation from placebo starting at week 7 and a difference greater than 40% by week 10. In addition, BX211 also produced statistically significant1 improvements in both ulcer depth at week 13 (in patients with ulcer depth defined as bone at baseline, ulcer depth was classified according to deepest tissue involved as measured by swab) (p=0.048), and in reducing the expansion of ulcer area (p=0.017). Over the 12-week treatment period, all patients (treatment and placebo) were treated in accordance with standard of care, including with systemic antibiotic therapy as appropriate. BiomX is currently planning a Phase 2/3 trial, pending discussions and feedback from the FDA.

About BX004

BiomX is developing BX004, a fixed multi-phage cocktail, for the treatment of CF patients with chronic pulmonary infections caused by P. aeruginosa, a main contributor to morbidity and mortality in patients with CF. In November 2023, BiomX announced positive topline results from Part 2 of the Phase 1b/2a trial where BX004 demonstrated improvement in pulmonary function associated with a reduction in P. aeruginosa burden compared to placebo in a predefined subgroup of patients with reduced lung function (baseline FEV1<70%). BiomX expects to initiate a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase 2b trial in CF patients with chronic P. aeruginosa pulmonary infections. The trial is designed to enroll approximately 60 patients randomized at a 2:1 ratio to BX004 or placebo. Treatment is expected to be administered via inhalation twice daily for a duration of 8 weeks. The trial is designed to monitor the safety and tolerability of BX004 and is designed to demonstrate improvement in microbiological reduction of P. aeruginosa burden and evaluation of effects on clinical parameters such as lung function measured by FEV1 and patient reported outcomes. Pending progress of the trial, topline results are expected in the first quarter of 2026. The FDA has granted BX004 Fast Track designation and Orphan Drug Designation.

In addition, the jury determined that Omnicare’s parent company, CVS Health Corporation (CVS), which acquired Omnicare in 2015, caused the false claims to be submitted.
The government further alleged that CVS “caused” the claims to be submitted, as it was aware of deficiencies in Omnicare’s practices but failed to correct them.
After the government rested its case, CVS filed a motion for a directed verdict, arguing that the government failed to satisfy its burden that CVS “caused” the false claims to be submitted.
Judge McMahon reserved judgment on the motion, finding that there was enough evidence for the jury to determine false claims liability for CVS.","On April 29, 2025, a federal jury in the Southern District of New York found Omnicare liable for illegally dispensing drugs to elderly and disabled people in long-term care facilities without legitimate prescriptions. A unanimous jury concluded that Omnicare, the largest long-term care pharmacy in the United States, fraudulently billed Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE, a government military healthcare program, for more than three million false claims totaling more than $135 million in damages — one of the largest jury verdicts ever in an FCA case. If trebled, damages could reach more than $400 million, plus penalties. In addition, the jury determined that Omnicare’s parent company, CVS Health Corporation (CVS), which acquired Omnicare in 2015, caused the false claims to be submitted.

The relator, an Omnicare pharmacist, filed suit in 2015, and in 2019 the federal government, 29 states, and the District of Columbia intervened. The four-week jury trial began on April 1, 2025. The government alleged that Omnicare dispensed drugs to individuals in assisted living and other long-term residential facilities that were not supported by valid prescriptions under state law and then submitted claims for reimbursement for those prescriptions to the federal healthcare programs. The government further alleged that CVS “caused” the claims to be submitted, as it was aware of deficiencies in Omnicare’s practices but failed to correct them. CVS focused its defense heavily on a materiality argument, arguing that the practice at issue was allowed by law in many states and accepted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

After the government rested its case, CVS filed a motion for a directed verdict, arguing that the government failed to satisfy its burden that CVS “caused” the false claims to be submitted. Judge McMahon reserved judgment on the motion, finding that there was enough evidence for the jury to determine false claims liability for CVS. Specifically, she found the evidence showed that CVS “had ultimate oversight over Omnicare’s compliance with Government program regulations — indeed, was required to do so by virtue of the [Corporate Integrity Agreement]” that CVS had entered into in 2016 related to different conduct by Omnicare; and “that [CVS] was aware of the compliance issues that underlie this case, and the fact that certain fixes had been proposed to remedy them” but “opted not to force [Omnicare] to adopt those fixes.”

The parties will submit briefing over the next month addressing the penalties to be assessed under the FCA, and CVS has said that it plans to appeal the decision. We at Qui Notes will continue to keep you updated on developments in the case.

In response to the Governor’s May Revision to the 2025-26 state budget, California Medical Association (CMA) President Shannon Udovic-Constant, M.D., issued the following the statement:

""The Newsom administration’s decision to divert voter-approved Proposition 35 and Proposition 56 funds is a direct violation of the will of California voters.

""Instead of honoring the clear intent of Prop 35 and voters – to increase access to care for Medi-Cal patients through a protected funding stream – the Governor is proposing to use this money to patch a budget shortfall of the state’s own making. At the same time, the Governor is repurposing Prop 56 dollars (passed in 2016) that provide critical funding to family planning and reproductive health care services and dental care.
