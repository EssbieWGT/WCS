SAN FRANCISCO , April 2, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- A securities class action has been filed against Zynex, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZYXI), a medical device manufacturer that produces and markets electrotherapy devices for use in pain management and physical rehabilitation, after it reported dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results which sent the price of Zynex shares down $3.59 (-51%) on March 12, 2025. The suit, captioned Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., et al., No. 1:25-cv-00913 (D. Colo.) seeks to represent investors who purchased Zynex securities between March 13, 2023 and March 11, 2025.

Zynex, Inc. (ZYXI) Securities Class Action:

The litigation is focused on the propriety of Zynex's statements about its sales and billing practices, its revenue recognition practices, and its relationship with the military health program for active-duty soldiers and their family members (""Tricare""), which represents 20 – 25% of company's revenue.

The complaint alleges that Zynex made false and misleading statements while failing to disclose crucial information to investors. More specifically, the suit alleges that:

Zynex shipped product, including electrodes, in excess of customers' needs;

As a result of this practice, Zynex inflated its revenues;

Zynex's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; and

As a. result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences such as removal from insurer networks and penalties by the federal government.

Investors began to learn the truth on June 4, 2024, when medical journal STAAT published ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills."" This report claimed that Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" STAAT further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

Then, on March 11, 2025, Zynex reported dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The company's Q4 revenue implied a 2% drop from the year-earlier period and YE net income per share plummeted from $0.27 in 2023 to $0.09 in 2024. According to Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard ""[o]ur fourth quarter revenue was less than expected[]"" and ""[t]he shortfall was due to slower than normal payments from certain payers and we were recently notified that Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.""

""We are concerned about potential issues with Zynex's revenue recognition and sales practices,"" said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

It would require TRICARE, the military's health insurance, to cover infertility diagnosis and treatments, including in vitro fertilization, or IVF.

Congresswoman Sara Jacobs co-authored the act alongside Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) and Rep. Rick Larsen (WA-02).

""I froze my eggs very publicly in my first year in Congress, and obviously representing San Diego, I talked to a lot of military families,"" Jacobs said. ""It became very clear to me that this is something that we really need to provide to our military families.""

Statistics from the World Health Organization show the general population has a 17.5% infertility rate. According to Jacobs, about 25% of military families are facing fertility challenges.

""You have these folks who are deployed far away from their families, from their partners. We're often asking them to be doing really dangerous things in dangerous places during their prime reproductive years,"" Jacobs said. ""They're often around chemicals and other things that I'm sure have negative fertility impacts.""

Treatments can be difficult to access through TRICARE. Currently, active duty military must prove their infertility is service-related to receive coverage.

Jacobs said military families are left with few options: forgo having kids, pay tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket or leave the military for a private sector job that covers IVF.

""This would be another incentive to help people want to stay in the military, who are already there, and are serving our country, and also potentially an incentive for folks to join the military,"" Jacobs said.

Jacobs pushed for similar legislation in the past. Last year, a provision to expand TRICARE coverage for IVF was included in the National Defense Authorization Act but was cut from the final version with no explanation why. Jacobs said House Speaker Mike Johnson opposed the legislation.

Military medicine cutbacks put strain on civilian health care system — as well as service members and retirees

Sitting in the living room of his Silverdale home, wearing a tube in his nostrils, Al Pinkham watches the evening news while recovering from a bad case of flu.

During his 24-year career in the Navy, Pinkham never worried much about health care. He knew that the military would look after him, as well as his wife and children, providing exactly “what a sailor needed” to focus during long deployments.

Yet as a retiree, Pinkham, 78, has almost no relationship with the military health system he once relied on. His latest illness was treated at St. Michael Medical Center in Silverdale. He no longer goes to Naval Hospital Bremerton, a once-thriving military hospital that has served the West Sound in some form for over a century.

Retirees forced out of military system

Over the last decade, the hospital has been gutted, leaving a major gap in the local health care sector and bogging down local providers. As military retirees and beneficiaries are forced out of the military system, they increasingly find themselves searching for care in an overburdened civilian sector desperately short on providers and struggling to provide access to routine care.

And there remains little sign the bleeding will stop soon. Earlier this year, the hospital announced it was transfering nearly 700 internal medicine clinic patients, who are mostly retirees, to civilian providers amid staffing shortages. The decision raises questions about exactly what primary care services are left at the hospital.

A spokesperson for the hospital did not make a member of its leadership available for an interview to discuss staffing levels, despite multiple requests over the last month. A list of questions sent over email also went unanswered by press time Tuesday.

“This downsize is part of a continuous trend in the declining quality of care at [Naval Hospital Bremerton],” Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, wrote in a letter following news of the Internalist clinic. Murray went on to say that the hospital has continued to experience staffing shortages but outlined no plans to address them. She also questioned the given reasons for those shortages.

“This pattern of declining care and personnel mismanagement at one of the largest Naval bases in the nation suggests a lack of attention to the healthcare needs of servicemembers, veterans, and their families in Kitsap County,” she wrote.

‘Should not have been a surprise’

Retired Air Force officer Jim Chapin was at the Jan. 31 town hall when officials at Naval Hospital Bremerton announced it would be transferring patients from its Internal Medicine Clinic to providers in the community. In a new release, the hospital said retirements and permanent change-of-duty orders had left them only one physician for over 2,000 patients.

“We did not make this decision lightly,” Capt. Molly Jenkins, the hospital’s executive officer, said during the town hall, according to the release. We “have been studying this issue for months.”

Standing in the hospital’s cafeteria, filled with “an awful lot of old people,” Chapin said that announcement “should not have been a surprise to anybody.” Over the last several years “it’s been quite obvious that there were not enough naval doctors.”

When Chapin and his wife, who live in Bremerton, first started going to the hospital about 16 years ago, it was often so busy in the morning you would have to park down by the water on Ostrich Bay. In the last five years or so, he has always been able to park right out front.

“I talked to some of the people I knew at the hospital. They said ‘they’re just cutting back because they don’t have the personal,” he said.

Shortages in civilian system

Both Chapin and his wife still use the hospital’s urgent care and pharmacy, but after the latest cut no longer have a primary doctor there.

Patients were offered help every Tuesday morning at the hospital to search for a new doctor. That could be tough for some. Kitsap County has a shortage of primary care providers, with about half as many per capita as the state average in 2023, according to Washington Health Care Research Center

Chapin was able to find primary care at the Veterans Affairs Clinic in Silverdale. But his wife, who is ineligible for VA care, is still looking for a new physician.

“It’s easy for me,” he said of the search. “For my wife, she can’t get VA benefits. She has to find a doctor she wants to go to. And as I’ve said, we’ve always relied on the Navy for the last 16 years.”

Budget cuts and military readiness

Reductions at Naval Hospital Bremerton over the last decade come as the Department of Defense has reduced spending on health care. As part of a major realignment designed to shed costs, it has prioritized operational readiness for wartime missions and care for those on active duty over that of beneficiaries and retirees.

The military health system has faced mounting financial pressure over the last two decades after expanding benefits to retirees and increased demand from two wars, Dr. Terry Adirim, a former assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, wrote in a 2019 report. That caused Department of Defense spending on health care to more than double during the 2000s.

By 2010, then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates remarked that health care costs were “eating the [DoD] alive,” and urged officials to find cuts and redirect savings to combat forces. Several initiatives helped reign in spending, including formation of the The Defense Health Agency.

Launched in 2013, the agency was first created to manage services shared between the Army, Navy and Air Force. Military health has been historically fragmented, with each branch operating its own facilities. Establishing a single agency was thought to be the best strategy to sustain combat readiness while reducing costs and increasing efficiency of federal spending.

Congress directed the DoD in 2017 to consolidate administration of its health care facilities of the three branches under the control of the Defense Health Agency. At the same time, the DoD announced plans to move nearly 2 million beneficiaries into the civilian health system.

Naval Hospital reductions

Exactly how this federal restructuring has directly impacted Naval Hospital Bremerton is unclear. But the hospital lost or reduced many of its services since the Defense Health Agency was created.

Naval Hospital Bremerton shuttered its 24/7 emergency room in 2013, replacing it with an urgent care that now opens just eight hours on weekdays. The hospital – which once delivered a quarter of Kitsap’s children – also put its labor and delivery services on divert status in 2022.

Dr. Gib Morrow, Kitsap County’s top public health official, said the community had seen “first-hand” the impact of the Defense Health Agency. Since its formation, the naval hospital has experienced closures of inpatient, emergency, critical and obstetric services, he said during a meeting last year.

In an email to the Kitsap Sun last month, Morrow wrote that the “The Kitsap Public Health Board has advocated for strengthening the military healthcare workforce and services available in Washington state and specifically at Naval Hospital Bremerton.”

In a joint letter the health board sent to DoD leaders last May, they wrote that care shortages left the “community, including those employed by and affiliated with the Department of Defense, face[ing] an ongoing health crisis.”

Caring for beneficiaries

Civilian providers say they are increasingly shouldering the load left by the Navy. The result is worse access across the board for primary, maternal and speciality care for all residents, including those not connected to the military. Shortages are driving up hospital bills, as more people depend on emergent care, and likely leading to worse outcomes for Kitsap patients.

Virginia Mason Franciscan Health, which operates St. Michael Medical Center in Silverdale and St. Anthony Hospital in Gig Harbor, has seen “increased demand as military health care facilities have adjusted their offerings over the years,” St Micheal President Chad Melton wrote in an email.

Peninsula Community Health Services, a federally designated community health center serving the Peninsula, found a nearly 40% increase in the number of self-identified veterans at its clinics between 2023 and 2024, according to agency CEO Jennifer Kreidler-Moss.

Until the last 20 years or so, if you had TRICARE — health insurance for military members and their families — you went to the military hospital for care, said Kreidler-Moss, who is a beneficiary of military insurance. That was how it worked.

“That is definitely not the case anymore,” she said. “Now you know you are going to seek care in the community.”

TRICARE clashes with civilian system

Civilian providers often have a hard time treating patients on TRICARE effectively, because they need prior authorization for most treatments. That means doctors are often forced to look at their patients in a vacuum and offer substandard care.

“This is a regular dilemma. A patient will come in for hypertension that they have authorization for,” Kreidler-Moss said. “If during that visit because they have lab work, [and] our provider figures out that they also have diabetes, we don’t get paid for the visit if we bill for diabetes and not what their conditions were . . . which is just not how medicine works.”

VMFH and the Kitsap Public Health District say they have an ongoing relationship with the Navy. But Kreidler-Moss said PCHS gets no advanced warning when a carrier is coming or going, which can have a large sway on health care demand.

A few decades ago, when an aircraft carrier arrived into Bremerton, both its active-duty members and their beneficiaries were sufficiently cared for by the military system. Today, many of those beneficiaries cannot get care at Naval Hospital Bremerton, Kreidler-Moss said. Local providers see a sudden and often unexpected increase in demand that can be difficult to staff for.

“The Navy tends to say the carrier takes care of itself, because it has its own health care,” she said. “That’s true for active duty people. It’s not true for the surge who come with the carrier.”

Professional service

Chapin, the retired Air Force officer, said doctors at the naval hospital have always been professional. He credits the physician there for seeing a sign of testicular cancer and referring him to a urologist that prevented it from spreading.

“If it wasn’t for that Navy Doctor telling me that maybe I had a problem I would’ve never known,” he said. “The [civilian] urologist just kept saying I don’t understand why you’re here. You have no symptoms.”

Pinkham, the Navy retiree, insists, even amid the reductions, he doesn’t want to “bad mouth” the Navy. He does not go to Naval Hospital Bremerton anymore, but the providers have always delivered good service. And, more importantly, his wife is alive today because of Navy doctors, he said.

Still, he agrees Navy medicine used to be simpler; easier to access, but states plainly that “things have changed.”

“Medicine is different now,” he said. “The Navy is different now.”",https://www.gigharbornow.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NHB_Pinkham-1-1200x630.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-01 19:56:21.295260

In early 2024, the Department of the Air Force unveiled sweeping plans for reshaping, refocusing, and reoptimizing the Air Force and Space Force to ensure continued supremacy in their respective domains while better posturing the services to deter and, if necessary, prevail in an era of Great Power Competition. Through a series of 24 DAF-wide key decisions, four core areas which demand the Department’s attention will be addressed: Develop People, Generate Readiness, Project Power and Develop Capabilities.

The space domain is no longer benign; it has rapidly become congested and contested.

Covered services

You can use online visits for many types of care. These include:

Primary care, including on-demand non-emergency care

Preventive care

Telemental health care

Specialty care

Remote monitoring for serious chronic conditions

Before you book a virtual health visit, call or visit your regional contractor’s web page. Some types of care need a referral or pre-authorization.

Do you get your care at a military hospital or clinic? Many of these virtual health services may be available there. Contact your provider for more information. If you’re an active duty service member, you need a referral and pre-authorization from your primary care manager for virtual health care.

As described in the TRICARE Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Services Fact Sheet, virtual mental health services have the same referrals and pre-authorization requirements as your in-person mental health care.

Costs

Virtual health costs are similar to in-person costs. Your costs depend on who you are, health plan, and type of appointment. Note that you’ll need to pay your usual cost-shares and copayments for virtual visits.

What you need

To use virtual health services, you need:

A computer or smartphone (for video care)

A telephone (for telephone-only care)

A secure phone or internet connection

Referrals or pre-authorizations (if required)

Overseas

Do you live outside the United States? You can still use virtual health services if:

The care is a TRICARE-covered benefit and is appropriate for virtual health.

The country where you receive care allows virtual health.

The provider is licensed and TRICARE-authorized and has a license to practice in the country where you receive care.

The provider knows your location and how to contact help in a medical or mental health emergency.

The provider follows all local healthcare and virtual health rules.

TRICARE will cover your virtual health care if you meet these requirements.

TRICARE For Life and Medicare

Do you have TRICARE For Life? Medicare usually pays first for virtual visits. This includes phone calls with your doctor. Remember to check what Medicare and TRICARE cover before scheduling an appointment. TRICARE pays first if Medicare doesn’t cover a service.

Autism Care Demonstration

TRICARE covers services for parents of children with autism. This includes applied behavior analysis guidance. These services are under the Autism Care Demonstration.

Want to learn more about virtual health coverage? Contact your TRICARE regional contractor or visit tricare.mil. Medicare members can also check Medicare.gov for additional details about their coverage.

We know so many military families are struggling to make ends meet as it is and are facing really significant fertility challenges.
One of the biggest concerns surrounding the addition of in vitro fertilization for military members should be no surprise—cost.","Using TRICARE to cover healthcare expenses is an integral part of military life, but it’s falling short for many warfighters. Military in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment isn’t covered, but there are politicians working to change this for service members and their families.

Does the Military Pay for In Vitro Fertilization?

TRICARE doesn’t cover Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) services like IUI, IVF, or cryopreservation. However, in 2024, a new Defense Department policy expanded fertility treatment eligibility to unmarried service members and those needing donor eggs or sperm.

Previously, these benefits were limited to certain married service members, with policies excluding same-sex couples.

Even though new measures have improved access, ART services still aren’t fully covered, so those seeking treatment may need to explore other options for financial support.

This is why there’s still a push to do more for service members seeking IVF treatments as a viable option for starting their families.

Democrats Pushing for IVF Coverage for Military Members

Congressional Democrats are pushing to expand IVF access for military service members by introducing legislation that would require TRICARE to cover the procedure.

Led by Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-CA), the bill aims to match the fertility benefits available to Congress members and remove the requirement that infertility be directly linked to military service.

Supporters say that having the military cover in vitro fertilization could be life-changing, allowing service members to grow their families without sacrificing their careers.

“I think it will be huge. We know so many military families are struggling to make ends meet as it is and are facing really significant fertility challenges. It would be life-changing. We shouldn't make them choose between serving our country and building their families,” said Rep. Jacobs.

Sen. Duckworth understands the plight of warfighters and IVF treatments as an Iraq War Veteran. She has been open about the use of these healthcare options when conceiving her two children.

President Donald Trump spoke positively of IVF treatment while campaigning and the idea is that now there could be more support for a bipartisan approach.

“President Trump pledged to voters on the campaign trail that he would go even further by making IVF free if elected and has repeated the bold-faced lie that he is governing on the principle of ‘promises made, promises kept.’ Republicans can now help him partially fulfill his broken IVF promise by joining our commonsense legislation that would make sure those who answer the call to serve have access to the care they need to build their family,” said Duckworth through a statement.

IVF Could Help Military Families Grow

The unfortunate reality is that while warfighters have a duty to our nation, they’re often forced to choose between defending our nation and starting a family.

Because of the difficulties involving IVF and getting TRICARE to pay for it, there are worries that operational readiness is being affected.

“For too many service members, the lack of TRICARE coverage of IVF has left them with only a few choices: beat the odds and prove that their infertility is directly related to their service, pay tens of thousands of dollars out-of-pocket for a chance at a family, forgo having children, or leave the military. This is wrong,” said Jacobs.

Besides just helping warfighters and their families by providing this benefit, proponents are also arguing the logical side of things, as Congress members are now allowed to have their infertility treatments covered.

“It makes no sense that members of Congress and the rest of the federal workforce will get this, but military families still won't,” said Jacobs.

Efforts Have Been Ongoing

This isn’t the first time the Democratic lawmakers have worked on this initiative.

In 2024, Sen. Duckworth and Rep. Jacobs worked together on an IVF proposal for military members that made it through the House Armed Services Committee but failed to make the final defense bill.

Duckworth herself has faced multiple blocks from the Republican Party while championing such initiatives.

One of the biggest concerns surrounding the addition of in vitro fertilization for military members should be no surprise—cost.

The added expense is what caused Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) to block a similar measure aiming to provide this healthcare to warfighters.

Now, the duo is trying again with a standalone bill, giving it a fresh chance for approval, but despite some hope of bipartisan support due to President Trump’s comments, military IVF coverage is still an uphill battle.

The Politics of TRICARE Covering In Vitro Fertilization for the Military

There may be strong supporters on the Democratic side of things but if a change to TRICARE is going to become a reality, the Republicans will need to get on board.

Unfortunately, as of this writing, there have been no Republicans who have cosponsored the bill brought up by Duckworth and Jacobs.

There’s still hope as Trump has called himself the “father of IVF,” stating that he “strongly support(s) the availability of IVF for couples who are trying to have a precious baby.”

“Fertilization. I'm still very proud of it, I don't care. I'll be known as the fertilization President, and that's OK. That's not bad. I've been called much worse. Actually, I like it, right?” said President Trump.

Regardless of which bill or method is successful, providing military members with TRICARE coverage for in vitro fertilization is an important initiative that could help the community overcome a sensitive matter with the dignity and resources they deserve.

Use the benefits most people ignore Most military spouses only use Tricare for routine doctor’s visits, but those who know the system well take advantage of benefits that make life easier.
It’s so easy to use Tricare to your advantage Military spouses have access to some of the best healthcare coverage available, but those who get the most out of it know how to work the system to their advantage.
Tricare is here to take care of your family, wherever military life takes you.","Tricare is one of the biggest perks of military life, but most people don’t realize how much better it works when you know the system inside and out. Spouses who get the best care aren’t just lucky. They know exactly how to navigate Tricare’s red tape, avoid common delays, and use benefits most people ignore.

If you’re only using Tricare at the bare minimum, you’re leaving benefits (and convenience) on the table.

Here’s how to use Tricare like an expert so you get the care you need, when you need it, without the usual headaches:

Picture this: You’re at a pharmacy picking up a prescription, and suddenly, you’re told your Tricare isn’t active. Stressful, right? The problem usually comes down to outdated records in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS)—the database that keeps your Tricare access running smoothly. If your information isn’t correct, you could find yourself without coverage at the worst possible time.

Log into MilConnect today and check your DEERS info. If anything looks off, fix it now. Don’t wait until you’re at the doctor’s office scrambling to correct an error. Moved recently? Had a baby? Got married? Every major life change means an update to DEERS. The sooner you do it, the fewer problems you’ll run into when you need care.

Choose the right Tricare plan for your needs

It’s important to remember this isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. The best plan for you depends on how much flexibility and control you want over your care.

If you want zero out-of-pocket costs and don’t mind going through a Primary Care Manager (PCM), Tricare Prime is your best bet. You’ll need referrals for specialists, but everything is covered, and there are no surprise medical bills. This is ideal for families who live near a military treatment facility and prefer a structured, managed approach to healthcare.

Prefer to choose your own doctors and avoid waiting on referrals? Tricare Select gives you full control. You’ll pay an annual deductible and co-pays per visit, but you can see any Tricare-authorized provider without permission from a PCM. This is a better option for those who need regular specialist care or live far from a military base.

If your spouse is in the Guard or Reserve and not on active orders, Tricare Reserve Select is the plan you need. It functions just like Tricare Select but must be purchased separately with monthly premiums. Many families assume they’re covered automatically—don’t make that mistake. If you’re in this category, make sure your enrollment is squared away before you need medical care.

For retirees, Tricare for Life is one of the best benefits you’ll ever have. It covers everything Medicare doesn’t, with no enrollment fees beyond signing up for Medicare Part B. Just make sure you enroll in Medicare on time to keep your Tricare benefits intact.

Use the benefits most people ignore

Most military spouses only use Tricare for routine doctor’s visits, but those who know the system well take advantage of benefits that make life easier.

Instead of rushing to the ER when a medical issue pops up in the middle of the night, call Nurse Advice Line. It’s open 24/7 and connects you with a registered nurse who can assess your symptoms and tell you whether you should go to urgent care, book an appointment, or treat symptoms at home.

Need regular prescriptions? Military treatment facilities offer 100% free prescriptions, but standing in long pharmacy lines isn’t ideal. Skip the wait by signing up for Tricare Express Scripts home delivery, which ships medications straight to your door for free.

If you need a specialist, don’t waste time calling around—use the Tricare Provider Directory to find in-network doctors. Some providers say they “take Tricare,” but that doesn’t mean they accept Tricare’s payment structure. Always double-check before scheduling an appointment to avoid unexpected bills.

Avoid common mistakes that cause delays

Even with great coverage, Tricare can be frustrating if you don’t know how to avoid common pitfalls.

Many spouses don’t realize that if you move and don’t update DEERS, your claims might get denied. Tricare ties coverage to your registered address, so failing to update it can result in problems when you seek care in a new location.

Tricare Prime users often get tripped up by booking a specialist without a referral. If you see a doctor without the proper authorization, Tricare won’t pay for it. Always go through your PCM first to avoid footing the bill yourself.

Another mistake? Assuming all civilian providers who “take Tricare” accept Tricare’s payment rates. Some doctors will accept Tricare but bill you extra because they don’t adhere to Tricare’s approved payment amounts. Use the Tricare Provider Directory to confirm that a provider is fully in-network before making an appointment.

It’s so easy to use Tricare to your advantage

Military spouses have access to some of the best healthcare coverage available, but those who get the most out of it know how to work the system to their advantage.

Stay on top of your DEERS updates. Choose the plan that best suits your needs. Use the lesser-known benefits that save time and hassle. And most importantly, avoid the common mistakes that slow everything down.

Tricare is here to take care of your family, wherever military life takes you. The key is knowing how to use it to its full potential.

The legislative effort, being led in the Senate by Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth and in the House by Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs, would bring IVF access afforded to military service members in parity with the services available to members of Congress. It would also modify current requirements that service members prove that their infertility challenges are directly connected to service, a barrier that the lawmakers say is often cumbersome or impossible to overcome.

The legislation, Jacobs said in an exclusive interview with ABC News, could be “life-changing” for military service members who are often forced to choose between continuing their military service and starting a family.

“I think it will be huge. We know so many military families are struggling to make ends meet as it is, and are facing really significant fertility challenges. It would be life-changing,” Jacobs told ABC News. “We shouldn’t make them choose between serving our country and building their families.”

Duckworth and Jacobs say that some members of the military have been forced to abandon their military careers because of the lack of infertility treatment coverage by their health care program, called TRICARE. It could present a risk to military readiness, they told ABC News.

“For too many service members, the lack of TRICARE coverage of IVF has left them with only a few choices: beat the odds and prove that their infertility is directly related to their service, pay tens of thousands of dollars out-of-pocket for a chance at a family, forgo having children, or leave the military. This is wrong,” Duckworth said.

It’s also about parity, they said: Starting this year, members of Congress are afforded access to plans that offer coverage for infertility treatments. Jacobs and Duckworth say the same should be true for military service members.

“It makes no sense that members of Congress and the rest of the federal workforce will get this, but military families still won’t,” Jacobs said.

This is not the first time that Jacobs and Duckworth have attempted to expand IVF access for military service members. They tried to get this same provision included in the massive military spending package, known as the National Defense Authorization Act, last year as both parties tried to reassure voters of their support for IVF and other infertility treatments.

Though the proposal made it through the House Armed Services Committee, it never made it into the final version of the bill that President Joe Biden signed into law during the waning days of his presidency.

Similar legislation was separately blocked in the Senate by Republican Sen. James Lankford last year. At the time, Lankford said that while he supports IVF, he was concerned about the indefinite cost of the legislation and the possibility it opened for “future definitions for gene editing or for cloning.”

Duckworth and Jacobs’ newest effort, however, is a stand-alone bill that could be voted on not as an amendment, but as it’s own legislation.

Duckworth, an Iraq War veteran, has been vocal about her own experiences using IVF to conceive her two children. She was involved in multiple efforts to expand IVF access last Congress that were ultimately blocked by Republicans.

She said this new proposal would give Republicans the opportunity to make good on President Donald Trump’s pro-IVF rhetoric that he’s used on the campaign trail and at the White House.

“President Trump pledged to voters on the campaign trail that he would go even further by making IVF free if elected and has repeated the bold-faced lie that he is governing on the principle of ‘promises made, promises kept,'” Duckworth said in a statement. “Republicans can now help him partially fulfill his broken IVF promise by joining our commonsense legislation that would make sure those who answer the call to serve have access to the care they need to build their family.”

No Republican has yet signed on as a cosponsor, but Duckworth and Jacobs are pointing to Trump’s comments as recently as last week touting his support for IVF as a possible boon to their efforts.

On the campaign trail, as an Alabama State Supreme Court ruling temporarily threw IVF access into question, Trump was vocal about his hope to make IVF continually accessible. He referred to himself as the “father of IVF” and issued a statement that said “I strongly support the availability of IVF for couples who are trying to have a precious baby.”

Trump has continued to make his support for IVF known. As recently as Wednesday when, during a Women’s History Month event, he referred to himself as the “fertilization president.”

“Fertilization. I’m still very proud of it, I don’t care. I’ll be known as the fertilization president, and that’s OK,” Trump said. “That’s not bad. I’ve been called much worse. Actually, I like it, right?”

It’s at this point unclear if the bill, which if pushed by Democrats to the Senate floor as a stand-alone bill would require the unanimous support of the Republican conference, would have the support it needs to pass. It’s also unclear if efforts to include it in this year’s National Defense Authorization Act or other major legislative pushes could lead to passage.

The California Medical Association (CMA) released its sponsored bill package for the 2025 legislative session. The seven-bill package tackles issues relating to bureaucratic delays in providing care, private equity’s influence on medicine, the use of artificial intelligence in health care, and increasing the physician workforce.

“CMA is advancing bold solutions that protect patients and prioritize their care,” said CMA President Shannon Udovic-Constant, M.D. “We are taking a strong stand against private equity’s profit-driven interference in medicine and pushing to end bureaucratic delays that harm patients. Our proactive approach to regulating artificial intelligence ensures that technology supports, rather than replaces, physician decision-making. We are driving change to ensure that patients always come first in our health care system.”

The bills in CMA’s sponsored bill package include:

SB 351 by Senator Christopher Cabaldon (SD 3): Private equity firms are gaining influence in our health care system, leading to rising costs and undermining the quality of care. SB 351 empowers the Attorney General to hold private equity groups accountable for interfering with the practice of medicine, allowing the Attorney General to investigate and take action against private equity firms that unlawfully interfere in the patient-physician relationship. The goal is to restore trust in the health care system, ensuring that medical decisions are made in the best interest of patients, not financial shareholders.

AB 489 by Assemblymember Mia Bonta (AD 18): While AI can be a useful tool in health care, it should not replace physician decision making. This bill would ban companies from marketing artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots as licensed medical professionals.

AB 967 by Assemblymember Avelino Valencia (AD 68): California is facing a physician shortage, leaving millions of residents waiting weeks and months to get critical care. This bill will streamline the process for licensing out-of-state physicians looking to practice in California.

Additionally, CMA is sponsoring a bill package entitled “Prioritizing Patients, Empowering Physicians” to cut bureaucracy in the health system that harms patients and delays the ability to provide care. The red tape, called prior authorization, has been shown to unnecessarily delay care and lead to serious adverse events such as hospitalizations, permanent bodily damage and even death. The Prioritizing Patients, Empowering Physicians package includes:

AB 510 by Assemblymember Dawn Addis (AD 30): Requires that appeals of prior authorization denials be performed by a provider of the same or similar specialty. This will help ensure that providers can discuss prior authorization denials with a professional peer who understands the recommended treatment and underlying condition.

AB 539 by Assemblymember Pilar Schiavo (AD 40): Extends the validity of an approved prior authorization to one year (current industry standard is 60 to 90 days). This will provide patients with a longer window of time to receive medically necessary care and avoid the cumbersome prior authorization review and appeal processes.

AB 512 by Assemblymember John Harabedian (AD 41): Requires health plans to respond to urgent prior authorization requests within 24 hours and respond to nonurgent requests within 48 hours. Currently, health plans have 72 hours for urgent requests and five days for nonurgent requests. This change will ensure more patients can receive care or appeal denials in a timely fashion.

SB 306 Senator Josh Becker (SD 13): Requires health plans to remove the requirement for prior authorization from any service that they approve more than 90% of the time. This will reduce the overall volume of prior authorization requests and ensure that patients can receive the care they need with minimal delay and physicians can spend more time focusing on patient care.

CMA thanks our partners in the Assembly and Senate for championing legislation to improve the quality, integrity and accessibility of our health care system.

Military public health experts who have monitored the occurrence of eye injuries among active-duty personnel say the numbers have continued to go down over the years.

U.S. Army Col. Mark Reynolds, ophthalmologist and chief of the Clinical Public Health and Epidemiology Directorate at Defense Health Agency-Public Health in Aberdeen, Maryland, has reported on these trends and supervised the monitoring of eye injury data throughout the pandemic.

Reynolds says the decline in eye injuries is in large part due to the Department of Defense’s successful efforts to ensure that service members use only the commercial protective eyewear identified in the Authorized Protective Eyewear List, known as APEL, during training and in combat.

“Unfortunately, eye injuries also occur during service members’ recreational activities such as when they play sports,” says U.S. Army Maj. John Koehler, optometrist and chief of DHA’s Tri-Service Vision Conservation and Readiness Branch at Aberdeen.

Sports activity injuries are also reflected in DHA’s annual military injury surveillance data.

“The DHA’s latest annual military injury surveillance data from 2021 showed that active-duty personnel required treatment for 13,635 eye injuries,” says Anna Renner, a senior CPHE injury prevention surveillance data analyst. “Of the medical records that indicated a cause, a quarter described a sports activity.”

“The sport reported to have caused the most eye injuries was basketball,” says Renner. “This was followed by martial arts and then tackle football. Soccer and wrestling were next.”

Basketball, football, and soccer are also consistent with sports identified by the National Eye Institute, or NEI, as having high and moderate eye injury risk.

“Eye injuries from participating in sports include corneal abrasions, blunt trauma, and penetrating eye injuries. Many eye injuries are temporary, but more severe eye injuries also occur. Some damage may even be permanent or result in blindness,” says U.S. Navy Capt. Kyle Dohm, an optometrist with DHA TSVCRB.

“All it takes is a random elbow or swipe of a fingernail across the eye during that platoon basketball tournament to take you out of the action and lead to days or weeks of limited duty,” Dohm says.

Does sports eye protection work?

According to the NEI, wearing the appropriate eye protection can prevent the majority of sports-related eye injuries.

As an example of effective injury prevention, in his 2000 American Society of Testing and Materials International, or ASTM, paper entitled, “Is the Facemask Good for Hockey?”, Dr. Paul F. Vinger, a Rutgers New Jersey Medical School graduate and practicing ophthalmologist in New Jersey, wrote:

“The ice hockey face protector is…extremely effective…Ice hockey face protectors prevent over 70,000 eye and face injuries a year with a savings...of over $10 million each year in the United States. No blinding eye injuries have been reported in any player...wearing an approved full-face protector while playing ice hockey. The success of the hockey face mask stems from the studied, deliberate process involved in the evaluation of the mechanisms of hockey injury and their means of prevention.”

The materials used in eye protection have been studied as well.

“Evidence has found that as much as 9 to10 times more energy was required to shatter a polycarbonate lens than other lens types, so polycarbonate material is recommended for impact resistance,” says U.S. Air Force Maj. Chen Yang, a DHA TSVCRB optometrist.

While the military’s APEL is not intended for individual sports, the ASTM has developed specific eye protective standard specifications for different sports. The ASTM standards are used when protective equipment is tested in independent laboratories – the ASTM does not certify specific commercial products.

Sports eye protection meeting an ASTM standard code for a particular sport will display that ASTM standard code or codes on the sports eye protector and/or its packaging. As an example, ASTM code F803-19 is recommended for impact resistance for many sports – though other ASTM standards are also required for certain sport-specific eye protection.

In addition, individual sports organizations have developed requirements and regulations regarding the wearing of eye protective equipment by their respective sport’s participants.

What can you do to reduce your risk of eye injury?

The DHA TSVCRB experts provide the following guidance:

When participating in sports and fitness activities with known eye hazards, people should know what eye protection is most appropriate and should wear it whenever they’re practicing or playing. Some sports protective eyewear can be made to incorporate prescriptions as well.

While the cost of recreational sports eyewear is the user’s responsibility in almost all cases, service members can get advice from their military optometrist or the TSVCRB regarding suitable protective eyewear for a chosen sport.

DHA public health experts remind service members and military athletes to protect their eyes in training, in combat and on the field of play:

• Use the APEL eyewear when you’re in training or performing combat operations.

• Use eyewear protectors meeting ASTM standards for intramural sports and athletic competition.

• Choose eyewear specifically made for your sport, and make sure it fits comfortably on your face.

Regulations that identify requirements in military sports facilities/fields (where service members play basketball, soccer, racquetball, ice hockey, football etc.) vary by service and installation. In most instances, such regulations are at the discretion of the installation commander.

Franzos is a retired U.S. Navy captain who flew the P3 Orion early in his career. He became a U.S. Navy physician and a flight surgeon and ultimately specialized in cardiovascular disease and internal medicine. He is an associate professor of medicine at the Department of Defense's premiere medical school. “Picking a diet you like and you can stick with, but that is also somewhat healthy—and will get you to your goals—is really critical,” Franzos said. His top nutritional lifestyle suggestion is the long-popular and varied Mediterranean diet. The diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, potatoes, beans, nuts, and seeds; olive oil as a primary fat source; and dairy products, eggs, fish, and poultry in low to moderate amounts. It centers on minimally processed, plant-based foods to prevent heart disease and stroke and reduce heart risk factors such as obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure.",https://health.mil/-/media/Images/MHS/Video-Thumbnails/Screenshot-20250331-at-24611PM.png,N,0.0,2025-04-01 09:56:18.091043

Work in the private sector is generally more volatile and it is incredible to not be dependent on your employer for healthcare and never having to change plans.

My buddy gets $14,000/yr bonus for using Tricare.

I went reserves when I left AD for grad school, partially for this reason. I would say it's worth it in some contexts, if your civilian job doesn't have very good insurance and you don't mind having a part-time job cutting into your free time, but take a really good look at what's available from your employer. Reserves and NG take more of your free time than advertised, and you're probably in a better place career-wise than you were before you joined.",,N,0.0,2025-04-01 07:56:42.282740

The Allegations: Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that Zynex, Inc. (ZYXI) Inflated its Revenue and Filed False Claims

According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; and (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government.

On March 11, 2025, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex further revealed ""Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims."" Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military. On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025.

What Now: You may be eligible to participate in the class action against Zynex, Inc. Shareholders who want to serve as lead plaintiff for the class must file their papers with the court by May 19, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. You do not have to participate in the case to be eligible for a recovery. If you choose to take no action, you can remain an absent class member. For more information, click here.

Health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) may be an option.","Tackling life after the military comes with its challenges, and one of the biggest decisions separating Service members face is figuring out health insurance. Whether you’re heading into a new job, enrolling in a different healthcare plan, or planning to retire, it’s important to know what options are available for you and your family. While most military retirees can continue using TRICARE, let’s go over what’s out there, especially if you’re separating or transitioning to civilian healthcare.

Review Your New Employer’s Health Plan

If you’ve landed a new civilian job, review the health insurance benefits they offer. Most employers provide a health plan that will serve as your primary coverage, like the TRICARE coverage you had while serving. You’ll likely need to sign up for your new employer’s plan as part of the onboarding process. Health insurance plans come in many shapes and sizes, but two of the most common types you’ll encounter are Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO) and Preferred Provider Organizations (PPO).

HMOs usually require you to choose a primary care physician (PCP), who then refers you to specialists if needed. These plans are cost-effective, but they do come with some restrictions, like only being able to see in-network doctors.

PPOs, on the other hand, are more flexible. You can see any specialist or doctor without needing a referral, and while in-network care is cheaper, you can still go outside the network for a higher cost. PPOs tend to have higher premiums but offer more freedom when it comes to choosing providers.

Some employers have a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP), which can be part of a PPO or HMO. These plans have higher deductibles but lower premiums, making them potentially more affordable to healthy participants. HDHPs are often paired with a Health Savings Account (HSA), which allows you to save money tax-free for medical expenses. If you are generally healthy and expect to need minimal coverage, a HDHP with an HSA could be a good way to manage your healthcare costs and save for future medical expenses.

Explore Other Coverage Options

If you’re a military retiree, you’re eligible to keep using TRICARE for your healthcare, with additional costs. This could include annual enrollment fees, deductibles, copays, and premiums, depending on the plan you select.

If you’re transitioning out of service and aren’t retiring, there are still a few options available:

The Continued Health Care Benefit Program (CHCBP) offers temporary civilian health coverage if you lose eligibility for TRICARE, but you’ll need to sign up for this within 60 days of losing coverage.

The Transitional Assistance Management Program (TAMP) provides 180 days of coverage for certain service members transitioning from active duty.

Health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) may be an option. The VA generally covers veterans only, so it is important to know how to obtain coverage for your family members. However, if a veteran is rated permanently and totally disabled or died from a service-connected disability, their spouse and dependent children may qualify for coverage under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA).

If you don’t qualify for any of these programs, you can check out the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace for health plans.

Don’t Forget Your Health Records

Finally, before you separate or retire, make sure you gather all your health records, including those for your family members. Having a complete copy of your medical history, including prescriptions, will make it easier to transition to new care providers regardless of which health insurance plan you choose. If you have ongoing medical needs, this is especially important for making sure your new provider has all the necessary information. Receiving these records can take a while, so jump on this request sooner rather than later.",https://usaaef.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/USAAEF_March31_Blog.png,N,0.0,2025-03-31 23:56:23.001675

Military health insurance in Illinois is provided by a federal military insurance provider called TriWest. It's part of a national program known as TriCare. Many medical providers who accept the insurance say their bills haven't been paid since Jan. 1, when the program underwent restructuring. TriWest previously claimed its payment delays would be resolved by the end of March.

NBC 5 Responds started investigating payment delays in February. After our report, one medical clinic in Lake Forest was able to get tens of thousands of dollars in claims paid by TriWest. Yet providers nationwide told NBC 5 Responds they are still waiting for the insurance provider to release payment to them.

Staff at 360° Wellness & Coaching in Lake Forest, which provides mental health treatment to active-duty military, veterans and their families, say they currently have 243 unpaid claims with TriWest. They say there's been no transparency or structured plan presented to resolve the balance.

While 360° Wellness & Coaching will continue offering services for the time being, other clinics are beginning to ask for payment up front or refusing to take TriWest all together.

On TikTok, a woman with PTSD told NBC 5 Responds: ""My therapist who I see for PTSD has not been paid … since December. I am currently paying full price for my sessions so she can keep seeing me, pay her own bills and not go out of business.""

Another woman with a chronic illness shared: ""Every appointment has thousands in lab work. I need new referrals, but TriCare isn't paying doctors or approving referrals. ... I can't risk thous $$$.""

Sophia Slain, clinical director of 360° Wellness & Coaching, said TriWest also added hurdles for patients and providers when it comes to getting insurance authorizations for new or continuing treatment.

In the past, getting treatment authorized meant Slain could see a patient for up to 24 sessions. Now, Slain said, the length and frequency of treatment must be approved much more frequently, creating delays and red tape for patients who need services.

""More than half of our patients need new authorizations by March 31st,"" said Slain, who adds her clinic was told patients would need reauthorization just last week. ""In order to get those authorizations, they have to do three different touch points over at the federal hospital. ... And then in addition, we need to write up a blurb explaining the medical necessity for them getting that additional authorization.""

Slain also said TriWest hasn't explained the new changes to patients either.

""If it's taking this much time to get those authorizations and people aren't being informed about the authorizations, and now they're giving you a ridiculous deadline that's essentially a week out, that's a real issue.

A contract change that brought in TriWest to handle enrollees within the area has brought about confusion, delays, and plenty of frustration among the military community. Hopefully, this extension will help those still not set up get everything in line, but if recent history is any indication, keep an eye out for updates.

TRICARE Deadline Extended for TriWest Enrollees Throughout April

The transfer from Health Net Federal Services (HNFS) to TriWest has not been smooth. Yet another TRICARE deadline is being extended as a result to help enrollees get their accounts in order.

There have been multiple extensions, with the original deadline being December 31, 2024. Now, the deadline of March 31, 2025, has been moved to April 30, 2025.

Patients continue to voice frustrations with moving contractors as well as the healthcare they are receiving, with this being the fourth deadline alteration so far.

Healthcare Confusion Continues

By April 30, patients in the TRICARE West Region will need to update their payment information with TriWest.

The deadline for TRICARE Prime patients to receive specialty care, without prior TriWest approval, has also been extended to April 30 due to referral portal issues.

Despite receiving a 9-year, $65 billion contract, TriWest has proven to fumble the beginning of the transfer, as displeasure has been voiced since December 2022 from many of the 4.5 million beneficiaries the company is now responsible for.

Reaching out for clarity has been a problem among enrollees, and even healthcare providers are finding the change difficult.

Reports have come in of primary care providers still being unaware of changes until the end of March, despite being almost four months into the transition.

The result? Patients have been left to apply to join TriWest's network, healthcare professionals are left in a difficult spot, and everyone suffers in confusion.

Beneficiaries in Limbo

Because some healthcare providers were in Health Net’s network but haven’t enrolled with TriWest yet, patients stuck in limbo can use a point-of-service waiver so that they can see their doctor in the meantime.

However, if you do use the point-of-service waiver, copayments are still your responsibility, and it’s advised that anyone using this method asks non-network providers if they have authorization from TRICARE.

According to an official statement, “This means they're licensed by a state, accredited by a national organization, or meet other standards of the medical community (and) certified to provide benefits under TRICARE.""

The TRICARE deadline extension may not require authorization from TriWest for those enrolled in Prime but referrals from primary care physicians are still a requirement.

TRICARE requires a referral dated between January 1 and April 30 and a waiver approval letter, which you can find by clicking the link.

The specialty care waiver excludes inpatient care, autism services, lab-developed tests, and Extended Care Health Option services.

Premium-based plan enrollees, including TRICARE Young Adult, Reserve Select, and Retired Reserve, have until April 30 to update payment info with TriWest or face disenrollment retroactive to January 1. However, these requirements do not apply to TRICARE for Life.

Latest TRICARE Deadline Extension Casts Another Spotlight on Frustrations

The repeated TRICARE deadline extensions may be working to help the military community, but at the end of the day, they’re also highlighting the many blights brought about by the system.

Transferring millions of beneficiaries to TriWest was never going to be an easy task; however, it’s also clear that the military community deserves better.

The lack of communication for families is bad enough, but with newer reports of confusion from providers, it’s curious to see just how far the lack of transparency goes.

Regardless, if you haven’t already taken advantage of the previous efforts, the April 30 TRICARE deadline extension is available. Be sure to act soon so that you don’t lose access to your healthcare coverage.

Spectral AI, Inc., a company specializing in AI-based predictive medical diagnostic tools, has released its annual 10-K report, detailing significant financial and operational achievements over the past year. The report highlights the company's improved financial performance, strategic initiatives, and the challenges it faces in the evolving cybersecurity landscape.

Financial Highlights

Research and development revenue: $29.581 million, reflecting an increase from the previous year's $18.056 million, primarily driven by contracts with BARDA and other U.S. governmental authorities.

Gross profit: $13.274 million, showing an improvement from $7.880 million in the prior year, indicating enhanced efficiency in managing cost of revenue.

Operating loss: $(6.582) million, a reduction from the previous year's operating loss of $(12.984) million, suggesting improved operational efficiency and cost management.

Net loss: $(15.315) million, compared to a net loss of $(20.854) million in the previous year, reflecting a decrease in total other expenses and improved gross profit.

Net loss per share of common stock: $(0.85), compared to $(1.48) in the prior year, indicating a reduction in net loss per share due to improved financial performance.

Business Highlights

Cybersecurity Risk Management: The company employs a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy overseen by the Audit Committee and Board, focusing on emerging risks such as phishing, supply chain threats, and geopolitical tensions. A multi-layered defense system and a robust incident response plan are in place to manage potential cybersecurity incidents.

Human Risk Management Program: A comprehensive program is in place to educate employees on cybersecurity threats, including phishing, malware, and data handling, to serve as the first line of defense against cyber threats.

Third-Party Risk Management: The company maintains a program to assess the security controls of third-party service providers, ensuring that their cybersecurity incidents do not impact the company.

Geographical Performance: The company operates in the US and UK, with significant operations in Dallas, Texas, and a presence in the UK. The company also engages with US government agencies for research and development contracts.

New Product Development: The company is focused on developing the DeepView System, an AI-based predictive medical diagnostic tool for burn wounds, with ongoing efforts to expand its capabilities and obtain FDA approval.

Contract with BARDA: The company has a multi-year contract with BARDA valued at up to $150 million, supporting the clinical validation and FDA clearance of the DeepView System. As of December 31, 2024, $22.9 million remains under the initial award.

MTEC Agreement: The company is developing a handheld version of the DeepView System for military use, with a $4.9 million grant from MTEC and an additional $0.5 million from the Defense Health Agency.

Future Outlook: The company plans to continue its focus on research and development of the DeepView System, leveraging contracts with BARDA and MTEC to support its growth and expansion into new markets.

Strategic Initiatives

Business Combination: The company executed a business combination with Legacy Spectral, resulting in a reverse recapitalization. This strategic move was aimed at enhancing the company's market presence and operational capabilities.

Formation of Spectral IP, Inc.: The company formed a new subsidiary, Spectral IP, Inc., to advance artificial intelligence intellectual property with a focus on healthcare, supported by a $1 million investment from an affiliate of its largest shareholder.

Capital Management: The company entered into a Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (SEPA) with Yorkville, allowing the sale of up to $30 million in common stock, and a Common Stock Purchase Agreement with B. Riley for up to $10 million. These agreements are part of the company's strategy to manage liquidity and fund operations.

Equity and Debt Financing: The company completed an equity financing and entered into a long-term debt financing agreement with Avenue Venture Opportunities Fund II, L.P., with an initial draw-down of $8.5 million. Furthermore, the company issued 2,415,900 shares for net proceeds of approximately $3.1 million through at-the-market equity issuances.

Future Outlook: The company plans to continue leveraging its SEPA and B. Riley agreements to support its liquidity needs and operational funding. It also aims to utilize the proceeds from its recent equity and debt financings to further its strategic initiatives, including the development of its DeepView System and expansion into new markets. The company is focused on maintaining its Nasdaq listing to ensure continued access to capital markets.

Challenges and Risks

The company faces significant cybersecurity risks as part of its overall enterprise risk management strategy. Emerging threats include phishing attacks, third-party supply chain risks, and geopolitical tensions that could lead to sabotage, espionage, and cyber-attacks. The company has implemented a comprehensive human risk management program and a multi-layered cybersecurity technology approach to mitigate these risks. Despite these efforts, there is no assurance that security measures will prevent all incidents, which could adversely affect the business.

Payment Plan

What: Beneficiaries must make a payment to TriWest by April 30 or they will be disenrolled from TRICARE dating back to Jan. 1.

Who: Those who pay by allotment or who have already established a payment plan with TriWest should check to ensure the payments are being processed. Those who have not established a payment plan can do so via the TriWest web portal or by completing and submitting this form.

Questions: TriWest beneficiaries can contact TriWest customer service at 888-TRIWEST (888-874-9378) for answers to their questions or to provide payment information over the phone.

Referrals and Waivers

What: Beneficiaries who receive a referral for specialty care from a primary care provider do not have to wait for TriWest approval to see the specialist.

The specialist must be TRICARE-authorized.

What Else: TRICARE Prime users seeing a provider who is no longer in the TRICARE network – but is a TRICARE-authorized provider – may continue to see that provider and pay regular TRICARE Prime copayments instead of higher point-of-service fees. This fee waiver also expires April 30.

I am under Tricare Select, not Tricare Select Overseas, since I would just be visiting.
Do I start with them and have them get Tricare's approval, since they are in Tricare's network (PPN).

For background, I'm a retired reservist who recently turned age 60 and enrolled in Tricare Select. I live in the US but have family in the Philippines and visit at least once per year, sometimes twice. Later this year I'm planning to visit for over a month, and I'm hoping to have a comprehensive ""executive physical"" done while I'm there, the kind that checks everything.

I've read that St. Luke's BGC offers an ExecuHealth physical, and also that St. Luke's is in Tricare's preferred provider network (PPN).

So my broad question is, is there anyone here with experience using Tricare at St. Luke's for an elective (non-emergency) procedure like that? And if so can you share what your experience was in scheduling it and paying for it using Tricare?

My more narrow questions are:

- How would a physical exam like this be pre-approved by Tricare? I am under Tricare Select, not Tricare Select Overseas, since I would just be visiting.

- How would this be scheduled with St. Luke's? Do I start with them and have them get Tricare's approval, since they are in Tricare's network (PPN). or do I get it pre-approved through my Tricare region contractor? I presently do not have a primary care physician (PCP), and would like to select a doctor at St, Luke's BGC as my PCP. Some info on Tricare's web site seems to indicate that I can just go do it and then get reimbursed, minus my co-pay.

- How does payment work? I have read that I would probably have to pay up front (up to 15k pesos) but that St. Luke's would process the claim for reimbursement for me.

Any insight or partial info would be greatly appreciated!",,N,0.0,2025-03-31 10:56:39.823733

Tricare/Triwest have issues with claims right now. Do not pay anything until they fix it on their end, esp since they also stated that your provider is in network.

I have Tricare eats and currently my local hospitals that were in network show out of network it is insane. Call the billing dep of the hospital and ask for their tax id andNPI number and then call Tricare and tell them their NPI AND TAX ID so they can compare the ones they have on the claims. I am currently in same situation

Call Tricare and ask for claims and then ask to speak with a supervisor in claims. Always get a call reference number and keep notes on what day and time you called.

I would send a letter to your congressman- they take veteran care seriously and usually will act on the situation if they start to have complaints- there was a survey that someone posted in reference to the issue also to collect information- if someone has that could they repost the link to it?",,N,-1.0,2025-03-30 14:56:14.826864
