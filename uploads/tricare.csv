The Armed Forces Health Surveillance Division's Global Emerging Infections Surveillance Branch (part of Defense Health Agency Public Health) hosted its 3rd Annual Science Summit in Silver Spring, Maryland, Sept. 10-12. This meeting highlighted cutting-edge, next-generation sequencing, or NGS, methods in use across the GEIS network and the value of genomic data for informing decision-makers. Attendees included representatives from more than 15 domestic and global organizations within the GEIS network, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Department of Homeland Security. The outcomes of this meeting were aimed to inform the strategic direction for the GEIS branch in the context of the larger Department of War public health and biosurveillance priorities.

“This meeting is an extension of our efforts in the GEIS program office to bring together world-class experts focused on improving the interoperability of genomic sequencing data, ultimately advancing the DOW’s biodefense posture,” said Lt. Col. Brett Swierczewski, chief of the GEIS branch.

Keynote speakers included Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of War Theresa (Tracie) Lattimore and Joint Staff Surgeon Brig. Gen. Clinton Murray, both of whom underscored the crucial role of biosurveillance and the GEIS network in supporting military operations around the globe.

The summit provided an opportunity for knowledge exchange and open dialogue on current priorities and emerging issues in the NGS and bioinformatics space. Topics included the practical applications of pathogen-agnostic sequencing (a method designed to spot any infectious agent, not just ones you already suspect) for respiratory pathogen surveillance, vector surveillance, and wastewater surveillance; pathogen-agnostic sequencing deployed in the field; and digital biobanking, big data transfer and storage. Other emerging challenges included pathogen-agnostic sequencing for biothreats and engineered threats, and the utility of surveilling for antimicrobial resistance in wastewater.

As highlighted in the 2023 Biodefense Posture Review, NGS technologies provide critical information for early biothreat detection and genomic characterization. Enhanced genomic surveillance capabilities within DOW medical and public health laboratories enable experts to rapidly detect and characterize infectious disease threats, including those encountered in field settings. However, effectively and efficiently interpreting and communicating the complex data generated from these new surveillance modalities remain key challenges.

The GEIS program is actively addressing these communication challenges. A mini-tabletop exercise at the summit focused on improving communication of early biothreat-surveillance findings. This exercise aimed to evaluate the process of communication after the detection of a novel pathogen and the challenges of translating complex genomic data into actionable information for decision-makers.

Summit participants also discussed the strategic implementation of pathogen-agnostic genomic surveillance across the GEIS network.

Pathogen-agnostic surveillance, when used with effective communication strategies and quality assurance programs, could enhance the DOW’s ability to detect, characterize and respond to threats, said Swierczewski. It doesn’t matter if the threat’s origin is natural, accidental or intentional. This approach reduces dependence on pre-existing knowledge of circulating pathogens within an operational area.

Because pathogen-agnostic sequencing is resource-intensive, the GEIS Branch emphasizes strategic implementation to prepare for both the ""most likely"" and the ""most dangerous"" biothreat scenarios.

Two presentations highlighted key GEIS branch efforts to improve the quality and accessibility of data generated using pathogen-agnostic sequencing methods:

The Pathogen Detection Project enhances pathogen-agnostic sequencing reliability within the GEIS network by uncovering weaknesses in wet-and-dry lab workflows, promoting standardized protocols, and improving bioinformatics expertise through comparative analysis. Addressing these challenges minimizes errors, optimizes sequencing platform usage, and ultimately increases the accuracy and confidence in pathogen identification across different DOW laboratories.

Military Health System Digital Biobank enables the GEIS network to better implement pathogen-agnostic surveillance by providing a centralized genomic data repository and the potential to rapidly share early sequence data for analysis and interpretation. This facilitates collaboration, large-scale analyses, and reach-back support within the DOW.

Each session sparked in-depth discussions, fostering deeper connections between GEIS partner laboratories and opening avenues for interagency collaborations.

“The GEIS summit serves as the premiere forum for exchanging information on the value of genomic sequencing technology and how it can be leveraged to benefit the warfighter,” said Navy Capt. Carlos Williams, deputy chief of the DHA Public Health’s Armed Forces Health Surveillance Division. “It is imperative that we maintain and expand these capabilities now to set the theater for the Geographic Combatant Commands, mitigating the potential impact of biothreats on military operations.”

What continues to evolve is how the MHS delivers on that responsibility in an increasingly complex operational landscape.

Today, the demand for integrated medical readiness, real-time situational awareness, rapid decision-making, and resilient healthcare infrastructure is higher than ever. As the National Defense Strategy reinforces, the military must remain medically ready for combat and resilient against multi-domain threats. The military health system must, in turn, maintain a force of medical professionals who are themselves prepared to deliver care “anytime, anywhere.”

Rugged tablets and laptops are purpose-built, mission-tough, and designed to perform in the most austere environments, playing a pivotal role in operations of the military. These rugged mobile computers are precision-engineered and align directly with the MHS’s strategic goals: strengthening readiness, modernizing capability, and improving healthcare delivery across every echelon of care.

A Stronger, More Connected MHS Starts with Reliable Technology

Anchored in moving forward together with a shared commitment to beneficiaries and the readiness mission, the military’s modern health systems’ strategic pillars are interconnected:

Medically Ready Force

Ready Medical Force

Health Care Delivery Excellence

Across these pillars, mobile rugged computing bring unmatched value empowering providers, modernizing workflows, and enhancing care delivery. Rugged tablets and laptops are not simply tools; they are force multipliers that help stabilize the MHS, support its workforce, and strengthen the integrated health system.

Rugged Computing Supports Health Readiness Anywhere Care Is Needed

1. Enabling the Medically Ready Force

Maintaining a force with the mental, physical, and cognitive resilience required for sustained operations relies heavily on accurate health surveillance, accessible records, and rapid response to health threats.

Military medical teams can:

Document care at the point of injury

Access treatment protocols in seconds

Transmit medical data during evacuation

Synchronize with joint systems to reduce errors and delays

Maintain visibility of supplies, blood products, and equipment

This level of reliability helps reduce clinical variability, enhance patient safety, and streamline care.

3. Enhancing Military Health Care Delivery

Military healthcare is a complex blend of people, systems, and resources. The shift toward digital, integrated, and interoperable systems is essential to:

Improving access to care

Supporting complex patient needs

Enriching clinical experience for medical providers

Controlling rising healthcare costs

Rugged tablets and laptops designed for all-day use in clinics, field hospitals, or forward operating bases give providers the digital tools they need while reducing hardware failure, supporting EHR modernization, and enabling seamless data flow across the enterprise.

Empowering the Workforce: A Critical MHS Priority

The military health system emphasizes that healthy, educated, and supported personnel take better care of people. Technology must therefore protect, not burden, its medical professionals.

Rugged tablets contribute to this goal by:

Reducing administrative fatigue with streamlined workflows

Offering ergonomic, lightweight, purpose-built computing systems

Supporting training with simulations, diagnostics, and digital reference materials

Allowing providers to work confidently in any lighting, weather, or terrain

When clinicians have reliable, intuitive tools, burnout decreases, and care quality increases.

Accelerating Modernization and Digital Health Implementation

Rugged computers such as rugged tablets and laptops have always been committed to MHS implementing digital health from home to clinic to battlefield, which is directly aligned with rugged computing. The ability to deliver timely, accurate, and actionable information is only possible with devices that withstand operational demands.

Rugged technology supports modernization by enabling:

Real-time telemedicine and remote consultations

Secure access to advanced diagnostics and imaging

Predictive analytics and AI-enhanced decision support

Integration with biosensors, wearables, and medical IoT devices

Field data capture for public health surveillance and biodefense

Whether supporting R&D initiatives, biodefense preparedness, or large-scale emergency response, rugged tablets keep medical teams connected and informed.

Interoperability and Joint Force Integration

A modern MHS requires seamless interoperability across services, partner nations, and civilian health systems. Rugged tablets and laptops serve as the mobile backbone for:

Joint health service capabilities

Cross-platform EHR access

Unified communication between installations

Coordination during humanitarian missions and disaster relief

With rugged tablets and laptops, medical teams stay connected even when communications infrastructure is degraded.

Preparing for the Future of Military Medicine

As the global health and national security environment grows more complex, the MHS is evolving into a more resilient, integrated, and technology-enabled system. Rugged tablets and laptops remain essential tools for that transformation, supporting readiness, accelerating modernization, and strengthening medical capabilities worldwide.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced Dec. 18 that it will pursue regulatory changes that would make gender-affirming health care for transgender children more difficult, if not impossible, to access.

The shift in federal healthcare policy stems directly from President Donald Trump’s Jan. 28 executive order, Protecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation, which formally establishes U.S. opposition to gender-affirming care and pledges to end federal funding for such treatments.

The executive order outlines a broader effort to align HHS with the Trump-Vance administration’s policy goals and executive actions. Those actions include defunding medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care to minors by restricting federal research and education grants, withdrawing the 2022 HHS guidance supporting gender-affirming care, requiring TRICARE and federal employee health plans to exclude coverage for gender-affirming treatments for minors, and directing the Justice Department to prioritize investigations and enforcement related to such care.

HHS has claimed that gender-affirming care can “expose them [children] to irreversible damage, including infertility, impaired sexual function, diminished bone density, altered brain development, and other irreversible physiological effects.” The nation’s health organization published a report in November, saying that evidence on pediatric gender-affirming care is “very uncertain.”

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is now in the process of proposing new rules that would bar hospitals from performing what the administration describes as sex-rejecting procedures on children under age 18 as a condition of participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs. Nearly all U.S. hospitals participate in Medicare and Medicaid. HHS said that “this action is designed to ensure that the U.S. government will not be in business with organizations that intentionally or unintentionally inflict permanent harm on children.”

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. released a statement alongside the announcement.

“Under my leadership, and answering President Trump’s call to action, the federal government will do everything in its power to stop unsafe, irreversible practices that put our children at risk,” Kennedy said. “This administration will protect America’s most vulnerable. Our children deserve better — and we are delivering on that promise.”

Those claims stand in direct opposition to the positions of most major medical and healthcare organizations.

The American Medical Association, the nation’s largest and most influential physician organization, has repeatedly opposed measures that restrict access to trans health care.

“The AMA supports public and private health insurance coverage for treatment of gender dysphoria and opposes the denial of health insurance based on sexual orientation or gender identity,” a statement on the AMA’s website reads. “Improving access to gender-affirming care is an important means of improving health outcomes for the transgender population.”

Jennifer Levi, senior director of transgender and queer rights at GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders, warned the proposed changes would cause significant harm.

“Parents of transgender children want what all parents want: to see their kids thrive and get the medical care they need. But this administration is putting the government between patients and their doctors. Parents witness every day how their children benefit from this care — care backed by decades of research and endorsed by major medical associations across the country. These proposed rules are not based on medical science. They are based on politics. And if allowed to take effect will serve only to drive up medical costs, harm vulnerable children, and deny families the care their doctors say they need. These rules elevate politics over children — and that is profoundly unAmerican.”

Human Rights Campaign President Kelley Robinson echoed Levi’s sentiments.

“The Trump administration is relentless in denying health care to this country, and especially the transgender community. Families deserve the freedom to go to the doctor and get the care that they need and to have agency over the health and wellbeing of their children,” Robinson said. “But these proposed actions would put Donald Trump and RFK Jr. in those doctor’s offices, ripping health care decisions from the hands of families and putting it in the grips of the anti-LGBTQ+ fringe. Make no mistake: these rules aim to completely cut off medically necessary care from children no matter where in this country they live. It’s the Trump administration dictating who gets their prescription filled and who has their next appointment canceled altogether.

The announcement comes just days after U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) advanced legislation in Congress that would make it a felony to provide gender-affirming care to a child.

By: Najla Alexander

NJ authorities announced that a Connecticut man was sentenced yesterday to 30 months’ imprisonment for his role in a multimillion-dollar durable medical equipment (DME) health care fraud and kickback scheme.

Senior Counsel Philip Lamparello stated that Jesse Foote, 60, of Fairfield, Connecticut, previously pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Esther Salas in Newark federal court to a two-count information charging him with conspiracy to violate the Federal Anti-Kickback statute and conspiracy to commit health care fraud.

According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:

From December 2017 to March 2021, NJ officials stated that Foote conspired with overseas telemarketing call centers, DME suppliers, telemedicine companies, and doctors to submit fraudulent claims to health care benefit programs, including Medicare and TRICARE, through a circular scheme of kickbacks and bribes.

Foote controlled a marketing company through which he purchased patient “leads” from overseas telemarketing companies, NJ officials say. The leads consisted of information on Medicare and other beneficiaries, as well as pre-written doctors’ orders for DME.

According to NJ officials, the telemarketing call centers targeted Medicare beneficiaries and others with health insurance to persuade them to accept DME, including orthotic braces, without regard to medical necessity. Foote paid bribes and kickbacks to telemedicine companies, which in turn paid bribes and kickbacks to doctors, to obtain doctors’ orders for DME based on the leads.

The doctors often approved the DME orders without contacting the beneficiary or making a bona fide assessment of the DME's medical necessity. Foote then sold the signed doctors’ orders to others with whom he had kickback arrangements, NJ authorities stated.

The doctors’ orders were ultimately submitted to DME suppliers, including DME suppliers controlled by Foote, which submitted fraudulent claims for reimbursement to health care benefit programs, including Medicare, TRICARE, and private insurance companies, NJ officials say.

The Company expects to file its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the second and third quarters of 2025 in the coming weeks.

“Today’s filing represents another important step in our efforts to bring our financial reporting current,” said Elias Sabo, CEO of Compass Diversified. “We remain focused on strengthening our financial flexibility and executing across our subsidiary businesses. Despite a dynamic operating environment, our operating subsidiaries, excluding Lugano, continue to perform well and collectively generate significant cash flow.”

Sabo added, “Looking ahead, we are focused on the key drivers of performance across our subsidiaries—driving operational excellence, disciplined working capital management, and investing in our differentiated products and brands. We’re encouraged by recent strong booking activity at Arnold and PrimaLoft. BOA continues to benefit from its patent-protected performance-enhancing fit solutions, supporting ongoing market share expansion. And 5.11 is navigating macro pressures with duty-smart sourcing and tighter inventory discipline while it continues to invest in its brand.”

Sabo continued, “Our priorities are clear: execute at our subsidiaries, generate cash, and use that cash to reduce leverage while continuing to support growth initiatives across our businesses. Long term, we remain committed to maximizing shareholder value and will continue to explore opportunities for the most efficient return of capital to our shareholders.”

2025 Outlook (Reiterated)

CODI reiterates its expectation for full-year 2025 subsidiary Adjusted EBITDA of $330 million to $360 million, excluding Lugano.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Earnings (Loss) are non-GAAP measures used by the Company to assess its performance. We have reconciled Adjusted EBITDA to Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Earnings (Loss) to Net Income (Loss) on the attached schedules. We consider Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted EBITDA and Net Income (Loss) to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted Earnings (Loss). We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Earnings (Loss) provides useful information to investors and reflect important financial measures as each excludes the effects of items which reflect the impact of long-term investment decisions, rather than the performance of near-term operations. When compared to Net Income (Loss) and Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations, Adjusted Earnings (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, are each limited in that they do not reflect the periodic costs of certain capital assets used in generating revenues of our businesses or the non-cash charges associated with impairments, as well as certain cash charges. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA allows investors to view the performance of our businesses in a manner similar to the methods used by us and the management of our businesses, provides additional insight into our operating results and provides a measure for evaluating targeted businesses for acquisition. The presentation of Adjusted Earnings (Loss) provides insight into our operating results.

Pro forma net sales is defined as net sales including the historical net sales relating to the pre-acquisition periods of The Honey Pot Co., assuming that the Company acquired The Honey Pot Co. on January 1, 2024. We have reconciled pro forma net sales to net sales, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, on the attached schedules. We believe that pro forma net sales is useful information for investors as it provides a better understanding of sales performance, and relative changes thereto, on a comparable basis. Pro forma net sales is not necessarily indicative of what the actual results would have been if the acquisition had in fact occurred on the date or for the periods indicated nor does it purport to project net sales for any future periods or as of any date.

In reliance on the unreasonable efforts exception provided under Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K, we have not reconciled 2025 Subsidiary Adjusted EBITDA to its comparable GAAP measure because we do not provide guidance on Net Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations or the applicable reconciling items as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, these items. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results.

Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Earnings and pro forma net sales are not meant to be a substitute for GAAP measures and may be different from or otherwise inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.

New York, N.Y., Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANO Nuclear Energy Inc. (NASDAQ: NNE) (“NANO Nuclear” or “the Company”) , a leading advanced nuclear micro modular reactor and technology company focused on developing clean energy solutions, today reported its fiscal year 2025 financial results and provided a business update.

Figure 1 - NANO Nuclear Reports Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results and Provides Business Update

During its 2025 fiscal year ended September 30, 2025 and subsequently, NANO Nuclear achieved significant milestones as it strives to be the leading advanced nuclear microreactor developer in North America. Key achievements included:

Acquiring the patented KRONOS MMR ™ Energy System , advancing the design toward initiation of the licensing process and prototype construction in the U.S. and Canada, and developing a growing pipeline of commercial opportunities.

Continuing advancement of commercial vertical integration efforts to participate in key aspects of the nuclear fuel supply chain, a corporate goal which distinguishes NANO Nuclear from its competitors.

Expanding its physical plant to include an engineering, research and development, and demonstration facility in Oak Brook, IL, while also receiving a $6.8 million award from the State of Illinois as part of the Reimagining Energy and Vehicles (REV) Illinois program.

Significantly expanded executive and technical teams to include personnel with meaningful industry experience.

Raising over $600 million from a growing number of prominent institutional investors.

“We are extremely proud of the hard work our team put in, the milestones we achieved, and the value we created for our investors and stakeholders in 2025,” said Jay Yu, Founder and Chairman of NANO Nuclear .

“Our efforts have positioned NANO Nuclear at the center of a global nuclear renaissance driven by several durable long-term macro trends, including growing demand for reliable baseload energy to support growth in AI data centers and electrification of various industries, clean energy mandates and energy independence, and unprecedented global support for nuclear energy. AI data centers are projected to be the primary driver of significantly higher electricity usage in the coming years, and a lack of sufficient transmission infrastructure is expected to constrain the traditional grid’s capacity to meet forecasted power growth, with even conservative growth estimates expected to require substantial grid expansion. All of this represents a fundamental shift that is placing an even greater emphasis on scalable and constant sources of baseload power that can operate independently from grid constraints. This is exactly where advanced reactors, and particularly our KRONOS MMR ™ , offer a compelling advantage.”

“2025 was a transformative year for NANO Nuclear, marked by disciplined execution across several parts of our business. We advanced the KRONOS MMR ™ meaningfully — from acquiring the asset out of bankruptcy, to securing our strategic collaboration with the University of Illinois, achieving important Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) milestones, completing the necessary site characterization and drilling work for our planned first quarter 2026 construction permit application with the NRC. We also made significant progress toward resuming formal licensing activities for the KRONOS MMR ™ with the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. Financially, we remain well-capitalized, raising over $600 million since our May 2024 IPO with growing support from prominent institutional investors and numerous index and ETF additions. Equally as important, we continue to make substantial commercial progress, highlighted by a feasibility study agreement with BaRupOn to evaluate up to 1 GW of power with our KRONOS MMR ™ , an AFWERX Direct to Phase 2 contract to evaluate siting our KRONOS MMR™ at Joint Base Anacostia Bolling, and a growing pipeline of potential customers from several different markets.”

“In summation, we believe that through hard work and disciplined execution, we’ve laid a very strong foundation from which we can continue to work towards achieving our near- and long-term goals. We look forward to continued progress in 2026.”

Financial Results for Twelve Months Ended September 30, 2025

Operating Activities

$19.6 million used in operating activities during the twelve months ended September 30, 2025, reflecting an increase in operations and research and development expenses, primarily to support advancement of the KRONOS MMR ™ and adjacent growth initiatives.

Investing Activities

$17.5 million used in investing activities during the twelve months ended September 30, 2025, which includes $9.1 million for the acquisition of certain assets (including the KRONOS MMR ™ ) and $8.4 million primarily related to the purchase of the Oak Brook, Illinois engineering and demonstration facility, in addition to the build out of our demonstration facility in Westchester, New York.

Financing Activities

$211.9 million in net cash provided by financing activities during the twelve months ended September 30, 2025.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

NANO Nuclear had cash and cash equivalents of $203.3 million as of September 30, 2025 , up from $28.5 million on September 30, 2024, following an October 2024 follow-on offering and private placements in November 2024 and May 2025.

Subsequent to the year end, NANO Nuclear’s cash balance increased to approximately $580 million from an October 2025 private placement with leading institutional investors providing net proceeds of approximately $379 million.

FY 2025 -- A Successful Year of Execution Including Numerous Key Milestones

Acquisition of the KRONOS MMR ™ Accelerates Deployment Timeline in U.S. and Canada

Closed on the acquisition of the patented KRONOS MMR ™ in January 2025, a microreactor with a high technology readiness level (TRL) that benefitted from previous substantial investment over an 8-year period.

Advanced KRONOS MMR ™ toward licensing activities with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and construction and eventual deployment of the first KRONOS reactor prototype at the University of Illinois (U of I).

Executed a key collaboration agreement to build out our first KRONOS MMR ™ at the U of I.

Held a ceremony at the U of I including remarks from NANO Nuclear Energy management and key project supporters to celebrate the commencement of site characterization and drilling with AECOM. A video recap of the event can be viewed here: http://nanonuclearenergy.com/uiucdrillingeventrecap

Site characterization and drilling work with AECOM was completed in November, with the data essential for the submission of construction permit application to the NRC in the first quarter of 2026.

Received an approved Fuel Qualification Methodology Topical Report from the NRC for the project.

Focused on resuming formal licensing activities of the KRONOS MMR ™ in Canada, where the KRONOS MMR ™ is the first microreactor to have entered the Phase 1 licensing process with the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC).

Acquisition of Global First Power (now rebranded as True North Nuclear ) provides NANO Nuclear with Canadian licensing application for KRONOS MMR ™ demonstration project in Chalk River, Ontario.

Additional Corporate Milestones Achieved

Acquired 2.75-acre land and building package in Oak Brook, Illinois to provide engineering, R&D and manufacturing support for KRONOS MMR ™ development.

Received $6.8 million REV Illinois incentive award from the State of Illinois, supporting the company in establishing operations in the state and creating at least 50 new full-time jobs.

Significant number of new hires expanding executive and technical teams, including various executive advisory board members and employees with many years of experience within the Nuclear industry, including positions at the Department of Energy (DOE), NRC, and U.S. National Labs.

Optimized microreactor portfolio with Letter of Intent to sell ODIN design to Cambridge AtomWorks for $6.2 million.

Progress Toward Expanding Vertical Integration

Executed a strategic investment and collaboration with affiliated company LIS Technologies (LIST), the only U.S. origin and patented technology for laser uranium enrichment, to de-risk our nuclear fuel supply chain, providing NANO Nuclear with a potential competitive advantage and low-cost enrichment solution.

Affiliate LIST and NANO designated as contractor and subcontractor, respectively, for the Department of Energy’s $3.4B Low Enrichment Uranium Acquisition Program.

Progress toward expanding our internal nuclear fuel supply chain capabilities, particularly in areas such as conversion.

Continued advancing fuel transportation business in development through progress on development of our proprietary transport cask and active evaluation of strategic M&A opportunities.

Well-Capitalized with Growing Support from Institutional Investors

Cash position of approximately $580 million following an October 2025 private placement providing net proceeds of approximately $379 million. NANO Nuclear has successfully raised more than $600 million dollars at progressively higher valuations following its Initial Public Offering in May of 2024.

Equity capital raises include strong support from growing number of prominent institutional investors.

NANO Nuclear was added to several new indices, including the MSCI USA, Solactive, S&P Global BMI, and Morgan Stanley National Security indices, in addition to the Global X Uranium ETF.

Additions expand the Company’s visibility and accessibility to both retail investors and institutional portfolios aligned with broad-based equity exposure and the nuclear-energy thematic.

Growing Pipeline of Commercial Opportunities

Signed a Feasibility Study agreement with BaRupOn to evaluate 1 GW of power provided by our KRONOS MMR ™ to BaRupOn’s AI Data Center and Manufacturing Campus.

Awarded AFWERX Direct to Phase 2 contract to evaluate siting our KRONOS MMR ™ at Joint Base Anacostia Bolling.

Growing pipeline of opportunities with AI data center, industrial and military related customers demonstrating growing excitement around the value proposition of the KRONOS MMR ™ .

“Our lead KRONOS MMR reactor project continues to demonstrate a compelling value proposition in the advanced nuclear landscape,” said James Walker, Chief Executive Officer of NANO Nuclear . “Because our design is rooted in proven high-temperature gas-cooled reactor technology using validated TRISO fuel, an inert helium coolant, and well-understood graphite moderation — we are benefitting from decades of operating data that we believe materially reduce technical and licensing risk. Combined with passive safety features that support the potential for co-location directly at customer sites, KRONOS MMR ™ is positioned to deliver the kind of reliable, always-available baseload power that emerging industries now require. At the same time, our commercial pipeline is expanding as data center operators, industrial customers, military organizations, and other potential customers seek scalable, dependable power that is less constrained by the grid, and our versatile, modular microreactor is resonating strongly with those needs. This growing engagement underscores the market’s recognition that secure, resilient nuclear power is becoming essential infrastructure for the digital and industrial economy. With a differentiated technology platform, increasing customer interest, a strategic focus on vertical integration, and a clear execution roadmap, we believe we are well positioned to create value across the broader advanced nuclear ecosystem.”

These results reflect the power of our integrated global platform and the exceptional execution of our team. Throughout the year, our connected commercial organization demonstrated remarkable agility—pivoting to capitalize on market opportunities across North America, Europe, and Asia—each of which experienced growth for the quarter and full year. We were able to optimize our owned Peruvian production across customers and markets in a balanced fashion that drove category penetration and deepened key customer relationships. Whether navigating pricing dynamics or managing supply across regions, our team leveraged the full breadth of our capabilities to drive volume growth and optimize per-unit margins. Combined with our company-wide effort to enhance collaboration, data-driven decision making, and disciplined execution, I'm confident Mission is well positioned to continue growing share through expanding our presence in the years ahead.”

With our heavy capital investment cycle now complete and capital expenditures expected to step down to approximately $40 million in fiscal 2026, we are positioned to accelerate free cash flow generation which provides us with great flexibility to create value for our shareholders.”

Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2025 Consolidated Financial Review

Total revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased $35.4 million or 10% to $319.0 million compared to the same period last year. The decrease was primarily driven by the Marketing & Distribution segment, where a decrease in average per-unit avocado sales prices of 27% was partially offset by a 13% increase in avocado volume sold. Price and volume movements resulted from greater availability of Mexican fruit due to harvest disruptions in the previous year and higher Peruvian avocado production driven by more favorable weather conditions in the current year.

Gross profit was $55.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, consistent with the prior year, while gross margin increased 180 basis points compared to the same period last year, to 17.5% of revenue. The margin increase was driven by lower revenues compared to last year, resulting from lower per-unit pricing, as the Marketing & Distribution segment margin is primarily managed on a per-unit basis.

Selling, general and administrative expense (“SG&A”) for the fourth quarter increased $0.5 million or 2% to $27.7 million, compared to the same period last year primarily due to higher general operating costs, inclusive of performance-based stock compensation expense, partially offset by lower statutory profit-sharing expense in the Peru and Mexico operations.

Net income attributable to Mission Produce for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 was $16.0 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to $17.3 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, for the same period last year.

Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 13% to $22.2 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared to $19.6 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the same period last year.

Adjusted EBITDA increased $4.5 million or 12% to $41.4 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to $36.9 million in the prior year period, driven primarily by increased owned avocado production in the International Farming segment and higher avocado volume sold in the Marketing & Distribution segment.

Fiscal Fourth Quarter Business Segment Performance

Marketing & Distribution

Net sales in the Marketing & Distribution segment decreased $47.7 million or 15% to $271.9 million for the fourth quarter, driven by the avocado volume and pricing dynamics described above. While pricing is driven by industry production dynamics, the Company manages the business primarily to volume and per-unit margins—leveraging its global platform and sourcing network to optimize per-unit margin performance regardless of the pricing environment.

Segment operating income increased $1.6 million or 9% and segment adjusted EBITDA increased $2.7 million or 11% compared to the same period last year, which is primarily attributed to higher avocado volume sold.

International Farming

The vast majority of fruit sales from the International Farming segment are made to the Marketing & Distribution segment, with the remainder of revenue largely derived from direct sales of fruit to third parties, as well as services provided to third-parties and the Blueberries segment. Affiliated sales are concentrated in the second half of the fiscal year in alignment with the Peruvian avocado harvest season, which typically runs from April through September of each year. As a result, adjusted EBITDA for the International Farming segment is generally concentrated in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year in alignment with the timing of sales.

Total sales in the International Farming segment for the fourth quarter increased $29.3 million or 97% to $59.6 million, compared to $30.3 million for the same period last year. Segment operating income improved by $4.7 million to $2.1 million compared to a loss of $2.5 million in the same period last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $5.7 million or 211% to $8.4 million compared to $2.7 million for the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher yield from owned avocado orchards and supported by higher volume of avocado packing and cooling services provided to third parties.

Blueberries

Sales in the Blueberries segment have traditionally been concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year in alignment with the Peruvian blueberry harvest season.

Net sales in the Blueberries segment increased $4.9 million or 16% to $36.5 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $31.6 million for the same period last year, primarily due to higher volume produced on owned farms as a result of increased total acreage.

Segment operating income was $4.9 million for the fourth quarter compared to $11.6 million in the same period last year and segment adjusted EBITDA was $4.7 million compared to $8.6 million in same period last year. The decreases were due to higher unit costs resulting from lower projected yields per hectare in the current harvest season.

Balance Sheet and Cash Flow

Cash and cash equivalents were $64.8 million as of October 31, 2025, compared to $58.0 million as of October 31, 2024.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $88.6 million for the year ended October 31, 2025, as compared to $93.4 million last year, driven by higher working capital requirements. Working capital growth was primarily driven by lower grower payables, higher other assets and net movements in income tax receivable and payable balances, which were partially offset by lower accounts receivable and inventory balances and higher accounts payable balances. The movements in accounts receivable, inventory and grower payables correlated with reductions in avocado pricing levels. Other asset growth pertains to value-added tax balances in Mexico and Guatemala, while income tax movements are attributed to timing of payment requirements in operational taxing jurisdictions. Accounts payable growth is primarily attributed to higher farming production costs within our International Farming and Blueberries segments.

Capital expenditures were $51.4 million for the year ended October 31, 2025 compared to $32.2 million last year. Capital expenditures were comprised primarily of avocado orchard development, pre-production orchard maintenance and land improvements, packhouse construction in Guatemala and pre-production land development and blueberry plant cultivation in Peru.

Outlook

For the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, the Company is providing the following industry outlooks that will drive performance:

Avocado industry volumes in the fiscal 2026 first quarter are expected to increase by approximately 10% versus the prior year period, driven by a larger Mexican crop in the current harvest season.

Pricing is expected to be lower on a year-over-year basis by approximately 25% compared to the $1.75 per pound average experienced in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by higher supply conditions.

The blueberries harvest season in Peru will peak during the first quarter. The Company expects to see volume increases from owned farms resulting from new acreage in production, which should translate to higher revenue, as average sales prices are expected to be flat to slightly higher. Profitability will continue to be impacted by higher costs resulting from lower projected yields per hectare in the current harvest season.

For full year fiscal 2026, total capital expenditure is expected to be approximately $40 million.

HIGH POINT, N.C., Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- vTv Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq: VTVT), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company, today announced a Phase 2 clinical study protocol developed in collaboration with M42’s Insights Research Organization & Solutions (IROS), a leading United Arab Emirates (UAE)-based contract research organization, has been submitted to the Department of Health (DOH) Abu Dhabi. The study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cadisegliatin , a potential first-in-class oral adjunctive therapy to insulin, in people living with type 2 diabetes. This study constitutes the longest trial investigating cadisegliatin to date and will be a 12-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial enrolling approximately 300 patients with type 2 diabetes who are treated with insulin for glycemic control. Participants will be randomized into three arms: two cadisegliatin dose groups (400 mg and 800 mg once daily) and a placebo control group. The trial will take place in the UAE, Jordan, and Tunisia, with the first patient first visit expected in the first quarter of 2026.

“Through our collaboration with M42, we continue to investigate cadisegliatin ’s potential as an adjunctive therapy to insulin for people living with diabetes,” said Paul Sekhri, Chairman, President, and CEO of vTv Therapeutics. “This study also expands the potential geographic footprint for cadisegliatin .”

“The launch of this trial enables us to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cadisegliatin over the course of one year in people with insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes, allowing for extended observation of the impact of our investigational oral adjunctive therapy,” said Thomas Strack, MD, Chief Medical Officer of vTv Therapeutics.

“Collaborating with vTv Therapeutics on this Phase 2 study positions us to explore opportunities to potentially impact the lives of millions of people with type 2 diabetes who are not currently able to maintain glycemic control,” said Islam Altantawy, General Manager at IROS. “Given that the prevalence of type 2 diabetes among UAE nationals is among the highest globally, we see potential for cadisegliatin to assist in glucose management efforts in this population.”

As part of the collaboration between vTv and M42, vTv is the regulatory sponsor of the trial and M42 is funding the study.

About Cadisegliatin

Cadisegliatin (TTP399) is a novel, oral small molecule, liver-selective glucokinase activator being investigated in the US as a potential first-in-class oral adjunctive treatment for type 1 diabetes (T1D). In non-clinical studies, cadisegliatin , acting selectively on the liver, increased the activity of glucokinase independently from insulin which supports clinical investigation of improvement in glycemic control through hepatic glucose uptake and glycogen storage. Cadisegliatin has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Cadisegliatin is under investigation, and the safety and efficacy have not been established. There is no guarantee that this product will receive health authority approval or become commercially available for the use being investigated.

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Heartflow, Inc. (Heartflow) (Nasdaq: HTFL), the leader in AI technology for coronary artery disease (CAD), announced the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) published new scientific statements supporting the prognostic value of quantifying coronary plaque and reinforcing the critical role of the coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) + Heartflow pathway in CAD patient management. The ACC’s consensus recommendations, published this week in JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging , highlight the importance of quantitative plaque assessment and underscore the benefits of adopting AI-powered Heartflow Plaque Analysis for personalized, precision cardiac care. 1 The ACC statement elevates plaque analysis from an emerging technology to a defined clinical consideration in CAD management, outlining appropriate patient selection and best practices for interpreting and reporting.

In direct alignment with the ACC’s call for rigorous quality assurance, reproducible results, and “human in the loop” analysis, Heartflow delivers a differentiated standard for clinical plaque quantification by combining AI-driven analysis with expert quality review. Heartflow Plaque Analysis is the only FDA-cleared, AI-powered plaque quantification tool with 95% agreement to the gold standard, IVUS, using blinded core lab adjudication. 2 This rigor, together with Heartflow’s commitment to standardized reporting and advanced algorithmic approaches such as adaptive thresholds, reflects a level of validation and quality oversight consistent with ACC guidance.

The AHA statement, published recently in Circulation , reinforces plaque burden and composition as central in managing nonobstructive CAD. 3 The expert authors emphasize that patients with nonobstructive CAD should not be considered low-risk, recognizing that coronary plaque burden, extent, and composition are major determinants of outcomes. Earlier this year, a commission perspective published in The Lancet called for a fundamental shift in managing CAD, urging clinicians to focus on identifying and managing plaque early, before the opportunity for prevention has been lost. 4 Together, the scientific statements from ACC and AHA reinforce that broader paradigm shift toward understanding plaque burden, not just artery obstruction, in modern CAD management.

“The ACC and AHA scientific statements address an important need by providing evidence-based consensus recommendations for clinicians and imagers, solidifying coronary CTA-based quantitative plaque analysis as a powerful tool for enhanced risk stratification in patients with suspected CAD,” said Ron Blankstein, M.D., writing committee member for both the ACC and AHA statements, Director of Cardiac Computed Tomography at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Professor of Medicine and Radiology at Harvard Medical School. “These statements highlight the limitations of current methods to assess risk based on risk factors or stenosis severity alone. Integrating AI-powered technology into clinical practice using ACC and AHA’s guidance can help clinicians move beyond diagnosing blockages, toward predicting and preventing major cardiovascular events.”

Both the ACC and AHA scientific statements support the use of quantitative coronary plaque analysis to identify high-risk patients, enabling the immediate and appropriate initiation of preventive treatment. Heartflow Plaque Analysis addresses the need to quantify disease following visual detection of plaque, and is delivered instantly upon order to maintain seamless clinical integration and enable timely clinical decision-making.

“The ACC and AHA scientific statements signal growing consensus that plaque assessment is essential for risk stratification, prevention, and long-term CAD management. Heartflow Plaque Analysis enables more precise risk stratification for personalized, preventive treatment plans,” said Campbell Rogers, M.D., F.A.C.C., Chief Medical Officer at Heartflow. “The expert guidance articulates the need for rigorous validation and standardization, which Heartflow is uniquely positioned to address, given our technology and quality systems already align with these stringent recommendations. We are energized by the opportunity to continue collaborating with clinicians as a catalyst to redefine and improve precision cardiovascular care.”

The ACC and AHA’s scientific statements reflect a growing body of clinical evidence further substantiating the prognostic significance of Heartflow Plaque Analysis. A retrospective analysis of symptomatic patients from a cohort of the FISH&CHIPS Study presented at the AHA Scientific Sessions 2025 provided the largest validation to date of the Heartflow Plaque Staging framework based on total plaque volume measurement as a predictor of future heart attacks or cardiovascular death. 5 The company is generating additional real-world evidence through the DECIDE registry , the largest prospective registry evaluating the clinical impact of Heartflow Plaque Analysis on medical management decisions. The DECIDE registry showed that more than 50% of patients had their medical management changed when Plaque Analysis with Plaque Staging* was added compared to their management based on CCTA alone. 6

The hospital is the first Army military treatment facility selected by the Defense Health Agency to pilot SWORD, a digital platform that uses motion-tracking sensors and remote clinical oversight to deliver physical therapy care outside the clinic.
This data is reviewed by licensed physical therapists who adjust treatment plans and communicate with the patient directly through the platform.
The system is designed for patients with mild to moderate musculoskeletal pain and serves as an alternative to in-person physical therapy at Martin Army.
Maj. Madeline Merriam, chief of Physical Therapy, is spearheading the pilot and said the platform addresses one of the most persistent barriers to recovery: time.","Martin Army Community Hospital has launched a new virtual physical therapy pilot aimed at strengthening Soldier readiness by meeting patients where duty takes them. The hospital is the first Army military treatment facility selected by the Defense Health Agency to pilot SWORD, a digital platform that uses motion-tracking sensors and remote clinical oversight to deliver physical therapy care outside the clinic.

SWORD provides patients with a tablet loaded with guided exercise sessions. As patients complete their movements, artificial intelligence corrects forms and measures completion of exercises. This data is reviewed by licensed physical therapists who adjust treatment plans and communicate with the patient directly through the platform. The system is designed for patients with mild to moderate musculoskeletal pain and serves as an alternative to in-person physical therapy at Martin Army.

Maj. Madeline Merriam, chief of Physical Therapy, is spearheading the pilot and said the platform addresses one of the most persistent barriers to recovery: time.

“SWORD Health PT is a great alternative to physical therapy at Martin Army for active-duty service members with mild to moderate pain who have a difficult time making it into the clinic for treatment or active-duty family members who do not want to be seen on the network,” Merriam said.

For Soldiers, the challenge is not a lack of willingness; it’s the mission. Packed training schedules, field exercises, and TDY travel often make it challenging to attend routine therapy appointments. With SWORD, Soldiers can bring their recovery with them, maintaining mobility and strength even while away from the installation.

Although SWORD is cleared for a wide range of musculoskeletal needs, it cannot treat toe or foot pain, finger or hand pain, or jaw pain. Patients with those conditions will continue receiving traditional in-person care.

The soft launch started this month, and Merriam’s team, along with providers in Primary Care, are now offering SWORD to eligible patients as needs arise. Direct access to SWORD will begin in the new year.

Martin Army’s role in piloting SWORD builds on its selection as one of DHA’s Accelerating Care Transformation venture sites. Over the past year, the hospital has implemented several new virtual tools, including My Military Health Quick Care Connect, DHA’s virtual urgent care option. SWORD adds another layer to that modernization effort by extending rehabilitation care wherever Soldiers and families are—at home, at work, or in the field.

While active-duty family members can also use SWORD instead of being referred off-post, the heart of the mission remains clear: ensuring Soldiers remain ready to fight. Consistent, accessible therapy supports performance, reduces recovery setbacks, and strengthens long-term musculoskeletal readiness.

SWORD ensures recovery continues even when training, travel, or long workdays disrupt a normal schedule. With therapy that can go wherever a Soldier goes, the platform supports the hospital’s commitment to keeping the force healthy, mobile, and ready for whatever the mission requires.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2512/9452069/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-12-18 18:56:28.062692

Maintaining Physical Health During the Holidays Physical activity remains important for both physical and mental well-being, even when schedules are full.","by Rodney Jackson, Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center Public Affairs

Editor’s note: The Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center has begun a Behavioral Health Initiative to inform the community with information and resources that will help with everyday struggles like stress management, nutrition and physical health, emotional intelligence, and healthy habits. This article focuses on maintaining healthy stress levels during the holiday season.

FORT HOOD, Texas – The holiday season is a time of celebration, connection, and reflection, but it can also bring increased stress, disruptions to routines, and challenges to maintaining healthy habits. Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center encourages service members, families, retirees, and community members to take proactive steps to care for their mental, nutritional, and physical health—and to take advantage of the many resources available on post and in the local area.

“Maintaining your health during the holidays doesn’t require perfection or even a large time commitment,” said Col. Amit Gupta, Fort Hood director of psychological health and chief of behavioral health CRDAMC. “It’s about balance—recognizing stress early, making small healthy choices, and knowing when to ask for support. Use your CRDAMC providers, who want nothing more than to care for this community every step of the way.”

Managing Holiday Stress

Holiday stress can come from many sources, including busy schedules, financial strain, travel, and separation from loved ones. Recognizing stress early and using healthy coping strategies can help prevent it from becoming overwhelming.

“Stress can affect both mental and physical health, especially when routines are disrupted,” notes Capt. Chelsea Yueng, a CRDAMC behavioral health nurse. “Reaching out early—whether to a provider, counselor, chaplain, or trusted individual—can make a significant difference.”

Helpful strategies include:

Maintain Routines: Stick to consistent sleep schedules when possible.

Set Attainable Expectations: Unrealistic expectations cause resentment and disappointment.

Set Realistic Goals: Prioritize what’s most important and don’t be afraid to say no.

Stay Connected: Make time for friends, family, and trusted coworkers.

Practice Relaxation: Try deep breathing, meditation, prayer, or even short walks to clear your head.

Navigating Nutrition During the Holidays

Holiday meals are meant to be enjoyed! With a mindful approach, you can savor your favorite foods as part of a healthy lifestyle.

“Nutrition is not about restriction—it’s about fueling your body in a way that supports energy, immunity, and overall health,” says Lt. Col. Donna Goodson, Director of Nutritional Medicine at CRDAMC.

Simple Nutrition Tips:

Use the Plate Method: Fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables, a quarter with lean protein, and a quarter with whole grains.

Eat Regularly: Don’t skip meals, as this can lead to overeating later.

Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. It will also help you stay full.

Enjoy Mindfully: Savor your favorite holiday treats by consuming them slowly and focusing on the sensations. Eat without guilt by focusing on portion awareness and satisfaction.

Maintaining Physical Health During the Holidays

Physical activity remains important for both physical and mental well-being, even when schedules are full.

Easy Ways to Stay Active:

Take short, brisk walks during breaks or after meals.

Plan family activities that encourage movement, like hiking or ice skating.

Incorporate simple, at-home bodyweight exercises into your day.

Your Health is a Year-Round Mission

If stress, unusual fatigue, or other health concerns are affecting your quality of life now or after the holidays, don’t hesitate to seek professional support. Your CRDAMC team is here to help you stay healthy all year long.

Col. Jolanda L. J. Walker, Munson Army Health Center director, served as master of ceremonies. Colors were presented by Soldiers from the Fort Leavenworth Chapter of the Sergeant Audie Murphy Club. Army, Marine Corps, Navy and Air Force service members assigned to the Fort Leavenworth-based U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, and a coast guardsman from the U.S. Coast Guard Pay & Personnel Center, Topeka, Kansas, presented ceremonial wreaths representing each branch of the U.S. Armed Forces and an additional wreath honoring Prisoners of War.

Despite the frigid conditions Saturday morning—temperatures around the mid-20s with wind chills near below zero, attendees braved the cold to stand together in remembrance.

“It was incredibly meaningful for me to be among the volunteers here today,” said Walker. “Even in this extreme cold, we gathered to speak the names of our fallen heroes. Each wreath we lay and every name we speak keeps their memory alive.”

As each wreath is placed at the base of a gravestone, volunteers read the service member’s name aloud ensuring each individual is remembered and honored for their service. Volunteers in uniform also render a salute.

“That act of remembrance connects us to their service and sacrifice and keeps their memory alive. I’m grateful to every volunteer who stood out here today and encourage everyone to learn more about the individuals we honor,” Walker said.

Following the ceremony, additional volunteers dispersed throughout the cemetery to place more than 5,000 wreaths on gravestones.

Wreaths Across America is held annually across the nation on the second or third Saturday of December, uniting communities, installations, and organizations in remembrance of those who served.

The John P. Murtha Cancer Center (MCC) at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, the Department of War’s only Center of Excellence for cancer care, recently hosted its 2025 Cancer Prevention Summit at the medical center.

Physicians and subject matter experts in cancer prevention, care and research discussed a range of topics during the summit, including cancer survival in the Military Health System (MHS), cancer incidence and survival by military occupation, cancer risk mitigation, the future of cancer care (early detection and interception), and next-generation cancer screening, among other issues.

“Cancer is a readiness issue,” said Dr. Craig D. Shriver, director of the MCC and MCC Research Programs (MCCRP). A retired colonel in the U.S. Army, Shriver added that more than 1,500 active-duty service members are diagnosed with cancer annually among “the healthiest, generally young, and most active of the nation’s population. “Every one of them is important to the military and warfighter readiness. When we lose one to treatment for a while, or [the service member] has to be transitioned out of the military, it impacts readiness,” said Shriver.

Dr. Kimberly Robins, of the MCCRP, explained that factors impacting cancer incidence include exposures such as occupational hazards, demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity), lifestyle factors (tobacco use, diet, physical activity, obesity) and genetic predispositions. She added that factors that affect cancer detection, diagnosis and treatment include access to care, screening practices, medical surveillance and reporting completeness.

“The MHS provides universal access to care,” Robins stated. She added that cancers among MHS beneficiaries are more likely detected and earlier detected because of the military’s requirement for regular health exams. However, some military occupations may increase the risk of certain cancers, studies have shown.

Better detection in military medicine

For most cancer sites, the incidence was lower in the military than the general population, particular among younger individuals, Robins stated. She added there’s a higher incidence in the military for prostate, thyroid and breast cancers, especially among older individuals, and higher incidence rates in the military were observed for localized breast, prostate, thyroid, soft tissue sarcoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma. Again, this may be because of the military emphasis on regular health exams and its universal access to care for its beneficiaries, which also may contribute to earlier detection.

Dr. Jie Lin, also of the MCCRP, agreed that the overall cancer mortality rate has been declining steadily since the early 1990s, mostly in the most common cancers such as lung, colorectal, breast and prostate cancers. “The decline results from early detection of some cancers, smoking reduction and treatment,” she added. “With the universal access to health care, MHS beneficiaries with cancer have improved survival outcome compared to the patients in the U.S. general population,” Lin said.

U.S. Air Force Col. (Dr.) Ian Stewart, vice chair for clinical research at the Uniformed Services University (USU), discussed traumatic brain injury [TBI] and the subsequent risk of brain cancer. “We found that moderate/severe TBI and penetrating TBI, but not mild TBI, were associated with the subsequent development of brain cancer. Given that TBI is a common injury incurred in the course of military service, further research is needed,” he added.

Lifestyle modifications: diet, exercise, regular exams

U.S. Air Force Maj. (Dr.) Zachary Rupert, a preventive medicine physician at USU and Walter Reed, said lifestyle modifications can reduce cancer risk. He explained that this includes reducing the consumption of ultra-processed foods and eating more fruits and vegetables while decreasing red meats and sugar-sweetened beverages. In addition, he encouraged people to be physically active to help avoid excess body weight, which can increase the risk of some cancers. He also encourages people to avoid use of tobacco and limit alcohol intake. He also urged people to protect themselves from the sun’s dangerous UV rays.

Rupert added that studies have estimated that about roughly 40 percent of cancer cases in the United States in 2019 were attributable to modifiable risk factors including smoking, secondhand smoke exposure, nutrition, lack of exercise, ultraviolet radiation exposure, and several carcinogenic infections.

Dr. Juvianee Estrada-Veras, head of genetics in the MCCRP, said, “Advancements in genetic testing, risk assessment, and understanding of the natural history of these syndromes may lead to more personalized monitoring strategies [for cancer risk mitigation]. Tumor surveillance is a critical component of managing hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes. Early detection through tailored strategies for children and adults saves lives, improves outcomes,” he added.

“We can change the cancer experience through early detection and intervention,” said Dr. Betsy O’Donnell, director of the Multi-Center Early Detection Clinic at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. She said clinical pathways for accurate diagnostic evaluations are evolving providing a tremendous opportunity for research – clinical, translational and basic – for early cancer detection.

Multi-cancer detection (MCD) tests aim to close the gap between traditional [and targeted] screening for cancers, explained MCCRP pathologist Kristen Natale. “Traditional screening saves lives, but it leaves many cancers undetected,” she added. MCD assays include cancer-related biomarkers, which circulate in blood; and next-generation sequencing, used to detect a wide range of genetic mutations, she explained. In addition, multi-omics combines genomic data with other biological information, and proprietary artificial intelligence algorithms “analyze complex data and identify patterns that may indicate cancer,” she stated.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2512/9451607/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-12-18 16:57:15.157765

Health implications for service members Numerous studies have revealed concerning health consequences from microplastic exposure.
Particularly alarming for service members are studies showing that microplastics were present in 99% of post-mortem lung tissue autopsies.
The key is incorporating protective habits into daily routines, much like other health and safety practices many service members already follow.
Resources Deployment and Environmental Health – The Defense Centers for Public Health- Aberdeen provides services and information pertinent to maintaining and improving environmental health on installations and in deployment locations.","Service members face health risks both while at home and when deployed, and the emerging global threat of micro- and nanoplastics, or MNPs, may have long-term impacts on their health.

""We’re beginning to appreciate that microplastics are everywhere and likely contaminating everything we eat, drink, and touch,"" said Dr. Mark Williams, a toxicologist with Defense Health Agency-Public Health in Aberdeen, Maryland.

The scale of the plastic crisis

The root of this emerging health threat lies in the global plastic production growth and humans’ increasing reliance on plastic products, said Williams.

Plastic production has exploded from just 2 megatons in 1950 to 475 megatons in 2022, a nearly 240-fold increase in just over 70 years, said Williams. Projections show this trend continuing, with production expected to nearly triple again to more than 1,200 megatons by 2060.

""By far the highest proportion of plastic production is derived from single-use plastics, with 98% of single-use plastics being derived from fossil fuels,"" said Williams.

These fossil fuels, including gas, oil, and coal, provide the raw materials for petrochemicals that serve as the building blocks for plastic manufacturing, said Williams.

The environmental consequences are significant, said Williams. The recycling reality is that less than 10% of globally-produced plastic is ever recycled. Since single-use plastic waste like straws, shopping bags, takeout containers, and water bottles can persist in the environment for decades, it’s estimated that 80%of all plastic ever manufactured still pollutes the planet. That is an estimated 8 billion metric tons of plastic waste.

What are microplastics?

This massive accumulation of plastic waste creates the foundation for microplastic contamination. Microplastics are tiny plastic fragments smaller than 5 millimeters, essentially invisible to the naked eye. They come from two main sources: intentionally-manufactured particles like microbeads used in cosmetics and biomedical products, and the breakdown of larger plastic items through normal wear and environmental exposure.

""There are broadly two families of plastics from which microplastics are derived,"" said Williams. ""Thermoplastics, which can be melted and reformed repeatedly, and thermosets, like epoxy resins and polyurethane, which undergo permanent chemical changes when heated.""

These particles don't just disappear, they persist in the environment and accumulate everywhere, creating what Williams describes as ""environmental ubiquity and persistence.”

“No geographic area on Earth is free from microplastic pollution, to include their presence in remote and pristine environments, including both the Arctic and Antarctic, sea ice, the deepest oceanic trenches, and remote mountains,"" said Williams.

How are service members exposed?

Everyone faces daily microplastic exposure through food, water, and air. However, military personnel encounter additional risks that civilians typically don't face.

Deployment-specific risks - During deployments, service members often rely heavily on bottled water and packaged meals.

Toxic elements in water bottles can contaminate their surroundings if the bottles are exposed to high temperatures and UV/sunlight, said Williams.

Meals Ready to Eat, or MREs, present another concern, said Williams. These meals are packaged in plastic that also may be exposed to heat and sunlight, potentially increasing contamination levels.

Equipment and uniform exposure - Modern military uniforms have transitioned from being made of 100% cotton to synthetic materials, said Williams. These include specialized nylons designed for durability and protection.

""When worn under conditions of high heat and direct sunlight, together with intense physical activity, there is the combined risk of microplastic emissions to the breathing zone and skin contact,"" said Williams.

Military equipment also increasingly relies on plastic composite materials for weight reduction and performance enhancement, creating additional exposure pathways during normal use, said Williams.

Environmental factors - Military operations expose service members to unique contamination sources. Burn pits, commonly used for waste disposal in forward operating bases, serve as significant sources of microplastic emissions.

""Burn pits can be a source of microplastic emissions and exposure, since plastic is often an additive to those burn pits,"" said Williams.

Dust storms in operational areas may carry microplastic particles, creating inhalation risks during missions, said Williams.

Health implications for service members

Numerous studies have revealed concerning health consequences from microplastic exposure.

""It’s critically important to emphasize that the plastics crisis is more than an environmental problem and has rapidly emerged as a serious and deeply worsening threat to human and environmental health on a global scale,” said Williams. “Microplastics have been reported in human organs, tissues, body fluids including peripheral blood, and in the liver, kidney, heart, lungs, brain, spleen, colon, and reproductive organs. This widespread presence suggests these particles can cross critical biological barriers, including the blood-brain barrier.”

The health threats come from both the physical particles and their chemical composition, said Williams. More than 16,000 chemicals are used in plastic manufacturing, of which 4,200 are chemicals of concern, including substances that may affect hormones, cognitive function, and long-term health.

Health risks

Due to their small size, microplastics ""can reach the conducting airways and far into the lung where they can migrate to the peripheral blood system,” said Williams.

Particularly alarming for service members are studies showing that microplastics were present in 99% of post-mortem lung tissue autopsies. They have also been found in other major organs including brain tissue, meaning that nanoplastics traverse the blood-brain barrier, said Williams.

Microplastic exposure contributes to increased risks of chronic health conditions and diseases, including cancer, obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, said Williams.

Reducing risk

While complete avoidance is impossible given operational requirements, service members can take targeted actions to reduce exposure risks, said Williams.

Dust and vacuum regularly. Removing excess dust from your home can help cut down on the amount of microplastic fibers in the dust you could be breathing or otherwise consuming.

Avoid drinking from disposable plastic water bottles. If you have no choice, try to keep them out of the sun, in a cool, dry environment. Disposable plastic water bottles degrade very easily in response to temperature change or friction.

Filter your water. Due to the widespread use and pollution of plastic, water can sometimes contain microplastic particles. Home water filters can be effective at reducing many contaminants, including microplastics. Advanced filtration and reverse osmosis kits are readily available.

Avoid plastic cutting boards. There are plenty of alternatives to use, like wood, glass, and steel.

Microwave your food in glass containers, rather than plastic or takeaway containers, which can release millions of microplastic particles into your food.

The bigger picture

While microplastic contamination is a growing concern, service members already successfully manage numerous health challenges. This issue requires awareness and simple preventive steps rather than major life changes.

""Due to the small size of microplastics, avoiding exposure completely is unrealistic,"" said Williams. ""However, there are options to reduce the numbers of particles that can access our body each day.""

The key is incorporating protective habits into daily routines, much like other health and safety practices many service members already follow. Understanding the global scale of plastic production and waste helps explain why this contamination is so widespread, but individual actions can still make a meaningful difference in protecting health.

Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, announced that several of her provisions were included in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2026.

“This year’s NDAA is a win for service members, New Yorkers, and all Americans,” said Senator Gillibrand. “I was proud to fight for and secure key provisions in the final bill, including a significant pay raise for troops, over $240 million in authorizations for military installations and activities in New York, and measures to strengthen our defense against cyber threats, biological threats, and unmanned aerial systems (UAS). Protecting our troops and our national security is of the utmost importance, and I am glad to see Democrats and Republicans work together to pass this vital legislation.”

A list of Senator Gillibrand’s priorities included in the NDAA and the Senate Report include:

Personnel:

Increases service members’ pay by 3.8%.

Protects access to sexual assault medical forensic examinations by requiring the Secretary of Defense to authorize military medical treatment facilities to provide sexual assault medical forensic examinations to all victims, not just victims who are eligible for military health care.

Bolsters OBGYN care at Fort Drum by directing a briefing on the adequacy and sufficiency of OBGYN care for TRICARE beneficiaries in the installation’s vicinity.

Protects service members’ brain health by supporting blast exposure monitoring within Special Operations Command.

Helps victims of anomalous health incidents by encouraging the Department of Defense (DOD) to provide the cross-functional team addressing anomalous health incidents (AHIs) with adequate resources to continue its efforts, particularly treatment of those affected by AHIs, and by ensuring timely compensation under the Helping American Victims Afflicted by Neurological Attacks (HAVANA) Act of 2021.

New York Priorities:

Senator Gillibrand secured over $240 million in authorizations for New York institutions in the NDAA, including:

$90 million for the 42nd Infantry Division Headquarters Readiness Center, which when funded will also clear the way for separate investments and construction at Watervliet Arsenal.

$54 million for the Combined Operations Airfield Facility at Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station

$31 million for the Fort Hamilton Child Development Center

$29 million for the Watervliet Arsenal Electrical Switching Station

$20 million for the planning and design of future construction projects at Fort Drum, including:

$9.5 million for Fort Drum aircraft maintenance hangar addition

$8.3 million for Fort Drum Operational Readiness Training Center barracks design

$2.5 million for Fort Drum Range 41c, Automated Record Fire Plus range design

$5 million for short-pulsed lasers intended to defeat hypersonic missiles and other potential threats. This research is carried out by the University of Rochester.

$5 million to expand the regional presence and outreach of the Defense Innovation Unit, which works to rapidly integrate commercial technologies into the DOD.

$5 million for an Agile, Assured, and Autonomous Battle Management Network and Readiness Accelerator (3A-BMN) at Rome Lab

$5 million for biotechnology manufacturing

Unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) and unmanned aerial systems (UAS):

Expands DOD’s authority to counter unmanned aerial systems (UAS) by allowing the Secretary of Defense to designate DOD installations as critical to national security and therefore covered assets for the purposes of counter-UAS (cUAS) actions; allowing the use of contractors for cUAS activities; and improving information sharing between DOD and other agencies relevant to cUAS activities.

Expands domestic cUAS authorities by allowing DHS and DOJ to provide training to state, local, Tribal, or territorial law enforcement or correctional agencies to engage in cUAS detection and mitigation to protect critical infrastructure and mass gatherings.

Strengthens UAP oversight by requiring the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) to brief Congress on UAP intercepts by NORTHCOM and NORAD and by requiring AARO to account for security classification guides that apply to UAP and authorizing a consolidated security classification matrix for UAP.

Cyber:

Protects undersea cables by requiring a report on the strategy, challenges, and capability gaps facing DOD in protecting undersea cables from physical and cybersecurity threats.

Bolsters cyber capabilities by requiring the Secretary of Defense to conduct one or more tabletop exercises to evaluate concepts for the future employment of cyber capabilities.

Biosecurity:

This year’s NDAA includes multiple provisions to strengthen America’s defense against biological threats, including:

Increasing interagency coordination to strengthen biodefense by directing the Defense Threat Reduction Agency to coordinate with other agencies and departments to clarify roles and responsibilities for building out biodefense capacity.

Supporting research and development of bioindustrial manufacturing processes by expanding DOD’s ability to support these activities at bioindustrial manufacturing facilities.

Giving the Secretary of Defense the authority to establish a program to support the expansion of the domestic capacity for bioindustrial manufacturing at a commercial level through awards to entities for establishing, upgrading, and retooling bioindustrial manufacturing facilities.

International Partnerships:

$500 million for Israeli Missile Defense Cooperative Programs such as Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and Arrow.

The Senate on Wednesday passed a $901 billion defense policy bill authorizing a 3.8% pay raise for troops while forcing more transparency from the Pentagon and putting limits on efforts to pull the U.S. military from Europe and South Korea.

The 77-20 vote sends the annual bill, known as the National Defense Authorization Act, to President Donald Trump for his signature. The legislation authorizes $8 billion above the Trump administration’s request for national security spending and still needs to be funded by a defense appropriations bill.

Lawmakers used the legislation to push back against Trump’s moves to disengage from Europe, notably authorizing $400 million for each of the next two years for a Ukraine security assistance program the administration did not want to continue.

The bill also curbs the administration’s ability to reduce the number of troops in Europe below 76,000 or to give up U.S. command of NATO’s top officer position in Europe unless Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth certifies to Congress that such actions aligned with national security interests and were made with the consultation of NATO allies.

Similar restrictions are in place for pulling back the U.S. military presence on the Korean Peninsula below 28,500 troops.

“To remain a force for peace and stability in these areas, we must have effective force levels, and this legislation provides for that,” said Sen. Jack Reed, of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee.

The provisions reflect bipartisan backlash to the Pentagon’s recent decision to bring home about 700 troops deployed in Germany, Romania and Poland. Lawmakers have also expressed concern that Trump could draw down the U.S. military presence in South Korea, which he has said should pay more to host American troops.

The legislation also reflected frustration on Capitol Hill with the way the Pentagon communicates with lawmakers, particularly regarding the strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific that have killed nearly 100 people since September. Hegseth said Tuesday that the Pentagon will not publicly release the full, unedited video of a divisive follow-up strike on a vessel on Sept. 2, but a provision in the bill withholds 25% of his travel budget until he turns over the orders behind the boat bombing campaign as well as unedited videos of the strikes to the Armed Services Committees.

“This NDAA compels the secretary of defense to follow the law and submit to Congress a number of reports that he has deliberately withheld,” said Reed, adding that the oversight provisions are a “ratification of our constitutional duties to raise an army, to supervise an army, and to ensure that the laws of the United States are followed scrupulously.”

Congress in the legislation is also asserting its authority to declare war by repealing two decades-old authorizations for the use of military force in the Gulf War in 1991 and the Iraq War in 2002. The White House has supported the repeals — a 2001 post 9/11 authorization continues to underpin nearly all U.S. counterterrorism operations around the world.

Service members will see a 3.8% pay bump under the legislation, as requested by the Trump administration. The bill also increases the family separation allowance for deployed service members from $250 to $300 and authorizes more than $1.5 billion in new construction of barracks, dormitories, housing and childcare centers.

The legislation also authorizes $26 billion in shipbuilding funding, $38 billion for aircraft and $25 billion to ramp up production of munitions.

A core focus of the bill is speeding up and reforming the way the Pentagon purchases weapons and supplies. Sen. Roger Wicker, of Mississippi, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the bill delivers the most sweeping upgrades to the Pentagon’s business practices in 60 years.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said the legislation “takes dozens of burdensome rules and laws off the books, streamlines the buying and innovations processes and ensures more American businesses will be able to contribute to America’s arsenal.”

The passage of the bill marks the end of monthslong negotiations between the House and Senate. The final version of the bill stripped out most of the conservative social policy mandates the House had passed but retained provisions banning diversity programs at the Pentagon as well as transgender athletes in women’s sports at the military academies.

Also left out of the bill were provisions that would have provided Tricare coverage of in vitro fertilization for military families and reversed Hegseth’s decision to undo a Congress-directed effort to change the names of Army bases that had honored Confederate leaders.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., intervened for a second year in a row to remove the IVF measure, which had been supported by both chambers. Johnson and other conservatives have expressed concern that the IVF process involves destroying embryos, which they view as people.

Bipartisan objections remained Wednesday over a provision kept from the House that would allow military aircraft to get a waiver to fly through Washington airspace without using location-transmitting technology, as was the case when an Army helicopter collided with an airliner on Jan. 29.

The Senate later on Wednesday passed separate legislation to nullify that provision of the defense bill, requiring military aircraft to broadcast their locations when flying near busy airports — with limited exceptions. It is unclear when the House will take up the measure.",https://www.legion.org/assets/dist/images/favicons/favicon-32x32.png,N,0.0,2025-12-18 11:56:25.915230

While less than 6% of hospitals nationwide earn this distinction, the Defense Health Agency saw 13 of its facilities recognized this year, placing them in the top tier of medical centers in the United States. DHA had two hospitals honored in 2024. This year marks the first time a military clinic has received a Top ASC award.

“Having 13 of our military treatment facilities recognized is a remarkable achievement,” said Maj. Gen.

“I could not be prouder of the dedicated staff at these hospitals and clinics for earning these awards,” said Dr. Paul Cordts, DHA’s deputy assistant director for Medical Affairs and chief medical officer. “This distinction reflects continuous hard work and dedication to serving our patients at the highest level.”

DHA's engagement with Leapfrog began about eight years ago when it sought to incorporate Leapfrog's evaluations into the Military Health System's Quality Assurance Program.

Families nationwide can now access Owlet’s FDA-cleared prescription pulse oximeter, BabySat, through insurance-supported pathways on 1NaturalWay.com.

Expanding Owlet’s DME Reach for Families Who Need It Most

1 Natural Way offers a national, digital-first insurance fulfillment experience for moms and babies, working with major commercial plans, many state Medicaid networks, and TRICARE, the healthcare program for uniformed service members, retirees, and their family members. Together, Owlet and 1 Natural Way aim to reach more families who could benefit from clinically validated, prescription-supported home monitoring.

“We are thrilled to expand the availability of Owlet products via 1 Natural Way, as a leader in the parenting space for essential products, specifically for mothers and babies,” said Jonathan Harris, Owlet’s President and CEO. “With a large online patient presence and many satisfied families, this partnership supports efficient digital acquisition and fulfillment for prescription BabySat.”

By leveraging 1 Natural Way’s established relationships and national insurance infrastructure, Owlet aims to expand BabySat access for families with higher-risk infant health needs. This includes a focus on TRICARE families, representing roughly 9.5 million individuals across the Military Health System.

“1 Natural Way was founded to bring compassion back into maternal care, a system that can too often feel impersonal and fragmented. Every mom deserves support that meets her where she is,” said Ryan Wright, CEO of 1 Natural Way. “Our partnership with Owlet continues our mission of ensuring that moms receive access to the highest level of care for themselves and their babies during a sensitive and deeply personal time in their lives.”

The six clinics that will be reopened include those seeing 400 or more patients per month.

The final provision also calls on the Defense Health Agency (DHA) to develop a plan to reopen closed clinics and to explore the feasibility of putting doctors of chiropractic stationed at military facilities in the federal General Schedule (GS) system. Further, the amendment directs DHA to report back to the House and Senate on its progress by March 31, 2026.

The move to restore chiropractic services is consistent with the DHA’s ongoing concern over the use of opioids by active-duty members of the military and calls to make non-addictive alternatives for pain management more readily available to military personnel. The final language was first adopted in September as an amendment by Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.) to the House version of the bill. It reflects upon the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act (Public Law 106-398), which in 2001 established the original chiropractic benefit in the Department of Defense healthcare system.

“We thank Rep. Steube for his foresight to tackle this issue, and we also acknowledge House and Senate negotiators who kept the bulk of his amendment in the final package,” said John Falardeau, American Chiropractic Association (ACA) senior vice president of public policy and advocacy.

The Steube amendment was drafted in response to chiropractic clinic closures over the past year caused by contracts with participating chiropractors being allowed to lapse, even though surveys indicate chiropractic services are highly valued at U.S. military facilities. Reports show that these clinics provide proven, cost-effective care to hundreds of patients monthly, offering a range of non-drug services to address painful musculoskeletal conditions commonly experienced by members of the military, enabling them to return to service. The results of a four-year clinical trial conducted at several military sites—the largest chiropractic clinical trial on record—provided further evidence that chiropractic care, when added to usual medical care, resulted in moderate short-term improvements in low back pain intensity in active-duty personnel.

The Fiscal Year 2026 National Defense Department Authorization Act now heads to the president’s desk for his signature. ACA will continue to work with Congress to ensure all military clinics that were recently closed reopen and to expand access at additional bases across the country and overseas.

Bill Includes A Pay Raise for Service Members and Authorizes Over $240 Million for New York Projects

Today, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, announced that several of her provisions were included in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2026.

“This year’s NDAA is a win for service members, New Yorkers, and all Americans,” said Senator Gillibrand.“I was proud to fight for and secure key provisions in the final bill, including a significant pay raise for troops, over $240 million in authorizations for military installations and activities in New York, and measures to strengthen our defense against cyber threats, biological threats, and unmanned aerial systems (UAS). Protecting our troops and our national security is of the utmost importance, and I am glad to see Democrats and Republicans work together to pass this vital legislation.”

A list of Senator Gillibrand’s priorities included in the NDAA and the Senate Report include:

Personnel:

Increases service members’ pay by 3.8%.

Protects access to sexual assault medical forensic examinations by requiring the Secretary of Defense to authorize military medical treatment facilities to provide sexual assault medical forensic examinations to all victims, not just victims who are eligible for military health care.

Bolsters OBGYN care at Fort Drum by directing a briefing on the adequacy and sufficiency of OBGYN care for TRICARE beneficiaries in the installation’s vicinity.

Protects service members’ brain health by supporting blast exposure monitoring within Special Operations Command.

Helps victims of anomalous health incidents by encouraging the Department of Defense (DOD) to provide the cross-functional team addressing anomalous health incidents (AHIs) with adequate resources to continue its efforts, particularly treatment of those affected by AHIs, and by ensuring timely compensation under the Helping American Victims Afflicted by Neurological Attacks (HAVANA) Act of 2021.

New York Priorities:

Senator Gillibrand secured over $240 million in authorizations for New York institutions in the NDAA, including:

$90 million for the 42nd Infantry Division Headquarters Readiness Center, which when funded will also clear the way for separate investments and construction at Watervliet Arsenal.

$54 million for the Combined Operations Airfield Facility at Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station

$31 million for the Fort Hamilton Child Development Center

$29 million for the Watervliet Arsenal Electrical Switching Station

$20 million for the planning and design of future construction projects at Fort Drum, including:

$9.5 million for Fort Drum aircraft maintenance hangar addition

$8.3 million for Fort Drum Operational Readiness Training Center barracks design

$2.5 million for Fort Drum Range 41c, Automated Record Fire Plus range design

$5 million for short-pulsed lasers intended to defeat hypersonic missiles and other potential threats. This research is carried out by the University of Rochester.

$5 million to expand the regional presence and outreach of the Defense Innovation Unit, which works to rapidly integrate commercial technologies into the DOD.

$5 million for an Agile, Assured, and Autonomous Battle Management Network and Readiness Accelerator (3A-BMN) at Rome Lab

$5 million for biotechnology manufacturing

Unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) and unmanned aerial systems (UAS):

Expands DOD’s authority to counter unmanned aerial systems (UAS) by allowing the Secretary of Defense to designate DOD installations as critical to national security and therefore covered assets for the purposes of counter-UAS (cUAS) actions; allowing the use of contractors for cUAS activities; and improving information sharing between DOD and other agencies relevant to cUAS activities.

Expands domestic cUAS authorities by allowing DHS and DOJ to provide training to state, local, Tribal, or territorial law enforcement or correctional agencies to engage in cUAS detection and mitigation to protect critical infrastructure and mass gatherings.

Strengthens UAP oversight by requiring the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO)to brief Congresson UAP intercepts by NORTHCOM and NORAD and by requiring AARO to account for security classification guides that apply to UAP and authorizing a consolidated security classification matrix for UAP.

Cyber:

Protects undersea cables by requiring a report on the strategy, challenges, and capability gaps facing DOD in protecting undersea cables from physical and cybersecurity threats.

Bolsters cyber capabilities by requiring the Secretary of Defense to conduct one or more tabletop exercises to evaluate concepts for the future employment of cyber capabilities.

Biosecurity:

This year’s NDAA includes multiple provisions to strengthen America’s defense against biological threats, including:

Increasing interagency coordination to strengthen biodefense by directing the Defense Threat Reduction Agency to coordinate with other agencies and departments to clarify roles and responsibilities for building out biodefense capacity.

Supporting research and development of bioindustrial manufacturing processes by expanding DOD’s ability to support these activities at bioindustrial manufacturing facilities.

Giving the Secretary of Defense the authority to establish a program to support the expansion of the domestic capacity for bioindustrial manufacturing at a commercial level through awards to entities for establishing, upgrading, and retooling bioindustrial manufacturing facilities.

International Partnerships:

$500 million for Israeli Missile Defense Cooperative Programs such as Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and Arrow.

Here are some of the best ways to reduce your home insurance costs, based on advice from Redditors:

Increase Your Deductible

One of the most effective ways to lower your premium is by increasing your deductible. This means you'll pay more out-of-pocket if you need to file a claim, but your monthly or annual premium will be lower.

""Increase your deductible""

""The most impactful way to reduce your premium is to raise your deductible.""

Bundle Insurance Policies

Many insurance companies offer discounts if you bundle your home and auto insurance policies. This can significantly reduce your overall insurance costs.

""Auto/Home bundling discount is the largest discount on most home policies so if you don't currently have your auto(s) and home with the same carrier, look into it.""

""I bundle home, car, and umbrella through AllState. They give an excellent deal.""

Shop Around Regularly

Insurance premiums can vary widely between companies, so it's worth shopping around for quotes regularly. Consider using a local independent broker who can compare multiple options for you.

""We’ll make it easy for you: call a local independent broker/agent to shop your policy.""

""Find a good broker. I use a small local broker and they know how to find good rates.""

Improve Home Security

Installing security systems, smoke detectors, and other protective devices can earn you discounts on your premium.

""Sometimes getting a monitored alarm system will qualify you for a protective device discount.""

Update Your Home

Making improvements to your home, such as replacing an old roof, can also reduce your insurance costs.

""Year of construction and/or age of roof are big premium factors in today's market. The newer, the better your premium will be.""

""I spent $10,000 on a new roof-the insurance company lowered my premium $180.00.""

Review Your Coverage

Ensure you are not over-insured for personal property or loss of use if you can afford to cover these costs out-of-pocket.

""Reducing personal property insurance or loss of use insurance have a big impact on the premium?""

Consider a Trust

If you have significant assets, a living trust can help protect your home from potential medical bills and ensure it passes to your heirs.

""Generally, a living trust would be a good vehicle, but ya need to do some research and maybe get an attorney consultation.""

Evaluate Your Need for Additional Coverage

Determine if you truly need additional coverage like umbrella policies or flood insurance, especially if you live in a low-risk area.

""You don’t need umbrella insurance. Get it when you’re more financially able and have more to lose.""

Housing

Fort Bragg Garrison Commander, Col. Chad Mixon, said housing repairs are underway and that a refinancing plan will help bring 400 to 500 homes back online.

“Think of all that money they can reinvest in some of our other issues around housing, like playgrounds and potholes,” said Mixon.

Roads

Director of Fort Bragg Department of Public Works, Jeff Williamson, announced that King Road and Manchester Road are now complete and open. The roads have been recently expanded and repaved.

Child Care: Construction has started on a new child development center near Irwin Intermediate School.

“That’s for a mega CDC one of the first in the Army where it will house 338 children,” said Mixon.

There are 17 CDCs at Fort Bragg with a long wait list. The mega CDC will help alleviate that list.

Dining

A new campus-style dining facility is also in the works. This is also a first at Fort Bragg and the Army.

“It’s really like a restaurant,” explained Mixon. “There’s going to be all kind of grab-and-go options in there.”

Safety

Speeding continues to be a problem, stated Director of Fort Bragg Department of Emergency Services, Col. Craig Giancaterino.

“The speed abatement policy is anything over 15 miles per hour, you will lose your driving privileges on post for 30 days,” he said.

Giancaterino added that more than 7,000 citations have been issued.

“We still see speeding in school zones, All-American Freeway, I295, Rock Merritt Road, and Gruber Road,” he said.

Health

Womack Army Medical Center is open for enrollment to TRICARE Prime and TRICARE for Life beneficiaries.

“We are trying to re-attract care with our 65 and older population,” said Womack Army Medical Center Commander, Col. Stephanie Mont, “We’re also open for those TRICARE for Life beneficiaries.”

Neighborhood Mayors

Two new volunteer neighborhood mayors were also appointed. Sarah Niles representing Casablanca/Anzio Acres and Megan Giancaterino representing Normandy/Bastogne Gables.

“With these latest two additions, we now have six of our 11 neighborhoods represented,” said Fort Bragg Housing Manager, Steve Wykel.

Five Mayor openings are still available:

• Hammond Hills

• Linden Oaks (Lodge)

• Randolph Point

• Ste Mere Eglise

• Pope AAF

DMV at Fort Bragg

NC Division of Motor Vehicles has been approved to move back on the installation. Planning and coordination are still in the works, but a kiosk will be located at the Soldier Support Center followed by a DMV representative to support the readiness for Service Members and their Families.

The team took “synthetic data similar to what we see in MHS GENESIS and combined it with readiness policies,” he said.
“As the agency’s leader for analytics and AI, participating in this event provides exposure to emerging technologies,” Caban said.
“This experience allowed us to test readiness-focused use cases, transforming how we approach medical readiness solutions within the DHA,” she said.
The vital work of Team MEDAL demonstrated agility, innovation, and enhanced productivity for military medical readiness, Caban said.","A team from the Defense Health Agency Chief Data and Analytics Office turned the Defense Technologies “Hackathon” into a major step forward for mission and medical readiness.

As part of the National Defense Industrial Association’s Emerging Technologies for Defense Conference & Exhibition, held in Washington, D.C., Aug. 25-29, the team competed in a weeklong competition alongside 50 other teams from government, private industry, and academia. The DHA CDAO team finished second overall for what the judging panel of military technology leaders called an “impactful and innovative readiness solution.”

Members of Team MEDAL — Medical Evaluation for Defense Airmen’s Readiness — who represented DHA CDAO included Barinderjeet Dhillon, operations research analyst; Chris Kittrell, branch chief; and Junayd Park, functional lead for application prototyping and integration.

Dr. Jesus Caban, DHA’s chief data and analytics officer, said the team participated in the event to gain valuable experience in a competitive environment, solving real-world issues to enhance operational readiness.

The team took “synthetic data similar to what we see in MHS GENESIS and combined it with readiness policies,” he said. “They then spent three to four days developing a software application to show the value of leveraging DHA data and AI (artificial intelligence) to better understand and support medical readiness.”

For Caban, the event offered more than a trophy: He said it served as proof for how data and AI can remove barriers that limit the force’s response speed.

“As the agency’s leader for analytics and AI, participating in this event provides exposure to emerging technologies,” Caban said. “It also highlights the incredible talent we have within the agency that we can leverage to apply innovative solutions in support of warfighter readiness.”

Leveraging AI to increase workflow productivity and efficiency

Team MEDAL took on the challenge of automating aeromedical waiver generation for U.S. Air Force pilots. The scenario was a “known constraint on pilot availability,” said Park. They developed a prototype to “streamline aeromedical waiver processing and readiness,” directly addressing issues of medically clearing pilots in an efficient and timely manner, Park said.

Aeromedical waivers can be a critical piece of the readiness puzzle. Before pilots can fly after a disqualifying injury, illness, or new diagnosis, providers must draft an aeromedical waiver, which reviews the airman’s medical history, current condition, and specific occupational requirements. This process can be unnecessarily time-consuming for military providers.

“Leveraging AI capabilities, we were able to demonstrate a significant decrease in the time that a doctor would take to process aeromedical waivers,” said Kittrell, referring to a process that commonly ranges anywhere between 30 minutes and multiple days. “Our solution demonstrated the ability to get this down to less than 30 seconds.”

The entire prototype development took less than 16 hours of coding during the hackathon, according to Park. “We used a coding platform to stand up the front end, coupled with an MHS GENESIS-compatible backend that we integrated using AI tools.”

Creating real-world streamlining solutions

Team MEDAL’s success demonstrated DHA’s capability to leverage AI and innovative approaches to improve efficiency, enhance clinical decision-making, and ultimately increase warfighter readiness, according to Dhillon.

“This experience allowed us to test readiness-focused use cases, transforming how we approach medical readiness solutions within the DHA,” she said. “We’re excited to continue piloting AI solutions in support of the agency’s mission.”

Since the hackathon, the team has continued refining the application using an approved application programming interface and has explored how similar tools could enhance other enterprise-wide initiatives. This example of integrating human and technology operations also aligns to DHA’s FY26 Mission Focused Directive as a combat support agency.

The vital work of Team MEDAL demonstrated agility, innovation, and enhanced productivity for military medical readiness, Caban said.

“I want to recognize and congratulate the team on their outstanding work and their continued support as we move quickly to mature our data and analytics capabilities in support of the readiness mission,” he added. “They are truly agents of change.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9448437.jpg,N,1.0,2025-12-17 23:56:41.310581

The bill authorizes a record $900 billion in military spending — $8 billion more than initially requested in President Donald Trump’s budget.
We need accountability — not just handouts to Trump.” The National Defense Authorization Bill (NDAA) establishes priorities and programs, but does not actually provide budget authority or spending for those programs.
The House first passed a version of the bill on September 10, and the Senate passed its own version on October 9.
According to a 2024 survey, half of military service members say their compensation is a top stressor, followed closely by housing concerns.","The Senate voted 77-20 to pass the final version of the 2026 defense bill on Wednesday. The bill authorizes a record $900 billion in military spending — $8 billion more than initially requested in President Donald Trump’s budget.

“This year’s National Defense Authorization Act helps advance President Trump and Republicans’ Peace Through Strength Agenda by codifying 15 of President Trump’s executive orders, ending woke ideology at the Pentagon, securing the border, revitalizing the defense industrial base, and restoring the warrior ethos,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, said in a statement.

Some Democrats, however, felt that the bill fell short and focused on the wrong priorities.

“Trump and [Defense Secretary Pete] Hegseth are deploying troops to our streets, carrying out extrajudicial killings, and undermining our military readiness,” Democratic Rep. John Garamendi of California, a senior Armed Services Committee member, said on social media. “Congress must reassert its oversight. We need accountability — not just handouts to Trump.”

The National Defense Authorization Bill (NDAA) establishes priorities and programs, but does not actually provide budget authority or spending for those programs. To provide funding, Congress is supposed to pass 12 appropriations acts each year, including one for the Department of Defense.

The NDAA has passed year after year for more than six decades, largely because deeply partisan provisions have been kept out. However, reflecting the state of politics, culture war provisions — including diversity, equity and inclusion programs, critical race theory, abortion-related travel, drag queen shows and COVID vaccine and mask mandates — were heatedly debated on the House and Senate floors this year. Compromises shaped different versions of the bill for months. The House first passed a version of the bill on September 10, and the Senate passed its own version on October 9. Then, legislators considered hundreds of amendments and worked to reconcile any differences between the two versions. The House passed its final, compromise version on December 10, followed by the Senate a week later. The 3,086-page bill now awaits the president’s signature.

The NDAA outlines the military’s values and strategic priorities, which often signal the administration’s broader vision about what might be coming to other federal departments and civilian life. Here are some of its notable provisions:

Reproductive health care

What was included in the final bill:

TRICARE, the health care program for active-duty and retired members of the Armed Services, will only cover fertility services, including in vitro fertilization (IVF), for service members whose infertility was caused by “a serious or severe illness or injury while on active duty.”

What was removed from the text:

A provision that would have required TRICARE coverage of fertility services, including IVF, for all service members and their families was removed in final negotiations — despite passing with bipartisan support in both the House and Senate versions of the bill.

Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs of California, who championed the IVF provision in the House, pointed out that military families face higher rates of infertility than the average population and need extra support overall for family building.

“I think it’s really important because of the nature of their jobs: demanding schedules, long deployments, frequent relocations, the physical demands of training, exposure to hazardous environments, being separated from their partner,” Jacobs said.

When Jacobs spoke on the House floor in the final hours of debate, she told the story of an Army wife who tried nine rounds of intrauterine insemination and has been told her husband’s infertility is due to his service. Still, TRICARE wouldn’t cover IVF, so she’s considering getting a divorce so she can find other coverage and give them another opportunity at growing their family.

“What I hear from so many military families is that they’re basically left with three choices,” Jacobs said. “Either pay tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket for a chance to have a family, leave the military to find a job in the private sector that will cover it or forgo a family altogether.

Jacobs said she was especially disappointed because she and other Democrats were hopeful the provision would make it this year, given Trump’s campaign promises to make IVF more accessible for everyone.

Diversity, equity and inclusion

What was included in the final bill:

Each of the five military branches will be required to restore service-level women’s initiative teams, some of which were disbanded when Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth called for the end of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the Pentagon. These teams will include servicewomen from different ranks, backgrounds and occupations, and they will be tasked with identifying and addressing issues that hinder women’s service. They will also support recruiting and retention and recommend policy changes that support the needs of women in the military.

Democratic Rep. Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, who introduced the provision, said she was grateful to find bipartisan support.

“These protections strengthen our force, our families, and our national security, and are vital under an Administration working to sideline women and erase their contributions,” Houlahan said in a statement.

The secretary of defense is prohibited from maintaining a DEI office, employing a chief diversity officer, maintaining an employee resource group or affinity group, developing any strategic plans or reports related to DEI and developing any training courses related to DEI, critical race theory or intersectionality.

Service academies are now prohibited from considering race, sex, color, ethnicity, national origin or religion in admissions decisions.

What was removed from the text:

The final version repealed existing DEI mandates, removing statutory requirements for diversity initiatives and other efforts to promote equal opportunity. The move is a reflection of Hegseth’s leadership and vision to shift the military’s culture away from what he called “woke garbage” to a “warrior ethos.”

LGBTQ+ care and participation

What was included in the final bill:

Transgender women enrolled at U.S. service academies can no longer participate in athletic programs designated for women.

What was removed from the text:

The final version did not include many anti-LGBTQ+ provisions that were added in early versions, like a ban on Defense Department funding for gender-affirming surgeries, which had passed in previous versions of both the House and Senate bills. It also dropped a provision that would have required all people to use single-sex facilities, including restrooms, locker rooms and changing rooms, at military installations based on their “reproductive system.”

“While we’re grateful that most anti-LGBTQI+ provisions were removed, the GOP kept one anti-trans provision in the final bill — and that’s one too many,” the Congressional Equality Caucus, a House caucus committed to advocating for LGBTQ+ rights, said in a statement. “We’re committed to repealing it.”

Previous versions of the bill also had provisions that said TRICARE would not cover or furnish “gender-related medical treatment,” which includes puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries for transgender people. Some versions also expanded the existing ban on covering gender dysphoria treatments for children by also banning mental health care. These provisions are not found in the final version. TRICARE currently only covers hormone therapy and psychological counseling for gender dysphoria. It does not cover surgery.

An earlier version also said that the secretary of defense would be prohibited from collecting information about gender identity on any form or survey — which will now only include “male” and “female” as gender options. The amendment was dropped.

An amendment included in the 2024 NDAA allowed military leaders or certain civilian leaders to approve the display of Pride flags; however, that provision has been removed.

Support for military families

What was included in the final bill:

All branches of the military will be required to set clear policies exempting service members from performance evaluations during parental leave, which they will now be allowed to take within two years of a child’s birth or adoption instead of one. In the past several years, the military made significant progress in expanding parental leave options to up to 12 weeks of paid leave for primary and secondary caregivers. The latest provision seeks to provide more consistency across the services and ensure that no one is at a disadvantage.

Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma, who championed the provision, called it a “victory for parents and for the strength of our national defense.”

In an effort to improve service members’ quality of life, the bill includes a 3.8 percent pay increase across the board and reauthorizes and expands military bonuses. It also brings a 4.2 percent average increase to housing allowances. According to a 2024 survey, half of military service members say their compensation is a top stressor, followed closely by housing concerns. The rising cost of housing is outpacing the military’s housing allowances: Only 37 percent of families said their allowances covered the cost of housing.

More than $491 million is authorized for the construction of new child care centers and more than $200 million for new schools for service members’ children and dependents. Finding child care is a common struggle for military families. According to the National Military Family Association, nearly 40 percent of the more than 1 million active-duty service members have children, and 70 percent of these children are under the age of 12.

What was absent from the text:

Notably, there were no amendments in this year’s bill that explicitly addressed the high military spouse unemployment rate. In previous years, the NDAA extended the Defense Department’s authority to fill open civilian positions with qualified military spouses, help those in licensed or credentialed professions more easily work after relocating across state lines and increase reimbursement rates for spouses’ business costs. The unemployment rate among military spouses — more than 90 percent of them are women — was 20 percent or higher for the last decade, according to Pentagon survey data. This is five times the national civilian unemployment rate.

WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) welcomed final passage of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26). The legislation includes major wins that Heinrich secured, including investments in New Mexico’s service members, military installations, national labs, job-creating initiatives throughout the state, and two specific Heinrich-led bills.

“This bipartisan defense bill includes important provisions to support our service members, invest in New Mexico’s military installations, strengthen our national labs, and accelerate critical environmental clean-up work in New Mexico. It also includes my legislation to ensure military families stationed at White Sands Missile Range, Holloman Air Force Base, and rural bases across the U.S. are reimbursed for medical travel under TRICARE Prime,” said Heinrich. “I’m proud that this legislation also further cements New Mexico’s leadership on emerging defense and space capabilities, includes my Downwinder Commemoration Act and International Nuclear Energy Act, and builds on important cybersecurity provisions that grew out of my work in the Bipartisan Senate AI Working Group. This bill will help make New Mexico and our country stronger and safer.”

Heinrich successfully included within the FY26 NDAA his TRICARE Travel Improvement Act to ensure active-duty service members and their families can be reimbursed when they travel for medical care. Currently, families stationed at White Sands Missile Range and Holloman Air Force Base travel nearly 100 miles to El Paso, Texas, for specialist medical care, but are denied reimbursement because they are just under the 100-mile threshold. Heinrich’s TRICARE Travel Improvement Act will ensure fairness for military families serving in remote areas by lowering the travel reimbursement threshold under TRICARE Prime from 100 miles to 75 miles for military families.

Heinrich also successfully included in the FY26 NDAA his Downwinder Commemoration Act to recognize the harm endured by New Mexico’s Downwinders following the 1945 Trinity Test — the first nuclear detonation in U.S. history. The bill directs the Department of Defense (DoD) to place commemorative monuments in publicly accessible areas at White Sands Missile Range and Holloman Air Force Base in their honor.

Both the TRICARE Travel Improvement Act and the Downwinder Commemoration Act are led by Heinrich in the Senate and U.S. Representative Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.) in the House.

“As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I’m fighting for New Mexico’s interests and fair share of funding in the nation’s defense bill,” said Vasquez. “With the passage of these two bipartisan bills I have led, we will finally recognize the families who have suffered in silence from the impacts of the Trinity Test and also ensure military families at White Sands and Holloman Air Force Base don’t have to pay out of pocket to access health care.”

Additionally, Heinrich successfully included the FY26 NDAA his International Nuclear Energy Act, co-led with U.S. Senators James Risch (R-Idaho), Chris Coons (D-Del.), and Mike Lee (R-Utah), to provide the federal government new tools to coordinate on nuclear energy policy with allied nations and help American energy companies thrive on the world market.

The FY26 NDAA now heads to the White House.

The NDAA sets the DOD spending levels and policies for the upcoming fiscal year and authorizes funding for the U.S. Department of Energy's programs at Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories, as well as the Department of Energy's environmental cleanup programs including the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP).

Heinrich has long championed provisions that benefit New Mexico’s service members, national laboratories, and defense missions. Heinrich served as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee from 2013 to 2020 and as Chairman of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee from 2021 to 2022. He is also a member of the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and a member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.

During his time in Congress, Heinrich has doubled the total budgets for Sandia and Los Alamos, significantly increasing the total employees and local economic impact of both labs.

Heinrich has also delivered a total of more than $1.5 billion for military construction projects at defense installations in New Mexico over the course of his career in Congress.

FY26 Defense Authorization Bill Highlights

Military Construction

Heinrich championed a historic number of investments in our military installations in New Mexico, including:

$90 million for a new 192-bed dormitory at Cannon Air Force Base.

$79 million for a Deployment Processing Center at Cannon Air Force Base.

$83 million for a Space Rapid Capabilities Office Headquarters at Kirtland Air Force Base.

$10 million for a dormitory for the 58th Special Operations Wing on Kirtland Air Force Base.

$26 million for an Explosive Operations Building on Kirtland Air Force Base.

$38.5 million for a Power Generation and Microgrid project on White Sands Missile Range.

$4.25 million for a Soldier Performance Readiness Center for the New Mexico Army National Guard at the Sante Fe Training Center.

Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technologies

Heinrich helped secure provisions that ensure the DoD only uses commercial AI services from companies with a reliable cybersecurity posture. AI companies that do not take appropriate steps to defend themselves in cyberspace may become the victims of supply chain attacks that compromise the trustworthiness of their products.

Pay Raise for Junior Enlisted Service Members

The FY26 NDAA authorizes a 3.8 percent pay raise for service members. This builds off of a 14.5 percent pay raise for the most junior-ranking enlisted service members, and a 4.5 percent pay raise for the rest of the force in the FY25 NDAA.

Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories

The FY26 NDAA authorizes $1.79 billion for LANL’s ongoing research and development programs. The funding supports personnel, equipment, and other activities at LANL.

Within the FY26 NDAA's overall $26 billion for the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), Sandia National Laboratories will receive funding to support and sustain system integration, engineering, and science programs. Sandia is also receiving $40 million for their Microsystems, Engineering, Science and Applications (MESA) Photolithography Capability and $52.2 million for Combined Radiation Environments for Survivability Testing.

Additional Heinrich-led provisions include:

Directing the U.S. Department of Energy Secretary to brief Congress on recommended actions to accelerate environmental cleanup milestones with the State of New Mexico at Los Alamos National Laboratory, including interim measures to control migration of a hexavalent chromium plume and progress on the groundwater remedies for the Royal Demolition Explosive (RDX) plume in Cañon de Valle.

Directing the NNSA Administrator for Nuclear Security and Directors of Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories, along with leaders from other national labs, to evaluate site strategies that can aid the NNSA in making greater use of facilities in areas neighboring existing laboratory and site installations, particularly where workforce housing is less constrained.

Directing the U.S. Comptroller General to assess:

What Unexploded Ordnance remediation efforts the NNSA has completed in the vicinity of Sandia National Laboratories; and

The extent to which additional efforts are needed to ensure that all affected nearby communities have been cleared of legacy unexploded ordnance.

Authorizing nearly $300 million for environmental cleanup efforts at Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories.

Directing the NNSA Administrator for Nuclear Security to conduct a study of portions of Tract A-14 (Rendija Canyon) of Los Alamos National Laboratory that may be suitable for conveyance.

Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP)

The FY26 NDAA authorizes over $415 million to operate WIPP including $2 million to construct a hoisting capability project to improve facility capacity and effectiveness.

Space Force Modeling, Simulation & Analysis Hub

The FY26 NDAA authorizes $7.5 million for the ongoing establishment and deployment of a U.S. Space Force modeling and simulation hub at the Air Force Research Lab on Kirtland Air Force Base.

Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration Program

The FY26 NDAA authorizes over $182 million for the DoD’s Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration (REPI) Program. Cannon Air Force Base, Melrose Air Force Range, and White Sands Missile Range utilize the REPI to prevent encroachment and preserve their testing and training missions. The program as a whole is critical to assisting military installations and ranges as they are increasingly impacted by extreme weather, flooding, wildfires, drought, and other threats to resilience.

Advanced Simulation and Computing for Nuclear Stockpile Stewardship

The FY26 NDAA authorizes $866 million in funding for the NNSA’s advanced simulation and computing efforts in the Stockpile Stewardship Program. This program ensures continued reliability of the stockpile and allows realistic simulations on supercomputers to understand how they would behave, without requiring explosive testing.

Intelligence Authorization Act

The FY26 NDAA includes the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY26, legislation that equips U.S. intelligence agencies with the tools, resources, and personnel they need to protect the American people, while also ensuring congressional oversight over those same agencies.

Humana (HUM, Financial) secures a $7.34 billion contract with the Defense Health Agency for TRICARE services in the East Region.

Humana's market capitalization stands at approximately $31.3 billion, positioning it as a significant player in the healthcare sector.

The company's financial health is underscored by a Piotroski F-Score of 7, indicating robust financial strength.

Humana (HUM) has successfully secured a $7.34 billion contract for the continuation of health care and administrative support services under the Defense Health Agency's TRICARE program in the East Region. This contract involves the integration of Humana's resources with the military's medical care system to deliver comprehensive health, medical, and support services to eligible uniformed service members, retirees, and their families.

The East Region encompasses a wide range of locations, including Washington, D.C., and states such as Alabama, Florida, New York, and Virginia among others. Initiated on December 22, 2022, this contract includes a 12-month base period along with eight potential one-year extensions plus a transition-out phase. The current option period is scheduled from January 1, 2026, to December 31, 2026, with operations centered in Louisville, Kentucky. The Managed Care Contracting Division of the Defense Health Agency oversees this contract.

Humana Inc, one of the largest private health insurers in the US, has carved out a niche specializing in government-sponsored programs. Nearly all its medical membership stems from Medicare, Medicaid, and the military's TRICARE program. Beyond medical insurance, Humana provides other healthcare services, including primary-care services, at-home services, and pharmacy benefit management. With a market capitalization of approximately $31.3 billion, Humana is a formidable entity within the healthcare sector, specifically in the healthcare plans industry.

Financial Health Analysis

Humana's financial performance is characterized by a revenue growth of 14.9% over the past three years, reflecting its ability to expand its market presence effectively. However, the company's net margin remains relatively modest at 1.02%, indicating room for improvement in profitability. The EBITDA margin stands at 2.55%, while the EBIT margin is 1.86%.

On the balance sheet front, Humana's debt-to-equity ratio is 0.68, suggesting a balanced approach to leveraging debt. The company has a interest coverage ratio of 3.63, indicating its ability to meet interest obligations comfortably. However, a warning sign is the company's continued issuance of new debt, with $2 billion issued over the past three years.

Valuation & Market Sentiment

Humana's valuation metrics reveal a P/E ratio of 24.39, which is within its historical range, suggesting that the stock is fairly valued relative to its earnings. The P/S ratio is 0.25, and the P/B ratio is 1.69, both indicating a reasonable valuation compared to historical norms.

Analyst sentiment is moderately positive, with a target price of $289.06 and a recommendation score of 2.5. Technical indicators such as the RSI of 51.84 suggest that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. Institutional ownership is high at 98.39%, reflecting strong confidence from large investors.

Risk Assessment

Humana's financial health is supported by a Piotroski F-Score of 7, indicating a very healthy situation. The Beneish M-Score of -2.43 suggests that the company is unlikely to be a manipulator. However, sector-specific risks, such as regulatory changes in healthcare, could impact future performance.",https://static.gurufocus.com/logos/0C00000BCM.png?20,N,1.0,2025-12-17 18:57:38.564715

The Military CARE Act gives service members and their families a direct line to report care access issues and track their resolution, while ensuring Congress has the data needed to identify and fix systemic problems across the military health system,” Rep. Bacon said.
Our commonsense bipartisan bill will cut senseless red tape, restore basic accountability, and return the power back where it belongs: with patients.","“Military families serve our nation and sacrifice so much for it, and they deserve a health care system that serves them just as well,” Rep. Horsford said. “Too many families struggle to get timely appointments or clear information, and they’re left without a reliable way to raise concerns or track whether problems are fixed. This bipartisan bill gives military families a real voice, gives providers the tools to respond quickly, and gives Congress the oversight needed to ensure servicemembers and their loved ones are never left behind.When we support our families, we strengthen the entire force.”

“Access to timely, reliable health care is both a personal issue and a readiness issue. Too often, military families hit administrative roadblocks or long delays with no clear way to raise concerns or track whether problems are being fixed,” Rep. Houlahan said. “The Military CARE Act brings transparency and accountability to the system by giving TRICARE beneficiaries a straightforward way to report access issues and ensures those concerns reach patient advocates and senior leaders.

Maintaining Physical Health During the Holidays Physical activity remains important for both physical and mental well-being, even when schedules are full.","Editor’s note: The Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center has begun a Behavioral Health Initiative to inform the community with information and resources that will help with everyday struggles like stress management, nutrition and physical health, emotional intelligence, and healthy habits. This article focuses on maintaining healthy stress levels during the holiday season.

FORT HOOD, Texas - The holiday season is a time of celebration, connection, and reflection, but it can also bring increased stress, disruptions to routines, and challenges to maintaining healthy habits. Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center encourages service members, families, retirees, and community members to take proactive steps to care for their mental, nutritional, and physical health—and to take advantage of the many resources available on post and in the local area.

“Maintaining your health during the holidays doesn’t require perfection or even a large time commitment,” said Col. Amit Gupta, Fort Hood director of psychological health and chief of behavioral health CRDAMC. “It’s about balance—recognizing stress early, making small healthy choices, and knowing when to ask for support. Use your CRDAMC providers, who want nothing more than to care for this community every step of the way.”

Managing Holiday Stress Holiday stress can come from many sources, including busy schedules, financial strain, travel, and separation from loved ones. Recognizing stress early and using healthy coping strategies can help prevent it from becoming overwhelming.

“Stress can affect both mental and physical health, especially when routines are disrupted,” notes Capt. Chelsea Yueng, a CRDAMC behavioral health nurse. “Reaching out early—whether to a provider, counselor, chaplain, or trusted individual—can make a significant difference.” Helpful strategies include: • Maintain Routines: Stick to consistent sleep schedules when possible. • Set Attainable Expectations: Unrealistic expectations y cause resentment and disappointment. • Set Realistic Goals: Prioritize what's most important and don't be afraid to say no. • Stay Connected: Make time for friends, family, and trusted coworkers. • Practice Relaxation: Try deep breathing, meditation, prayer, or even short walks to clear your head.

Support is Always Available: • CRDAMC Behavioral Health Services: Counseling for stress, anxiety, and other concerns. Visit https://darnall.tricare.mil/Health-Services/Mental-Behavioral-Health-Substance-Use-Disorder for more information. • Military & Family Life Counselors (MFLC): Confidential, short-term counseling.

Navigating Nutrition During the Holidays Holiday meals are meant to be enjoyed! With a mindful approach, you can savor your favorite foods as part of a healthy lifestyle.

“Nutrition is not about restriction—it’s about fueling your body in a way that supports energy, immunity, and overall health,” says Lt. Col. Donna Goodson, Director of Nutritional Medicine at CRDAMC.

Simple Nutrition Tips: • Use the Plate Method: Fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables, a quarter with lean protein, and a quarter with whole grains. • Eat Regularly: Don't skip meals, as this can lead to overeating later. • Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. It will also help you stay full. • Enjoy Mindfully: Savor your favorite holiday treats by consuming them slowly and focusing on the sensations. Eat without guilt by focusing on portion awareness and satisfaction.

For immediate release

Washington, DC—ASRM applauds the introduction of the Bipartisan IVF for Military Families Act. This significant development should be viewed as a rapid and sharp rebuke of House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), who unilaterally stripped TRICARE coverage for the brave men and women who serve our country from the Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26) National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).

“The ink on the final FY26 NDAA is still drying, and the bill has yet to be signed into law,” observed American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) Chief Advocacy & Policy Officer Sean Tipton. “And yet, even in one of the most polarized and partisan political environments we have seen in decades, House Democrats and Republicans have rapidly come together with one voice to condemn the Speaker’s actions and stand up for the members of the active duty military who desire to both serve their country and achieve their dreams of building a family.”

The Bipartisan IVF for Military Families Act is the first-ever, standalone, bipartisan bill to provide comprehensive fertility care for military families under TRICARE, the federal health care program for servicemembers and their families. Nearly identical to the language included in the version of the NDAA that passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support in September, the new legislation requires TRICARE coverage for fertility-related care, including IVF, cryopreservation of reproductive genetic materials, medications, and fertility treatment coordination, among other services. Notably, the IVF coverage directed by the bill achieves parity with the IVF benefits available to Members of Congress and their staff.

“We commend Representatives Sara Jacobs (D-CA), Nick LaLota (R-NY), Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA), and Jen Kiggans (R-VA) for their outstanding leadership on the Bipartisan IVF for Military Families Act,” continued Tipton. “In an era where Members of Congress frequently encounter threats of political retribution for bucking party leadership, it is a breath of fresh air to engage with these lawmakers who demonstrate what it means to serve with integrity and do the right thing. We thank this group of bipartisan champions for their work to ensure that our military families will have guaranteed access to IVF and other family building treatments, and ASRM looks forward to fighting alongside them to secure enactment of the Bipartisan IVF for Military Families Act as soon as possible.”

Many ASRM members have previously served in uniform, and others have years of experience providing fertility care to military families. Too often, ASRM members report that the biggest obstacle to caring for these patients is knowing that IVF is the best treatment option and simultaneously acknowledging that this family building pathway is financially out of reach because of barriers under TRICARE. The absence of coverage is deeply unjust considering the sacrifices military families endure and the elevated infertility rates among service members due to job-related factors.

“The introduction of the Bipartisan IVF for Military Families Act is a huge victory for military families across the country,” said Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) Executive Council President Dr. Micah Hill, D.O., a retired colonel who served 21 years on active duty. “The brave men and women who serve our nation are more likely to experience infertility than the general public, and it’s high time they receive comprehensive coverage for IVF and other essential family-building treatments through TRICARE.”",https://www.asrm.org/globalassets/_asrm/news-events/asrm-news/press-releasebulletins/press_release_teaser.png,N,1.0,2025-12-17 17:57:15.973163

Why it matters: San Diego has one of the largest concentrations of military personnel, and about one in four service members and their spouses report infertility.

In vitro fertilization, or IVF, treatments can cost tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket.

Driving the news: Jacobs and other congressional lawmakers introduced the Bipartisan IVF for Military Families Act as a standalone bill Wednesday to require military health care to cover all fertility treatments, including IVF and egg freezing.

Speaker Mike Johnson worked to remove a similar provision from the final version of the National Defense Authorization Act last week, despite it passing with bipartisan support in previous House and Senate versions.

What she's saying: ""It's a national security issue,"" Jacobs told Axios. ""People are leaving the military because they cannot continue and build the families that they want.""

Between the lines: California requires large health insurers to cover IVF treatments, but that doesn't apply to the thousands of local military families who use TRICARE, the military's health plan.

Zoom in: TRICARE only covers fertility treatment for those who can prove that there's a service-connected reason for their infertility, which can be challenging.

Jacobs said she talked to one woman who's tried 11 rounds of IUI, and can't get TRICARE to cover IVF, even with proof that her husband's multiple combat deployments have caused his fertility issues. They've even considered getting divorced so that she can get that coverage elsewhere, she said.

It is structured to help military-connected individuals enter care with clarity, predictability, and a sense of stability. Instead of navigating everything alone, you are offered a clear pathway that explains what steps to take and what support may be available.

One of the most meaningful aspects of Tricare is its emphasis on accessibility. Many individuals and families share that having guidelines and coverage explanations helps reduce the stress of making decisions during an already vulnerable time. When you understand what your plan includes, it becomes easier to imagine a healing experience that feels approachable.

Rehab is often described not as a place of judgment but as a space where understanding, connection, and grounding begin to take shape. Many individuals find themselves reconnecting with their needs, rebuilding inner stability, and exploring long-standing challenges with compassion and support.

Treatment can offer greater clarity, emotional resilience, healthier routines, and a sense of steady encouragement during moments of transition. Healing is never rushed. Each step is taken with intention and respect for your comfort level.

Feeling understood is often the first step toward healing. At Acceptance Treatment, individuals are welcomed exactly as they are, without pressure or expectation. We create a warm, trauma-informed space where you can explore what feels heavy, reconnect with your needs, and move forward at a pace that honors your internal rhythm.

While we are not a residential rehab facility, we offer grounding outpatient support for individuals who are considering different treatment options. We frequently help people understand which programs may align with their goals, including those that take Tricare insurance.

Earlier this week, Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio held classified briefings for all House members and Senators on the strikes.
Later on Wednesday, the Senate unanimously adopted a bipartisan bill to close the loophole, but it still needs to pass the House.
GOP Sen. Ted Cruz said he hopes the House will take it up “expeditiously” Senators expressed concerns about other omissions in the defense policy bill.
Earlier House and Senate versions of the bill contained such language, but it was left out of the final product.","The Senate passed the annual defense policy bill, sending it to President Donald Trump’s desk for his signature.

Democrats and Republicans in the Senate voted overwhelmingly, 77-20, to approve the National Defense Authorization Act, which authorizes nearly $900 billion in funding for military programs, including a 3.8% pay raise for service members, and sets out the nation’s defense policy agenda.

The House of Representatives approved the package last week, and Trump is expected to sign it, having previously urged its passage.

Among the massive bill’s more controversial measures is a provision that pressures the Pentagon to provide more information on military strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean, which was added after the revelation of a follow-up strike conducted on September 2. The package would cut Secretary Pete Hegseth’s travel budget by 25% until unedited videos of the strikes are released to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees.

Earlier this week, Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio held classified briefings for all House members and Senators on the strikes. Hegseth told reporters on Tuesday the Pentagon will not release to the public the full video of the controversial September strike.

The NDAA would also repeal the 1991 and 2002 authorizations for the use of military force against Iraq, repeal sanctions on Syria, and seek to limit the Trump administration’s ability to significantly draw down troops from Europe.

Another provision aims to support efforts to recover Ukrainian children who have been abducted by Russia. The provision, based on bipartisan, bicameral legislation, would restore US support for the work to track and return the stolen children. Earlier this year, the Trump administration cut funding to the leading organization that tracks evidence of Russian war crimes, including the forced relocation of the estimated tens of thousands of Ukrainian children who have been taken by Russia.

Senators from both parties had raised alarms about a measure in the package that they warn will weaken safety measures put in place after last year’s deadly plane crash at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.

Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Chairman Ted Cruz and Ranking Member Maria Cantwell, along with Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, pushed for an amendment to the bill to ensure that a new rule instituted after the crash remains in place. The rule requires military aircraft to transmit their locations using a more precise system.

The senators, and others, warned that the NDAA includes a loophole that would permit military aircraft to use a less precise system, like the one that the Black Hawk military helicopter was using on the night of the collision with the American Airlines plane. Their amended language was ultimately not added to the bill.

Later on Wednesday, the Senate unanimously adopted a bipartisan bill to close the loophole, but it still needs to pass the House. GOP Sen. Ted Cruz said he hopes the House will take it up “expeditiously”

Senators expressed concerns about other omissions in the defense policy bill.

Many lawmakers, including Sen. Tammy Duckworth, were dismayed that language to expand coverage of fertility services like in vitro fertilization for service members on TRICARE was absent from the package. Earlier House and Senate versions of the bill contained such language, but it was left out of the final product.

“Health care providers should be able to focus on their patients.
“To ensure the warfighter is fit to fight tonight, the Military Health System needs to operate as efficiently as possible.
Previously, our health care providers renewed their privileges every two years.
Health care providers will also remain subject to the adverse action protocols at the setting in which they are practicing.","The Military Health System recently streamlined the provider-privileging process to allow health care providers to seamlessly transfer their privileges between MHS entities with minimal interruption to patient care duties. This change results in reduced administrative burden and increased patient access.

As of Oct. 15, 2025, health care providers retain their clinical privileges when moving within the enterprise, including across stateside and overseas military hospitals, clinics, and deployed settings.

“Health care providers should be able to focus on their patients. With portable privileges, they can do so more quickly,” said Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of war for Health Affairs.

Provider privileging promotes quality care

Provider privileging is a key component of maintaining the highest quality and safety of care we deliver in the MHS. Clinical privileges define a provider’s scope of practice and are based on factors such as relevant training and experience, current competence, health status, and judgment, and peer and department head recommendations.

Under the previous system, providers were required to complete a privileging action each time they transferred to different care settings, adding additional time to the process before providers could render care. With the expanded policy, when transferring between MHS entities, health care providers sign an attestation for an approved scope of work, eliminating the need for a privileging action or transfer briefing and allowing the provider to focus on patient care.

More effective privileging means accelerated care

Ferrara said that removing obstacles and barriers allows providers to do what they are passionate about — treating patients.

This supports mission readiness by reducing delays in patient care, Ferrara said. “To ensure the warfighter is fit to fight tonight, the Military Health System needs to operate as efficiently as possible. After moving to another facility, this allows our providers to start seeing patients right away instead of waiting weeks or even months to repeat this process.”

“Enterprise-wide privileging is just one of many efforts to make the Military Health System more agile. Previously, our health care providers renewed their privileges every two years. With this expanded policy, we have extended the renewal window to three years to reduce their administrative load,” said Ferrara.

The rigorous process of acquiring privileges remains the same, and there are no changes about the quality assurance of the credentialing standards for health care providers. Health care providers will also remain subject to the adverse action protocols at the setting in which they are practicing.

The new policy spearheads faster, more flexible operations as the MHS remains committed to excellence in care by enabling a ready medical force.",https://www.health.mil/-/media/Images/MHS/DVIDS/Articles/news554396.jpg?sc_lang=en&hash=F79451BD6E27FA19D024A0655E7FCBE8BD5F3F2C,N,0.0,2025-12-17 14:56:47.342211

Life as a single service member can bring excitement, adventure, and unique stressors. Personal networks of peers, friends, and family members can help single service members cope with the challenges they experience in the course of military service. Such supports can help service members feel connected to life at home, cope with the stress during deployment, and assist with adjustment upon return home. Try using the tips and resources below to strengthen and expand your personal support network.

Benefits of Using a Personal Support Network

People in your personal support network are those whom you care about and trust, and who care about and trust you. Benefits associated with a strong personal support network include:

Less stress, by turning to your support network of friends, family, and peers who can provide practical and emotional support

A stronger sense of belonging, by spending time with people who value and care about you

Greater peace of mind, by knowing that you have people in your life on whom you can depend

More self-confidence, by being a part of someone else's support network to help them cope with similar challenges that you experienced

A strong personal support network can help you build resilience as you progress throughout your military service. Building resilience will make you a stronger, more effective warrior.

Get Involved: Single Service Member Programs

Single service member programs are a great way to develop new friendships and reinforce existing ones. These programs support the overall quality of single service members' lives by identifying common challenges, recommending ways to address these concerns through the chain of command, encouraging and assisting single service members in identifying and planning for recreation and leisure activities, and providing single service members with opportunities to participate in and contribute to their respective communities.

Tips to Strengthen Your Personal Network

Whether you're PCSing to a new duty station, deployed, or preparing for another life transition , now is the best time to strengthen your personal network. Try incorporating the following tips into your relationships with family and friends:

Keep in touch. Call, text, video chat or send emails frequently. Consider joining online networks that your friends and family enjoy. Social media is another way you can communicate with friends and family when you can't call, write, or visit.

Remember special days. Call, text, or send a card on birthdays, anniversaries, holidays and other days that are important to the people in your network. To help you remember these days, fill in a calendar or date book with the important dates. You can also set reminders on your cell phone.

Turn to your friends and family in good times, too. Your friends and family are there for you when times are tough; invite them also to share in your good news!

Surround yourself with positive people. The attitudes and behaviors of others can affect your attitude and behavior, so surrounding yourself with optimistic people may help you to maintain a positive outlook.

Show family and friends they are important to you. Return their calls and messages. Respond to invitations promptly when you are home. Tell them frequently that you appreciate them.

Don't wait for people to tell you that they need support. People may be reluctant to ask for help, especially if they know you have a busy life. If you think a person in your network may need someone to talk to, offer to share your experiences overcoming challenges because you are your friend's biggest support. If you feel a person is in danger of hurting themselves or others, seek help immediately by calling or texting 988 (press 1 for the Military/Veterans Crisis Line) to speak with a trained professional.

Make time for personal get-togethers. Even if you prefer to communicate by phone, text message or email, others may be more willing to open up in a face-to-face conversation. Make time for connecting with friends and family in-person by having a barbecue, attending a sporting event or concert together or going for a long walk.

This change results in reduced administrative burden and increased patient access.

As of Oct. 15, 2025, health care providers retain their clinical privileges when moving within the enterprise, including across stateside and overseas military hospitals, clinics, and deployed settings. “Health care providers should be able to focus on their patients. With portable privileges, they can do so more quickly,” said Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of war for Health Affairs.

Provider privileging promotes quality care

Provider privileging is a key component of maintaining the highest quality and safety of care we deliver in the MHS. Clinical privileges define a provider’s scope of practice and are based on factors such as relevant training and experience, current competence, health status, and judgment, and peer and department head recommendations.

Under the previous system, providers were required to complete a privileging action each time they transferred to different care settings, adding additional time to the process before providers could render care. With the expanded policy, when transferring between MHS entities, health care providers sign an attestation for an approved scope of work, eliminating the need for a privileging action or transfer briefing and allowing the provider to focus on patient care.

More effective privileging means accelerated care

Ferrara said that removing obstacles and barriers allows providers to do what they are passionate about — treating patients.

This supports mission readiness by reducing delays in patient care, Ferrara said. “To ensure the warfighter is fit to fight tonight, the Military Health System needs to operate as efficiently as possible. After moving to another facility, this allows our providers to start seeing patients right away instead of waiting weeks or even months to repeat this process.”

“Enterprise-wide privileging is just one of many efforts to make the Military Health System more agile. Previously, our health care providers renewed their privileges every two years. With this expanded policy, we have extended the renewal window to three years to reduce their administrative load,” said Ferrara.

The rigorous process of acquiring privileges remains the same, and there are no changes about the quality assurance of the credentialing standards for health care providers. Health care providers will also remain subject to the adverse action protocols at the setting in which they are practicing.

The new policy spearheads faster, more flexible operations as the MHS remains committed to excellence in care by enabling a ready medical force.",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/8888359.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-17 16:59:22.404538

The team took “synthetic data similar to what we see in MHS GENESIS and combined it with readiness policies,” he said.
“As the agency’s leader for analytics and AI, participating in this event provides exposure to emerging technologies,” Caban said.
“This experience allowed us to test readiness-focused use cases, transforming how we approach medical readiness solutions within the DHA,” she said.
The vital work of Team MEDAL demonstrated agility, innovation, and enhanced productivity for military medical readiness, Caban said.","A team from the Defense Health Agency Chief Data and Analytics Office turned the Defense Technologies “Hackathon” into a major step forward for mission and medical readiness. As part of the National Defense Industrial Association’s Emerging Technologies for Defense Conference & Exhibition, held in Washington, D.C., Aug. 25-29, the team competed in a weeklong competition alongside 50 other teams from government, private industry, and academia. The DHA CDAO team finished second overall for what the judging panel of military technology leaders called an “impactful and innovative readiness solution.” Members of Team MEDAL — Medical Evaluation for Defense Airmen’s Readiness — who represented DHA CDAO included Barinderjeet Dhillon, operations research analyst; Chris Kittrell, branch chief; and Junayd Park, functional lead for application prototyping and integration. Dr. Jesus Caban, DHA’s chief data and analytics officer, said the team participated in the event to gain valuable experience in a competitive environment, solving real-world issues to enhance operational readiness. The team took “synthetic data similar to what we see in MHS GENESIS and combined it with readiness policies,” he said. “They then spent three to four days developing a software application to show the value of leveraging DHA data and AI (artificial intelligence) to better understand and support medical readiness.” For Caban, the event offered more than a trophy: He said it served as proof for how data and AI can remove barriers that limit the force’s response speed. “As the agency’s leader for analytics and AI, participating in this event provides exposure to emerging technologies,” Caban said. “It also highlights the incredible talent we have within the agency that we can leverage to apply innovative solutions in support of warfighter readiness.” Leveraging AI to increase workflow productivity and efficiency Team MEDAL took on the challenge of automating aeromedical waiver generation for U.S. Air Force pilots. The scenario was a “known constraint on pilot availability,” said Park. They developed a prototype to “streamline aeromedical waiver processing and readiness,” directly addressing issues of medically clearing pilots in an efficient and timely manner, Park said. Aeromedical waivers can be a critical piece of the readiness puzzle. Before pilots can fly after a disqualifying injury, illness, or new diagnosis, providers must draft an aeromedical waiver, which reviews the airman’s medical history, current condition, and specific occupational requirements. This process can be unnecessarily time-consuming for military providers. “Leveraging AI capabilities, we were able to demonstrate a significant decrease in the time that a doctor would take to process aeromedical waivers,” said Kittrell, referring to a process that commonly ranges anywhere between 30 minutes and multiple days. “Our solution demonstrated the ability to get this down to less than 30 seconds.” The entire prototype development took less than 16 hours of coding during the hackathon, according to Park. “We used a coding platform to stand up the front end, coupled with an MHS GENESIS-compatible backend that we integrated using AI tools.” Creating real-world streamlining solutions Team MEDAL’s success demonstrated DHA’s capability to leverage AI and innovative approaches to improve efficiency, enhance clinical decision-making, and ultimately increase warfighter readiness, according to Dhillon. “This experience allowed us to test readiness-focused use cases, transforming how we approach medical readiness solutions within the DHA,” she said. “We’re excited to continue piloting AI solutions in support of the agency’s mission.” Since the hackathon, the team has continued refining the application using an approved application programming interface and has explored how similar tools could enhance other enterprise-wide initiatives. This example of integrating human and technology operations also aligns to DHA’s FY26 Mission Focused Directive as a combat support agency. The vital work of Team MEDAL demonstrated agility, innovation, and enhanced productivity for military medical readiness, Caban said. “I want to recognize and congratulate the team on their outstanding work and their continued support as we move quickly to mature our data and analytics capabilities in support of the readiness mission,” he added. “They are truly agents of change.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2512/9448437/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-12-17 12:56:32.745332

Medical personnel from Winn Army Community Hospital and Soldiers from across the 3rd Infantry Division enhanced their trauma care proficiency last week during the Rural Interactive Trauma Simulation Course, a hands-on training event designed to reinforce life-saving skills essential to battlefield medicine.

The course, now in its pilot year, is facilitated by the Medical College of Georgia. The program exposes military medical providers to realistic trauma scenarios, particularly those common in remote or resource-limited environments.

Lisa Tyler, nurse educator at Winn Army Community Hospital, said the training directly supports the hospital’s mission of preparing clinicians and warfighters for real-world emergencies.

“These are the people that are going to be taking care of you and your family members out on the battlefield,” Tyler said. “So it’s very important that they get these hands-on skills before they actually need to use them.”

Tyler oversaw 20 participants rotating through stations such as intraosseous access, central lines, pelvic binders, airway management, cricothyrotomy, intubation and chest tube placement. She said the experience is critical to maintaining trauma proficiency for the hospital.

“This is a very crucial part in helping us maintain our trauma designation,” Tyler said.

Winn emergency department noncommissioned officer in charge Sgt. 1st Class Randy Brandt described the training as essential preparation for procedures that are rarely performed but carry significant risk.

“So today we’re running through some trauma training. It is necessary trauma training,” Brandt said. “This is a lot of the stuff that I would consider to be low volume, high risk stuff — the very deep in-depth, bread and butter of what we do, but we don’t do it very often.”

Brandt said training alongside civilian medical partners helps validate military medical standards and build confidence among participants.

“It’s especially good to do it with external agencies, people that we don’t normally work with,” he said. “It just kind of confirms that what we do is right, that these are kind of standard across not just the Army, but the healthcare profession in general.”

For Soldiers operating in austere environments, the course mirrors the realities of battlefield medicine, where advanced equipment and imaging may not be available.

Capt. Jessica Richards, a nurse with 703rd Brigade Support Battalion, said the rural focus of the training makes it particularly relevant for deployed warfighters.

“So obviously, our training today is focused on trauma, especially in the rural setting, which is very applicable to our war fighters, because they are out with very minimal resources,” Richards said. “And so we’re kind of talking about those few things that we can do without all of the technology and imaging that would be helpful to make those decisions, and what we can do in the field to prepare to get them to that level in trauma center.”

As the only nurse in her Role II team, Richards said the course strengthened her ability to support medics and guide care under pressure.

“I’m very grateful to be a part of this training,” Richards said. “I can perform a quick FAST exam in the absence of someone that might be more experienced, and help out with that. Same with having the medics here doing the IOs, doing the central lines, because even though we might not be the ones placing them, we’re going to be the ones caring for them later.”

Richards said the experience also provided valuable perspective on how military and civilian trauma care intersect.

“It’s just really cool to see it from all different points of the people participating in the care, and then obviously to comparing it to our civilian counterparts, where we may be sending soldiers for follow-on care,” she said.

Brandt emphasized that while the procedures practiced during the course may be infrequent, the expectation for excellence remains constant.

“This is exactly what patients come to us for,” Brandt said. “To receive this higher level care.”

Kiggans.","Washington, D.C. — After IVF coverage for military families was stripped from the final version of the National Defense Authorization Act last week, Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (PA-06), Sara Jacobs (CA-51), Rep. Nick LaLota (NY-01) and Rep. Jen Kiggans (VA-02) introduced the Bipartisan IVF for Military Families Act to continue the fight to deliver this much-needed and deserved care for active duty service members and their dependents. This legislation mirrors text that was unanimously adopted on a bipartisan basis by the House Armed Services Committee and passed the House earlier this year.

Rep. Chrissy Houlahan said: “Military families already sacrifice so much in service to our country, and they should not be forced to put their dreams of starting a family on hold because TRICARE fails to cover medically necessary fertility care. Servicemembers should never have to choose between serving their country and building a family. This bipartisan bill recognizes infertility as a real medical condition and ensures servicemembers and their families have access to fertility care without unnecessary barriers. Supporting military readiness means supporting the people who serve.”

Rep. Sara Jacobs said: “Like I said last week, the fight isn’t over. Our military families shouldn’t be denied IVF access just because of politics while bearing the physical and emotional costs of service. Civilian employers are increasingly providing IVF coverage to their employees, and it’s even accessible to every Member of Congress and their staff, but the military is still lagging behind. This is creating an acute readiness and retention crisis because our military families are forced to pay tens of thousands of dollars out-of-pocket for IVF, forgo having children, or leave the military to get private coverage instead. That’s why I’m proud to introduce the Bipartisan IVF for Military Families Act to give our service members every opportunity to build their families.”

“Since 2023, Congress has rightly focused on strengthening military recruitment and retention by increasing troop pay, improving housing, expanding health care, and investing in quality of life for servicemembers and their families. Now, Congress should expand access to IVF, as many civilian employers already do, to build on that progress and help ensure America maintains the most lethal fighting force the world has ever known,” said Rep. Nick LaLota (NY-01).

Read the full article here.

This research addresses a critical gap in understanding treatment pathways for musculoskeletal shoulder conditions—one of the most frequent causes of pain and disability among active-duty service members and veterans. By analyzing longitudinal data from the Military Health System, the team identified patterns in healthcare utilization, including diagnostic imaging, physical therapy, surgical interventions, and medication use.

""Our findings provide a clearer picture of how care is delivered for shoulder disorders in a large, integrated health system. This knowledge is essential for identifying opportunities to improve efficiency and ensure patients receive the right care at the right time,"" said Steven Z. George, PT, PhD, professor in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Duke.

Key Findings:

Shoulder disorders represent a significant burden in military populations, often requiring multi-modal care.

Utilization patterns varied based on diagnosis type, patient demographics, and care setting.

The study highlights opportunities to optimize care delivery, reduce unnecessary interventions, and improve outcomes.

Why It Matters:

Musculoskeletal injuries are among the leading causes of limited duty and medical discharge in the military. Understanding how patients navigate care systems can inform evidence-based guidelines, improve resource allocation, and enhance patient-centered care for both military and civilian populations.

""By examining real-world data from the Military Health System, we can better understand treatment patterns and identify gaps in care. These insights are critical for developing strategies that improve outcomes and reduce unnecessary costs,"" said Maggie E. Horn, PT, DPT, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Duke.

“HR-6703 builds on recent reforms that put patients first and moves us closer to a system where Americans, not Washington, make their own health care decisions.” ###","ARLINGTON, Va. ― Concerned Veterans for America (CVA) today announced its strong support for HR-6703, the Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act, urging members of the U.S. House of Representatives to vote YES ahead of the upcoming floor vote.

Veterans understand the real-world consequences of government-run health care systems that limit choice, delay care, and put bureaucracy ahead of patients. HR-6703 takes meaningful steps to move the American health care system in the opposite direction –toward affordability, flexibility, and personal choice.

“This legislation is a commonsense effort to bring down health care costs and give Americans more control over how and where they receive care,” said John Vick, Executive Director of Concerned Veterans for America. “For veterans, troops, working families, and seniors alike, expanding access to affordable coverage options is long overdue.”

HR-6703 would lower premiums and increase competition by expanding health insurance options, reducing insurer-driven cost inflation, and empowering consumers rather than insurance companies or federal bureaucracies. For veterans navigating private insurance alongside VA community care, for military families relying on TRICARE, and for civilians struggling in the individual market, choice and affordability matter.

Under current federal health care policy, families face skyrocketing premiums, shrinking provider networks, and rising out-of-pocket costs, all while access to timely care continues to decline. Veterans have lived this reality inside the VA system, where lack of competition and rigid structures too often result in delayed or denied care.

“The House has an opportunity to take a clear step toward fixing what’s broken,” Vick added. “HR-6703 builds on recent reforms that put patients first and moves us closer to a system where Americans, not Washington, make their own health care decisions.”

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services should consolidate its scanning contracts to boost its records digitization efforts. That’s one recommendation from the USCIS ombudsman’s latest annual report. It also said USCIS needs to standardize its scanning operations to ensure documents are appropriately tagged with searchable metadata. The report touts how artificial intelligence could help the agency create fully searchable records. USCIS has been on a years-long journey to digitize its records, but it still manages approximately 171 million paper files.

Agencies will soon see a more streamlined process when giving bonuses to their employees. The Office of Personnel Management is transferring the approval process for pay incentives off of its own plate, and instead making it the responsibility of individual agencies. The goal is to make it easier to offer bonuses to employees, and free up time for OPM to focus on other priorities. Despite the process change, OPM said it “does not know” if agencies will actually offer more recruitment or relocation incentives as a result. The final rule implementing the changes comes after OPM first proposed regulations in 2023.

A new “Tech Force” hiring program from the Trump administration seeks to bring more technical expertise into the government’s ranks. The Office of Personnel Management said the new program will recruit 1,000 employees, for two years each, to work on IT modernization projects at various agencies. The new hiring initiative comes after more than 300,000 employees left government this year, due to the Trump administration’s efforts to reduce the workforce.

The future of the Federal Emergency Management Agency is up in the air after a turbulent year. Former FEMA leaders said the agency needs clarity to move forward. Last week, the Trump administration delayed the release of the FEMA Review Council’s recommendations. Speaking at an event on Monday, former FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor said the report was going to serve as a “north star” for the agency. “It was going to offer predictability to FEMA and to the entire emergency management enterprise that we were going to go somewhere transformative. And it hasn't happened, at least not yet. And I guess the biggest takeaway is, without the report, what happens next?” Gaynor said. White House officials canceled a scheduled FEMA Review Council meeting at the last minute on Friday. The council had been scheduled to vote on a draft of its final report.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is exploring workarounds to stricter rules on telework as a reasonable accommodation. CDC supervisors have instructed staff to email their medical documentation directly to Lynda Chapman, the agency’s chief operating officer, to “bypass” the traditional reasonable accommodation system. Chapman will decide if employees are eligible for 30 days of telework as an interim accommodation. Two CDC employees told Federal News Network that Chapman is only approving interim telework in a few circumstances, including recovery from surgery, pregnancy or chemotherapy.

Naval Hospital Okinawa, Japan Comm: 011-81-971-7024 DSN: (315) 646-7024 isaac.s.savitz.civ@health.mil","CAMP FOSTER, Japan — Providing health care to the nearly 55,000-person beneficiary population and the 188,768-person Western Pacific-eligible referral population in Okinawa presents unique challenges.

One challenge for an overseas medical treatment facility (MTF) is staffing medical specialties that may not see the same workload or complexity of cases as stateside MTFs.

The Defense Health Agency (DHA) and Navy Medicine have devised a creative solution by rotating neurosurgeons at U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa. Each provider spends about four months in Okinawa, providing critical, life-saving care.

Dr. Michael Lawless, a visiting neurosurgeon from Naval Medical Center San Diego, decided to proactively seek out cases. Because Okinawa has fewer causes of major trauma, such as high-speed roads and firearms, the daily caseload can be light. Lawless brought relief to many patients who were hesitant about undergoing traditional spinal surgery.

Spinal surgeries can have varied results, sometimes leading to more pain, long recovery times, and severe side effects. Lawless introduced another option for patients: a minimally invasive endoscopic procedure. This is becoming a routine procedure that relieves pinched-nerve sciatica resulting from spinal decompression.

The endoscope allows the physician to be more precise than in a more invasive open surgery. The department already has an endoscope, so there is little to no extra cost. The surgery also provided additional training for the hospital corpsman assigned to neurosurgery. HM3 Alyssa Clayton was able to scrub in and assist Dr. Lawless during the procedure.

The minimally invasive procedure allows rotating neurosurgeons to maintain a steady workload of two to three cases a week. It provides relief for patients suffering from sciatic nerve pain and allows for a dramatically quick recovery. One patient rated their pain as zero out of 10 while in the recovery room. This approach enables people to return to work much faster and keeps costs down by avoiding off-island medical evacuations.

While at the hospital, Lawless performed the first endoscopic laminectomy on the island. A laminectomy is a surgical procedure that removes a portion of the bony roof of the spine, called the lamina, to relieve pressure on the spinal cord or nerves. The patient had an excellent result with immediate relief of leg pain and did not require any narcotic pain medication.

This surgery has the same benefits as an endoscopic microdiscectomy: smaller incisions, less trauma to muscle and soft tissues resulting in less postoperative pain, and fewer complications and infections. This allows the procedure to be performed in an outpatient setting so patients can go home the same day.

According to a recent randomized controlled study in the British Medical Journal, endoscopic spine surgery was more cost-effective and provided better pain relief than traditional open surgery for sciatica, even one year after surgery. The study noted that the endoscopic approach resulted in savings of over $3,000 in direct health care costs and indirect lost productivity costs at one year after surgery.

A recent survey of elite athletes in the journal World Neurosurgery found an 81 percent return-to-play rate at 5.2 to 8.7 months after traditional open and tubular minimally invasive surgery. In contrast, endoscopic spine surgery produced an average 88 percent return-to-play rate at three months.

Creative staffing and innovative thinking allow patients at U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa to benefit from a less invasive surgery that relieves their pain, while allowing visiting doctors to maintain their surgical skills. It is a win for all involved and another way the people who make up the Defense Health Agency maintain a medically ready force by being a ready medical force.

The U.S. Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command Okinawa (USNMRTCO) supports the Defense Health Agency's U.S. Naval Hospital, Okinawa (USNHO) as the largest OCONUS Navy Medicine medical treatment facility and stands at the ready to respond to contingency operations to support the INDOPACOM region. It is a critical regional asset for direct care delivery, regional referrals, and medical contingency operations. The staff of USNHO understands their vital role as pre-positioned, forward-deployed naval forces within the first island chain, aligned and in support of the joint military commands and operations.

Joseph Ignatius Martin joined the U.S. Army in 1918, he began a military career that spanned 37 years, becoming one of the most influential leaders in military medicine. In 1958, the Martin Army Community Hospital, an iconic 10-story structure known as “the Old Hospital” in Fort Benning, Georgia, was dedicated in his honor.

Through his dedicated service during World War II in North Africa and Italy, and as an educator for the next generation of military medical leaders, Martin transformed how the U.S. Army trains its medical forces and treats its wounded on the battlefield — and the hospital honors these accomplishments through delivery of award-winning health care today.

Early focus on education, global service

Born Feb. 1, 1894, in Chicago, he earned his medical degree from the Chicago Medical College of the University of Illinois in 1918. That same year, he entered the U.S. Army Medical Corps Reserve as a first lieutenant, according to documents provided by the Army Medical Corps.

Early postings took him from Fort Riley, Kansas, to Camp Grant, Illinois, where he worked as a ward surgeon during the U.S. Army’s demobilization after World War I. He served overseas at Sternberg General Hospital in Manila, Philippines, building clinical and leadership experience that would later prove invaluable.

A lifelong student, Martin took every opportunity to learn while graduating from the Army Medical School, the Medical Field Service School, the Infantry School, the Command and General Staff College, and the Army War College.

Educating future military medical force

In 1940, Martin was assigned to design and build the Medical Department Replacement Training Center at Camp Grant, Illinois. His work shaped wartime training that prepared doctors, nurses, and medics for global conflict.

In August 1946, he became deputy commandant and, later, commandant of the Medical Field Service School at Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, Texas. During his six-year tenure, he transformed the curriculum, introducing new comprehensive programs in field medicine, leadership, and combat casualty care that became benchmarks for modern medical readiness.

As noted in The Military Surgeon, the journal of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States, Martin said, “At our schools, we aim to pass on to the younger group of medical officers that same torch of responsibility, with the hope that if World War III comes, the medical department will have in its ranks medical officers who are trained and capable of acting competently as medical leaders in the field.”

Medical innovation in peacetime and on the battlefield

He believed the military medical system should continually seek ways to enhance readiness, stating in The Military Surgeon, “We must continue to prepare ourselves by keeping abreast of technical developments for waging war … the specialty of military field medicine is not gained in a week or a year but requires a foundation of formal education and long experience to master.”

Martin’s work in field medicine improving evacuation procedures, sanitation controls, and mobile hospitals in combat conditions are “reflected in our modern system of training, management and employment of medical personnel, units and installations in peace and in war,” stated in an Aero Medical Association publication provided by provided by the Army Medical Corps.

International deployments on his rise to military medical leader

In 1943, he deployed to North Africa as chief surgeon of the Fifth Army, leading medical operations across campaigns in North Africa and Italy, according to his biography provided by the Office of the U.S. Army Surgeon General.

In July 1945, he was transferred to the Pacific to become chief surgeon of Army Forces Western Pacific, with headquarters at Manila, Philippines. For his leadership and innovation during wartime, he was promoted to brigadier general in 1944 and major general in 1949.

As chief surgeon of Allied Forces Pacific in Tokyo, he directed large-scale disease control efforts during postwar typhus epidemics, preventing what could have been “one of the world’s largest medical catastrophes,” according to a biography written by Army 1st Lt. George Kauffman in 1967.

In 1953, Martin was appointed surgeon of U.S. Army, Europe, overseeing postwar hospital operations, preventive medicine, and troop health programs that supported American forces across the continent.

Colleagues described his leadership and vision as innovative. “He developed many of the medical practices that became, and have remained, standard procedures for our Army Medical Service,” noted a 1955 profile in Military Medicine, a publication of the Aero Medical Association.

Legacy carries on at MACH with quality patient care

Among his many honors and decorations are the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the French Croix de Guerre, the Order of the British Empire, the Italian Order of the Crown, and numerous other awards in recognition of his long and distinguished service worldwide.

After retiring in November 1955, Martin settled in Santa Rosa, California, where he died on April 13, 1957. He was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery.

In 2014, the “Old Hospital” was replaced by 500-million-dollar facility with sustainable features and cutting- edge technology, still carrying the name of the military medical pioneer.

MACH continues to honor Martin’s namesake through quality, safe patient care. In 2024 and 2025, the hospital earned an “A” grade for hospital safety by the Leapfrog Group, an independent organization that focuses on health care quality.

“Health care providers should be able to focus on their patients.
“To ensure the warfighter is fit to fight tonight, the Military Health System needs to operate as efficiently as possible.
Previously, our health care providers renewed their privileges every two years.
Health care providers will also remain subject to the adverse action protocols at the setting in which they are practicing.","The Military Health System recently streamlined the provider-privileging process to allow health care providers to seamlessly transfer their privileges between MHS entities with minimal interruption to patient care duties. This change results in reduced administrative burden and increased patient access.

As of Oct. 15, 2025, health care providers retain their clinical privileges when moving within the enterprise, including across stateside and overseas military hospitals, clinics, and deployed settings.

“Health care providers should be able to focus on their patients. With portable privileges, they can do so more quickly,” said Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of war for Health Affairs.

Provider privileging promotes quality care

Provider privileging is a key component of maintaining the highest quality and safety of care we deliver in the MHS. Clinical privileges define a provider’s scope of practice and are based on factors such as relevant training and experience, current competence, health status, and judgment, and peer and department head recommendations.

Under the previous system, providers were required to complete a privileging action each time they transferred to different care settings, adding additional time to the process before providers could render care. With the expanded policy, when transferring between MHS entities, health care providers sign an attestation for an approved scope of work, eliminating the need for a privileging action or transfer briefing and allowing the provider to focus on patient care.

More effective privileging means accelerated care

Ferrara said that removing obstacles and barriers allows providers to do what they are passionate about — treating patients.

This supports mission readiness by reducing delays in patient care, Ferrara said. “To ensure the warfighter is fit to fight tonight, the Military Health System needs to operate as efficiently as possible. After moving to another facility, this allows our providers to start seeing patients right away instead of waiting weeks or even months to repeat this process.”

“Enterprise-wide privileging is just one of many efforts to make the Military Health System more agile. Previously, our health care providers renewed their privileges every two years. With this expanded policy, we have extended the renewal window to three years to reduce their administrative load,” said Ferrara.

The rigorous process of acquiring privileges remains the same, and there are no changes about the quality assurance of the credentialing standards for health care providers. Health care providers will also remain subject to the adverse action protocols at the setting in which they are practicing.

The new policy spearheads faster, more flexible operations as the MHS remains committed to excellence in care by enabling a ready medical force.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2502/8888359/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-12-16 16:56:55.874466

Read the Prior Authorization form Anxious-Inspector-18 posted. Print it out. Fill it out. Be prepared to discuss those things with your Tricare PCM.

For example, on question 9 where it says ""the patient has been engaged in behavioral modification and dietary restriction for at least 6 months and has failed to achieve the desired weight loss,"" I went in with a graph of my weight over the last 25+ years and cold clearly explain that I could lose weight relatively quickly for about 4 months at a time, but then would gain it back. He could see multiple attempts and I could describe my attempts. For contraindications I could point those out so he didn't have to go searching through my record.

Bottom line: make it so easy for your doctor they're glad to help you.

Here's the Tricare prior authorization form from April 2025. Make sure you skip over questions when it says to! (For instance, #3 is only for 12-17 year olds.)

There may be a newer PA, or one specific to your plan, but this at least gives you an idea of what you might be dealing with.

You might also confirm with Tricare who is eligible to prescribe. They might require an in network provider.

I do! Your PCM will have to put through a prior authorization to express scripts, but as long as they have all the info they need it’s usually a quick process. I’ve had palpitation issues which was noted in my chart, so my doc checked the box that I had a contraindication to trying the cheaper weight loss meds (stimulants). They didn’t ask for anything further and my prior auth was approved the next day. I’m not sure how it works with Tricare as a secondary though. I’ve always been told your primary insurance would be billed first and then Tricare would pick up the remainder of the tab (not entirely sure of the nuances with that).

I have Prime and got it approved. I am on meds for hypothyroid as well, since 2018. My bmi was like 28 or something so I assume that is how I got the approval. I don't have high blood pressure or diabetes or sleep apnea so he wouldn't have indicated that. He did put me on phentermine for 6 months prior to this, and it worked for a bit but then it stopped working. Maybe that helped?",,N,-1.0,2025-12-16 22:56:52.723892
