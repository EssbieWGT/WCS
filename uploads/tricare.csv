While the Marine Corps maintains that fraud isn’t a widespread issue, it does seem to be more prevalent in areas facing the toughest recruiting challenges.

The overarching theme reveals a systemic challenge within the Marine Corps recruitment framework, where the drive for high enlistment numbers often places ethical considerations in precarious balance.","Recruiting efforts for the Marine Corps in certain regions of the United States, particularly the Rust Belt, have faced significant challenges, culminating in reports of widespread fraudulent practices among recruiters. A recent investigation by Business Insider into the 4th Marine Corps District has uncovered alarming instances of rule-breaking, including the use of forged police records and fake medical documentation.

Interviews with two recruiters who were dismissed due to their involvement in these activities reveal the intense pressures faced by staff. One of the former recruiters, Staff Sgt. Calvin Grimes, provided insight into the tactics employed within the recruiting environment, including the creation of electronic templates used to forge a variety of documents such as medical clearances and diplomas. He described the internal turmoil of having to engage in deceit, stating, “You have to live with that feeling that your heart’s beating out of your chest ready to explode.”

The investigation highlighted that of the ten Marines in the field between 2018 and 2024, five admitted to engaging in unethical practices to meet their monthly goal of enlisting two new recruits. The pressures intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic, which posed further complications in reaching potential candidates as traditional recruiting avenues were disrupted.

Moreover, the introduction of the Military Health System Genesis created additional hurdles for recruiters. This medical data system flagged applicants for minor issues that could lead to extended delays in the enlistment process. As a result, recruiters felt compelled to expedite applications through unethical means, like forging documents to bypass these obstacles.

The culture surrounding recruitment pressures was vividly illustrated by former Gunnery Sgt. Logan Krivak, who, during his tenure in the Marines, faced the fraught dynamics of an amped-up demand to deliver results amid overwhelming stress. Reflecting on his experience, Krivak noted that the environment had shifted over time, leading some to question the integrity of their work. His own experience with faking a required police document led to an investigation and ultimate dismissal, which he stated left him feeling conflicted about the morality of his actions versus the expectations set by his superiors.

Grimes echoed these sentiments, revealing that from the very beginning of his recruiting career, there was an implicit acceptance of bending the rules. “You have to do what you have to do to be successful,” his supervisor had encouraged, contributing to a cycle of dishonesty that seemed to normalize rule-breaking as a necessary means to an end.

While the Marine Corps maintains that fraud isn’t a widespread issue, it does seem to be more prevalent in areas facing the toughest recruiting challenges. Some current and former recruiters confirmed that they had not witnessed fraudulent practices, although they did acknowledge that those working under immense pressure sometimes succumbed to temptation.

Addressing the situation, a Marine Corps Recruiting Command spokesman stated that they have mechanisms in place to monitor and mitigate fraud. This includes conducting thorough quality control checks throughout the enlistment process and reviewing records rigorously when recruits arrive at boot camp. However, recruiters have indicated that while progress has been made since the pandemic—particularly in streamlining the waiver process and expanding recruiting hubs—the fundamental issue of pressure to meet quotas remains a significant concern.

The overarching theme reveals a systemic challenge within the Marine Corps recruitment framework, where the drive for high enlistment numbers often places ethical considerations in precarious balance. As recruiters continue to navigate this complex landscape, there is an ongoing debate about how best to meet recruitment goals without compromising integrity.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Marine-Recruiters-Resort-to-Fraud-Amidst-Intense-Quota-Pressures-in.jpeg,N,0.0,2026-01-05 14:56:37.003837

For government contractors supporting health IT, enterprise systems integration and digital transformation, the FEHRM fireside chat at the 2025 Healthcare Summit is expected to be one of the most consequential conversations on the agenda.

Why Should GovCons Pay Attention to FEHRM Now?

The Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization program has moved decisively beyond initial deployment and into a phase defined by optimization, interoperability and future capability delivery, with MHS GENESIS now fully deployed across the Military Health System.

With the common federal EHR in place, FEHRM’s focus has shifted toward enhancing performance, integrating user feedback and enabling advanced capabilities, including artificial intelligence, virtual care and data-driven clinical decision support. These efforts are central to how the Military Health System is rethinking care delivery, not only in hospitals and clinics, but also in deployed and contested environments.

For government contractors, this transition signals sustained demand for expertise in system optimization, analytics, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, AI enablement and legacy system retirement. As FEHRM works to ensure the EHR can support real-time data sharing from battlefield settings to stateside facilities and veteran care environments, industry partners will play a critical role in helping the platform scale, adapt and remain resilient.

The Healthcare Summit fireside chat offers GovCons a rare opportunity to hear directly from FEHRM leadership about how requirements are evolving now that MHS GENESIS is operational, and where industry support will be most impactful in the next phase of modernization.

Who Is Bill Tinston?

Bill Tinston serves as director of the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization office, overseeing the implementation and continued evolution of a single, common federal EHR across multiple agencies.

Tinston brings more than 30 years of experience in defense acquisition, enterprise IT and portfolio management. He previously served as program executive officer for the Program Executive Office, Defense Healthcare Management Systems, where he led deployment of the Department of War’s EHR and worked closely with VA and the Coast Guard to align systems and workflows.

Before joining PEO DHMS, Tinston held senior executive roles at the Defense Logistics Agency, including program executive officer, where he oversaw major automated information systems and served as milestone decision authority for enterprise programs.

He holds a bachelor’s in business and information systems, is Defense Acquisition University Level III-certified in program management and information technology, and has received honors including the DLA Meritorious Civilian Service Award.

Tinston has consistently emphasized the importance of EHR systems that support clinical and operational decision-making without allowing IT constraints to dictate outcomes, a theme expected to feature prominently in the summit discussion.

Who Is Cori Hughes?

Cori Hughes serves as director of program integration for the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization office and also holds the same role for the Program Executive Office, Defense Healthcare Management Systems.

In these positions, Hughes manages FEHRM’s cross-cutting integration efforts, including communications, government affairs, risk and issue management, integrated scheduling and performance optimization across federal stakeholders.

She also oversees public and government affairs activities for PEO DHMS, including congressional engagement, audit coordination and external communications related to EHR modernization.

Before joining FEHRM, Hughes supported senior leaders across the Department of War as a contractor, including within the Defense Health Agency and offices responsible for health affairs, acquisition and sustainment and personnel and readiness.

What Will the FEHRM Fireside Chat Cover?

At the 2025 Healthcare Summit, Tinston and Hughes’ fireside chat will explore how FEHRM leaders are building on the full deployment of MHS GENESIS to support a more connected, technology-enabled Military Health System.

Discussion topics are expected to include how the federal EHR is enabling virtual care, real-time consultation and advanced data sharing, including deployed and theater-specific use cases where specialists can support frontline medics remotely. The conversation will also address how FEHRM is preparing the EHR environment to support AI-driven tools, reduce administrative burden for providers and improve continuity of care as service members transition from active duty to veteran status.

Hubby works as a mechanic technician for the army. Unfortunately, his salary disqualifies him from Tricare so he is on a healthcare plan with SelectHealth through his job. It seems to take a decent amount out of his check and benefits are so/so.

I'm currently on my parents insurance but I turn 26 in a few months so I'll be kicked off at that point. I will also be finishing a limited term internship the same month as my birthday so I will (hopefully) be transitioning to a new job around that same time that will be full time and likely offer benefits.

As a military spouse should I just get on Tricare and not sign up for any healthcare plans through my employer? Are Tricare benefits and cost typically better than what I could be offered through other major healthcare insurance providers?

I also have to consider that hubby and I want to have kids within a couple years and I've heard that Tricare is really good for families including covering all delivery costs at the hospital etc. Also, I might have some employment gaps so I can stay at home once I start having kids.

There is also, of course, the option of getting added onto my husband's healthcare plan with SelectHealth. Not sure if that will somehow be cheaper or easier than me being on Tricare separate from him but obviously I want the best coverage I can get.

What would y'all recommend I do at this point?",,N,0.0,2026-01-04 00:12:03.928486

The births of these little ones mark a special moment for both sets of proud parents and the dedicated staff at TAMC. Col. William Bimson, commander of TAMC, along with department leadership, visited the parents to present baby gift baskets for the new arrivals, celebrating their milestones and offering support as they begin their journey of parenthood.

The first baby of the year, a boy, was born at 5:16 a.m. on Jan. 1 to U.S. Army Capt. Henry Zenger, a current graduate student at of the University of Hawaii, and U.S. Army Capt. Cecelia Zenger, a social work intern at TAMC. The couple arrived in Oahu in October 2024 and is thrilled to welcome their second child to the family.

The second baby, a girl, was born at 5:49 a.m. on Jan. 1 to Pfc. LaShawn Brabham, an infantry soldier with the 25th Infantry Division at Schofield Barracks, and his wife, Kayla Brabham. The couple arrived in Oahu in May 2025 and is excited to add their second child to the family.

Reflecting on their experiences at TAMC, both couples shared their positive thoughts about the physicians, nurses, and staff in the Mother Baby Unit:

“The support from the staff made all the difference, and we couldn’t be more grateful,” Henry Zenger said. “New year, new baby, let’s go!”

""I had a fast birth. It was four minutes, and I couldn’t have done it without my amazing nurse, Leilani Jimenez,” Kayla Brabham said.

“It’s always a privilege to be part of such a special moment for families,” Dr. Jonathon Yu, a family medicine physician at TAMC, said. “Seeing the joy on the parents' faces when they meet their babies for the first time is what makes our work so rewarding.”

“Every birth story is unique, and being able to support families through this journey is an honor,” Taylor Dusa, an attending registered nurse, said.” We’re thrilled to welcome two beautiful lives into the world.”

TAMC is a vital center for maternal care, delivering approximately 1,289 babies each year. The facility serves military families stationed in Hawaii and supports the entire Indo-Pacific region, including active-duty personnel, their dependents, and eligible beneficiaries from various branches of the military.

TAMC's Labor and Delivery Unit is equipped with state-of-the-art technology, ensuring comprehensive prenatal care, labor support, and postnatal care for mothers and babies. The services offered at TAMC include:

Comprehensive prenatal and postnatal care

Labor support services

Specialized care for high-risk pregnancies

Neonatal intensive care for premature or ill infants

In addition to medical services, TAMC engages with the local community through various programs aimed at supporting new parents. These include parenting classes and support groups focused on maternal health and wellness.

Take these steps to avoid some common trouble spots, and check out this TRICARE.mil article for even more details:

Address Changes

You’ll want to ensure the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) has your new residence on file. Update your contact information via the ID Card Office Online or call DEERS at (800) 538-9552. Note: You cannot use a post office box as your DEERS address.

You’ll also need to update your address with Express Scripts to use the TRICARE Pharmacy Program. You can update your information online or by calling Express Scripts at (877) 363-1303.

Finally, update your address with the Social Security Administration, which handles Medicare processing.

Plan Changes

You will retain your Medicare and TRICARE For Life benefits in your new location, but keep these potential changes in mind:

If you’ve signed up for a Medicare Advantage Plan (MAP, or Medicare Part C) and you move out of that plan’s coverage area, you can enroll in a new MAP or revert to Original Medicare coverage during a special enrollment period.

Moving overseas? TRICARE For Life becomes your primary payer for TRICARE-covered services unless you have other health insurance. Note: You must continue to pay Medicare Part B premiums to use TRICARE For Life. Contact International SOS to find a provider or learn more about overseas care options.

Family members using TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select who move with you will be eligible to change their coverage, as the move counts as a Qualifying Life Event.
