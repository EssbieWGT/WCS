Your Prime copays, along with cost-sharing, remain consistent whether you choose standard TRICARE Prime or join the demonstration.
The 2026 TRICARE changes aren’t seismic, but they are significant.","Like tectonic plates, TRICARE is shifting again. If you’re a military spouse or family member trying to keep track of what’s changing and what it means for your family’s actual care, it might feel like a 7.5 earthquake. Between coverage adjustments in 2025 and the launch of a new demonstration project in 2026, the headlines may not always clearly explain how these moves impact day-to-day access, costs, and peace of mind. However, this community has been addressing this issue for a long time.

So let’s break it down, in plain language, from the perspective of the people who will feel it most: the families.

What Changed in 2025

Related: 6 dumb things I thought I knew about the military before joining

Some changes already hit in 2025. TRICARE Young Adult coverage now ends at age 21 unless a dependent is a full-time student, in which case it stretches to age 23. Survivors of deceased service members gained additional benefits, including more time in Prime and extended access to transitional coverage.

TRICARE regions also shifted. If your address placed you under a new regional contractor, you may have noticed differences in customer service, networks, or claims processing. Those changes are structural, but the next round is about choice.

Coming in 2026: The TRICARE Prime Demonstration

Beginning in January 2026, the Defense Health Agency is launching a pilot program in two metro areas: Tampa, Florida, and Atlanta, Georgia. This program, formally called the TRICARE Prime Demonstration, allows eligible dependents to opt into coverage administered by CareSource Military & Veterans (CSMV), rather than the standard regional contractor.

This doesn’t replace TRICARE Prime nationwide. It’s not even automatic for families in those regions. You must enroll in the demo to participate, and enrollment opens during TRICARE’s annual open season.

The goal is to test whether a different contractor can offer improved access and expanded support services while maintaining the same high levels of care, all while adhering to the Prime cost structure. But many families are understandably cautious when they hear the words “pilot” or “demonstration.”

Will they still be covered in the event of an emergency? Can they see their existing providers? Will it cost more?

Emergency Care Under the Demo: What Families Need to Know

This is where intricacy matters most. Some reporting has left families confused about how emergency care will work if they opt into the new demo. Let’s be specific:

If you think it’s an emergency, go to the nearest ER, military or civilian, immediately. No referral or pre-authorization is required.

That’s true under traditional TRICARE Prime; it remains true for CareSource enrollees in the demo as well. Even if the emergency department is out of network, you will be covered at the standard Prime cost-share, as long as the visit meets TRICARE’s definition of an emergency.

The process of filing claims or following up on bills remains the same. CSMV may administer the plan, but it follows the same emergency care rules as the broader TRICARE Prime program.

Why CareSource? Why now?

CareSource isn’t new to managed care by any means. It has a long history with Medicaid within veteran populations and is now being tested in military health. The 2026 demo presents an opportunity for the Defense Health Agency to assess alternative approaches to managing care while preserving existing benefits within its areas of operation.

For families, this could mean better support, more streamlined customer service, and access to providers who may not currently be part of TRICARE’s traditional network. But these are potential benefits, not promises; it’s up to each family to weigh whether opting in makes sense.

What Doesn’t Change

Your DEERS enrollment still governs eligibility. Your Prime copays, along with cost-sharing, remain consistent whether you choose standard TRICARE Prime or join the demonstration. Your right to emergency care doesn’t simply vanish either. Your ability to return to regular Prime? Not a problem if done during future open seasons; this remains in effect.

What to Watch For

If you live in Tampa or Atlanta and receive notice that you’re eligible for the demo, read it carefully. Compare what’s being offered against what you already use. If you have specialists you depend on, call them directly to see if they’re part of the demo network. There are no referrals for in-network specialists. If you join the CareSource Prime Demonstration, and your current specialist is out-of-network, CareSource has a team of specialists that will work with your specialist to bring them in-network.

Most importantly, CareSource will cover a beneficiary’s out-of-network fees to continue seeing the specialist over the first 90 days, ensuring the beneficiary has a seamless experience, while CSMV handles the lift in the background.

Now if you still have questions, press for answers from TRICARE, CareSource, or your local military treatment facility; they will be there for you.

Health care isn’t just about policies; it’s about trust. That’s especially true for families managing moves, deployments, plus everything in between. The 2026 TRICARE changes aren’t seismic, but they are significant. Knowing the facts and being prepared before making a choice is the best decision you can make for your care.

Your Prime copays, along with cost-sharing, remain consistent whether you choose standard TRICARE Prime or join the demonstration.
The 2026 TRICARE changes aren’t seismic, but they are significant.","Like tectonic plates, TRICARE is shifting again. If you’re a military spouse or family member trying to keep track of what’s changing and what it means for your family’s actual care, it might feel like a 7.5 earthquake. Between coverage adjustments in 2025 and the launch of a new demonstration project in 2026, the headlines may not always clearly explain how these moves impact day-to-day access, costs, and peace of mind. However, this community has been addressing this issue for a long time.

So let’s break it down, in plain language, from the perspective of the people who will feel it most: the families.

What Changed in 2025

Related: 6 dumb things I thought I knew about the military before joining

Some changes already hit in 2025. TRICARE Young Adult coverage now ends at age 21 unless a dependent is a full-time student, in which case it stretches to age 23. Survivors of deceased service members gained additional benefits, including more time in Prime and extended access to transitional coverage.

TRICARE regions also shifted. If your address placed you under a new regional contractor, you may have noticed differences in customer service, networks, or claims processing. Those changes are structural, but the next round is about choice.

Coming in 2026: The TRICARE Prime Demonstration

Beginning in January 2026, the Defense Health Agency is launching a pilot program in two metro areas: Tampa, Florida, and Atlanta, Georgia. This program, formally called the TRICARE Prime Demonstration, allows eligible dependents to opt into coverage administered by CareSource Military & Veterans (CSMV), rather than the standard regional contractor.

This doesn’t replace TRICARE Prime nationwide. It’s not even automatic for families in those regions. You must enroll in the demo to participate, and enrollment opens during TRICARE’s annual open season.

The goal is to test whether a different contractor can offer improved access and expanded support services while maintaining the same high levels of care, all while adhering to the Prime cost structure. But many families are understandably cautious when they hear the words “pilot” or “demonstration.”

Will they still be covered in the event of an emergency? Can they see their existing providers? Will it cost more?

Emergency Care Under the Demo: What Families Need to Know

This is where intricacy matters most. Some reporting has left families confused about how emergency care will work if they opt into the new demo. Let’s be specific:

If you think it’s an emergency, go to the nearest ER, military or civilian, immediately. No referral or pre-authorization is required.

That’s true under traditional TRICARE Prime; it remains true for CareSource enrollees in the demo as well. Even if the emergency department is out of network, you will be covered at the standard Prime cost-share, as long as the visit meets TRICARE’s definition of an emergency.

The process of filing claims or following up on bills remains the same. CSMV may administer the plan, but it follows the same emergency care rules as the broader TRICARE Prime program.

Why CareSource? Why now?

CareSource isn’t new to managed care by any means. It has a long history with Medicaid within veteran populations and is now being tested in military health. The 2026 demo presents an opportunity for the Defense Health Agency to assess alternative approaches to managing care while preserving existing benefits within its areas of operation.

For families, this could mean better support, more streamlined customer service, and access to providers who may not currently be part of TRICARE’s traditional network. But these are potential benefits, not promises; it’s up to each family to weigh whether opting in makes sense.

What Doesn’t Change

Your DEERS enrollment still governs eligibility. Your Prime copays, along with cost-sharing, remain consistent whether you choose standard TRICARE Prime or join the demonstration. Your right to emergency care doesn’t simply vanish either. Your ability to return to regular Prime? Not a problem if done during future open seasons; this remains in effect.

What to Watch For

If you live in Tampa or Atlanta and receive notice that you’re eligible for the demo, read it carefully. Compare what’s being offered against what you already use. If you have specialists you depend on, call them directly to see if they’re part of the demo network. There are no referrals for in-network specialists. If you join the CareSource Prime Demonstration, and your current specialist is out-of-network, CareSource has a team of specialists that will work with your specialist to bring them in-network.

Most importantly, CareSource will cover a beneficiary’s out-of-network fees to continue seeing the specialist over the first 90 days, ensuring the beneficiary has a seamless experience, while CSMV handles the lift in the background.

Now if you still have questions, press for answers from TRICARE, CareSource, or your local military treatment facility; they will be there for you.

Health care isn’t just about policies; it’s about trust. That’s especially true for families managing moves, deployments, plus everything in between. The 2026 TRICARE changes aren’t seismic, but they are significant. Knowing the facts and being prepared before making a choice is the best decision you can make for your care.

Subscribe now and take control of your AI investment future!","We came across a bullish thesis on GRAIL, Inc. on Value investing subreddit by BombasticBillionaire. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on GRAL. GRAIL, Inc.’s share was trading at $86.41 as of October 16th.

Grail (GRAL) is emerging as a leader in multi-cancer early detection (MCED) with its Galleri blood test, which leverages machine learning on DNA methylation patterns to detect signals from over 50 cancer types, including hard-to-screen cancers like pancreatic and ovarian. The company, originally acquired by Illumina for $8 billion in 2020, was spun off in June 2024 due to antitrust concerns, with Illumina retaining a 14.5% stake.

The spin-off began with approximately $930 million in cash, providing Grail roughly two years of operational runway. Galleri has already demonstrated promising results in the PATHFINDER study and is undergoing validation in two large-scale trials—the NHS-Galleri study with 140,000 participants and PATHFINDER II, which includes over 35,000 Medicare enrollees—expected to report key outcomes between 2025 and 2026.

Supporting its adoption, the VA’s REFLECTION study and TRICARE coverage for older, at-risk members reinforce the test’s clinical potential. If these trials confirm effectiveness and Medicare reimbursement follows, Galleri could achieve annual sales of $2–3 billion, representing a substantial upside relative to Grail’s current sub-$1 billion valuation.

While the opportunity is compelling, the stock remains a high-risk, binary biotech play contingent on clinical and regulatory validation. Investors are positioned for significant potential gains if Grail successfully transitions from promising trials to broad clinical adoption, with Medicare coverage serving as a pivotal catalyst to unlock value.

Previously we covered a bullish thesis on GRAIL, Inc. (GRAL) by mike-some in April 2025, which highlighted its leadership in multi-cancer early detection, promising trial results, and potential Medicare-driven $2.25 billion sales. The company’s stock price has appreciated approximately by 233% since our coverage. The thesis still stands as trials progress. BombasticBillionaire shares a similar thesis but emphasizes updated cash runway, larger trial sizes, and $2–3 billion potential sales.

GRAIL, Inc. is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 28 hedge fund portfolios held GRAL at the end of the second quarter which was 25 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of GRAL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GRAL and that has 10,000% upside potential, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.

Disclosure: None.

When Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

This prediction might not be bold at all:

A few years from now, you’ll wish you’d owned this stock.

The best part? You can discover everything about this company and its groundbreaking technology right now.

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

This program has provided Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy to children with autism in military families since 2014. After years of study, the report calls for significant changes that could make access to ABA easier, more consistent, and less stressful for families.

The committee’s most important recommendation is that the Defense Health Agency (DHA) should end the ACD and make ABA a basic TRICARE benefit. This would mean ABA is recognized as a medically necessary service, just like speech, occupational, or physical therapy, and would be covered under standard TRICARE benefits rather than through a special demonstration program.

The report also urges DHA to stop requiring unnecessary assessments such as the PDDBI, Vineland-3, and SRS, which have added time and stress for families and providers. It recommends reducing administrative barriers that make it harder to start or continue services and allowing ABA providers more flexibility to meet each child’s individual needs. NASEM also encourages TRICARE to permit ABA services in all appropriate settings, including schools and community environments, where children can best learn and generalize their skills.

These changes would bring TRICARE policies in line with what is already standard practice across most states and insurance plans.

At Butterfly Effects, we strongly support these recommendations. Every child deserves access to high-quality ABA services, and every parent deserves a process that supports rather than complicates their child’s care.

I was involved in an accident in 2024, and was not at fault. The at fault driver’s insurance adjuster (from Allstate) reached out to TRICARE to handle the lien process for third party liability. It’s been about two months, and we still haven’t heard anything back at all from TRICARE.

I’ve tried figuring out who to contact directly, but I’m getting conflicting info about whether it goes through TRICARE West or Carol R Darnall AMC. I’m active duty and the incident happened in Texas.

Does anyone know: • Which office or contact handles third party liability liens for active-duty service members? • Is there a specific phone number or email for the Medical Cost Recovery Office or TPO (Third Party Office)? • Any tips on how to actually get a response from them?

The monthlong open enrollment period is scheduled for Nov. 10-Dec. 9. During open enrollment, or open season, beneficiaries may make changes to their Tricare coverage for the upcoming year. Tricare users who want to keep the same coverage don’t need to do anything during open enrollment.

However, the Defense Health Agency announced that some Tricare services are suspended or may be delayed during the shutdown, including the potential for delayed or cancelled outpatient appointments at military hospitals.

The agency, which administers Tricare, published a tracker to communicate service delays or interruptions.

As of Oct. 22, for inpatient services including surgeries, the agency reported: “No changes for now. Contact your provider to confirm any procedures you have scheduled.”

But the shutdown had affected Tricare’s ability to pay claims; the Tricare Prime Travel Benefit, which reimburses Prime members for certain travel costs to reach a provider; administrative actions such as appeals and other determinations; and potentially outpatient appointments and pharmacy hours at military hospitals.

Claims: “Tricare may not be able to process or pay medical claims for services received on or after Oct. 1, 2025, until funding is restored,” according to the tracker.

Tricare Prime Travel Benefit: “Not available. If you must travel for care, save your receipts, and you may file for reimbursement for reasonable travel expenses for a qualified trip.”

Administrative actions: “Government administrative actions” such as “appeals, line of duty determinations, and grievances, may be delayed or paused due to staffing levels.”

Military hospital outpatient visits, including for labs and for primary and specialty appointments: “There may be changes in hours or services. Your hospital or clinic will contact you if they must cancel an appointment. Contact your military hospital or clinic to confirm sick call or walk-in clinic hours.”

How to Change Tricare Coverage During Open Enrollment

Tricare beneficiaries may enroll in a Tricare plan or change their plan during open enrollment in one of the following ways:

Online at MilConnect, milconnect.dmdc.osd.mil/milconnect/.

By calling their Tricare regional contractor.

By mailing or faxing an enrollment form provided during open enrollment.

After spending years in the military, you may have given little thought to layoffs and job loss. But after you leave the service and start a civilian job, you are much more susceptible to these changes.

If you served in the military — even if it was years earlier — some of your military and veterans’ benefits can help financially after you lose a civilian job.

TRICARE

If you kept TRICARE benefits after retiring from the military but also had coverage from your civilian employer, then TRICARE was secondary to the employer’s coverage by helping with deductibles, copayments, and more.

But if you lose your job, TRICARE can become the primary coverage. It can be a less-expensive alternative to keeping your former employer’s coverage through COBRA, a federal law that requires employers with 20 or more employees to let former employees keep their group health insurance for up to 18 months after they lose their jobs. Even though COBRA is the same coverage you had when working, the premiums jump significantly when you leave your job.

[UPDATED MONTHLY: MOAA's TRICARE Toolkit]

“If I had lost a job and I had TRICARE Prime or TRICARE For Life as my backstop, I wouldn’t do COBRA. I’d go ahead and use the TRICARE,” said Lt. Col. Kathryn “Kitty” Meyers, USAF (Ret), a MOAA Life member, president of the Alamo (Texas) Chapter of MOAA, and a MOAA transition liaison officer.

You can also use VA health care rather than pay for COBRA, if eligible. But first, find out how the coverage, providers, and facilities compare. If you are undergoing treatment with a specialist, you may want to temporarily pay extra to continue your employer’s coverage through COBRA. Definitely find out how family members who were included on your employer’s policy would be covered.

GI Bill

The GI Bill can be a valuable way to pay for education, and it can be especially helpful to get new credentials or training while looking for a new job.

“Veterans may have the option of using their GI Bill benefit for vocational training or education, which can be particularly useful for shifting to a new career path,” said Pete Kasperowicz, a spokesman at the VA. “The VA benefit can help veterans to earn a degree [or] certificate, or pursue on-the-job training or apprenticeships. They can also get reimbursed for the cost of tests to become a licensed or certified professional in a variety of career fields.”

[FROM VA.GOV: GI Bill Eligibility]

Transition Programs

Many of the programs and resources that helped when you first left the military and started a civilian job may also prove useful during a job search years later.

Meyers also recommends networking with veterans’ groups, alumni associations, and trade groups.",https://www.moaa.org/contentassets/44998980e09547319e71f4b19cbb0648/layoff-stock-art-runstudio-getty-h.jpg,N,1.0,2025-10-22 14:59:32.763529

The daughter of immigrants who built their lives in Hampton Roads, Nila is running to fight for the families, veterans, and working people she cares for every day by fixing the broken health care system and lowering costs for hardworking families.

Nila’s story is rooted in service. Her mother worked for the Navy as a Tricare primary care doctor, and she grew up surrounded by healthcare workers who taught her the value of community and service. Before becoming a doctor, she practiced law defending survivors of domestic violence at a legal aid clinic, deepening her commitment to standing up for those too often left behind. Now as an acute care doctor, she serves her Hampton Roads community, including veteran and active-duty families.

To help Dr. Nila Devanath show the constituents of Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District the same care she provides to her patients, chip in HERE.

Nila is ready to put her patients and the families of Virginia’s 2nd first in Congress. She’ll fight to lower costs — from skyrocketing health care premiums to housing, groceries, and utility bills — and to push back on the reckless attacks on Medicaid, cut drug prices, ensure veterans get the care they earned, and safeguard coverage for the 300,000 Virginians now at risk of losing it.

“In our hospitals, I see every day what happens when Washington fails to act. Families wait months for care. Veterans are forced to split their pills in half. Patients with diabetes lose their lives avoiding treatment for something as simple as a small cut because they’re afraid of the medical bills that will follow,” said Nila. “Rep. Jen Kiggans and I both swore to care for our patients, but in Washington she’s turned her back on that promise. As a doctor, I can’t stand by while families suffer. I’m running for Congress to fix this broken system for my patients, for our veterans, and for every family who deserves better.”

Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District is one of the most competitive in the country and could decide control of the U.S. House. Rep. Jen Kiggans broke her promise to protect Medicaid, voted to take health care away from 300,000 Virginians and put our hospitals at risk of closing, and just this week admitted she has no plan for Virginians who will lose coverage when ACA subsidies expire. Nila is running to bring integrity and compassion back to Washington — to fight for her patients, protect health care, and live up to her oath to care for this community every single day.",https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1491227/story_image/TwitterlaunchpostNila.png?1761092807,N,0.0,2025-10-21 23:19:55.499525

The counties affected are Maricopa and Gila.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

She also said, before she herself became a doctor, that she practiced law and defended survivors of domestic violence while working at a legal aid clinic. She is currently an acute care doctor with Sentara.

Coverage for certain GLP-1 drugs under TRICARE For Life ended Aug. 31 thanks to a Defense Health Agency (DHA) decision that threatens both the health of those taking these medications and the overall health of the TRICARE For Life (TFL) benefit.

Before the change, TFL beneficiaries who completed a rigorous prior-authorization process to validate obesity-related comorbid medical conditions could secure coverage for GLP-1 drugs approved for weight loss by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). TRICARE did not cover these drugs for weight loss alone, but rather to improve medical conditions associated with obesity.

TRICARE Prime and Select users retain coverage for these medications under these conditions, while all beneficiaries are still covered for GLP-1 medications to treat Type 2 diabetes.

As MOAA works with DHA officials, lawmakers and their staffs, beneficiaries, and fellow advocacy groups to address this issue, we’ve requested feedback from those who’ve lost drug coverage because of the change. Hundreds have answered the call so far, but the more stories we can share, the stronger our voice becomes.

One MOAA member made his case in a commentary at Military Times, where he shared his personal story while detailing the questionable path DHA officials took to reach their decision.

“In 2001, Congress ended decades of second-class treatment for older retirees with the creation of the Senior Pharmacy Program, guaranteeing Medicare-eligible retirees the same pharmacy coverage as younger beneficiaries,” wrote Col. Derence V. Fivehouse, USAF (Ret). “For more than 20 years, that promise held. When I turned 65, nothing changed: same formulary, same co-pays, same access. Until now…This is not an abstract dispute. It is a matter of health and dignity for older veterans.”

He was far from the only TFL beneficiary to raise concerns about the future of TFL and the betrayal of losing an earned benefit:

“I just don’t understand why a person that served 21 years and deployed in wartime is suddenly being treated like a second-class citizen and any differently from those on TRICARE Prime,” wrote one.

“My biggest concern is that more drugs will be added to the list that TFL won't cover. Although I am a military veteran, I identify as a spouse primarily. I am thankful for all that Tricare has done for my family throughout the years, but we were promised health care coverage for life. If they can start cutting meds from our plan, what is to stop them from cutting the program down the road,” wrote another.

“Am I no longer entitled to equal benefits because I served for over 20 years and now, I’m just too costly to pay for? I am trying to prevent diabetes and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Please fix this egregious error and restore my right to receive equal benefits,” wrote a third.

PBMs will use multiple adverse audit findings to justify terminating pharmacies from their network, so it is crucial for pharmacies to appeal PBM audit findings and attempt to reduce the amounts at issue to the fullest extent possible.","Recently, Frier Levitt assisted an Illinois-based pharmacy in challenging multiple Pharmacy Benefit Manager’s (“PBM”) audit findings as a service to the TRICARE Pharmacy Program and successfully reversed 100% of the discrepant amounts. In the audit findings, the PBM sought claim data verification for several prescriptions, stating the “Network Provider Refused to or Failed to Provide Requested Information.” Under Frier Levitt’s guidance, the Pharmacy gathered supporting documentation and submitted a robust appeal response challenging the alleged discrepancies, particularly as the PBM withheld the funds despite the Pharmacy’s timely submission of a Grievance Request and Request for Reconsideration. Leveraging Frier Levitt’s experience in addressing PBM audit tactics, the Pharmacy submitted patient records, signed prescriptions, pharmacy work orders, compounding records, progress notes, and delivery tickets demonstrating that the Pharmacy did in fact maintain and provide sufficient claim data verification. Ultimately, the PBM reversed 100% of the audit findings.

The excessive audit findings seen in this case are examples of abusive PBM tactics that have become far too routine in pharmacies’ dealings with PBMs. Being aware of such practices and how they can be remedied is crucial to avoiding negative outcomes for your pharmacy.

While PBMs are increasingly taking disciplinary actions against pharmacies, pharmacies have several effective tools at their disposal to push back against PBM overreach. One of the most important steps pharmacies can take is to implement and maintain comprehensive policies and procedures that ensure compliance with the requirements set forth in PBM Provider Manuals. By doing so, pharmacies can reduce the risk of unfavorable audit outcomes or severe sanctions and, if action is taken by a PBM, they are better positioned to respond effectively.

Moreover, PBM Provider Manuals generally include contractual appeal and dispute resolution processes. These procedures give pharmacies the right to challenge any actions or allegations made by PBMs. Taking advantage of these appeals processes is essential, not only for contesting terminations, but especially in response to audit findings. Pharmacies are strongly encouraged to appeal all audit findings, regardless of the financial impact, as even minor findings can lead to more significant PBM actions if left unchallenged. Timely appeals can result in the reversal of unfounded findings, the release of improperly withheld payments, and a reduced risk of future network termination.

Finally, there is growing momentum among state and federal lawmakers to rein in PBM misconduct. Many states have enacted Fair Audit laws that establish procedural safeguards, including clear limits on what documentation PBMs may demand, when funds can be withheld or recouped, and how audits must be conducted. As regulatory scrutiny of PBM practices increases, additional legislative protections for pharmacies are likely on the horizon.

This matter further demonstrates the importance of combating all PBM audit findings, as PBMs assert unnecessary discrepancies to use pharmacy audits as a source of revenue rather than ensuring compliance with applicable laws and contractual obligations. PBMs will use multiple adverse audit findings to justify terminating pharmacies from their network, so it is crucial for pharmacies to appeal PBM audit findings and attempt to reduce the amounts at issue to the fullest extent possible. Thus, seemingly “insignificant” amounts should be appealed to avoid additional future adverse actions by PBMs.
