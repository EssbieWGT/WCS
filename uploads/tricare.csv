Mental health professionals are not immune to the pressures associated with deployments or their care of service members and their families. Many specialists put their own advice into practice, seeking support when faced with mental health challenges.

One of the most important first steps they can take is finding someone to help ease the load. That’s the advice of Navy Cmdr. Stephanie Long, a clinical and medical psychologist who is the director for psychological health for the U.S. Navy.

Long said she found it challenging to reconnect with her family after a deployment to Joint Task Force Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. She and her spouse discovered couples’ counseling through their local Fleet and Family Service Center that combined with resources for their toddler.

The couples’ counseling “made such a difference, because I knew what I wanted, and I knew that it was important for me to reconnect. I just didn't know exactly how to do that,” Long said. “Just a little bit ironic, given what I do, but we all need help sometimes.”

Therapy helps resolve bad experiences

Long praised her experience seeking support. “Therapy can be so helpful for folks, whether they're struggling with relationships, anxiety, depression, or trauma-related symptoms. In some ways, it forces us to confront our problems.”

“Most of us want to compartmentalize our issues. We don't want to think about our negative past experiences and problems. We want to distract ourselves or focus on career or something else,” Long said. “Therapy gives us that dedicated time and space to talk through something, to gain that awareness, that insight.”

Therapy can identify what is contributing to a mental health challenge. “Having someone guide that process helps,” said Long. “We do it together because it's not easy to figure it out on our own.”

“I think focusing efforts on strengthening true connections, and having service members supporting others can go a long way,” she said.

“I’ve seen mental health (counselors) … it’s not a secret and I’m wildly open about it,” said Air Force Tech. Sgt. Jacob Cote, a mental health flight chief at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in Washington, D.C., noting that he sought care through military family life counselors and Military OneSource.

Mental health professionals are “not perfect. We all feel overwhelmed?” Cote said. “Seeking these resources has been beneficial in that I can treat my patients better now.”

Long said her own success with counseling could parallel with anyone who needs support — wherever they are in their mental health journey.

“Connection with others — true, deep, meaningful connection with others — that’s one of the things that can draw people to the service,” she said.

Long said fears of losing security clearances, not promoting, or separation from the military may hinder a service member from seeking help. However, a study from 2021 to 2023 by the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency found barely 1/100th of 1% of cases resulted in security denials or revocations were due to psychological health and additional conditions.

In fact, DCSA said seeking support leads to recovery and is more likely to enhance a military career than harm it, because of the openness demonstrated by the applicant in the process.

Get help early to boost recovery

Unfortunately, some people don't seek help until they're in crisis mode, which can make recovery harder. “Not impossible,” Long said. “But it requires so much more work to intervene later versus earlier.”

“Getting help early is critical and connecting with someone is such an important protective factor against suicide,” Long said. “There's so much more opportunity to get to work on something, to improve before it becomes a crisis.”

Available Military Health System mental health resources

The MHS Mental Health Hub provides a comprehensive listing of mental health services available throughout the MHS. This includes options to seek care, tips from experts, and in-depth information on a variety of resources. You can connect directly to mental health support services near you with one click.

Targeted Care. This new process connects you to the specific type of care you need after an initial evaluation — and can be an individual appointment, in-person group therapy or virtual group therapy. Targeted care is now available at many military mental health clinics.

TRICARE covered mental health services are available through its worldwide network of civilian providers. To set up a mental health appointment through TRICARE, visit the mental health doctors and appointments page.

Virtual care: The Defense Health Agency continues to expand mental health services available to service members at remote installations. One example is BRAVE, the DHA’s Behavioral Health Resources and Virtual Experience, provides tele-mental health services at 84 locations around the world by connecting service members with counselors through virtual sessions.

inTransition is a confidential program that offers specialized coaching and assistance for active duty service members, National Guard and Reserve members, veterans, and retirees, who are receiving mental health or traumatic brain injury care and experiencing disruption in their lives, like a PCS (permanent change of station) move, separation, or retirement.

The Real Warriors Campaign, a Department of War public health initiative, strives to decrease stigma, increase psychological health literacy, and encourage early mental health help-seeking behaviors in the military community.

The Warrior Care Recovery Coordination Program, executed by the three branches of service, provides holistic care to wounded, ill, or injured service members and their families and caregivers. Recovery Care Coordinators serve as a guide through recovery, rehabilitation, and transition or reintegration by facilitating a comprehensive recovery plan. This plan covers needs associated with daily living, career, family, finances, health, legal, military issues, and spirituality.

The Brandon Act is a law that empowers service members to receive the help they need by seeking a referral for a mental health evaluation through their commander or supervisor. This guidance helps with the process. The purpose of the Brandon Act is to reduce the stigma associated with mental health.

Military OneSource. Service members and their families can also receive referrals to nonmedical support such as a chaplain, financial advisor, or a military family life counselor through Military OneSource, a one-stop 24/7 gateway to trusted resources, information, and confidential help. Call 800-342-9647. Military OneSource can also help with referrals such as the impact of a parent on deployment to a child’s health and happiness, or a substance abuse issue.

The military provides a continuum of care for service members and families who may face unique mental health challenges coping with daily life. This means the right resource is out there to match warfighters and families to the care they need.

“The wonderful thing in the Department of War is that we have a lot of different modalities, and so we can individualize treatment and find out what is going to work best for them,” said Navy Capt. (Dr.) Elle Marie Schollnberger, a psychiatrist and director of mental health for the Office of the Assistant Secretary of War for Health Services Policy and Oversight.

Personalized care can strengthen resilience and improve overall health, said Dr. Marjan Holloway a clinical psychologist and the director of the Suicide Care, Prevention, and Research initiative at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Maryland, adding that mental health care is “delivered in the context of what is the best evidence there is for the treatment that's being provided.”

Military Health System is there for you wherever and whenever you need help

Therapy can take many forms, such as nonmedical, toll-free advice, nurse advice lines, and lifestyle coaching to provide support and connect with professionals before issues become severe. Along the spectrum of care, support can include interactive mental therapy, medications, and hospitalization, if needed. The MHS Mental Health Hub provides information on resources that can be accessed around the world 24/7, and via telehealth.

The care and prevention components come together “such as that we all work as a team and do a better job in the context of suicide prevention,” Holloway said. “While sometimes, it is a one-on-one setting, there are people all around you that are willing to help, be they a barracks buddy, platoon leader, or a volunteer on a free 24/7 telephone line dedicated to helping military mental health.”

The aim of these efforts is to make military life fulfilling at a high level.

“Allow our mental health clinics and other professionals like Military and Family Life counselors, Military OneSource, and all those other support agencies to serve you and make you a better version of you,” said Air Force Tech. Sgt. Jacob Cote, a mental health flight chief at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in Washington, D.C.

To reach that better version, you have to give these military support programs “that chance,” Cote said. If you don’t feel comfortable with the first or second resource or program, “That’s OK, there are other resources service members can utilize, too.”

MHS mental health professionals emphasize a ready military force must be at its best physically and mentally to be most effective in action.

“The human weapon system is one of the most valuable systems that we have in the United States,” observed Air Force Tech. Sgt. Martina MooreTerry, also a mental health flight chief at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. “Mental health and readiness go hand in hand in the military.”

Mental health professionals are “ready to take care of that fight downrange, ready to take care of those individuals in their hardest and darkest of times,” she added.

“If an individual doesn’t take care of their mental health, and only focuses on the physical aspect — how can we expect them to go out and perform their duties, day in and day out? If one is not psychologically resilient, the DOW is at risk of failing, and readiness could be directly impacted,” concurred Cote.

Service members may find themselves hesitant to take the first step toward mental health support. “Being hesitant is normal. I cannot stress that enough,” said Cote. “It is OK to feel hesitant. It is OK to feel cautiously optimistic. It is OK to wonder if it will help you. Let us show you that it can and does work.”

According to Schollnberger, there are a variety of therapy types that can help. Individual therapies available at military clinics include cognitive behavioral therapy, prolonged exposure therapy, or psychoanalysis. There are also group therapies, which “can be very beneficial for individuals to have an understanding that they're not alone in what they're facing and really get support from the group,” she explained.

There are other ways to learn coping … we also have virtual therapy. So, for those folks in remote locations, we do have the ability to make sure they have access to therapy as well,” she noted.

Nonmedical resources are also available and are ideal to look at or consult with if a service member or family member thinks they may need mental health help, said Navy Cmdr. Stephanie Long, a clinical and medical psychologist, U.S. Navy director for psychological health.

“I think partially because when we think about mental health and mental health care, a lot of times we think straight to the clinic or the military treatment facility and the specialty mental health care that is there, but there are tons of other resources that can still provide care,” Long said. For example, she noted, are Military and Family Life counselors and chaplains who are often trained in pastoral care.

With Military and Family Life counselors, “they’re confidential to a point just like mental health, but they have the ability to meet you where you're at on base and do not document what is discussed,” Cote said. The first step can be to ”shop around, for example, living in the National Capital Region, there are tons of resources to best fit your needs,” Cote stressed.

He noted that mental health professionals are skilled at ""meeting you where you’re at on your mental health journey, coming to your level, and showing you that ‘I'm here for you while you are on this journey’ and that it is OK to not be OK.”

If you’re still unsure about which resources to try — or feeling emotional distress — Cote said “call your local mental health clinic. They will be able to help match you with the most appropriate resource.”

By proactively enforcing clear medical standards, the DOW reduces long-term health care costs, optimizes personnel availability, and supports veteran care.

To enhance warfighter readiness, the Medical Standards Analytics and Research program delivers science-based recommendations fueled by data.
Evidence-based medical standards help ensure that service members can perform their duties effectively and safely — directly contributing to mission success.","2025 marks the 30th anniversary of the Medical Standards Analytics and Research program, the Department of War's premier analytical capability, providing policymakers with actionable data to shape evidence-based medical standards and support military health and performance.

In 1995, the U.S. Army Surgeon General established the Accession Medical Standards Analysis and Research Activity to improve the health, readiness, and resilience of service members by transforming complex data into actionable insights to guide policy. With its mission expanded, it is now known as the Medical Standards Analytics and Research program, or MSAR, and is housed in the Statistics and Epidemiology branch at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. The program continues to deliver science-based recommendations to optimize recruitment and retention and enhance warfighter readiness.

“The standards for accession into the U.S. military are high, uncompromising, and clear,” wrote Secretary of War Pete Hegseth in an April 2025 memo emphasizing that “Young Americans seeking to serve in the greatest fighting force in history must be physically and mentally capable of performing their duties in the harshest conditions.”

Data-driven support for these rigorous standards makes MSAR’s key capabilities even more imperative, as MSAR generates knowledge products tracking that service members are physically and medically fit to meet the demands of military service.

With physicians, epidemiologists, statisticians, and data analysts at the helm, MSAR oversees large-scale epidemiological analyses, predictive modeling, and biostatistical assessments to evaluate medical standards by examining the impact of medical conditions, occupational exposures, diseases, and injuries on military service.

""MSAR's core mission is to validate, standardize, analyze, and transform complex data into actionable insights,” said Dr. Natalya Weber, director of the WRAIR’s Statistics and Epidemiology branch and chief of MSAR. “Our work empowers leaders to make informed decisions regarding medical standards, recruitment, and warfighter health and readiness.”

Over the last 30 years, the team has generated dozens of reports, above 60 peer-reviewed journal publications, and countless other products to provide valuable insights into medical readiness, adverse attrition, and disability evaluations.

Guided by the Offices of the Assistant Secretary of War for Health Affairs, Health Services Policy and Oversight, and Under Secretary of War for Personnel and Readiness Military Personnel Policy, MSAR provides continuous data-driven assessments, evaluating the rigorousness of medical standards and service-specific waiver decisions. The offices oversee data provision to MSAR and direct the depth and breadth of its programmatic tasking. This is just one example of leadership’s dedicated efforts to foster a data-driven culture across the department, which helps inform decisions at all levels.

“The MSAR focus is on ensuring that we fulfill our mission with precision and uphold the highest standards of data integrity,” said Caitlin Rushin, deputy chief of MSAR. “We ensure that our analytic datasets are accurate, actionable, and expertly analyzed to provide the insights necessary for informed decision-making.”

Evidence-based medical standards make sure service members can perform their duties effectively and safely — directly contributing to mission success. By proactively enforcing clear medical standards, the DOW reduces long-term health care costs, optimizes personnel availability, and supports veteran care.

For 30 years, MSAR has provided critical epidemiologic and analytic support to the Accession and Retention Medical Standards Working Group, providing numerous analyses detailing accession, waiver, disqualification, retention, and disability evaluation trends. The team’s systematic generation of critical data metrics and comparative analyses has allowed the working group to address medical readiness more efficiently and adjust when needed. This approach maximizes cost benefits, workload, and time, all while advancing readiness.

“MSAR’s value isn’t just in describing medical trends, but in predicting potential challenges to warfighter readiness,” said Army Maj. Jared Egbert, the associate director of WRAIR’s Statistics and Epidemiology branch and associate chief of MSAR. “Ultimately, our work ensures policy isn't reactive, but anticipatory, safeguarding our nation’s fighting strength.”

Notably, MSAR follows service members who enter service with medical waivers to examine their attrition, deployability, and health care utilization in comparison with those fully medically qualified. MSAR also identifies medical conditions that are most often waived, rarely approved, or frequently associated with high attrition and cost. These important indicators keep senior leaders informed regarding where policies might need to change and estimate impact of the changes.

The data collected directly informs the DOW’s medical standards policies, particularly DoDI 6130.03 Volumes 1 and 2 which are instrumental for maintaining a strong and lethal military. By identifying these trends, the MSAR team improves efficiency and saves time, money, and effort in the recruitment and medical screening process.

Accession and retention medical standards ensure service members can perform their duties without posing undue risk to themselves or others. These standards provide clear guidance for military health care providers, line officers, and other officials to determine whether a service member can continue service.

Without standards, the consequences could be dire.

“Without solid accession and retention medical standards, we would have a military that is likely not medically ready to perform routine service duties and support our nation in the event of a conflict,” said Tim Powers, MSAR’s senior statistician.

With a focus on readiness, MSAR continuously reevaluates standards and concludes that Service Medical Waiver Review Authorities strike an appropriate balance between managing adverse attrition and meeting the unique needs of each service. MSAR findings validate the effectiveness of its data-driven approach, confirming that medical standards are upheld to align with dynamic operational requirements and applied within the established evidence-based framework.

Blaine McGraw, an OBGYN assigned to the hospital who is now in custody.

Under Secretary of the Army Mike Obadal and Army Surgeon General Lt. Gen. Mary K. Izaguirre toured the facility to review Defense Health Agency policies, patient safety practices and overall care standards. Rear Adm. Matthew Case, acting deputy director of DHA, also joined the visit. Darnall operates under the DHA network, which oversees military medical facilities worldwide.

Obadal emphasized that maintaining patient trust and safety remains the Army’s highest priority, particularly in light of the allegations against McGraw.

“Our ethical and moral imperative is to ensure deployment-ready forces while providing a safe and professional environment for all patients,” Obadal said. “I’m proud of our leaders and medical providers for the swift action taken to initiate the criminal investigation and prioritize patient safety.”

Izaguirre said the Army is closely examining how medical training, standards and oversight are carried out across facilities.

“We are looking closely at how training is conducted, how standards are enforced and how leaders ensure that policies are being followed,” she said. “Based on this review, we will work with the DHA to implement any necessary recommendations quickly and transparently to maintain faith with soldiers and families.”

Those steps will align with an Army-directed Inspector General review focused on medical treatment policies and practices.

McGraw faces allegations involving more than 100 individuals across multiple states for secretly recording patients during their exams. The claims involve patients from Fort Hood, Darnall Army Medical Center and Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii.

""These reports are deeply concerning and indescribably horrific. I and my staff are in contact with the Army and monitoring their investigation. I'm committed to ensuring a full accounting of the facts and that justice is served,” said Senator Ted Cruz in a statement.

McGraw is being held at the Bell County Jail as an inmate of the U.S. Army.

Baby Quest and the Cade Foundation also provide substantial grants ranging from $2,000 to $16,000 open to active-duty families.
The removal of the IVF provision in the 2026 NDAA is a tactical defeat, but the war is not over.","For military families, the promise of comprehensive reproductive healthcare has long felt like a mirage, always visible on the horizon but forever dissolving as you approach. For the past year, beneficiaries have been led to believe that relief is finally inbound. The Fiscal Year 2026 National Defense Authorization Act included bipartisan language that would have required Tricare to cover In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) for all active-duty service members, finally modernizing a benefit stuck in the Cold War era for decades.

But as the final conference report dropped on Dec. 9, 2025, that provision was nowhere to be found.

It was not lost to a clerical error or a budget oversight, either. It was stripped by House leadership behind closed doors, reportedly due to ideological disputes regarding the status of embryos created during the IVF process. The result is that while members of Congress and federal civil servants enjoy comprehensive fertility coverage, the troops who deploy to defend them do not.

For the average military family, the 2026 landscape is now a little bleaker, leaving them to navigate a broken system with nothing but their own bank accounts and perhaps a few tactical workarounds.

The Financial Scunion

To understand the frustration rippling through the spouse networks, one must look at the math. Excluding this provision not only hurts morale; it also erodes savings accounts. Tricare currently covers only the diagnostic portion of infertility, the labs and exams that identify the problem, but pays zero dollars for the actual treatment unless the service member has a “serious or severe” illness or injury directly caused by their service.

For everyone else, the cost is draining. The average price of one single IVF cycle in the civilian world now runs between $15,000 and $30,000 after factoring in items like medications and genetic testing. Let’s put that into perspective: an E-5 with six years of service takes home a base pay of about $3,800 a month. That means their first attempt to start a family costs almost 75 percent of a sergeant’s annual base pay before taxes.

The Department of Defense is basically asking families to pay a “retention tax” to have children, forcing them to choose between staying in uniform or separating to work for a company like Starbucks, Amazon, or the federal civil service that offers the benefits the military refuses to fund.

The Loophole: MTFs and the “Discount”

If the Pentagon will not pay the bill, families must find a way to hack the system. The most viable workaround is the Military Treatment Facility (MTF) “cost-recovery” program. While Tricare will not cover a civilian clinic, roughly seven military hospitals across the globe offer IVF, in which the professional fees, including the doctors’ and surgery costs, are covered. The patient is responsible only for the contracted laboratory fees and medications, which typically run between $5,000 and $8,000 per cycle, rather than the civilian average of $25,000.

However, accessing these hubs is a logistical nightmare, akin to changing a hot machine-gun barrel with your bare hands. Patients must be stationed near one or get command approval to travel out of pocket.

With 2026 around the corner, the open and operational hubs include Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland, which serves as the East Coast flagship, with costs around $6,383 plus medications. Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio serves the central region but operates on a batched cycle system with a waitlist that can stretch up to a year. Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii and Naval Medical Center San Diego handle the Pacific demand, though travel costs often wash out the savings for those not locally stationed.

A critical warning for families in the Pacific Northwest: Madigan Army Medical Center is currently closed to new IVF referrals until at least March 2026 due to severe provider shortages. Relying on outdated referral lists for Madigan will result in dead ends and lost time.

The “Civilian Spouse” Maneuver

Perhaps the most overlooked strategy involves leveraging state law against the federal policy. While Tricare is a federal program exempt from state insurance mandates, civilian employers are not always afforded the same exemption. If a non-active duty spouse secures employment with a company based in a “mandate state“, such as New York, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, or Colorado, that employer’s “fully insured” health plan is legally required to cover IVF.

Of course, families should verify with human resources whether a plan is “fully insured” or “self-insured,” since “self-insured” is regulated by federal ERISA laws and often exempt from state mandates.

Pharmaceutical Hacks and Grants

For those forced into the civilian sector, the medication bill alone can rival the cost of a car. Some pharmaceutical companies do offer discount programs that can create a financial tourniquet in dire times. Compassionate Corps provides free fertility medication to eligible veterans with service-connected injuries who lack insurance coverage. For active-duty personnel, ReUnite Assist offers an automatic 25 percent discount on specific medications such as Follistim and Ganirelix, with deeper discounts available based on financial need.

The non-profit sector has also stepped into the breach. The Bob Woodruff Foundation’s VIVA program offers grants of up to $5,000 per cycle for veterans, often covering costs that the VA rejects, such as donor gametes or surrogacy. Baby Quest and the Cade Foundation also provide substantial grants ranging from $2,000 to $16,000 open to active-duty families.

The removal of the IVF provision in the 2026 NDAA is a tactical defeat, but the war is not over. Advocacy groups like the Military Officers Association of America and RESOLVE are already pivoting their strategy for the FY2027 cycle. The argument is shifting from a plea for social benefits to a hard-nosed assessment of readiness. With the military facing historic recruiting challenges, the data suggests it simply cannot afford to bleed mid-career talent because it refuses to support the families it claims to cherish.

Until the policy changes, families must utilize every loophole, apply for every grant, and document every dollar spent. The receipts of 2026 will likely be the ammunition needed to win the fight in 2027. As always, we must do what we do best: adapt and overcome.

When to use civilian dental care Military dental clinics are the main providers of dental care for ADSMs.
• Care unavailable at your military dental clinic: Your military dental clinic doesn’t offer the dental services you need and will refer you out.
You’ll need authorization from your civilian dentist, as described in the Active Duty Dental Program Handbook.
• The TRICARE Dental Program offers coverage to family members of ADSMs and National Guard or Reserve members not on active orders and family members.","Maintaining dental health is a critical part of overall force readiness. Are you on active duty but live far away from your nearest military dental clinic? Or do you need dental care that your military dental clinic can’t provide?

You should know that TRICARE offers the Active Duty Dental Program. This program allows active duty service members to get care through civilian providers under certain circumstances. The ADDP helps catch problems early and prevents them from becoming more serious.

“Knowing when to see a civilian dentist can save time and prevent complications,” said Douglas Elsesser, dental program analyst, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “ADDP guides you to the right dental care without unnecessary delays. It helps make sure you get the care that you need, when you need it.”

Who can get care through the ADDP The ADDP is available to all ADSMs. It also covers National Guard and Reserve members who are on active duty for more than 30 consecutive days. Some members in early activation, the Transitional Assistance Management Program, or in line of duty status also qualify.

How you get care depends on where you’re stationed and if you’re remotely located. • CONUS: o You’re remotely located if you live and work more than 50 miles away from a military dental clinic. o Not remote? You can see a civilian dentist through the ADDP with a referral from your military dental clinic. • OCONUS: You must be enrolled in TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas.

When to use civilian dental care Military dental clinics are the main providers of dental care for ADSMs. However, they can’t always provide every type of treatment. Also, not every service member is stationed close to one. In those cases, the ADDP lets you see a civilian dentist at no cost, as long as you follow the ADDP rules.

You may be eligible to see a civilian dentist through ADDP in two situations: • Remote locations: You’re assigned to a duty station more than 50 miles from a military dental clinic. • Care unavailable at your military dental clinic: Your military dental clinic doesn’t offer the dental services you need and will refer you out.

Getting an Appointment Control Number Before scheduling with a civilian dentist, you’ll need an Appointment Control Number.

An ACN allows TRICARE to pay for your civilian dental visit under the ADDP. You must have one before getting care outside a military dental clinic. • If you already have an authorization or referral: Your authorization letter will list your ACN. You can find this letter in your ADDP My Account. • If you don’t have an authorization or referral: You may still be able to request your own ACN for routine dental care. The needed care must meet these criteria: o It’s a covered benefit. o It costs less than $750 per procedure or appointment. o It totals no more than $1,500 in a 12-month period. o It’s scheduled with a network dentist (CONUS).

Do you need specialty care? Or do your costs exceed these limits? You’ll need authorization from your civilian dentist, as described in the Active Duty Dental Program Handbook. You can find more details on ACNs and other program rules in the handbook.

How to request an ACN: • Submit an ACN Request Form online (fastest option, CONUS only). • Call the ADDP contractor, United Concordia, at 866-984-2337 (CONUS) or 844-653-4058 (OCONUS).

How to make an appointment with a civilian dentist: Once you have an ACN, here’s what to do:

If you’re in a CONUS location: • You can schedule an appointment with a network dentist. United Concordia can help you. Do you have a referral? Your military dental clinic can also schedule your appointment.

If you’re in an OCONUS location: • Call United Concordia for help finding a TRICARE OCONUS Preferred Dentist. A TOPD will: o File claims for you o Submit pre-authorizations before you get costly or complex treatment

New tool for military dental care: findDHA If you aren’t using the ADDP for civilian care, you’ll go to a military dental clinic. The Defense Health Agency recently launched findDHA, an interactive mapping tool. This tool can help you find the closest military dental clinic for routine care.

ADDP vs. other TRICARE dental programs Are you a family member, retiree, or service member who isn’t on active duty? You won’t get care through the ADDP. You can buy dental coverage through a different program. • The TRICARE Dental Program offers coverage to family members of ADSMs and National Guard or Reserve members not on active orders and family members. • The Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program offers coverage to retired service members and their family members.

By covering care at military dental clinics with support from civilian dentists in the ADDP, TRICARE helps you maintain dental readiness wherever you serve.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2512/9430964/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-10 12:57:03.756553

Senate Bill 370, which establishes the Tricare Premium Reimbursement Program Act, will reimburse eligible members of the Michigan National Guard for the costs of Tricare health and dental insurance premiums.

According to the legislation's language, eligibility for the reimbursements is defined as: ""a member of the Michigan National Guard who is eligible for coverage under the Tricare reserve select program or the Tricare dental program and meets any other eligibility criteria established by the department.""

Senate Bill 370 was passed nearly unanimously in both chambers and takes effect immediately. Only Rep. Steve Cara (R-Three Rivers) voted against the bill.

Senate Bill 540 establishes the Michigan National Guard Child Care Assistance Program, which would provide a stipend for childcare to eligible members of the Michigan National Guard.

The bill defines eligible members of the Michigan National Guard as:

The member is in active service

The member is not absent without leave (AWOL) or under charges described in the Michigan Code of Military Justice

Any other criteria determined by the adjutant general consistent with Michigan National Guard recruiting and retention requirements

The stipend is only given to applicants if both the following apply:

There is enough money in the Michigan National Guard Member Benefit Fund proposed by House Bill 4962 to cover the amount of assistance applied for

Either of the following:

The applicant is a single parent

The applicant’s spouse is also an eligible member

Child care assistance through the stipend can only be provided for up to 12 hours a day for weekend drills and annual training, and up to a maximum of 39 days a year.

Senate Bill 540 passed with strong bipartisan support in both chambers and goes into effect immediately.

Senate Bill 542 amends the Michigan National Guard Tuition Assistance Act to move its remaining unencumbered balance from the Michigan National Guard Tuition Assistance Fund to the Michigan National Guard Member Benefit Fund proposed by House Bill 4962.

The tuition assistance program will eligible members of the Michigan National Guard to pay for education that would culminate in:

A vocational or technical training

A certificate

The individual’s first associate degree

The individual’s first bachelor’s degree

The individual’s first master’s degree

Senate Bill 542 passed with strong bipartisan support in both chambers and goes into effect immediately.

All of the above mentioned assistance programs will be overseen by the Michigan National Guard General Adjutant, the senior military officer for a state's National Guard. The general adjutant will determine the annual amounts of reimbursement for each program.",https://media.wzzm13.com/assets/WZZM/images/fd74af74-e4bf-4f08-9a9d-d77824232390/20251209T211659/fd74af74-e4bf-4f08-9a9d-d77824232390_1140x641.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-09 21:56:44.721316

The secondary exposure was the location of the index visit, which could be either military clinics or private sector (civilian clinics) care.
Supplemental Table 3 reports patient characteristics based on the location of the initial shoulder care (military or private sector clinic).
Diagnostic Imaging (Aim 1) A majority of the cohort never received diagnostic imaging (76.7% overall), but there was variability in imaging use among diagnostic groups (Supplemental Table 4).
Comparisons to the existing literature are challenging because our approach investigated HCRU patterns along with increased granularity in shoulder diagnostic groups.","Introduction

Shoulder conditions and disorders are commonly experienced musculoskeletal pain conditions and have a prevalence (20.9%) comparable to back (26.9%) and neck pain (20.6%).1 For example, in a 15-year population-based study in the Netherlands, only 47% of the cohort were free of chronic arm, neck, or shoulder pain throughout the observation period.1 The 53% experiencing these conditions were further described as having either development (18.3%), persistence (8.5%), recovery (7.5%), or variable (18.7%) disease courses.2 Moreover, the healthcare burden is high for those with shoulder injuries, including up to 58% of those with chronic arm, neck, and shoulder pain from the aforementioned Netherlands cohort study.3

Health system level care utilization patterns for shoulder conditions and disorders have not previously been well described; a stark contrast to other commonly occurring musculoskeletal conditions like low back pain.4,5 Furthermore, available literature for characterizing shoulder conditions has included cross-sectional analysis which does not allow for an understanding of healthcare utilization and care trajectories over time.6 This knowledge gap has potentially important ramifications for data-driven recommendations improving care for this highly prevalent musculoskeletal condition. Also, in many instances, shoulder conditions are grouped broadly as “musculoskeletal pain” for population-based studies, including being clustered with neck and arm pain as in the aforementioned cohort study in the Netherlands, as well as other studies.7,8 Most large-scale healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) studies have focused on other areas of musculoskeletal pain, leaving shoulder conditions and disorders as under-studied. Furthermore, the lack of shoulder-specific data on HCRU limits the development of value-based models that have been established in similarly prevalent conditions.

Similar to other body regions, several different diagnostic categories of shoulder conditions exist, ranging from acute injuries to severe degenerative disease requiring surgery. Moreover, prognosis and care trajectories can vary substantially across shoulder conditions. Therefore, when examining healthcare utilization patterns at the population level, conditions should be evaluated separately. From a policy and planning perspective, knowledge of how healthcare use varies across different diagnostic categories is a necessary first step to understanding which care patterns have the highest impact on the health system. The knowledge of healthcare use across different shoulder diagnostic categories is important because it informs whether ongoing management is potentially aligned with best practice recommendations. Investigation of alignment with best practice recommendations for shoulder conditions and disorders is largely missing from existing literature but is important to know given its high prevalence. One analysis investigating the timing and ordering of manual therapy and opioid prescription for shoulder pain within the military health system provided insights related to the economic burden of these care pathways.9 Another analysis of the same health system, this time for knee disorders, demonstrated cost savings to the organization when stepped care pathways are followed.10 However, such examples are rarely reported in the literature. Filling this information gap will also allow future assessment of whether shoulder care (in this and other health systems) aligns with best practice recommendations for diagnostic imaging use,11–13 and pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments.12,14,15

This analysis used routinely collected health data to 1) describe the frequency and timing of diagnostic imaging (x-rays and advanced imaging services) and treatment use (non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic) for a new episode of shoulder pain and 2) identify how usage varied across high-volume shoulder conditions in different settings (military clinics versus private sector care). High volume conditions represent those most commonly seen within the health system. This analysis adds to the existing literature by HCRU among patients within different shoulder diagnostic categories, thereby enabling future efforts to better understand what constitutes value-based care for this highly prevalent musculoskeletal condition.

Methods

Study Overview

This was a retrospective cohort study of United States Military Health System (MHS) beneficiaries seeking care for a shoulder disorder. The MHS is a single-payer government health system and one of the largest health systems in the US, with over 50 hospitals and over 400 clinics. We used de-identified data from the MHS Data Repository (MDR) from January 2013 to July 2019; specifically, the Comprehensive Ambulatory/Professional Encounter Records (CAPER), the Non-Institutional TRICARE Encounter Data (TED-NI), the Ancillary Laboratory and Radiology data (Ancillary), the Pharmacy Detail Transaction Service data (PDTS), the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS), the Institutional TRICARE Encounter Data (TED-I), and the Standard Inpatient Data Records (SIDR). CAPER and SIDR include data from the outpatient and inpatient electronic medical records used in military clinics. TED-NI and TED-I include claims data from outpatient and inpatient visits in the private sector. The ancillary file includes imaging procedures that take place in military clinics, and PDTS includes all prescription data from outpatient encounters. The index date was defined as the date the individual had their first encounter that recorded a shoulder disorder diagnosis or procedure (Supplemental Table 1). Both sources that feed to the MDR, from military or private sector care clinics, are based on procedure (Current Procedural Terminology – CPT) and diagnosis (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) codes, allowing for a standardized comparison).16

This project received ethics approval from the Institutional Review Board at US Army Medical Center of Excellence, San Antonio, TX (#25-00019n, PI: Dan Rhon). The Institutional Review Board at Duke University reviewed this project and declared it as exempt because statistical analyses were performed on de-identified data (Pro00109909, PI: Steven George).

Eligibility Criteria

Individuals had an index date between July 2013, and March 2019. To be eligible, all cases were required to have a minimum six-month lead-in period (ie, no care seeking for shoulder disorder) and a three-month follow-up period to ensure this was a new episode of shoulder pain and to allow for a three-month analysis window of initial care utilization.

Patients were excluded if they were older than 65 years old, or less than 18 years old on the index date except those on active duty as emancipated minors, or their index visit was in an inpatient setting. Patients were further excluded if, during the surveillance period, they had a diagnosis or procedure indicating trauma, open dislocation, shoulder/humerus fractures, or upper extremity amputation. Diagnosis codes for the exclusion criteria can be found in Supplemental Table 1.

Exposures

Using encounters within three months of the index visits, the primary diagnostic shoulder group exposures were classified as: 1) non-specific shoulder diagnosis only, 2) rotator cuff/sub-acromial pain, 3) acromioclavicular (AC joint) dysfunction, 4) shoulder instability/dislocation, 5) hypomobility/adhesive capsulitis, 6) osteoarthrosis (OA), and 7) multiple diagnoses (Supplemental Table 1). Individuals with more than one specific diagnosis were placed in the multiple diagnoses category. The secondary exposure was the location of the index visit, which could be either military clinics or private sector (civilian clinics) care.

Outcomes

The study outcomes were HCRU within the first three months from the index visit and were broadly classified into three main groups: diagnostic imaging, pharmacological, and non-pharmacological treatments (codes in Supplemental Table 2). Diagnostic imaging procedures included radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance arthrogram (MRA), and computed tomography (CT) scans. Imaging that included MRI, MRA, or CT was further categorized as advanced imaging. Patients who received both radiographs and advanced imaging were further categorized based on the order of imaging (radiograph prior to advanced imaging or vice versa). Pharmacological treatments included prescriptions for NSAIDs, opioids, benzodiazepines, muscle relaxers, analgesics, and steroid joint injections, based on American Hospital Formulary Service therapeutic class codes in the PDTS file. Non-pharmacological treatments included receipt of acupuncture, physical therapy, and then more specifically whether patients received supervised therapeutic exercise, passive modalities (eg, ultrasound, electrical stimulation, heat/cold therapy), or manual therapy. These outcomes were defined as binary indicators of utilization and as continuous variables (ie, number of procedures, prescriptions, and treatment visits per patient).

Data Analysis

For Aim 1, the HCRU in the first three months of shoulder care across the diagnostic shoulder groups was summarized as the number of unique people who received that care at least once. In addition, descriptive statistics, including the mean and standard deviation, summarized the number of times the care was received per patient. Chi-square and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to test the difference in treatment receipt between diagnosis categories without adjusting for multiple testing. However, given the large sample size of this study, a small non-clinically important difference can be claimed as statistically significant with a p-value <0.05.17 Therefore, the focus on clinical relevance was prioritized, and inferential statistical testing was not performed.

For Aim 2, we descriptively compared the same HCRU outcomes between cases that occurred initially in military clinics versus private sector clinics for each shoulder disorder category. All statistical analyses were completed using SAS 9.4 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

Results

The initial data abstraction from MDR identified 1,488,821 unique persons with care for an initial episode of shoulder pain from January 2013 to July 2019 in MDR. After exclusions for age, prior shoulder care, trauma-related incidents, and minimum eligibility periods, the research team was provided with a file representing 663,573 unique individuals. Manual validation of the data removed additional cases based on age, presence of shoulder trauma, and beneficiary eligibility windows not met. This led to 456,241 individuals meeting eligibility for inclusion in the final cohort (Table 1). The two most common reasons an individual was excluded during manual validation were not having the index visit in an outpatient setting (n = 22,046) and having evidence of fracture or trauma (n = 106,772). The summary of this cohort by diagnostic group is presented in Table 2 and by index clinic type (Supplemental Table 3). The size of the diagnostic groups ranged from non-specific shoulder pain as the largest (n = 305,764, 67%) to rotator cuff injury (n = 84,698, 18.6%) to AC joint disorders as the smallest (n = 4,013, <0.1%).

Table 2 Demographic Characteristics by Diagnostic Groups

Table 2 was stratified by the diagnostic groups and the characteristics summarized include the data source of the patient’s index date, age, index year, sex, beneficiary category, pay plan, and service branch (the latter two variables represent the status of the sponsor). Sex was missing for 14.4% of the total patients. All diagnostic groups showed a higher percentage of male patients (between 49.7% and 73.4%) except for the Hypomobility/Adhesive Capsulitis disease group which had 50.9% female patients and only 39% male. Patients with hypomobility/adhesive capsulitis, OA, and multiple diagnoses had a higher mean age (47, 50, and 48, respectively), whereas patients with AC Joint and instability/dislocation had a lower mean age (33 and 30, respectively). The AC Joint and Instability/Dislocation disease groups had the highest percentage of active duty patients (63.8% and 67.5%, respectively), compared to the others which ranged from 22.4% to 47.3%. Across all diagnostic groups, patients were mainly enlisted members (ranging from 70.4% to 76.9%; compared to officers) within the Army (37.5–43.1%; compared to the other service branches).

Supplemental Table 3 reports patient characteristics based on the location of the initial shoulder care (military or private sector clinic). Patients with missing sex were all initially seen in military clinics. Patients whose initial care occurred in the military clinics had a lower mean age compared to patients with initial care occurring in private sector clinics (38 vs 46, respectively). As expected, a higher percentage of active-duty service members were seen in military versus private sector clinics (63% vs 17%), compared to fewer dependent (18.3% vs 47.5%) and retired service members (13.4% vs 28.3%).

Diagnostic Imaging (Aim 1)

A majority of the cohort never received diagnostic imaging (76.7% overall), but there was variability in imaging use among diagnostic groups (Supplemental Table 4). For example, 61.4% of patients with OA and 73.5% with multiple diagnoses had at least one imaging procedure. Radiographs were the most common imaging (18.3% overall), except for the multiple diagnoses group receiving equal radiographs and MRIs (53.6% and 53.0% respectively). Advanced imaging was most common for the multiple diagnoses group (53.6%), followed by OA (22.8%), rotator cuff (17.4%), and instability/dislocation disorders (12.4%). When examining the order of imaging services among patients who used imaging services, 34.4% of the patients with multiple diagnoses had a radiograph first, 27.1% had only a radiograph, 27% had only advanced imaging, and 11.1% had advanced imaging prior to a radiograph. Of the patients who used imaging services, the percentage of patients with advanced imaging first was the highest in the multiple diagnoses group (11.1%), followed by the rotator cuff group (5.5%) and Hypomobility/Adhesive Capsulitis disease group (3.5%). Advanced imaging prior to radiograph occurred for only <3% of those in all other diagnostic groups.

Pharmacologic and Nonpharmacologic Treatments (Aim 1)

Supplemental Table 4 summarizes pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments by the shoulder diagnosis groups. NSAIDs were the most common pharmacological treatment across the entire cohort, with 10.4% receiving at least one prescription. Within the diagnostic groups, almost 13% or higher received an NSAID prescription in hypomobility/adhesive capsulitis, OA, and multiple diagnoses groups. This was closely followed by steroid injections with 10.2% overall, and within the diagnostic groups, >20% for rotator cuff, OA, and multiple diagnoses groups. Opioid prescriptions were filled by 8.4% of the patients overall, but within the diagnostic groups >10% in hypomobility/adhesive capsulitis, OA, and multiple diagnoses groups. Benzodiazepine prescriptions were the least common, with only 3.6% of the cohort receiving this medication. Among those who had at least one prescription of NSAIDS or opioid, the mean numbers of NSAIDS or opioid prescriptions were around 5 or 3 for all diagnostic groups, respectively. Among those who had at least one steroid joint injection, the mean number was 1 across all diagnostic groups.

Physical therapy was received by 31% of the cohort. Specific elements included therapeutic exercise (32.2% having at least one occurrence), followed by manual therapy (19.7%), and passive treatments (13.7%). Those who received therapeutic exercise or physical therapy had a mean number of around 5 sessions, with the diagnostic groups of Hypomobility/Adhesive capsulitis and multiple diagnosis groups having the most sessions. Acupuncture was used for 0.4% of the cohort, thus limiting the ability to explore variation across different diagnostic groups.

Differences in Military and Civilian Care Settings (Aim 2)

Supplemental Table 5 compares HCRU between patients initially seen in civilian and military clinics. Figure 1 illustrates the percentages of patients utilizing at least one pharmacological treatment by diagnostic groups and location of the initial shoulder care encounter (military or private sector clinic). Receipt of pharmacological treatments was relatively similar between clinic types within the same disease group, except for a few instances. NSAIDs were filled about 3% more often for private sector shoulder care compared to military clinics for patients with rotator cuff disorders, AC joint, instability/dislocation, and non-specific diagnosis. The percentages of patients using opioids were higher by 1–2% when care was initiated in a private sector clinic compared to a military clinic for all diagnostic groups except for Hypomobility/Adhesive capsulitis and OA. Patients with rotator cuff disorders, Hypomobility/Adhesive capsulitis, and multiple diagnoses were more likely to have received at least one steroid joint injection if shoulder care was initiated in the private sector compared to military clinics (28.1% vs 16%; 18.6% vs 13.3%; and 41.2% vs 32.0%, respectively).

Across all diagnostic groups, care initiated in a military clinic was more likely to consist of at least one session of a non-pharmacological treatment compared to care initiated in a private sector clinic (Figure 2). However, manual therapy was similar across both settings for Hypomobility/Adhesive capsulitis and multiple diagnoses groups. On the other hand, if care was initiated in a private sector clinic, patients were more likely to have received an advanced imaging or X-ray than if care was initiated in a military clinic (Figure 3).

Discussion

Shoulder conditions are highly prevalent in both military and civilian populations and are a common reason to seek healthcare. This comparative analysis of shoulder diagnostic groups provided novel data on HCRU patterns that, to the best of our knowledge, had not been previously described at the health system level. For example, shoulder disorders have the highest rates of diagnostic imaging compared to competing musculoskeletal conditions, like back, knee, or neck pain;18 yet guidance for imaging decision-making is often left to expert opinion for the shoulder.19 These findings provide patients, clinicians, and policy-makers the ability to identify overall prescription rates among commonly used modalities for the management of shoulder disorders. These data may be critical to establishing benchmarks and HCRU metrics that inform the development of value-based care pathways in this population.

In this cohort, there were relatively low rates of diagnostic imaging (almost 77% of the cohort received none) and low prescription rates for opioids and steroid injections (each ≤10%). Furthermore, the variability observed in the HCRU largely coincided with what would be considered clinically appropriate for a given diagnostic group. For example, the multiple diagnoses group had the highest rates for advanced diagnostic imaging, steroid injections, and physical therapy. Relative to the other diagnostic groups, these higher rates appear justified given the multiple diagnoses group likely represents individuals with more complex cases.

There were some HCRU patterns, however, that indicated an opportunity for improvement. The limited use of acupuncture as a non-pharmacologic treatment was one notable finding, given that the treatment modality has been used to improve short-term shoulder outcomes.20 Another interesting finding is that large differences in military and civilian clinics were noted in the use of imaging, steroid injections, and physical therapy for specific diagnostic subgroups. These differences provide circumstantial evidence that system-level factors may facilitate care decisions.11,21 For example, in civilian clinics, higher reimbursement could lead to greater use of diagnostic imaging and steroid injections, while copayments could be a barrier to the use of physical therapy.

The strengths of this analysis include a large sample size of both military and civilian care recipients, likely one of the largest existing samples for shoulder disorders. This analysis also used data collected from a closed single-payer healthcare system, increasing the likelihood it represents a true reflection of actual care received. Comparisons to the existing literature are challenging because our approach investigated HCRU patterns along with increased granularity in shoulder diagnostic groups. A study by Joo et al6 described healthcare use for three different shoulder diagnostic groups (ie, adhesive capsulitis, rotator cuff syndrome, and shoulder impingement syndrome) from National Health Insurance (Korea) claims data. However, their focus was on describing the location, provider type, and cost of service making difficult direct comparisons with our cohort. Another study from Leggit et al22 assessed shoulder disorders across this same health system in fiscal year 2014. They reported 55,643 individuals that met study inclusion, with 75.3% undergoing radiological assessment and 91% being prescribed pain medications.22 However, case assessment was limited to only ICD-9 codes, and they did not investigate patterns based on diagnostic groups or differentiate between care in military versus civilian clinics. When considering these results within the context of a theoretical framework for orthopedic hospitals, our data were best aligned with one domain (provision of sustainable medical care services), while less informative for other domains (organizational management, economic, environmental, and social).23

There are some limitations to consider. First, our sample included cases from the years 2013–2019 which may not represent current practices. We intentionally chose the time frame to exclude years overlapping with the COVID pandemic because of the disruption in ambulatory care. More recent years were not yet available for analysis. Second, we used a washout period to avoid prior care seeking; but there remains a possibility these findings do not represent their true initial index shoulder visit for all patients. Another important limitation to consider when interpreting these findings is that over-the-counter medications and healthcare visits outside of civilian/military clinics may not be captured. No costs for care in the MHS versus the likely need to fund additional care out of pocket makes over the counter medication use less likely. However, due to this limitation, we cannot directly comment on any rates or differences in rates for over-the-counter medication use. Finally, medication prescriptions could not be directly linked to a diagnosis, so the shoulder disorder could not validated as the primary reason for the order.

Conclusion

This study describes the use of care for different shoulder diagnostic groups and adds to the existing literature by comprehensively describing patterns within a large health system; one of the first studies to describe care at this level of detail for this highly prevalent musculoskeletal condition. Collectively, care patterns were congruent across military and civilian clinics with notable exceptions being much higher imaging rates and steroid injection use in civilian clinics and higher physical therapy use in military clinics. These findings suggest that policies in the MHS may facilitate clinical practices that are more likely to be consistent with existing practice guidelines, especially with regard to use of imaging, steroid injection, and physical therapy. However, future research is needed in this area to determine what are the definitive or primary drivers for the care variability observed in this cohort study.",https://www.dovepress.com/assets/img/addon/og_logo.png,N,0.0,2025-12-09 12:56:39.775726

Are you on active duty but live far away from your nearest military dental clinic? Or do you need dental care that your military dental clinic can’t provide?

You should know that TRICARE offers the Active Duty Dental Program. This program allows active duty service members to get care through civilian providers under certain circumstances. The ADDP helps catch problems early and prevents them from becoming more serious.

“Knowing when to see a civilian dentist can save time and prevent complications,” said Douglas Elsesser, dental program analyst, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “ADDP guides you to the right dental care without unnecessary delays. It helps make sure you get the care that you need, when you need it.”

Who can get care through the ADDP

The ADDP is available to all ADSMs. It also covers National Guard and Reserve members who are on active duty for more than 30 consecutive days. Some members in early activation, the Transitional Assistance Management Program, or in line of duty status also qualify.

How you get care depends on where you’re stationed and if you’re remotely located.

CONUS:

You’re remotely located if you live and work more than 50 miles away from a military dental clinic.

Not remote? You can see a civilian dentist through the ADDP with a referral from your military dental clinic.

OCONUS: You must be enrolled in TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas.

When to use civilian dental care

Military dental clinics are the main providers of dental care for ADSMs. However, they can’t always provide every type of treatment. Also, not every service member is stationed close to one. In those cases, the ADDP lets you see a civilian dentist at no cost, as long as you follow the ADDP rules.

You may be eligible to see a civilian dentist through ADDP in two situations:

Remote locations: You’re assigned to a duty station more than 50 miles from a military dental clinic.

Care unavailable at your military dental clinic: Your military dental clinic doesn’t offer the dental services you need and will refer you out.

Getting an Appointment Control Number

Before scheduling with a civilian dentist, you’ll need an Appointment Control Number.

An ACN allows TRICARE to pay for your civilian dental visit under the ADDP. You must have one before getting care outside a military dental clinic.

If you already have an authorization or referral: Your authorization letter will list your ACN. You can find this letter in your ADDP My Account.

If you don’t have an authorization or referral: You may still be able to request your own ACN for routine dental care. The needed care must meet these criteria:

It’s a covered benefit.

It costs less than $750 per procedure or appointment.

It totals no more than $1,500 in a 12-month period.

It’s scheduled with a network dentist (CONUS).

Do you need specialty care? Or do your costs exceed these limits? You’ll need authorization from your civilian dentist, as described in the Active Duty Dental Program Handbook. You can find more details on ACNs and other program rules in the handbook.

How to request an ACN

Submit an ACN Request Form online (fastest option, CONUS only).

A recent study led by researchers at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU) has found that nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs) deliver care for mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in the Military Health System (MHS) at significantly lower costs than primary care physicians (PCPs), with no clear compromise in quality.

brain injury. (Photo credit: Tom Balfour, USU)

Released online in the October 2025 issue of Value in Health, the study examined more than a decade of data from the Military Data Repository, analyzing care encounters from 2011 to 2021 for active-duty service members, retirees, and military dependents diagnosed with mTBI.

According to the findings, both PAs and NPs provided care at per-patient cost savings ranging from $53 to over $275 when compared to PCPs, depending on the patient’s risk category and whether they were new or existing patients. Among dependent populations, PAs and NPs were also associated with significant savings.

“Our research highlights the important and growing role that nurse practitioners and physician assistants play in military medicine,” said lead author Dr. Patrick Richard of USU’s F. Edward Hébert School of Medicine. “In a healthcare environment facing ongoing shortages of primary care physicians, these results suggest that advanced practice providers are a cost-effective and viable solution—particularly for treating common conditions like mild traumatic brain injury.”

While the cost advantages were clear, the study revealed mixed outcomes when it came to quality. For example, PAs were found to order fewer brain and spine imaging scans—an evidence-based practice—when treating high-risk new patients, but also conducted fewer depression assessments in the same group. NPs, on the other hand, performed more neuropsychological testing for high-risk existing patients and were associated with fewer hospital readmissions among low-risk new patients in the dependent population.

The study was supported by the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program and the USU Center for Health Services Research. It leveraged the unique structure of the MHS, where NPs and PAs often provide care independently, allowing for a natural comparison of provider types without the confounding influence of patient self-selection.

In addition to Dr. Richard, co-authors of the study include researchers from USU’s Graduate School of Nursing, the National Intrepid Center of Excellence, Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine, and Brown University.

As the signature injury of recent military conflicts, traumatic brain injury—particularly mild forms—remains a top health concern within the Department of War. The results of this study could inform staffing models, training priorities, and policy decisions aimed at maximizing readiness while controlling healthcare costs.

“These findings not only reinforce the value of non-physician providers in delivering efficient care,” said Dr. Richard, “but also identify specific areas where clinical practice guidelines and provider education can help optimize outcomes.""",https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg81EDCUBaAfczSf6ANFkecdXkbGJMBBpKoQC_Ca8A3LFMbk_VTJ8P96IwCIoChT0h0lflh6xtnO7t8fOKiTWqU_LqbCZxMY-veaeTjAejKhYbWBX4vNTRjZGdnVHUTnc9iPnbtG-T7S7NbzeJ8GQ41E9-zUV4SgbabMjoph2N1yxjXx_Vmajq0IL0YWK4/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/cropBM%202024%20(1).jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-09 11:56:51.384257

Currently, service members’ Tricare insurance only covers fertility services for military members whose infertility was caused by a serious or severe illness or injury while on active duty.

The Washington Post: ‘Forever Chemicals’ Could Cause More Infant Deaths And Preterm Births

Mothers in New Hampshire who were downstream of sites contaminated with “forever chemicals” experienced triple the rate of infant deaths and had more premature births or babies with low birth weights, according to a new study released Monday. The analysis by a team of economists, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, sampled data from more than 11,000 births between 2010 and 2019. Researchers looked at how per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS, affected fetal health after these chemicals contaminated the drinking water supply. (Ajasa, 12/9)

The 19th: Why Are So Many Americans Worried About Falling Birth Rates?

Half of Americans think we should be at least somewhat worried about the impact of falling birth rates on society, according to the 2025 19th News/SurveyMonkey Poll fielded in September. Mary Aured, a 65-year-old based in Florida, indicated in the poll that she was “very worried” about the country’s falling birth rate and told The 19th: “I’m desperately afraid that there will not be a generation that can support the generation above it.” (Padilla and Mithani, 12/8)

Post-Tribune: Experts Debate New Infants In The Workplace Policy In Indiana Government

Taking care of a newborn child is a “full-time job,” said a women’s health professional. “Coupling that with returning to work could be really difficult for some people to do,” said Usha Ranji, associate director of KFF’s Women’s Health Policy Program. “Getting work done while you’re caring for anything is difficult.” Indiana Gov. Mike Braun, on Tuesday, announced a “Family First Workplace” policy that would allow some state employees to bring their infants to work until they are six months old. (Wilkins, 12/6)

“This victory shows us a sensitivity to that.” (Polling has found that an overwhelming majority of Americans support access to IVF.)
It’s Speaker Johnson and his key staffers in his office,” Duckworth told NOTUS.
“This is a religious opposition to it, and it’s sad that they’re doing it in the dark of night, you know, behind closed doors.” Some Republicans, however, lamented the removal of the IVF provision from the bill.
“The people I’ve talked to in the administration have said very explicitly, you know, these concerns have been heard, these moral concerns,” Pavone told NOTUS.”","Republicans loudly declared in 2024 they backed access to in vitro fertilization, even changing their party’s platform to highlight their support.

But little has been done to actually deliver on those campaign promises. And when lawmakers unveiled over the weekend the final negotiated language for the National Defense Authorization Act, a provision that was passed in both the House and Senate versions requiring insurance coverage of IVF for active-duty service members was missing.

Anti-abortion leaders, who have long opposed IVF over the practice of discarding embryos, are now declaring victory.

“When you have a significant, and I would call it a significant portion of the public having moral concerns about this … let’s be sensitive to that,” Frank Pavone, the national director of Priests for Life, told NOTUS. “This victory shows us a sensitivity to that.” (Polling has found that an overwhelming majority of Americans support access to IVF.)

Kristi Hamrick, vice president of media and policy for Students for Life of America, added in a statement that “more pre-born lives are lost in IVF than abortion.”

“IVF is not an industry that deserves blanket support and funding,” Hamrick continued. “We can do better.”

Tricare, the Pentagon’s health care program for service members, currently does not cover IVF or other assisted reproductive technologies.

The provision stripped from the NDAA would have required Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to “ensure that fertility-related care for a member of the uniformed services on active duty (or a dependent of such a member) shall be covered under TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select.”

Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a Democratic member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who championed the IVF provision, last week urged President Donald Trump to stop Speaker Mike Johnson from removing the provision from the bill. At the time, a Johnson spokesperson told NOTUS the speaker is “supportive of access to IVF when sufficient pro-life protections are in place.”

The White House did not respond to NOTUS’ request for comment on whether it supported the IVF measure.

Advancing American Freedom, a conservative group led by former Vice President Mike Pence, released a memo celebrating the removal of the provision: “Many pro-life Americans are opposed to IVF because the standard process destroys human embryos.”

“Mike Johnson is an effective Speaker because he is taking public arrows for his team. The majority of the Republican conference is pro-life and understands that this controversial provision should have never been in NDAA in the first place,” John Shelton, the group’s policy director, said in a statement.

Similarly, Lila Rose, president of Live Action, thanked Johnson for “ensuring TRICARE was not used to subsidize this destruction of life.”

While anti-abortion advocates were quick to say they won the battle, Senate Republicans involved in the discussions on the NDAA language were fairly tight-lipped as to exactly why the IVF provision was suddenly removed from the bill. When asked about the issue, The chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Roger Wicker, told NOTUS, “I can’t speak to that.”

Sen. Markwayne Mullin said the provision was removed as a negotiating tool, as senators considered what compromises could be made to “get this thing passed.”

“I think it’s got a chance to find its way back in, but it ought to be clean, because there was other language attached that caused it to be, what we call, a poison pill,” Mullin continued. He declined to say what language Republicans opposed because “we’re still negotiating.”

Duckworth scoffed at Mullin’s explanations for why the clause was excluded, adding that the move was not exactly surprising because the provision was also eliminated at the last minute from the NDAA last year.

“It passed out of the House; it passed out of the Senate committee; it passed out of both chambers; I negotiated in committee, it passed. It’s Speaker Johnson and his key staffers in his office,” Duckworth told NOTUS. “This is a religious opposition to it, and it’s sad that they’re doing it in the dark of night, you know, behind closed doors.”

Some Republicans, however, lamented the removal of the IVF provision from the bill.

“It’s not the way that I would do it,” Sen. Mike Rounds — who said he’d “personally” like to see the provision reinstated — told reporters. “But remember that a bill this size and this critical will have to have a consensus approach to it. If the House doesn’t have a consensus, or if the White House doesn’t have an agreement on it, we still need the rest of the bill.”

“While the bill is not as good as it could be, it’s still better than not passing the bill,” Rounds continued.

Back in October, after months of speculation on how Trump would fulfill his campaign promise to make IVF free, the president announced a plan to lower the prices of a commonly used fertility drug and encouraged employers to offer IVF coverage for employees — though he did not offer any incentives to insurance companies or employers to do so.

The plan fell short of his proposal to fully cover IVF costs — and some anti-abortion advocates took that as an indication that the administration and Republicans were listening.

“Volunteers bring wisdom, experience, and compassion into our facility,” said Col.

Spearheading the effort is Master Sgt. Anthony Eberly, who assumed leadership of the program in early 2024 following a prolonged vacancy in the coordinator position.

“When I stepped into the role, the program hadn’t had a full-time lead since 2022,” Eberly said. “Despite that, several long-standing volunteers remained dedicated, keeping things afloat. But we knew it could be so much more, with a little structure and a lot of heart.”

Since then, the program has expanded significantly growing from 42 active volunteers contributing 545 hours in Oct. 2023 to 84 volunteers providing 1,171 hours in Oct. 2025. This doubling of personnel and more than 100% increase in volunteer hours reflects a deliberate effort to strengthen patient support and enhance clinical efficiency across the 59th Medical Wing.

“Volunteers fill critical gaps, especially when military or civilian manpower isn’t available,” Eberly said. “They answer phones, help transport patients, escort families, and provide information to visitors who might otherwise be waiting or confused. It’s about enhancing the entire experience.”

The strategic revamp of the program led to a greater community impact while revitalization led to several new initiatives:

• Step Saver Program: Relaunched in partnership with the Safety Office, volunteers now assist in transporting over 2,000 patients annually between the parking lot and clinic.

• Teen Volunteer Opportunities: A new youth outreach component enables volunteers as young as 14 to gain service hours while contributing to healthcare support.

• Red Cross Partnership: A renewed collaboration brings Red Cross support back into WHASC and other JBSA locations.

• Streamlined Onboarding: Onboarding timelines have been reduced to as little as two weeks for many roles, making it easier for newcomers to get started.

• Expanded Roles: Volunteers now serve across 31 departments, including laboratory, pharmacy, PACU, and the front desk.

Beyond administrative duties, volunteers now average over 800 annual patient escorts and assist more than 900 patients traveling between clinics and parking lots. Additionally, they answer more than one in four patient inquiries by phone or in person—filling a vital communication role.

“This program has become a lifeline not just for our patients, but for our clinics,” Eberly added. “We’ve also opened the door for Airmen and Guardians in casual status—those waiting for reassignment or training—to step in and support our mission.”

Recent retirees from military service also make up a growing portion of the volunteer base, including former physicians who wish to continue contributing to the military community.

“Volunteers bring wisdom, experience, and compassion into our facility,” said Col. Karen Buikema, Lackland Medical Support Group deputy commander. “Their dedication is a reflection of what service truly means and we’re grateful for every one of them.”

How to Join:

Volunteer Services welcomes individuals age 14 and older. Those interested in serving at one of the Wing’s San Antonio clinic locations can contact MSgt. Eberly directly at anthony.j.eberly2.mil@health.mil to schedule an appointment and learn about next steps.

""Above all, I’m incredibly grateful for our dedicated and passionate volunteers,” added Buikema. “They give not just their time, but their hearts. That’s what makes them extraordinary.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2512/9429292/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-09 05:56:46.066153

It’s amazing, I had fehb which is comparable with coverage but it was double what I paid in tricare. Only other ppl that had better health insurance than tricare was if they were in a good union or defense contracting where they paid for it all.

It’s absolutely worth it if you need regular healthcare. I had a high deductible plan with a HSA through my employer for awhile and it was great until me and my family members had a string of hospital visits that completely drained 2 years worth of HSA savings and I still ended up having to pay thousands out of pocket. I switched to Tricare reserves select after that and have had many hospital visits, procedures, and prescriptions and have paid almost nothing out of pocket. The monthly premium is about the same as my current employers plan too

Tricare reserve select is truly a Cadillac healthcare plan and generally will be better than most healthcare plans provided by employers. The low premiums combined with a Catastrophic Cap of no more than $4,635 is really great. You also have the ability to go to a Military treatment facility on a space available basis.

Now I will say I would explore what the provider base is for the plan especially if you live in a non military area. Also check with your primary care provider to see if they take tricare.",,N,0.0,2025-12-09 02:56:45.761994

The total reimbursement to the provider is the same, but with INN you would just have a copay.

They would then process the claim (assuming deductible is met) with you paying $25, them paying $75, and the provider writing off $100.
If they send less then you just pay 25% of whatever that amount is after Tricare finishes processing.","I'm not sure where you're seeing 75% of the allowed charges at, as unless there's been a change for 2026, Tricare reimburses based on a federal fee schedule that's the same for INN and OON. I haven't had a chance to look at Tricare's 2026 rates yet so I don't know the amount for 97530 (the code that will most likely be used for OT) that would be allowed. What I think that 75% means is Tricare will pay 75%, and you'll pay 25% (coinsurance), after your deductible is met. The total reimbursement to the provider is the same, but with INN you would just have a copay.

If you go with Tricare as secondary, then it'll still be that 25/75 split (after the deductible), but the amounts will be based off the patient responsibility assigned by BCBS, up to the maximum allowed by Tricare. So let's say BCBS allows $200 and assigns all $200 to PR, but Tricare's max allowed is $100. They would then process the claim (assuming deductible is met) with you paying $25, them paying $75, and the provider writing off $100. If BCBS applies nothing to PR, then Tricare doesn't get billed.

Now, OON providers may balance bill you UP TO 115% of the Tricare allowable. So instead of writing off $100, the provider could choose to write off $85 and bill you for $40 instead of just $25. However I don't know of any providers who actually do this, as generally Tricare (especially Select) is a no muss, no fuss, super easy to deal with payor so we like to stay in the good graces of Tricare patients. At least Tricare East is.

I handle the commerical insurance coding, billing, contracting, and follow ups for a pediatric therapy office (which includes OT), feel free to ask anything else you want clarification on.

-edit- I just noticed you mentioned that provider is the only one who does the services your son requires. If that's the case, the provider may be able to get a pre-authorization under the consideration that they're the only option, which would then have your claims processed as INN. I think. I've never actually done this with a Select plan, as there are numerous INN providers in my area, but with our Tricare Prime patients we have to get a pre-authorization, which then results in the claims processing as INN. That may be something to look into, assuming the PR from BCBS would be excessive.

-edit 2- so I just checked Health.mil and it doesn't appear reimbursement is changing for 2026, so if the Therapist is an actual Doctor (MD, DO) then the price per unit of 97530 (in TX as a whole, though I don't think the amount will change per Zip since this amount is the same as NC) will be $33.02. If they're an Occupational Therapist, then it's $28.06. Each unit is 15 minutes, so pediatrics OT is usually 4 units, an hour session. I'm going to assume the OT is just a therapist, not a Dr, so that puts the allowed amount for treatment at $112.24, meaning at a 25% coinsurance you would pay, well, $28.06. This is if Tricare is billed as primary, or if BCBS sends more than $112.24 to patient responsibility. If they send less then you just pay 25% of whatever that amount is after Tricare finishes processing.

Honestly, if it were me personally, I'd drop BCBS and put the money you would spend on premiums into savings or something. Tricare is a pain to deal with as a patient sometimes, but Select is much more lenient than Prime and unless the BCBS plan is self-funded (paid by the employer), just Tricare alone is going to come out far cheaper for you.",,N,0.0,2025-12-08 20:56:34.527663

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye disease that affects your central vision, impacting sight for objects directly in front of you. It is a common age-related eye condition that occurs mostly in people over the age of 50. An estimated 20 million American adults have some form of AMD.

The macula is the central section of your retina, which is the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of your eye. The retina captures light and converts it into electrical signals your brain interprets as images (or vision).

Potential signs of AMD include:

Blurry vision.

A decrease or loss of central vision, including grayed out, dark, or missing areas.

Trouble recognizing familiar faces.

The misjudgment of spatial distances, sometimes resulting in bumping into walls, steps, or other obstacles.

Straight lines appearing wavy or broken.

[RELATED: MOAA's TRICARE Guide]

Eighty percent of those with AMD develop the “dry” version. That’s when parts of the macula thin with age and tiny clumps of protein, called drusen, grow.

The “wet” version is less common but more serious. It occurs when new, abnormal blood vessels grow under the retina. These vessels might leak blood or other fluids, causing scarring of the macula. Vision deteriorates faster with wet AMD.

AMD might develop in one or both eyes with different levels of severity but does not impact peripheral vision. Risk factors other than age include obesity, smoking, and more.

Regular eye examinations can help detect the onset of AMD. TRICARE covers routine exams every two years. Most separate vision insurance policies include at least one annual eye exam.

Medicare and TRICARE cover medically necessary treatments and diagnostic services for AMD. This includes anti-VEGF injections (which stands for “vascular endothelial growth factor”) and low-vision aids for wet AMD, along with preventive care.

[RELATED: How Much Will Your Medicare Part B Premium Rise in 2026?]

Photodynamic therapy, which combines eye injections and laser treatment, can help slow or halt the advance of the disease.

Dry AMD can turn into wet AMD. One low-vision aid that can help determine if your AMD is progressing is the Amsler grid. This is a square containing a grid pattern and a dot in the center. It can point to deteriorating spots in your field of vision.

There is no cure for AMD, but low-vision devices and technology can help maintain vision and improve your quality of life.",https://www.moaa.org/contentassets/ffa2e6acbfa446369703b4af9eb5fb96/eye-exam-h.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-08 18:56:35.295234

Kentucky Health News

Year two of the state’s Our Healthy Kentucky Home campaign will focus on the various programs and resources available to all Kentuckians that work to improve health.

November kicked off the second year of the campaign, with a focus on community health workers, who act as liaisons between health care providers and patients, improving communication, facilitating access to services and educating individuals on health-related issues.

This month, the campaign highlights Kynect, the state’s one-stop website that helps Kentuckians connect with essential support services, including the state-based marketplace for federally subsidized health insurance.

Kentucky’s health secretary, Dr. Steven Stack, reminded Kentuckians that open enrollment for federally subsidized health insurance plans on Kynect runs through Jan. 15. During this time, consumers can purchase a new plan or change plans for coverage year 2026.

Kentucky residents who don’t have coverage through an employer, Medicare, Medicaid, the Kentucky Children’s Health Insurance Program, or the Pentagon’s Tricare program can shop for individual coverage on Kynect.

To qualify for coverage beginning Jan. 1, Kentuckians need to sign up for their health plan by Dec. 15. Coverage for Kentuckians who enroll from Dec. 16 through Jan. 15 will start Feb. 1.

To sign up for coverage, Kentuckians can visit kynect.ky.gov or call 855-459-6328. The website also offers a prescreening tool to see if your family may be eligible for benefits.

Stack also encouraged Kentuckians to reach out to a “kynector” for help choosing a health plan that best suits their needs.

“These are trained professionals who provide free and unbiased guidance to help you enroll in health coverage and benefits, such as Medicaid, Kentucky Children’s Health Insurance Plan, qualified health plans and nutrition or child care assistance programs,” he said. “Licensed insurance agents can also assist at no cost to you in choosing a good plan for you.

“Whether you’re looking for an individual plan, family coverage or help paying your premiums, now is the time to act and let Kynect help link you to trusted options.”

Information about kynectors and licensed insurance agents can be found under the “Get Local Help” tab at the top of the Kynect website page.

Stack said 90,000 Kentuckians got insurance last year during the open enrollment period and so far this year, that number is just over 80,000.

“So we’ve got just under six weeks to close that gap and try to make sure that even more Kentuckians this year get coverage through the open enrollment period than last,” he said.

At a Nov. 18 ThriveKY meeting, David Verry, assistant director with the state’s Division of Health Plan Oversight, said that despite the loss of the enhanced tax credits that are set to expire on Dec. 31 if Congress doesn’t act to extend them, Kynect is “open for business” and that the process to enroll is the same as it has been before.

In addition to being able to apply for health insurance, including Medicaid and qualified health plans, Kynect is where Kentuckians sign up for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, apply for childcare assistance through the Child Care Assistance Program, get energy and heating help through the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, and find mental health, employment, housing and transportation resources through the community resource portal.

And with a nod to the first year of the Our Healthy Kentucky Home campaign, Stack said the state will continue its efforts to promote simple, attainable lifestyle changes and goals to help Kentuckians achieve better health and wellness, such as eating at least two servings or fruits and vegetables every day, exercising at least 30 minutes three times per week, and remaining socially engaged to stay socially connected.",https://lexingtonky.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/kynect_Overarching.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-08 15:57:09.078737

On Sunday, US lawmakers released the annual defense policy bill authorizing a record $901 billion in national defense spending in 2026. The bill was somehow $8 billion more than President Trump requested, and bans transgender women from competing in sports at military universities.

The 3,086-page bill states that the secretary of defense will ensure military academies do not permit a person “whose sex is male to participate in an athletic program or activity that is designated for women or girls.” The text codifies “sex” as “a person’s reproductive biology and genetics at birth.”

The bill has already been negotiated between Republicans and Democrats and is set to go to a House vote this week, likely leaving little room for significant changes.

But the new version does drop the ban on Defense Department funding on gender-affirming surgeries. Previous versions passed by both the House and the Senate incorporated the ban.

The House bill approved in September also prohibited gender transition services for family members through the Exceptional Family Member Program: “No gender transition procedures, including surgery or medication, may be provided to a minor dependent child through an EFMP.”

Last year’s National Defense Authorization Act restricted TRICARE, the health care program that provides civilian health benefits for US military personnel, their dependents, and retirees, from covering “certain medical procedures for children that could result in sterilization.”

The NDAA is must-pass legislation as it sets the defense budget and determines the policies it will apply to each year. NDAA laws from previous fiscal years thus have a knock-on effect, opening the door for lawmakers to flood the new bill with anti-trans provisions that would likely not pass on their own and force Democrats to block them while on limited time.

The House bill that was passed in September contains several anti-LGBT amendments in addition to the ban on “gender transition procedures” for servicemembers’ children. Many of Rep. Nancy Mace’s (R-S.C.) proposed additions were adopted—including prohibiting coverage for “gender-related medical treatment,” defined to include puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgeries, as well as mental health care for transgender young people and requiring the use of single-sex facilities such as restrooms and locker rooms according to their “reproductive system.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP221164851522011.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,0.0,2025-12-08 15:57:13.415506

“Speaker Johnson just stole the opportunity for service members to build their families through IVF, putting his personal beliefs over their dreams,” Jacobs said in a statement on Sunday.
“Like any American, Speaker Johnson is fully entitled to hold personal views on IVF and to make his own family building decisions accordingly,” Tipton said.
Julie Eshelman, founder, CEO and president of the Building Military Families Network, said in a statement to Military.com that Johnson’s message is “clear” and that military families’ goals of having a family by way of IVF are not as valued.
“Military families have waited far too long to access the full range of medical care needed to build their families.","House Speaker Mike Johnson praised the final version of the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) bill text released Sunday, saying it further promotes President Donald Trump’s “America First” agenda while eliminating a provision on IVF and undoing “woke” policies from the Biden administration.

The 3,086 page bill that could be voted on as soon as this week and typically passes Congress on bipartisan lines has a budget request that adds $8 billion to the $892.6 billion initially requested in Trump’s budget.

“This year’s National Defense Authorization Act helps advance President Trump and Republicans’ Peace Through Strength Agenda by codifying 15 of President Trump’s executive orders, ending woke ideology at the Pentagon, securing the border, revitalizing the defense industrial base, and restoring the warrior ethos,” Johnson said in a statement.

“This legislation includes important House-passed provisions to ensure our military forces remain the most lethal in the world and can deter any adversary. It roots out Biden-era wokeism in our military and restores merit-based promotions and admissions to service academies, prohibits contracts with partisan firms, counters antisemitism, and halts harmful, unnecessary programs like CRT, DEI, and climate initiatives,” the Speaker added.

NDAA Highlights

Johnson also noted the bill’s guardrails aimed to protect U.S. long-term investments, economic interests and sensitive data from adversaries like China.

Other highlights of the NDAA include the following:

Providing enlisted servicemembers with a 4% pay raise.

Strengthens U.S.-Israel military operations and cooperative missile defense programs.

Expanding counter-drone defenses and new technologies.

Advances the “Golden Dome” and enhances America’s nuclear deterrent and new nuclear power technologies.

Fully supports the deployment of National Guard and active-duty troops at the southwest border to intercept illegal immigrants and drugs.

Enhances U.S. defense initiatives in the Indo-Pacific to bolster Taiwan’s defense and support Indo-Pacific allies.

Revitalizes American shipbuilding and expands the Maritime Industrial Base.

Strengthens the defense industrial base and supply chains.

""The FY26 NDAA delivers on President Trump’s promise of peace through strength and ensures America can deter our adversaries and protect our homeland,” House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-AL) said in a statement. “This legislation builds on the wins from the Working Families Tax Cut, revitalizing our defense industrial base, improving our servicemembers’ quality of life, and building out critical warfighting capabilities.

“We’re also reforming the Pentagon’s broken, bureaucratic acquisition process so that our troops can quickly get the tools they need to deter our enemies, instead of waiting up to a decade while our adversaries field new technologies within months.”

IVF Provision Removal

Some Democrats and an array of reproductive organizations warned prior to the final version of the drafted bill text that the removal of a provision mandating health care coverage for assisted reproductive technology, including in vitro fertilization (IVF), for all active-duty service members was not going to make the cut.

They raised alarm that Johnson was targeting TRICARE, the insurance plan for service members and their families outside of military facilities that covers IVF for everyone regardless of health situations.

If it remains out of the version that passes Congress, it would prevent the expansion of IVF access to all servicemembers due to current insurance plans through TRICARE only covering fertility services for service members whose infertility was caused by “a serious or severe illness or injury while on active duty.”

Johnson made no mention of the IVF provision removal in his most recent statement. Military.com reached out to Johnson’s office for comment on that issue.

'Shame On Them'

Concerns expressed in Washington by Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-CA) ultimately came to fruition, at least as the bill is currently drawn.

“Republicans repeatedly make promises to the public that they support IVF, but their extreme actions tell a different story from their lip service during election years,” Duckworth said in a statement shared with Military.com. “Time and again when given the chance to make IVF available and affordable, they cave to far-right extremists who see families and their doctors as murderers. And for the second year in a row, our servicemembers are paying the price of that extremism.”

Duckworth focused her ire on Johnson and Trump, the latter for his various statements assuring to provide IVF to Americans at reduced or no cost. Trump referred to himself as the “father of IVF” while on the 2024 campaign trail.

“[Trump’s] proved he’s a deadbeat dad by not only failing to make IVF free for anyone but standing by as Speaker Johnson undermined one of his key campaign promises and stripped coverage from servicemembers behind closed doors that both the House and Senate approved. Shame on them,” Duckworth said.

She added that Johnson’s actions are “deeply hypocritical” considering that military heroes do not receive the same care and access that congressional members receive.

Duckworth and Jacobs earlier this year passed the TRICARE provisions on bipartisan votes in the Senate and House. Now, that’s in jeopardy.

“Speaker Johnson just stole the opportunity for service members to build their families through IVF, putting his personal beliefs over their dreams,” Jacobs said in a statement on Sunday. “It’s an unbelievably selfish and callous move against people who’ve served and sacrificed so much for us, especially when he and his own staff have access to health care plans that provide IVF coverage.

“I’m also disappointed that President Trump failed to do anything to change Speaker Johnson’s position on this issue despite his alleged love for our military and supposed support for IVF. But the fight isn’t over.”

When asked by Military.com whether she would still vote for a defense policy package that omits such IVF-related care, a spokesperson for Jacobs said the congresswoman is still reviewing the entire bill in full and that it remains undetermined whether she will support it.

“She did vote against it in committee and on the House Floor this year,” the spokesperson said. “I can’t speak for the caucus but the NDAA typically passes with bipartisan support.”

Other Legislative Avenues For IVF

National fertility and reproductive organizations lamented the final NDAA text, saying that if the bill forges on without aid for IVF then it puts Republicans at odds with the president’s own publicly stated remarks on the issue.

Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, said in a statement shared with Military.com that the final text implies ‘unilateral” decision making by Johnson himself.

“Like any American, Speaker Johnson is fully entitled to hold personal views on IVF and to make his own family building decisions accordingly,” Tipton said. “What he is not entitled to do is override the will of Congress and strip away a provision that was negotiated during committee markups and ultimately approved by both the House and Senate on the floor—particularly at the eleventh hour of NDAA negotiations and without transparency.

“Actions taken in this manner—out of sight, without debate, and contrary to broad bipartisan agreement—are precisely why public trust in today’s Congressional leadership has eroded.”

Should the provision be left out, Tipton suggested a standalone floor vote on the IVF for Military Families Act so that every congressional member’s vote could be on record for the American people to judge.

Julie Eshelman, founder, CEO and president of the Building Military Families Network, said in a statement to Military.com that Johnson’s message is “clear” and that military families’ goals of having a family by way of IVF are not as valued.

“Our military families already sacrifice so much for this country and denying them the same level of healthcare access that the Speaker himself has, is disrespectful to the brave men and women who are willing to sacrifice their lives and fertility in service to our country,” Eshelman said. “While we are deeply disappointed the IVF provision was excluded from the final version of the NDAA, we don't think Congress should delay passing it any further.”

Echoing Tipton, Eshelman said Congress can “still pass meaningful legislation to improve access to care and all family building options for military and veteran families” by voting for bills like the IVF for Military Families Act and the Veterans Infertility Treatment Act of 2025.

Danielle Melfi, CEO of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, said in a statement provided to Military.com that the removal of IVF coverage “is a dishonor to our servicemembers who make extraordinary sacrifices for our freedoms.”

“There was bipartisan support for this coverage, and its exclusion fails to advance President Trump’s call to expand IVF access,” Melfi said. “Military families have waited far too long to access the full range of medical care needed to build their families. RESOLVE will not stop fighting until every American has access to the care they need to build the family they dream of.”

Stand with Speaker Johnson Against Expanding IVF in Military Health Coverage: Do Pro-lifers Mean What They Say?

Sometimes there are issues with really big worldview significance that don’t get a lot of national attention, and they should because for one thing, today we’re going to be talking about a national issue that is a very important pro-life issue. This has to do with IVF, assisted reproductive technologies, IVF, in vitro fertilization. This is the process whereby the male and the female cell are brought together in a laboratory setting. Embryos are created. And in the general process, the general application of the IVF procedure, multiple embryos are made and that’s one of the big problems.

There’s a fundamental problem I would argue with alienating the process from the conjugal act, that is to say from the act of marriage. But the larger significance is the fact that pro-lifers have to look at the discarding and destruction of these embryos. Also, the sorting and quality screening of these embryos, something that is deeply, inherently, morally, murderously wrong. And the IVF is right now a very crucial issue in one particular respect. This has to do with TRICARE, the reauthorization for the medical coverage for military personnel in the US armed forces, particularly for medical facilities outside of the military facilities themselves.

Now, this is a big issue because you’re talking about millions of Americans within the US military covered by this. And you had people in both the House and in the Senate. Representative Sarah Jacobs in the House. Senator Tammy Duckworth in the Senate. They’ve been pressing for the full inclusion of IVF for all personnel. Now, this is really a much bigger issue than it may even sound at first. And it was Speaker Johnson who pulled this out of the authorization bill last year out of the insurance coverage for TRICARE. And he is doing it again and he is under direct fire. He deserves our support.

There’s a very important reason why at this juncture this has to take place. And the forces against the speaker are coming out in full force. And quite honestly, this is a situation that may well divide some Republicans. And indeed, one of the big questions is how President Donald Trump will respond to this himself. President Trump has identified himself with IVF treatments and has said that one of the goals of his administration is to make those treatments more available to American, he always says basically to American couples who want to have children. What is not even acknowledged in a lot of this conversation is that there are so many multiple issues, and one of them has to do with the fact that if you just put this out there available through, say, insurance policies, or in this case, this policy, this entire program for medical coverage for US military personnel, then there are going to have to be some strictures.

And the strictures thus far when it comes to IVF has been that IVF was available only to heterosexual couples when there was a military reason, an injury, or some other reason for why the IVF was made necessary. So it wasn’t just blanket IVF coverage, even for married heterosexual couples in the military. It was for some linkage to a military cause. And that has left some couples very frustrated, but it’s not just couples. And I want to point out something that several military advocacy sites have noted.

For example, military.com, which is a news site, reminds us of this, “A Biden era Defense Department policy in March 2024 expanded TRICARE eligibility for infertility treatments to unmarried service members and those needing donated eggs or sperm, adding onto a previous policy when the Department of Defense only offered such treatments to certain married service members.” So here’s 2024, President Biden, the Biden administration, enlarging that so that marriage isn’t an issue.

All right. So even then, however, there were some people who didn’t have access, and so listen to the next sentence, “Eggs or sperm donated by a third party were also prohibited by the Department of Defense at that juncture, effectively barring same-sex couples from the benefit.” Okay. So the way that it would stand if blanket coverage is given is that it would be blanket coverage. And that even means that individual service members, unmarried, who want to have a child by IVF could call upon this policy and upon this medical coverage.

This is a very, very important issue. This is where we either stand or fall when it comes to the pro life movement. And when pro life conviction, when people who hold to those convictions say very clearly that our belief is that life begins at fertilization and life is to be protected from the point of fertilization. And by the way, that’s the only logical point, it’s the only theologically viable point at which we can possibly make the argument. If you say it’s at some point thereafter, then all you have is an argument about which point, which could take you all the way up to the point of birth. And that’s exactly the way this argument has operated. This is the way the abortion argument has unfolded.

This is why we have to keep pressing back to an objectively true point. When life begins, when God says, “Let there be life,” and that point is when the sperm and the egg come together and we believe–let’s remind ourselves of this–we believe that that should take place within the context, the conjugal context of marriage, the union of a man and a woman before God. And at the very least, we should not be paying for. The very issue as to whether these things should be available legally. You know my position on that. But to force the American taxpayer to pay for it, even beyond that, is really a stretch. And in this case, I think we need to acknowledge that Speaker Mike Johnson who is already in a very difficult position, just because of the small margin that Republicans have in the house and all kinds of political pressures from within the Republicans themselves, we need to support Speaker Johnson in this particular effort. And those on the other side are going at him full bore. And they are also trying to work the Republican Party and they’re trying to work the White House into forcing the speaker to back down on this issue.

It reminds us of how important elections are. Every single election. The speaker of the House is elected to the House by his congressional district there in Louisiana. He is elected by fellow Republicans in the majority to the office of speaker. If Republicans aren’t the majority, he simply becomes the Republican leader. And what you’re looking at in this case is the fact that this is incredible political pressure and an incredibly delicate moment. And with so many other things piling on in terms of big issues at the end of the year, this is one of those issues that should have the attention of Christians and Christians need to understand what is at stake.

I have gone through page after page of legislative and media material on this going into the background. And I think most Christians and most pro lifers would be very surprised to know how long advocates for the inclusion of IVF have been working in terms of the US military. And sometimes from within the military, sometimes on behalf of military personnel. But we just need to recognize that we have multiple problems here and one of them is that once you even offer this, the question is, how do you exclude anyone? And long term, I think we all know, just look at the people pushing this, everyone will be included and everyone’s going to mean everyone.

And so we’re looking at multiple levels of moral collapse. It’s a subversion of marriage, it’s a subversion of sexual morality and it’s a subversion of the sanctity of human life. We just need to understand that on this issue, things are not moving in our direction. And that’s just something we need to recognize. The culture is pressing really hard on this issue. And I think of the president, for example, President Trump speaking about this, speaking of couples who want to have children, I understand he has the right heartfelt concern there.

But by the time this is put into law, by the way, it won’t even be restricted to couples, much less a man and a wife. The Supreme Court’s decision on same-sex marriage pretty much took care of that. It’s always been hard to have to show up all the time in defense of human life. It’s never been easy. And the things are getting more complicated all the time. And that just means we have to bring even more conviction and more clarity to these issues.

One other related issue, by the way, that’s just much lower, frankly, in terms of moral significance is the money because the cost of this, if it’s approved as Senator Duckworth and others have pushed, it will be astronomical. That’s not my main concern, but you would think of nothing else that would get the attention of some Republicans. It’s a big concern.

Part II

‘I Got Myself in Good Trouble’: Former President Biden Brags About His Contributions to the LGBTQ Revolution

All right. So we just talked about what the Biden administration had attempted to do on this issue in 2024. The former president is back in the news, and he’s back in the news because of an address he gave just in recent days to the LGBTQ+ Victory Institute. The New York Times defines that as, “An organization that supports LGBTQ people in public office.” The particular issue here is also the context. Former President Biden is in a very weak position at the present. He’s in a very weakened political position. Even people in his own party don’t generally want to be seen with him. He’s having difficulty raising money for a presidential library.

Democrats generally want to try to forget the Biden administration, at least in terms of the end, and they especially want to try to forget the 2024 presidential election. They want to just move on. And it’s also true that the former president is in a weakened physical condition. He’s fighting a diagnosis of advanced prostate cancer, and he’s had other issues as well. And so his appearances in public have been fairly rare. That makes this one even more important, more worthy of our attention.

As Amy Harmon reports, “Former President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. on Friday offered a defense of his support for transgender rights, addressing an issue that has prompted debate and soul searching among Democrats, some of whom attribute losses in 2024 to a focus on identity politics.” Well, okay. So a focus on identity politics, but you know what? The way that the article began was honest. It’s not just identity politics. It is the specific identity politics of the transgender movement. And there is no doubt that played out in a big way in the 2024 presidential election and also in other dimensions of that election.

It played apparently a lesser role in the 2025 off-year elections, but so those elections are not necessarily a bellwether of anything other than say a political direction party by party. The point is that President Biden was pushing the transgender agenda, just like he pushed the same sex marriage agenda ahead of his own party.

And so he was basically bragging to this group about the fact that he had in effect pushed former President Barack Obama, he was serving at that time as President Obama’s vice president into support for same-sex marriage, by mentioning it out loud before President Obama was prepared to. He said he basically didn’t regret that. He said, “I got myself in a bit of trouble, good trouble,” he said. But of course, all of this is reflective of the fact that you have to consider that the former President also had a very long, very long tenure in the United States Senate.

And then he ran for president, ran for president more than once, had to withdraw, was certainly not a leading candidate in the 2008 round, but ended up being chosen by Barack Obama who won the Democratic nomination as his vice president. Former President Biden has always been gaff prone and yet he’s also changed a lot of his positions. And you look at same-sex marriage, you’re looking an array of some of these issues, even some of the transgender issues, he knows he changed his positions in his view to get on the right side of history. And in this address Friday, he was speaking to a group that thought he was on the right side of history. They’re on the same side of this issue and pushing very, very hard.

It is really interesting to see what the former president had to say. And when it came to transgender issues, it’s really clear he was pushing them. No less than 16 members of his administration were publicly identified as transgender.

In his address, the claim was made that about 15% of his appointees identified as LGBTQ. Now, I’ll just point out that that’s a much higher percentage than activist groups have historically claimed for the LGBTQ percentage in the population. So that’s another way of saying. We all knew President Biden was sending a message. We knew that he knew he was sending a message and we, and he both knew what message he was sending. He came to this LGBTQ activist group on Friday to brag about that activism.

Biden was also proud of the fact that in 2022, he signed the Respect for Marriage Act, which was an attempt to try to put in place federal legislation. It was a successful attempt. The legislation passed. It doesn’t guarantee a right to marriage in all 50 states, but it says that every state must recognize a legally issued marriage certificate from a state that does approve of same-sex marriage, which means basically the same thing. You might not be able to get a same-sex marriage in every state if the Supreme Court’s decision on Obergefell were to be reversed. Of course, that’s out there in the future. The point is this was activism on the part of Congress, activism on the part of the White House, and they get it through in 2022.

I think it’s also important to look at some of the comments made here in this article, Evan Low, president and chief executive of this group, the LGBTQ+ Victory Institute, “Said that Mr. Biden had been intentional about understanding that a historically marginalized community can participate fully and openly in our democracy.” What you need to note there is the doubling down on identity politics because this is a group. By the way, groups don’t vote, citizens vote. They may be members of any number of groups and they still have the right to vote. This is really not about the right to vote. When they say participated democracy here, they’re talking about the affirmation of their sexual identity and their lifestyle.

We also read this, “Mr. Biden’s support for transgender rights stands in contrast to the Trump administration’s efforts to impose strict limits on transgender people, including requiring that US passports reflect the sex on people’s original birth certificates, a reversal of a decade’s old policy. Mr. Trump has called transgender teenagers, mutilated and barred transgender people from serving in the military, asserting that having a transgender identity is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of people who serve in the US military forces.”

It’s a very interesting point made here, by the way, that President Trump has appointed a number of openly gay men to his administration, but not transgendered individuals. It shows you something of a line in the Trump administration. It’s something of a line in the culture too, and this is where it is clear that the culture writ large is rethinking the T in LGBTQ and has been, especially when it comes to, say, private spaces such as locker rooms and bathrooms, and especially when it comes to males in those spaces, and when it comes to especially minors, to children and teenagers, but also to women in women’s sports, girls’ sports.

You’re looking at, let’s just say, very legitimate concerns and they have resonated with the American people. The Democratic Party, by the way, and this is also clear in the background to all of this, the Democratic Party recognizes that the transgender issue lost them a lot in 2024. They are at least claiming that they don’t think it lost them so much in 2025 and the recent off-year elections, and yet they’re not going to avoid having to deal with this issue in 2026 and in 2028, and especially in 2028, the next presidential round.

And so they can say, “We don’t want to make this an issue. We don’t think the American people want to make it an issue.” But it’s going to be really interesting to see how this argument shapes up in the larger context, the larger political and national context, because I don’t think most parents are going to become friendlier to the idea of boys on their girls team, or boys in the girls’ bathroom, or for that matter, men beating women in women’s sports. I don’t think that’s going to get better.

Now, that doesn’t mean that I think most Americans have a comprehensively healthy and accurate understanding of these things. I’m telling you that Christians have a reason for explaining there’s a moral intuition. We believe it’s put there by the creator. It’s in creation order, that is at least, well, it’s showing up in the resistance to the transgender agenda and it’s showing up in a big way. So much so that we see an interesting development, we’ll talk about more on briefings to come in which you have some gay men in particular who are now openly complaining about transgender identity being lumped into one group. “We’re not one thing,” they’re saying. And of course they’re not. Many of us said that all along, but they are united in rejecting biblical commands. They are united in rejecting creation order to a greater or a lesser extent, and they are united in terms of the moral agenda.

Before I leave this story, I just want to go back to the language that is just routinely used and it’s a matter of heartbreak to notice this. So just even trying to take this out of politics for a moment, it’s the President, the former President who’s making the statement, former President Biden. He said as the story comes to a conclusion, “Because of our national debate on LGBTQ issues,” he said, “there are young people sitting alone as I speak, scrolling through social media, wondering whether they will ever truly be accepted for who they are. ” The former president said evidently as if he were addressing those young people, “You are heard and you belong.” And we’re told he said that to a standing ovation.

Okay. So here’s the thing, the crucial language is they’re wondering whether they will ever truly be accepted for who they are. That is a seismically important statement for who they are. It all comes down to who they are. It all comes down to who determines who they are. It all comes down to whether or not their bodies, by God’s intention, tell them who they are. And in this case, we know what the former President’s point is. We know he’s trying to say that whatever they feel themselves to be, that’s what they are.

We have to resist that. We have to resist the idea that it is those who hold to a biblical worldview who are not telling people they’re free to be who they are. That is exactly the point we are trying to make. It’s the question as to where in the world they come to know, how in the world they come to know who they are. There is simply no way that Christians can come to a biblical understanding that says that who they are is separate from the body that God gave them.

Part III

The Battle for Your Entertainment Attention: Netflix and Warner Bros. Agree to Seismic Deal – This is a Battle For Much More Than Your Entertainment

All right. Finally, there were some really big business news also breaking over the weekend, and that is that Netflix announced that it is going to buy Warner Brothers, the famed Hollywood Studio, and much of that Warner Brothers Empire for $83 billion. Okay, so that’s $83 billion. According to most reports, Netflix had never made a purchase of even a billion dollars, now $83 billion.

Now, why in the world would a streaming service, this vast platform, Netflix, why would it want to buy Warner Brothers? And a part of the deal is that they’re not buying some parts of Warner Brothers, including some parts of the empire like CNN, but they are agreeing that they will continue in theater distribution, they don’t say for how long, of Warner Brothers movies, and that’s something quite unexpected because the leadership at Netflix, it actually made fun of theater saying that that was much a part of the past and not so much of the future.

Well, now I guess they’re counting on it being a part of the future, at least for some term, because they’re putting $83 billion on the line. Now, this is going to have to go through review process. It’s going to have to go through antitrust review and all of that. And there are enemies of this plan. But the fact is that these two giants wouldn’t have agreed to this unless they think it’s going to go through.

Now, I want to bring up one of the issues that I think will come up in that kind of antitrust challenge, and that is whether or not this reduces the number of companies that are operating in terms of entertainment media. And it does mean that. There’s no doubt it means that. And if they weren’t trying to economize, this deal wouldn’t make any sense. They’re going to try to cut down the cost at Warner Brothers, and they’re going to try to bring in more profits to Netflix. Otherwise, there’s no purpose to the deal. That’s the only way the deal works.

But you can hear some people saying, “Look, this is too much consolidation in the hands of one company.” And this gets into some very deep waters in the antitrust matters. But I just want to point out from a Christian perspective, this shows further consolidation in these giant companies of the entertainment attention of the American people. And at the very least, this ought to have some attention from Christians. We ought to be more thoughtful about the media we consume than others are. We understand more is at stake. We understand that what we let in our eyes, what we let in our headphones, we’re also effectively letting into our brains and effectively letting into our hearts.

And we need to know that others are too, including the little kid with the iPad screen and the teenager with the ear pods. This is a huge problem and we are huge consumers of entertainment. For most of human history, think about this, for most of human history, people saw very little entertainment. They consumed very little entertainment. They might see a play, maybe somewhere they might see some work of art in public somewhere, but their access to entertainment was basically members of their own family, their own extended community, and in their neighborhood. That was basically it.

And entertainment had a place, of course, in every society, that’s why you have surviving plays from ancient Greece and you’ve got artifacts and cultural products from ancient peoples all over the world. But now we’re talking about an entertainment world that is 24/7. It’s all around us. It’s everywhere. It’s all accessible. It’s privatized. It’s no longer in the main a group experience. That’s why Netflix made fun of the theaters. My guess is they’re not going to make fun of them anymore, but nobody thinks theaters are the wave of the future.

Everybody knows that the streaming platform is hungry for more content and it’s hungry for more contracts. It’s hungry for more customers and for more contact hours. That’s what’s behind all of this. It’s a battle for your eyes. It’s a battle for your ears. It’s a battle for your attention. It is a battle for your hearts. It’s an $83 billion deal. Just let that settle in, $83 billion.

This company is putting its own existence at risk. Netflix is basically putting itself at risk in an $83 billion deal. They wouldn’t be making it if they didn’t think it was pretty much a sure fire win. We need to know, and think about the fact that someone is paying $83 billion just for a bit more chance to have our attention. That ought to have our attention.",https://cf.albertmohler.com/uploads/2025/12/gettyimages-2249635311.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-08 15:57:54.791955

The Maxillofacial Restoration Program team has changed that timeline dramatically.
Restoring Form and Function The surgery involved a complex series of steps orchestrated by NMCSD’s multidisciplinary Maxillofacial Restoration Program team.
By reducing recovery time from years to months, the Maxillofacial Restoration Program does more than treat patients—it preserves the force.
The Maxillofacial Restoration Program is fulfilling our fundamental responsibility to our warfighters, getting them back to full readiness so they can return to the fight.","SAN DIEGO — When Army Spc. Grant Dickerson felt a sharp pain in his jaw after drinking something cold during a deployment earlier this year, he expected a routine dental issue. Instead, an X-ray revealed a dark lesion in his lower jaw.

U.S. Army Lt. Col. Christopher Chang, an oral maxillofacial surgeon at Evans Army Community Hospital in Fort Carson, Colorado, where Dickerson was stationed, ordered additional 3D imaging to determine the nature of the lesion.

""We saw a very large growing tumor,"" said Chang.

The diagnosis was a central giant cell granuloma, which is a benign but aggressive tumor that forms within the bone and grows. It threatened not only Dickerson’s health but his ability to continue serving in the Army.

For his family, the word “tumor” was alarming.

“As a mom, when I heard the word tumor, I was just in shock,” said Jennifer Dickerson. “I think I was just scared and afraid that it could be cancer.”

His father, Craig Dickerson, recalled preparing for the worst while focusing on next steps. “Everybody always goes worst case,” he said. “But we worried, and we just said, let’s work through the process, see where we end up.”

The process meant surgery to remove the tumor that had destroyed two-thirds of Dickerson’s lower jaw and rebuild the damaged portion.

“As much as I would like to do the surgery here, it takes a surgeon who has specialized training in doing microvascular surgery,” said Chang. “It also requires the support staff to be knowledgeable and to be able to manage a patient like that after the surgery in recovery, in the ICU.”

Ultimately, Chang chose to refer Dickerson to Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) where surgeons with their Maxillofacial Restoration Program have been treating patients requiring comprehensive facial restoration since November 2020.

“He reached out and did the biopsy and the initial workup,” said U.S. Navy Cmdr. Daniel Hammer, a maxillofacial surgeon and director of NMCSD’s Maxillofacial Restoration Program. “We worked as a team between Colorado and San Diego.”

The goal was to restore not only Dickerson’s jaw, but also his medical readiness.

According to Hammer, the damage the tumor had done was so extensive that had Dickerson been hit in the face, he would likely have broken his jaw.

“My hope for Grant with this surgery is that he keeps going with his career,” said his mother. “He wants nothing more than to be in the Army, to be a Soldier.”

Standard reconstructive surgery for a tumor the size of Dickerson’s typically requires a long, multi-stage recovery. After surgeons remove the jaw and transplant bone, patients typically wait 18 months to two years before they can receive dental implants and teeth.

For a service member, two years of limited function—unable to eat solid foods or deploy—can mean a medical separation. The Maxillofacial Restoration Program team has changed that timeline dramatically.

""The primary goal for Dickerson was a return to duty,"" said U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr. Kyu Choi, chief resident of oral maxillofacial surgery. “He wanted to continue to serve his country, and he wanted to return to the job he had left behind at Fort Carson. After a long discussion, we consented him for the one-time, one-surgery to restore everything.”

Instead of spreading surgeries out over years, the jaw-in-a-day procedure consolidates them into a single surgery that takes place in one day.

""Really, the big difference between jaw-in-a-day and traditional reconstruction is that you get your dental rehabilitation immediately,"" Hammer said. ""The bone, the teeth, and your function—so your speech and swallowing—all come back that same day.”

Cross-Service Collaboration

Before surgery could take place, a significant amount of coordination was required to ensure the procedure went smoothly. Through virtual surgical planning, the teams coordinated across state lines. They used scans of Dickerson’s mouth and 3D imaging to map the surgery and fabricate custom titanium guides before Dickerson even arrived in California.

“All the pre-op appointments, all the planning was done virtually on video communication,” said Chang.

Lt. Cmdr. Aaron Barto, a maxillofacial prosthodontist at NMCSD and member of the Maxillofacial Restoration Program team, gathered digital scans, photos, and Dickerson’s CT images.

“Using that information, we can actually virtually plan the surgery, the implants, and the teeth before the patient ever comes into the OR,” Barto said.

The seamless collaboration between Evans Army Community Hospital and NMCSD showcases how the Defense Health Agency (DHA) is integrating healthcare delivery across the military health system. By streamlining processes and removing traditional barriers between services and facilities, DHA enables providers to deliver coordinated care to warfighters like Dickerson regardless of location or branch of service.

""We worked as a team,"" Hammer noted. ""We were able to be so collaborative between the Army and the Navy and the entire military health system.""

Restoring Form and Function

The surgery involved a complex series of steps orchestrated by NMCSD’s multidisciplinary Maxillofacial Restoration Program team. First, surgeons harvested a section of the fibula from Dickerson’s leg and shaped it to match his jawline using the pre-planned guides.

“The next step is the inset, and that’s where we take our rebuilt jaw and we use metal plates to connect it to the patient’s mouth so that it fits in place,” said U.S. Navy Cmdr. Samuel Frasier, department chair, ear, nose, and throat at NMCSD and one of Dickerson’s surgeons.

Once the bone was set, the team performed microvascular anastomosis, which means they connected blood vessels together using a microscope to ensure the transplanted tissue would thrive. Finally, they placed the dental implants, immediately restoring Dickerson’s ability to smile and chew.

The day after Dickerson’s surgery, he was up walking. Within a week, he was discharged from the hospital and eating without a feeding tube.

Hammer attributes the program’s success to the nine integrated clinical care pathways that include pain management, speech and physical therapy, and mental health support, which focuses not on reconstruction, but on restoration of the whole patient.

“Reconstructive success is finite,” said Hammer. “I did a procedure. I got a good outcome. Patient’s okay. Moving on. But if your outcome is longitudinal in process, and it is as audacious as restoring the overall health of the patient rather than myopic of one procedure, that is how we restore form, function, and purpose.”

The ultimate goal for NMCSD’s Maxillofacial Restoration Program is the comprehensive restoration of health, especially for warfighters so they can get back into the fight. By reducing recovery time from years to months, the Maxillofacial Restoration Program does more than treat patients—it preserves the force.

“What Cmdr. Hammer and his team are doing at NMCSD demonstrates the true potential of our integrated military health system,” said Rear Adm. Kevin Brown, director of Defense Health Network Pacific Rim, which has oversight of NMCSD. “When we can turn what traditionally would be a career-ending diagnosis into a months-long recovery with full return to duty, we're fundamentally changing the equation for military readiness. This level of clinical innovation and collaboration across services is exactly what our warfighters deserve.”

A Return to Duty

Dickerson’s results speak for themselves. Within a month of his surgery, he was walking, speaking, and swallowing.

“The fact that Grant, after 30 days following his surgery, is able to function at this level is amazing,” said Chang. “I have no doubt that he’s going to fully recover in a short amount of time and be able to do the job that he loves.”

A diagnosis that leads to having two-thirds of your lower jaw removed is devastating, said Hammer. “But our hope is that his diagnosis, his experience, his recovery is just a chapter in his life, and not his story.”

Today, Dickerson is back with his unit and well on his way to a full recovery, supported by the teams in San Diego, Evans Army Community Hospital, and a military health system committed to improving health and building readiness, ensuring warfighters receive the care they need, when they need it.

“This case exemplifies what we strive for every day at Naval Medical Center San Diego—delivering world-class care that not only heals our nation’s heroes but ensures they are ready to meet the mission,” said NMCSD Director Capt. Elizabeth Adriano. “Our team has truly innovated by focusing on restoration of the whole patient, not just reconstruction, and they consistently achieve extraordinary outcomes. The Maxillofacial Restoration Program is fulfilling our fundamental responsibility to our warfighters, getting them back to full readiness so they can return to the fight. That's the standard we hold ourselves to, and that's the promise we make to every warfighter who walks through our doors.”

“The first year is preparation for all the classes in order to get into medical school.
“We would carpool from Manassas, Virginia, to Bethesda every single day while we were in medical school.
“I knew I also wanted to do flight medicine, and the operational emergency medicine program partners with Virginia Commonwealth University,” she said.
(Dr.) Barrera now serves as the flight surgeon for the 74th Fighter Squadron and as an emergency medicine physician at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia.","It’s 2015, and then-Air Force Senior Airman Laura Barrera’s day off while assigned to the 633rd Medical Group at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia. She received a call to come into her clinic for an unplanned meeting.

She was nervous. Having applied to the Uniformed Services University’s Enlisted to Medical School Preparatory Program, or EMDP2 — she had been waiting for word whether she would realize her dream of becoming a military doctor.

“I came to the desk at labor and delivery, and I saw everyone there that helped me with my application,” she said. “And then my group commander comes in ... he tells me I got in.”

Barrera was accepted into the intensive, pre-medical program that charts enlisted service members on a course to become military physicians through a partnership with George Mason University. The program offers mentoring and Medical College Admission Test preparation while allowing students to maintain their current rank, pay, and benefits while going to school full-time.

For Barrera, the mentoring had already started.

“I had fantastic, enlisted supervisors and leadership that helped review my package. They made sure I had everything to apply,” she said. “I have been lucky in my career to always have leadership that has looked out for me and has always pushed me forward and helped me up.”

Striving for the sky

Growing up in the wide-open spaces of Wyoming, Barrera had two older brothers, Erik and Hugo, that had enlisted in the U.S. Navy.

“I saw my brothers serve, and they got deployed right away after 9/11,” she said. “I looked up to them highly.”

She joined the U.S. Air Force, enlisting as a flight medicine tech in the reserves for four years while getting her bachelor’s degree from Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia. When she began active duty service, Barrera worked as a technician in the labor and delivery ward with the 633rd Medical Group at Joint Base Langley-Eustis where she learned her true calling: patient care.

“I really enjoyed working with patients, and I knew what I wanted to do to progress my career more,” she said. “It took time for me to understand and realize what it means to take care of patients.”

At 27 years old, Barrera thought she was “too old” for medical school. While discussing her career path with a military physician — who shared with her that he was in his mid-30s with five children when he started medical school — another doctor popped his head into the office and said, “Do you know about the EMDP2 program?”

“I looked it up,” Barrera said. “I was like, ‘I can do this.’”

From enlisted service member to medical student

She relocated to Manassas, Virginia, and started classes at George Mason University, taking on tough coursework to include “biochemistry, organic chemistry, anatomy, and physiology — every topic relevant for us to get into medical school,” she said. “The first year is preparation for all the classes in order to get into medical school. During the whole time period, you're also doing MCAT prep.”

While school was challenging, Barrera said top-notch professors in the program made the work fulfilling.

“The professors that taught us are phenomenal. They're some of the best people that I could have ever asked to teach us how to do medicine, how to prepare. I think it's a fantastic school. While you’re in school, the program prepares you to be not just a doctor, but a leader in the military.”

She also met fellow enlisted service members in the program, bonded in service and their unique path to a medical career.

“There were 12 of us military members from different branches. We would help each other study, and we were together all the time.”

When Barrera was ready to take the MCAT exam, she was embarking on another milestone — having a baby.

“I was eight months pregnant taking the exam,” she said. “It was stressful, but I got through it.”

Barrera was accepted into medical school at USU’s F. Edward Hebert School of Medicine in 2017 in Bethesda, Maryland. They started on their academic journey rooted in friendship and service.

“We would carpool from Manassas, Virginia, to Bethesda every single day while we were in medical school. We basically became a family,” she said. “These people are still my best friends. We all visit and talk to each other. Every year we take a picture together because we served together.”

After graduation and receiving her commission to the rank of captain, Barrera started her residency in emergency medicine — all the while aiming high for her military career goals.

“I knew I also wanted to do flight medicine, and the operational emergency medicine program partners with Virginia Commonwealth University,” she said. “I wanted to be more operational within the Air Force, so it was important to understand how we truly take care of our patients — I knew emergency medicine could teach me that.”

While in the emergency room at VCU Medical Center in Richmond, Virginia, the work mirrored the multiple, urgent tasks she experienced while deployed.

“I was forced to learn how to take care of all different patients and figure out what each person needed,” Barrera said. “I had an appendectomy in one room and then within 10 minutes, I’d get called over for a trauma injury.”

“Even when it was scary, it’s like ‘I can do this. I can take care of these people,’” she added. “It forces you to think on your feet, figure out the triage process, and then your resources, which is highly useful to the military.”

Flight surgeon and family doctor

In 2025, Air Force Capt. (Dr.) Barrera now serves as the flight surgeon for the 74th Fighter Squadron and as an emergency medicine physician at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia. She enables airmen to stay in peak health to continue their service in the air.

“I am a squadron physician that's embedded in the squadron with the airmen. I fly with the C-130's to understand the stuff that they see, the stuff that they go through, what happens when they're on a flight,” she said.

She considers her squadron her family, and she takes care of theirs on the ground.

“My patients are not just my patients — they’re also my friends. I know that what I'm doing is really impacting them and all the things that they do,” Barrera said. “Since I'm emergency medicine, I can help their families. I can see children if there’s an urgent care need, like a fever. It's like being the family doctor of your family, but it's a squadron.”

“I like being the one that people depend on.”

Barrera also has her own family — her husband and nine-year-old daughter — who she credits with supporting her every step of the way to her unique path to military medicine.

“My family is No. 1. I wouldn't have been able to do any of this without my husband, John Maurice. He has been a rock,” she said. “I have gone through a lot of mom guilt, having been deployed, but he’s never made me feel any less of a person for missing a birthday or holidays.”

While it was a challenging route from enlisted airman, to student, to primary care physician for the U.S. military’s top pilots, Barrera says the reward is worth it.

“It is hard, but it's hard for a reason. Nothing in life that's good is easy,” she said. “There are so many paths to medicine, but the program makes physicians true leaders in what they do and the patients that they care for.”

“The rewarding part is actually having that connection with the patients and being passionate about taking care of them.”

However, the 6th MDSS continues to provide patients with quality care by offering TRICARE-covered medication alternatives when available.","MACDILL AIR FORCE BASE, Fla. -- With more than 265,000 active-duty, veterans, and dependents living within the Tampa Bay community, the 6th Medical Support Squadron employs 22 active duty, 12 government employees and 12 contractors across three locations to ensure each customer receives the right medication at the right time.

“The pharmacy directly supports the mission of the 6th Air Refueling Wing by ensuring the health and readiness of the wing’s personnel,” said Staff Sgt. Zoie Annulis, 6th MDSS noncommissioned officer in charge of pharmacy operations. “By providing timely and accurate pharmaceutical care, we help maintain the physical well-being of aircrew, support staff and their families—allowing them to perform their critical roles effectively.”

Multiple facilities and a large team reflect the hundreds of thousands of beneficiaries these pharmacies support. However, supporting so many patients comes with challenges.

“One of the most challenging aspects of the job is balancing the demands of providing excellent patient care while managing operational efficiency, especially during high-demand periods,” Annulis said.

The team overcomes those challenges by leveraging advanced technology solutions that improve accuracy, communication and resource management.

According to the pharmacy team, one key to its success is a robotic automated dispensing system. The system reduces manpower strain by completing 60% to70% of the unit's workload allowing Airmen to focus on quality of care while maintaining high output.

Despite advances in automation, the 46-member unit still responds to supply chain issues.

Hailey Weiner, a pharmacist with the 6th MDSS, said a recurring challenge is receiving specific medications in a timely manner.

However, the 6th MDSS continues to provide patients with quality care by offering TRICARE-covered medication alternatives when available.

Beyond technology and prescription access, the pharmacy provides services that have a direct and meaningful impact on patients at MacDill and across the greater Tampa area.

“We help patients save money on prescriptions and avoid high retail pharmacy copays,” Weiner said. “Our operations are particularly beneficial for the elderly population who are on fixed incomes by allowing them to access medications at no cost.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2511/9395606/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-08 12:57:20.673745

Background: The Military Health System offers geographically distributed SARS-CoV-2 incidence estimates to support critical national pandemic surveillance, but this has not been previously assessed. The objective was to identify confirmed, probable, and possible SARS-CoV-2 infections with laboratory and clinical evidence and compare cumulative incidence to the general United States population. Methods: An observational, retrospective epidemiologic study using medical records from the United States Military Health System (inclusive of active duty) collected from outpatient and inpatient facilities worldwide, both United States Military and non-military treatment facilities. Direct standardization to the general US population was used to calculate sex-adjusted cumulative incidence, stratified by age, for ten Health and Human Services regions for active duty and non-active duty beneficiary populations, with Spearman’s rho correlations for age and region strata. Results: Among Military Health System beneficiaries, 2,219,987 cases were identified, with 27.4% laboratory-confirmed cases alongside 35.0% probable and 37.6% possible cases identified using clinical ICD-10-CM evidence. Peaks in cases occurred November 2020-January 2021, August 2021-September 2021, and January 2022. Age-stratified and sex-adjusted cumulative incidence across ten geographical regions reflected these temporal patterns among both active duty (90% of age and region-specific correlation coefficients >0.7) and non-active duty beneficiaries (80% of age and region-specific correlation coefficients >0.7). Cumulative incidence was higher among active duty beneficiaries compared to the United States general population, particularly those ages 18-49 years, with adjusted cumulative incidence ratios consistently greater than 1. The cumulative incidence ratios for non-active duty beneficiaries were more consistent and closer to 1. The sensitivity analysis of laboratory-confirmed cases among active duty personnel demonstrated consistently lower adjusted cumulative incidence than United States general population. Conclusion: Temporal patterns in cases among Military Health System beneficiaries reflect cases measured nationally by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Admits Dispensing More Insulin to Patients Than They Needed and Receiving Ineligible for Reimbursements

December 8, 2025 – United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Jay Clayton, Special Agent in Charge of the New York Regional Office of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General (“HHS-OIG”), Naomi D. Gruchacz, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the Northeast Field Office of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (“DCIS”), Christopher M. Silvestro, and Special Agent in Charge of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Office of the Inspector General (“OPM-OIG”), Derek M. Holt, announced that the United States has filed and settled a healthcare fraud lawsuit against national retail pharmacy chain CVS PHARMACY, INC. (“CVS”). The settlement resolves allegations that, from 2010 through 2020, CVS violated the False Claims Act in connection with its billing and dispensing of insulin pens to patients enrolled in Government healthcare programs (“GHPs”), including Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Specifically, the Government alleges that CVS improperly requested and received GHP reimbursement for premature refills, dispensed more insulin pens than patients needed according to their prescriptions, and falsely under-reported the days-of-supply of insulin that its pharmacies dispensed.

Under the settlement approved by U.S. District Judge John G. Koeltl, CVS agreed to pay a total sum of $37.76 million, with $24,446,240 to be paid to the United States and the remainder to be paid to various states. As part of the settlement, CVS also admitted and accepted responsibility for certain conduct alleged by the Government in its complaint, including that GHPs paid CVS substantial amounts for insulin pen refills that were ineligible for reimbursement and CVS pharmacies dispensed more insulin to GHP beneficiaries than they needed.

“CVS engaged in a decade-long practice of repeatedly prematurely refilling insulin prescriptions for patients and improperly billing government healthcare programs for more insulin than patients needed,” said U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton. “These programs rely on pharmacies to follow appropriate refill schedules and to accurately report the amount of medicine dispensed, which CVS pharmacies frequently failed to do. This settlement reflects our continued commitment to holding pharmacies to account, enforcing rules designed to keep costs down, and protecting taxpayer dollars.”

“Companies that participate in federal health care programs are required to obey laws meant to protect the integrity of program funds, including the responsibility to bill only for services and supplies eligible for reimbursement,” said HHS-OIG Special Agent in Charge Naomi D. Gruchacz. “Working closely with our law enforcement partners, HHS-OIG will continue to investigate allegations of improper billing to safeguard our taxpayer-funded federal healt​hcare system and the millions of enrollees who rely on its programs.”

“Investigating false claims against TRICARE, the healthcare system for military members and their families, is a top priority for the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the criminal investigative arm of the Department of Defense’s Office of Inspector General,” said DCIS Acting Special Agent in Charge Christopher M. Silvestro. “This announcement underscores our commitment to working with our law enforcement partners and the Department of Justice to protect TRICARE against unwarranted and fraudulent expenses.”

“Knowingly submitting claims for medically unnecessary insulin refills exploits benefits that federal employees rely on to manage their health, increasing the cost of care and wasting taxpayer dollars,” said OPM-OIG Special Agent in Charge Derek M. Holt. “We thank our agents, law enforcement partners, and the Department of Justice for their dedication to investigating and pursuing these improper billing practices that undermine the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.”

Insulin pens (hard plastic, pen-shaped cases containing syringes filled with insulin solution) are a common way for diabetic patients to self-administer insulin. During the relevant period, manufacturers frequently distributed insulin pens in five-pen cartons with each pen containing 300 units (3 mL) of insulin solution. Insulin prescriptions must set forth the “directions for use,” which typically designate both how much insulin to administer and the frequency and/or timing of when to administer it.

When pharmacies seek reimbursement from GHPs for insulin pens, they are required to report, among other data, the “quantity dispensed” and the “days-of-supply.” The “quantity dispensed” means the total amount of medication dispensed to a patient when the pharmacy fills the prescription, and the “days-of-supply” refers to the number of days that the quantity dispensed is expected to last if taken as directed by the prescriber. Typically, pharmacists calculate days-of-supply by dividing the total quantity of medication dispensed by the patient’s “daily dose,” i.e., the amount of medication that the prescriber directs the patient to use each day.

GHP plans, and pharmacy benefit managers (“PBMs”) working on their behalf, typically set limits on the days-of-supply that a pharmacy may dispense when filling prescriptions (such as a 30-day supply), and reject reimbursement claims for fills that exceed those limits. GHPs and PBMs also deny reimbursement for prematurely refilled prescriptions—refills dispensed before the beneficiary would have consumed a substantial portion of the previously-dispensed quantity of medication if taken as prescribed. PBMs use automated processes to review claims for reimbursement submitted by pharmacies and deny claims that are submitted too far in advance of the expected refill date. The ability of PBMs to detect and reject reimbursement claims for premature refills depends on pharmacies complying with their obligations to accurately report days-of-supply data.

Dispensing insulin in full cartons containing five pens can exceed applicable days-of-supply limits, resulting in claim rejections. PBMs developed rules to address reimbursement when dispensing medications like insulin in the smallest commercially-available container would exceed the days-of-supply limit. Some PBMs required pharmacies to seek an override of the limit and then to resubmit the claim reporting the accurate days-of-supply actually dispensed so the PBM could verify when the next refill would be needed. Other PBMs permitted pharmacies to submit claims reporting the maximum days-of-supply allowed, even if that number was lower than the actual supply dispensed. Importantly, however, those PBMs still required pharmacies to track and use the actual days-of-supply dispensed to determine when patients would actually need a refill. All PBMs prohibited pharmacies from seeking reimbursement for premature refills, regardless of container size.

As alleged in the Government’s Complaint:

From January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2020 (the “Covered Period”), CVS violated the FCA by knowingly submitting, or causing to be submitted, false claims to GHPs for reimbursement for insulin pens where CVS: dispensed more insulin to GHP beneficiaries than was specified by their prescriptions and refilled GHP beneficiary prescriptions substantially before GHP beneficiaries needed the refills; falsely under-reported the days-of-supply for the insulin refills, which often prevented PBMs from detecting that the refills were premature; and failed to comply with applicable rules when refilling insulin prescriptions requiring pharmacies to calculate refill dates using the actual days-of-supply dispensed.

To fill insulin prescriptions as quickly as possible and to ensure that reimbursement claims for insulin pens were not rejected, CVS instructed its pharmacy staff simply to report the maximum days-of-supply allowed under the beneficiary’s plan when dispensing full insulin pen cartons, which was often lower than the actual days-of-supply dispensed. Many CVS pharmacies did not internally document and use the actual days-of-supply dispensed to determine when patients could next refill their prescription. To the contrary, CVS’ dispensing software calculated refill dates automatically based on inaccurate days-of-supply data reported to the PBM. As a result, CVS pharmacy staff repeatedly refilled prescriptions prematurely, dispensing substantially more insulin to GHP beneficiaries than they actually needed and substantially sooner than they needed it according to their prescriptions. As a result, some GHP beneficiaries accumulated large quantities of unused insulin, which was both wasteful and potentially dangerous as insulin can expire.

CVS management was well aware that it was over-dispensing insulin. PBMs conducted periodic audits of CVS pharmacies and repeatedly found violations of the dispensing rules, including reporting invalid days-of-supply data, refilling insulin pen prescriptions too soon, and dispensing insulin pens in excess of the quantities authorized by the prescription. PBMs issued chargebacks to CVS based on these violations. For several years, CVS management knew that insulin pens were among the drug products most frequently subject to chargebacks for premature refills. Yet, despite these audit findings, CVS failed to take necessary steps to address this long-standing problem during the Covered Period.

Under the settlement, CVS admitted, among other things, that:

During much of the covered period, many CVS pharmacies did not break open insulin pen cartons when dispensing insulin pens. As a result, at times, CVS pharmacies dispensed amounts of insulin that exceeded applicable days-of-supply limits. When a claim for reimbursement was rejected for exceeding the limit, some CVS pharmacies did not obtain overrides and re-submit the claim listing the actual days-of-supply dispensed as required by some PBMs. Instead, CVS pharmacies often reported the maximum days-of-supply allowed under the beneficiary’s insurance plan for insulin pens when resubmitting the claim, which was lower than the actual days-of-supply dispensed. While certain PBMs allowed this practice because the carton was the smallest commercially-available container for the medication, CVS pharmacies at times did not adhere to the appropriate refill intervals for patients that were to be based on the actual days-of-supply dispensed.

During much of the covered period, CVS customers with insulin-pen prescriptions who enrolled in CVS’ optional auto-refill program received automatic prompts notifying them that their refilled prescriptions were available to be picked up. CVS’ auto-refill logic calculated prescription refill dates based on the days-of-supply data recorded by pharmacy staff and sent customers refill notifications based on those dates. When pharmacy staff recorded days-of-supply numbers that were lower than the actual days-of-supply dispensed, the system would at times calculate refill dates for patients that were premature. As a result, some CVS pharmacies dispensed insulin pen refills to GHP beneficiaries before the beneficiaries needed more insulin and before the GHP plan or PBM would have approved such refills for reimbursement.

At times during the covered period, GHPs and the payors working on their behalf paid CVS substantial amounts for insulin pen refills that were ineligible for reimbursement, and CVS pharmacies dispensed more insulin to GHP beneficiaries than they needed.

In connection with the filing of the lawsuit and settlement, the Government joined five private whistleblower lawsuits that had previously been filed under seal pursuant to the False Claims Act.

Mr. Clayton praised the outstanding investigative work of the HHS-OIG, DOD-OIG, OPM-OIG, the Department of Veterans Affairs OIG, and the U.S. Postal Service OIG.

This case is being handled by the Office’s Civil Frauds Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorney Pierre Armand is in charge of the case.

The Board has conditionally approved FF and FX’s five-year volume production plan, including the target of 400,000-500,000 cumulative production and sales, contingent upon securing the necessary financing, as well as more support and agreements with strategic partners.

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF.

“Today I would like to share two major bits of progress first: I will start with the fact that I am proud to announce that the FX Super One First Pre-Production Vehicles Roll-off Ceremony is scheduled for December 21 at our manufacturing facility in Hanford, CA! We have reached a critical state of readiness: the full set of components for the first several pre-production vehicles have arrived on site. With nearly 3,000 parts per vehicle now in hand, we will formally launch production tomorrow.

This milestone carries significance in six areas:

1. It marks the near completion of the Bridge Closure for our Bridge strategy, covering a closed loop of supply chain, testing, logistics, customs clearance and production. This further validates the feasibility and strategic value of the Bridge model, across tariff adaptation, ICTS compliance, cost management, operational efficiency, and so on.

2. It marks that the Hanford factory has entered the FX pre-production phase. Our production, industrialization, supply chain, and Bridge systems are now forming a closed-loop synergy.

3. It could provide a replicable, fast-track mass production framework for the scalable deployment of future FX models.

4. It represents a new breakthrough in the Company’s business and supports improvements in our capital position and capital market expectations.

5. It could empower the global expansion of China's automotive supply chain and unlock its value within the U.S.— the world's highest-value market.

6. It could fill a structural gap, tap the blue-ocean segment in the U.S., and generate incremental value in the U.S. market, including job creation and contributions to manufacturing reshoring.

The second bit of progress is that the Board has conditionally approved FF and FX’s five-year volume production plan, including the target of 400,000-500,000 cumulative production and sales, contingent upon securing the necessary financing, as well as more support and agreements with strategic partners. This could help us build a solid foundation for our strategic advancement and stockholder value maximization.

On EAI flywheel—other FFAI updates this week:

S5 Capital Markets and Finance — FF attended UBS’s Global Industrials and Transportation Conference in Florida — a major platform for global capital, industrial and mobility sectors. During the event, we held in-depth discussions with multiple institutional investors, providing a systematic overview of our strategy and core business progress.

Turning to S6 Middle East — Following the delivery of the very first Super One to global icon Andrés Iniesta — coinciding with the UAE’s 54th National Day — our Middle East team brought FF 91 and FX Super One across all seven Emirates, where the “Twin Stars” shined across the region. Next, the Middle East team will speed up assembly ramp up and keep pushing for the assembly and delivery of the FX Super One AIHER variant and the potential battery electric variant, so that more users can be among the first to experience the unique value of First Class EAI-MPV and have the region truly enter the era of AI-powered luxury mobility.

Finally, our issues, reflections, and solutions — Since the FX Super one Initial Product Launch on July 17, we know that our stockholders, investors, and users have been eagerly waiting updates on our milestones and our business vision for the next few years. Our goal has always been to share a roadmap that is clear and executable. Due to complex review cycles and approval procedures, we have not been able to share these details as quickly as intended. This experience has underscored the need for us to improve our internal synergy and operational efficiency.

With our Five-Year Plan closing in on approval, the path could soon be clear for us to share our key milestone goals and forward-looking business plans. We will begin releasing these updates soon and look forward to your continued attention. That’s it for today. I’ll see you at the Hanford factory on December 21.”

HONG KONG and SHANGHAI and FLORHAM PARK, N.J., Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HUTCHMED (China) Limited (“ HUTCHMED ”) (Nasdaq/AIM:​HCM; HKEX:​13) today announces that following the contract renewal with the China National Healthcare Security Administration (“NHSA”), the updated National Reimbursement Drug List (“NRDL”) effective on January 1, 2026 will continue to include ELUNATE ® , ORPATHYS ® and SULANDA ® . In addition, TAZVERIK ® will be included in the first edition of the National Commercial Health Insurance Innovative Drug List (“Commercial Insurance Drug List”).

ELUNATE ® (fruquintinib) is included for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial cancer with Mismatch Repair proficient (pMMR) tumors that have failed prior systemic therapy and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation, in combination with TYVYT ® (sintilimab injection). It is also renewed for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have previously received fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, and those who have previously received or are not suitable for receiving anti-VEGF therapy or anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy (RAS wild-type).

ORPATHYS ® (savolitinib) is included for treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with MET exon 14 skipping alteration.

SULANDA ® (surufatinib) is renewed for the treatment of patients with unresectable; locally advanced or metastatic; progressive non-functional, well-differentiated (G1 or G2) pancreatic and non-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.

TAZVERIK ® (tazemetostat) is included in the Commercial Insurance Drug List for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma with EZH2 mutation who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. In July 2025, the NHSA issued the 2025 Adjustment Work Plan for the NRDL and the Commercial Health Insurance Innovative Drug List, announcing the establishment of the new Commercial Insurance Drug List. This list, together with the NRDL, forms a key component of China’s multi-level medical insurance system. This new list focuses on medicines with high innovation and significant clinical value that fall beyond the scope of basic medical insurance, including certain high-cost oncology drugs, gene therapies, and rare disease therapies, enabling reimbursement through commercial health insurance products such as high-limit medical insurance, inclusive health plans (“Huiminbao”) and group health insurance. This multi-layered reimbursement framework enhances patient access to breakthrough treatments while supporting the sustainable development of China’s innovative pharmaceutical sector.

About NRDL

The government in China has placed great importance on improving the affordability of drug treatments for the public. As of end of 2024, 1.33 billion people in China had basic medical insurance coverage, representing around 95% of the entire population. The NRDL is updated every year, and inclusion on the list is subject to renewal every two years. The NHSA annually convenes a broad network of experts in medicine, pharmacology, pharmacoeconomics and actuarial valuation to identify innovative medicines to consider for NRDL inclusion. Reimbursement of Category B medicines, including novel oncology medicines, requires varying degrees of copayment from patients, depending on their provinces or types of NHSA insurance scheme enrollment.

LOS ANGELES, CA, Dec. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Immix Biopharma, Inc. (“ImmixBio”, “Company”, “We” or “Us” or ”IMMX”), a global leader in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis, today announced positive phase 2 NXC-201 results in an oral presentation at ASH 2025 presented by Heather Landau, MD, of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. NXC-201 demonstrated a complete response (CR) rate of 75% (15/20) (at s/u IFE(-) level) by independent review committee. In four out of five pending patients, MRD negativity in bone marrow predicts future complete response, potentially increasing future CR rate to 95%. NEXICART-2 final readout and BLA submission are planned for 2026.

“In the larger patient set Phase 2 results presented today at ASH, we are thrilled to see complete response rates continue to improve in NEXICART-2. These excellent results demonstrate the potential of NXC-201 to address the significant unmet medical need in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis,” said Ilya Rachman, MD, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of Immix Biopharma. Gabriel Morris, Chief Financial Officer of Immix Biopharma, added, “This exciting Phase 2 milestone brings us one step closer to delivering this promising therapy to patients upon planned BLA submission in 2026.”

ASH Presentation Results – Phase 2

Prior to NXC-201 treatment, all patients were exposed to an anti-CD38 antibody and a proteasome inhibitor. Median prior lines of therapy was 4 (range: 1-10). All patients had baseline relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis organ involvement. After NXC-201 treatment, complete responses (CRs) were observed in 75% (15 out of 20 patients) (at s/u IFE(-) level) by independent review committee. In four out of five pending patients, minimum residual disease (MRD) negativity in bone marrow predicts future complete response, potentially increasing the future CR rate to 95%. Downstream clinical improvement, including organ responses, were observed in 70% of evaluable patients (7/10). No neurotoxicity was observed. Only low-grade cytokine release syndrome has been observed with a median duration of 1 day. The ASH presentation contains clinical data as of November 13, 2025.

Current treatments typically result in a 10% or lower complete response (CR) rate in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis according to Zanwar, et al 2024, indicating a high unmet medical need.

SLS009 in combination with AZA/VEN achieved a 46% overall response rate across all cohorts, a 58% overall response rate in patients with one prior line of therapy, and encouraging survival outcomes in heavily-pretreated AML-MR following prior VEN-based treatment

Median overall survival (mOS) of 8.9 months in the least pretreated patient cohort; across all cohorts, mOS was not yet reached in patients with one prior line of therapy vs historical benchmark of approximately 2.5 months

SLS009 30 mg IV twice weekly added to AZA/VEN was safe and feasible, with no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed

Study expansion to evaluate SLS009 plus AZA/VEN in newly diagnosed AML with high-risk features is planned for Q1 2026

NEW YORK, Dec. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SELLAS Life Sciences Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: SLS) (“SELLAS’’ or the “Company”), a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel therapies for a broad range of cancer indications, today announced that clinical data from its ongoing Phase 2 study of SLS009, a highly selective CDK9 inhibitor, in combination with azacitidine (AZA) and venetoclax (VEN) for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with myelodysplastic syndrome-related changes (AML-MR) after prior VEN-based treatment were presented today at the 67 th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition, being held December 6 – 9, 2025, in Orlando, Florida.

In this Phase 2 expansion study, R/R AML-MR patients (N = 35 evaluable) were studied in three separate cohorts (cohorts 3-5) who were previously treated with VEN-based regimens and either relapsed and/or were refractory to VEN and were then treated with SLS009 plus AZA/VEN. The median age of participating patients was 69 years, and 98% of patients had ELN adverse-risk AML, with the most frequent mutations being ASXL1, RUNX1, TP53, and SRSF2.

SLS009 in combination with AZA/VEN demonstrated clinically meaningful activity in patients with R/R AML-MR, and among the 35 evaluable patients, the overall response rate (CR+CRi+MLFS) was 46%, including 29% achieving CR/CRi. Patients harboring ASXL1 or TP53 mutations achieved response rates of 48% (19% CR/CRi) and 57% (29% CR/CRi), respectively. The median overall survival (mOS) was exceedingly higher than the expected 2.6 months in this R/R AML patient population, and in the least pretreated cohort, mOS reached 8.9 months. Across all cohorts, patients with one prior line of therapy experienced the greatest benefit, with a 58% response rate and mOS not yet reached. No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) or treatment-related deaths were observed, and the combination was well tolerated.

“These results further reinforce the therapeutic potential of SLS009 to overcome resistance to venetoclax-based regimens by suppressing the expression of MCL-1, a key mechanism of resistance to BCL-2 inhibition in AML,” said Dr. Dragan Cicic, Senior Vice President and Chief Development Officer of SELLAS. “The combination of SLS009 with azacitidine and venetoclax demonstrates encouraging activity in a heavily pretreated population with adverse-risk AML-MR, including those harboring ASXL1 and TP53 mutations. We are particularly encouraged by the strong responses in patients with limited prior therapy and look forward to expanding this combination regimen into newly diagnosed AML with high-risk features.”

All three dose groups (50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg) showed impressive monotherapy efficacy, with VGPR+ (very good partial response or better) of ≥70% despite limited follow-up; evidence shows that these responses are expected to deepen over time

Across all dose groups, 95% (19 of 20 patients) of all evaluable VGPR+ patients achieved minimal residual disease negative status

Data featured in an ASH oral presentation; LINKER-MM4 is the first clinical trial to evaluate a BCMAxCD3 bispecific monotherapy in NDMM and is part of a broad clinical development program evaluating Lynozyfic-based regimens in earlier lines of treatment

Regeneron to host virtual ‘Regeneron Roundtable’ investor event to discuss its multiple myeloma development program on Wednesday, December 10 at 8:30 a.m. ET

TARRYTOWN, N.Y., Dec. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced encouraging data from the Phase 1/2 LINKER-MM4 trial evaluating Lynozyfic™ (linvoseltamab) in adults with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) who were transplant eligible or ineligible were shared in an oral presentation at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting. These data build on results from a broad clinical development program evaluating Lynozyfic in early lines of treatment, including precursor conditions, as monotherapy and in combination with standard-of-care or novel agents.

“The treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma often relies on complicated combinations of quadruplet or triplet regimens, each with its own toxicities, in order to achieve rapid and durable responses, which can be incredibly burdensome for these patients,” said Robert Orlowski, M.D., Ph.D., Deputy Chair, Professor of Medicine, and Director of Translational Myeloma Research in the Departments of Lymphoma/Myeloma and Experimental Therapeutics at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and the lead investigator for the LINKER-MM4 trial. “As the first to evaluate a BCMAxCD3 bispecific monotherapy in this setting, LINKER-MM4 seeks to understand whether frontline intervention with a single agent can deliver strong efficacy, enabling the simplification and potentially greater tolerability of these regimens. Lynozyfic monotherapy is already achieving MRD negativity rates comparable to quadruplet regimens but earlier in the treatment course, and these compelling results are expected to deepen with longer follow up. These results underscore Lynozyfic’s potential as a foundational component of frontline treatment regimens for multiple myeloma – or even a monotherapy regimen – for both transplant-eligible and transplant-ineligible patients.”

LINKER-MM4 is an ongoing, open-label Phase 1/2 trial investigating Lynozyfic in adults with NDMM. During a Phase 1A (dose escalation) cohort, patients were treated with a step-up dosing regimen followed by 50 mg, 100 mg or 200 mg doses of Lynozyfic. The lowest (50 mg) and highest (200 mg) tolerated doses were selected for further evaluation in the Phase 1B (dose-expansion) cohort. Among the 45 treated patients in both Phase 1A and 1B, 28 were transplant eligible, and 17 were transplant ineligible.

Across all dose levels (n=45), there was a 1.2 months median time to onset of response (range: 1-4.5 months). All three dose groups (50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg) showed impressive efficacy, with a VGPR+ (very good partial response or better) of ≥70% with limited follow-up. Evidence shows that these responses are expected to deepen over time. Across all dose groups, 95% (19 of 20 patients) of all minimum residual disease (MRD) evaluable VGPR+ patients achieved MRD negative status at 10 -5 sensitivity.

Across all dose levels, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were cytokine release syndrome (CRS; all Grade 1: 44%) and neutropenia (any Grade: 38%; Grade 3/4: 33%). Among other adverse events of special interest, one patient in the 50 mg cohort experienced Grade 1 immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Infections occurred in 84% of patients (Grade 1/2: 51%; Grade 3: 33%) with the majority occurring within the first three months of treatment and the rate of infections decreased over time. There were no ≥Grade 4 infections, Grade 5 TEAEs or dose-limiting toxicities. Ten patients elected to undergo an autologous stem cell transplant, all of whom had an acceptable CD34+ stem cell yield post-induction (range: 2.5-11.5 x 10 6 /kg).

A broad clinical development program investigating Lynozyfic in early stages of the disease is underway. This includes the Phase 2 portion of the LINKER-MM4 trial evaluating Lynozyfic at the recommended 200 mg dose, as well as LINKER-MM6 (EMN39), a trial evaluating a combination of daratumumab, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (DRd) followed by Lynozyfic monotherapy compared with continued DRd in transplant-ineligible NDMM.

The use of Lynozyfic described above is investigational, and its safety and efficacy has not been evaluated by any regulatory authority for this indication.

About Multiple Myeloma

As the second most common blood cancer, there are over 187,000 new cases of MM diagnosed globally every year, with more than 36,000 diagnosed and 12,000 deaths anticipated in the U.S. in 2025. The disease is characterized by the proliferation of cancerous plasma cells (MM cells) that crowd out healthy blood cells in the bone marrow, infiltrate other tissues and cause potentially life-threatening organ injury. Despite treatment advances, MM is not curable, and while current treatments are able to slow progression of the cancer, most patients will ultimately experience cancer progression and require additional therapies.

About Lynozyfic

Lynozyfic was invented using Regeneron’s VelocImmune ® technology and is a fully human BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody designed to bridge B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) on MM cells with CD3-expressing T cells to facilitate T-cell activation and cancer-cell killing. Lynozyfic is approved to treat certain adults with R/R MM: in the U.S. after four lines of therapy and in the European Union after at least three prior therapies.

In the U.S., the generic name for Lynozyfic in its approved indications is linvoseltamab-gcpt, with gcpt as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the U.S. FDA. Outside of the U.S., the generic name of Lynozyfic in its approved indications is linvoseltamab.

Lynozyfic is being investigated in a broad clinical development program exploring its use as a monotherapy as well as in combination regimens across different lines of therapy in MM, including earlier lines of treatment, as well as plasma cell precursor disorders. These potential uses are investigational, and their safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.

In addition to LINKER-MM4 , ongoing trials include:

LINKER-MM1: Phase 1/2 dose-escalation and dose-expansion trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities and anti-tumor activity of Lynozyfic monotherapy in R/R MM

LINKER-MM2 : Phase 1b, open-label trial evaluating Lynozyfic in combination with other cancer treatments in patients with R/R MM

LINKER-MM3 : Phase 3 confirmatory trial evaluating Lynozyfic monotherapy compared to the combination of elotuzumab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone in R/R MM

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR U.S. PATIENTS

What is the most important information I should know about LYNOZYFIC?

LYNOZYFIC may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, including Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and infusion-related reactions (IRR), or neurologic problems.

Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and infusion related reactions (IRR) . CRS is common during treatment with LYNOZYFIC and can also be serious or life-threatening. Tell your healthcare provider or get medical help right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of CRS or IRR, including:

fever of 100.4ºF (38ºC) or higher

fast heartbeat

chills or shaking

dizziness or light-headedness

trouble breathing

Neurologic problems. LYNOZYFIC can cause neurologic problems that can be serious or life-threatening. Tell your healthcare provider or get medical help right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of neurologic problems, including:

headache

agitation, trouble staying awake, confusion or disorientation, seeing or hearing things that are not real (hallucinations)

trouble speaking, writing, thinking, remembering things, paying attention, or understanding things

problems walking, muscle weakness, shaking (tremors), loss of balance, or muscle spasms

numbness and tingling (feeling like “pins and needles”)

burning, throbbing, or stabbing pain

changes in your handwriting

seizures

Due to the risk of CRS and neurologic problems, you will receive LYNOZYFIC on a “step-up dosing schedule” and should be hospitalized for 24 hours after the first and second “step-up” doses.

During the “step-up dosing schedule”:

For your first dose, you will receive a smaller “step-up” dose of LYNOZYFIC on Day 1 of your treatment.

For your second dose, you will receive a larger “step-up” dose of LYNOZYFIC, which is usually given on Day 8 of your treatment.

For your third dose, you will receive the first treatment dose of LYNOZYFIC, which is usually given on Day 15 of your treatment.

Your healthcare provider may repeat one or both of the “step-up” doses depending on side effects or if your treatment is delayed.

Before the “step-up” doses and the first two treatment doses of LYNOZYFIC, you will receive medicines to help reduce your risk of CRS and IRR. Your healthcare provider will decide if you need to receive medicine to help reduce your risk of side effects with future doses.

LYNOZYFIC is available only through the LYNOZYFIC Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) due to the risk of side effects of CRS and neurologic problems. You will receive a Patient Wallet Card from your healthcare provider. Carry the LYNOZYFIC Patient Wallet Card with you at all times and show it to all of your healthcare providers. The LYNOZYFIC Patient Wallet Card lists signs and symptoms of CRS and neurologic problems. Get medical help right away if you develop any of the signs and symptoms listed on the LYNOZYFIC Patient Wallet Card . You may need to be treated in a hospital.

Your healthcare provider will monitor you for signs and symptoms of CRS and neurologic problems during treatment with LYNOZYFIC, as well as other side effects, and may treat you in a hospital if needed. Your healthcare provider may temporarily stop or completely stop your treatment with LYNOZYFIC if you develop CRS, neurologic problems, or any other severe side effects.

If you have any questions about LYNOZYFIC, ask your healthcare provider.

Before receiving LYNOZYFIC, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:

have an infection.

are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. LYNOZYFIC may harm your unborn baby. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you become pregnant or think that you may be pregnant during treatment with LYNOZYFIC.

Females who are able to become pregnant:

Your healthcare provider should do a pregnancy test before you start treatment with LYNOZYFIC.

You should use an effective form of birth control (contraception) during treatment with LYNOZYFIC and for 3 months after your last dose of LYNOZYFIC.

are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known whether LYNOZYFIC passes into your breast milk. Do not breastfeed during treatment with LYNOZYFIC and for 3 months after your last dose of LYNOZYFIC.

Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take , including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.

How will I receive LYNOZYFIC?

LYNOZYFIC will be given to you by your healthcare provider by infusion through a needle placed in a vein (intravenous infusion).

After the “step-up dosing schedule”, the treatment dose of LYNOZYFIC is usually given 1 time each week for 11 doses, and then 1 time every other week for 5 doses. After these doses and based on how your disease responds, your healthcare provider will decide if you are able to receive LYNOZYFIC less often (every 4 weeks) or will continue to have every other week treatment.

Your healthcare provider will decide how long you will receive treatment with LYNOZYFIC.

If you miss any appointments, call your healthcare provider as soon as possible to reschedule your appointment. It is important for you to be monitored closely for side effects during treatment with LYNOZYFIC.

What should I avoid while receiving LYNOZYFIC?

Do not drive, or operate heavy or potentially dangerous machinery, or do other dangerous activities for 48 hours after completing each of your “step-up” doses or at any time during treatment with LYNOZYFIC if you develop new neurologic symptoms, until the symptoms go away.

What are the possible side effects of LYNOZYFIC?

LYNOZYFIC may cause serious side effects, including:

Infections. LYNOZYFIC can cause bacterial, viral, or fungal infections that are serious, life-threatening, or that may lead to death. Upper respiratory tract infections and pneumonia are common during treatment with LYNOZYFIC.

Your healthcare provider will monitor you for signs and symptoms of infection before and during treatment with LYNOZYFIC.

Your healthcare provider may prescribe medicines for you to help prevent infections and treat you as needed if you develop an infection during treatment with LYNOZYFIC.

Tell your healthcare provider right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of infection during treatment with LYNOZYFIC, including:

fever of 100.4 °F (38 °C) or higher

chills

cough

shortness of breath

chest pain

sore throat

pain during urination

feeling weak or generally unwell

Decreased white blood cell counts . Decreased white blood cell counts are common during treatment with LYNOZYFIC and can also be severe. Fever can happen with low white blood cell counts and may be a sign that you have an infection. Your healthcare provider will check your blood cell counts before you start treatment and during treatment with LYNOZYFIC, and will treat you as needed.

Liver problems. LYNOZYFIC can cause increased liver enzymes and bilirubin in your blood. These increases can happen with or without you also having CRS. Your healthcare provider will do blood tests to check your liver before starting and during treatment with LYNOZYFIC. Tell your healthcare provider if you develop any of the following signs or symptoms of liver problems:

tiredness

loss of appetite

pain in your right upper stomach-area (abdomen)

dark urine yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes

The most common side effects of LYNOZYFIC include:

muscle and bone pain

nausea

cough

headache

diarrhea

93% overall response and 76% complete response rates with median progression-free survival of 18 months in patients with large B-cell lymphoma in the 3L+ setting

83% overall response and 61% complete response rates in cohort comprised predominantly of patients with primary refractory large B-cell lymphoma in the 2L setting

Manageable safety profile appropriate for outpatient administration; no high-grade CRS and ≤ 5% of patients with Grade ≥ 3 ICANS following dexamethasone prophylaxis

Lyell management will host an investor webcast with presenting author and ronde-cel investigator Sarah M. Larson, MD, Associate Professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, at 8:30 AM ET on Monday, December 8 th

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Dec. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lyell Immunopharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: LYEL), a clinical-stage company advancing a pipeline of next-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies for patients with cancer, today announced new clinical and translational data from the ongoing clinical trial of rondecabtagene autoleucel (ronde-cel, also known as LYL314) in patients with large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL), which were presented today in two oral presentations at the 67 th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition. As of the data cutoff date of September 5, 2025, ronde-cel continued to demonstrate robust clinical responses with a manageable safety profile appropriate for outpatient administration. A 93% overall response rate, a 76% complete response rate, and median progression-free survival of 18 months were reported for patients with relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) LBCL in the third- or later-line (3L+) setting. Patients evaluated in the second-line (2L) setting (94% with difficult-to-treat primary refractory disease) achieved an 83% overall response rate and a 61% complete response rate, and 70% of patients with a complete response remained in complete response at 6 months or longer.

Ronde-cel is an autologous dual-targeting CD19/CD20 CAR T-cell product candidate in pivotal development for patients with R/R LBCL. Ronde-cel CAR T cells are designed to have enhanced antitumor activity through a proprietary manufacturing process that enriches for CD62L-positive cells to produce a CAR T-cell product with a higher proportion of naïve and central memory T cells. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted ronde-cel Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation for the treatment of patients with R/R LBCL in the 3L+ and 2L settings.

“These data from the ongoing clinical trial showing high rates of durable complete responses along with a manageable safety profile in patients with high-risk large B-cell lymphoma represent the potential of ronde-cel to improve patient outcomes,” commented Sarah M. Larson, MD, Associate Professor, Department of Medicine, Medical Director, Immune Effector Cell Therapy Program, Division of Hematology/Oncology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. “The two pivotal trials underway, including the first-of-its kind head-to-head CAR T-cell trial, are expected to provide a comprehensive and robust evaluation of the potential for ronde-cel to demonstrate differentiated benefit over approved CD19 CAR T-cell therapies.”

Sixty-nine CAR T-cell naïve patients with R/R LBCL received ronde-cel as of the data cutoff date for the presentation. The efficacy evaluable population, defined as those patients with Day 84 assessments or prior disease progression or death, consisted of 47 patients (29 in the 3L+ and 18 in the 2L settings). Imaging assessments were performed locally by the sites. Patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were consistent with a high-risk, heavily pre-treated patient population, particularly as compared to historical trials of CD19 CAR T-cell products: median ages of 64 and 65 years with 20% (9/45) and 21% (5/24) of patients being 75 years or older in the 3L+ and 2L settings, respectively; and primary refractory disease in 49% (22/45) and 92% (22/24) of patients in the 3L+ and 2L settings, respectively.

Patients Evaluated in the 3L+ Setting

There were 29 efficacy-evaluable 3L+ patients with R/R LBCL (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, Grade 3B follicular lymphoma, or transformed follicular lymphoma) with a median follow up time of 12 months as of the data cutoff date. In these patients:

The overall response rate was 93% (27/29 patients), with 76% (22/29) of patients achieving a complete response

72% (13/18) of patients with complete response remained in complete response at 6 months or longer

Median progression-free survival was 18 months

Patients Evaluated in the 2L Setting

There were 18 efficacy-evaluable patients enrolled in the 2L setting with a median follow-up time of 9 months as of the data cutoff date. Of these efficacy-evaluable patients, 94% had primary refractory disease. In these patients:

The overall response rate was 83% (15/18 patients), with 61% (11/18) achieving a complete response

70% (7/10) of patients with complete response remained in complete response at 6 months or longer

The median duration of complete response was not reached

Safety Data

In 69 patients, including patients from both the 3L+ and the 2L cohorts, a manageable safety profile appropriate for outpatient administration was observed. No Grade 3 or greater cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was observed in any patient. Twenty-five of the 69 patients received protocol-directed dexamethasone prophylaxis (10 mg/day for 3 days). One case (4%) of Grade 3 or greater ICANS was reported in a patient with high disease burden; no case of Grade 2 ICANS was reported.

In all 69 patients, as of the data cutoff date, low rates of Grade 1 (32%) or Grade 2 (29%) CRS were reported; ICANS rates were reported as follows: Grade 1 (9%), Grade 2 (3%), and Grade 3 or greater (12%) of patients. The median time to complete resolution of all reports of ICANS was 4 days. Cell pharmacodynamic data demonstrated robust CAR T-cell expansion and persistence that were similar in patients with or without dexamethasone prophylaxis. No deaths were determined to be related to ronde-cel administration.

Pivotal Clinical Trials

Lyell has initiated two pivotal clinical trials of ronde-cel: PiNACLE – H2H and PiNACLE.

PiNACLE – H2H is a Phase 3 head-to-head CAR T-cell therapy randomized controlled clinical trial of ronde-cel versus investigator’s choice of either lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) or axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) in patients with R/R LBCL receiving treatment in the 2L setting. Patients randomized to ronde-cel will be treated with a dose of 100 x 10 6 CAR T cells; patients in the control arm will be treated as per the product label. The primary endpoint of the trial is event-free survival and the trial is expected to enroll approximately 200 patients per arm (N = 400) with R/R LBCL, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, high grade B-cell lymphoma, Grade 3B follicular lymphoma, or transformed follicular or transformed mantle cell lymphoma who have not previously received CAR T-cell therapy. Patients may be treated with ronde-cel in either the inpatient or outpatient setting. More information about the PiNACLE – H2H trial can be found on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT07188558) here .

PiNACLE is a single-arm trial of ronde-cel that is enrolling up to 120 patients receiving treatment in the 3L+ setting. This registration trial is a seamless expansion of the 3L+ cohort from the Phase 1/2 trial. The dose is 100 x 10 6 CAR+ cells and the primary endpoint is overall response rate. Patients may be treated with ronde-cel in either the inpatient or outpatient setting. More information about the PiNACLE trial can be found on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05826535) here .

Ronde-cel Translational Data

Translational data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial showed that ronde-cel manufactured with CD62L enrichment achieved robust expansion and high expression of memory-related genes after infusion in patients with LBCL. An evaluation of ronde-cel and published data for CD19 CAR T-cell products demonstrated that ronde-cel had a higher proportion of CD62L-positive T cells with a higher proportion of memory-cell phenotype prior to infusion (ronde-cel, N = 34; axi-cel, N = 110 and tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel), N = 31). In addition, ronde-cel had up to a three-fold higher expansion in patients after infusion compared to the expansion of approved CD19 CAR T-cell products. The product memory-cell phenotype was positively correlated with expansion. Peripheral blood samples collected from patients one month after infusion (N = 9) also had a higher proportion of CAR T cells with a memory phenotype compared to cells from axi-cel-treated patients (N = 4). Ronde-cel CAR-positive T cells collected from patients one (N = 7) and two months (N = 3) after infusion demonstrated sustained capacity to proliferate, kill tumor cells over 72 hours, and secrete cytokines (N = 3).

The clinical data were highlighted in an oral presentation by Sarah M. Larson, MD, Associate Professor, Department of Medicine, Medical Director, Immune Effector Cell Therapy Program, Division of Hematology/Oncology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA. Translational data were presented in a separate oral presentation by Akil Merchant, MD, Associate Professor and Co-Director of the Lymphoma Program at the Samuel Oschin Cancer Center, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA.

Conference Call Details

Lyell’s management will host an investor conference call and webcast to review these data at 8:30 AM ET on Monday, December 8th. The webcast registration link can be accessed here . A replay of the event and presentation materials will be available on the Investor page of the Lyell Website following the end of the event.

Poster outlines clinical benefit with acceptable safety profile across 9 tested dosing regimens

Accelerated step-up dosing and higher dosing frequency is feasible and results in increased exposure

Six of eight responders presented with low bone marrow blast counts at baseline, supporting further investigation in this patient population most likely to benefit from MP0533

ZURICH-SCHLIEREN, Switzerland and CONCORD, Mass., Dec. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ad hoc announcement pursuant to Art. 53 LR Molecular Partners AG (SIX: MOLN; NASDAQ: MOLN), a clinical-stage biotech company developing a new class of custom-built protein drugs known as DARPin therapeutics (“Molecular Partners” or the “Company”), has today announced it will present updated data from a Phase 1/2a trial of the multispecific T-cell engager MP0533 in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in a poster at the 67th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition, taking place December 6-9, 2025, in Orlando, Florida.

The poster outlines the latest results of this multicenter, open-label study evaluating MP0533 for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/AML (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05673057 ). Data from cohorts 8 and 9 show that densified MP0533 dosing appears tolerable and leads to markedly improved serum exposure in treatment cycle 1, with encouraging preliminary antitumor activity.

“The results in patients with higher frequency dosing regimens of MP0533 are very encouraging. I am happy to see the clinical benefit of MP0533 in a mutation-agnostic manner in R/R AML patients, in particular those with lower disease burden. The data indicate that MP0533 has the potential to significantly improve treatment options for patients with AML and I support investigating MP0533 in a Phase 2 setting to confirm its safety and activity in earlier lines as consolidation addition to existing backbones,” said Prof. Courtney DiNardo, M.D., Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston, Texas, and co-chair of the MP0533 dose escalation review committee (DERC).

As of the data cut-off of September 1, 2025, 54 patients had been treated with MP0533. Eight of 48 evaluable patients achieved a response, with five reaching composite complete responses (3 complete responses, CR, and 2 CR with partial hemotologic recovery) and three reaching morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS). Six of the 8 responders, and 11 of 14 patients who achieved a reduction in bone marrow blasts of more than 50%, presented with less than 20% bone marrow blast at baseline, indicating that patients with low disease burden are most likely to benefit from MP0533. One patient in cohort 8 has been in complete remission for over a year, and one patient in cohort 9 is on the trial since 4 months. Cohort 10, which aims at reaching the same target dose as cohort 8 while exposing patients to more drug over time, is ongoing with data expected in 2026.

“The Phase 1/2a trial with MP0533 is making good progress, with the densified dosing regimen showing to be feasible, with an acceptable safety profile, and resulting in clinical benefit. The results warrant further exploration of MP0533’s potential, both in the R/R and front-line AML settings in combination with standard of care, and several consortia have approached us expressing interest in conducting such studies. We are actively engaging with potential partners and continue our dialogue with key opinion leaders and regulators to shape the next phase of development of our innovative T-cell engager for patients,” said Philippe Legenne, M.D., CMO of Molecular Partners .

MP0533 is a novel tetra-specific T cell-engaging DARPin designed for selective and broad killing of AML cells in a mutation-agnostic manner. MP0533 simultaneously targets three tumor-associated antigens CD33, CD123, and CD70 on AML cells as well as the immune activator CD3 on T cells. AML cells commonly co-express at least two of the three target antigens, whereas most healthy cells only express one or none. MP0533 binds with increasing avidity as the number of its target antigens present increases, thereby preferentially binding to AML cells over healthy cells. This unique mode of action is designed to enable T cell-mediated killing of AML cells while preserving a therapeutic window that minimizes damage to healthy cells.

About DARPin Therapeutics

DARPin (Designed Ankyrin Repeat Protein) therapeutics are a new class of custom-built protein drugs based on natural binding proteins that open new dimensions of multi-functionality and multi-target specificity in drug design. The flexible architecture, intrinsic potential for high affinity and specificity, small size and high stability of DARPins offer benefits to drug design over other currently available protein-based therapeutics. DARPin candidates can be radically simple, with a single DARPin unit acting as the delivery vector to a specific target; or multispecific, with the possibility of engaging more than five targets, and combining multiple and conditional functionalities in a unique DARPin drug candidate. The DARPin platform is designed to be a rapid and cost-effective drug discovery engine, producing drug candidates with optimized properties and high production yields. DARPin therapeutics have been clinically validated across several therapeutic areas and developed through to the registrational stage.
