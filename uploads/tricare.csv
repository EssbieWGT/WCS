BiomX (PHGE, Financial) receives FDA endorsement for its BX011 phage therapy targeting diabetic foot infections (DFI).

Significant non-dilutive funding of $40 million from U.S. Defense Health Agency and Department of Navy supports development.

BiomX operates in the biotechnology sector, focusing on phage therapies for chronic diseases.

BiomX (PHGE) has received affirmative feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regarding its clinical development strategy for BX011. This novel multi-phage cocktail aims to combat Staphylococcus aureus in diabetic foot infections (DFI). The FDA's input endorses BiomX’s progression of its phage therapy for DFIs as the next clinical application, building on the prior Phase 2 study of BX211, which targeted diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) linked to S. aureus.

The focus on DFI is driven by three main factors: a larger patient base with unfulfilled medical needs, substantial commercial potential, and a distinct regulatory route informed by established FDA guidelines. As both DFI and DFO involve the S. aureus pathogen, DFI is positioned as the initial indication for regulatory approval before exploring further DFO development. BX011 is composed of multiple proprietary phages, including those assessed in the BX211 study.

Approximately $40 million in non-dilutive funding from U.S. Defense Health Agency and the Department of Navy supports BiomX's efforts. Moving forward, further development of BX011 will align with dialogues with the U.S. Defense Health Agency and depend on financial resources to commence a Phase 2a trial in DFIs. The FDA has provided a clear path for a potential Biologics License Application, with no additional non-clinical studies required, affirming BiomX’s manufacturing and quality strategies.

Company Overview and Market Position

BiomX Inc is engaged in developing both natural and engineered phage cocktails and personalized treatments designed to target and destroy harmful bacteria in chronic diseases, including cystic fibrosis and diabetic foot osteomyelitis. It discovers and validates proprietary bacterial targets and customizes phage compositions against these targets, applying its BOLT (BacteriOphage Lead to Treatment) platform. The company operates within the Healthcare sector, specifically in the Biotechnology industry, with a market capitalization of approximately $11.25 million.

Financial Health Analysis

BiomX's financial health presents several challenges:

Revenue growth remains stagnant with zero revenue reported, indicating a focus on development rather than commercialization.

Profitability metrics are concerning, with a negative EPS of -1.01 and a ROE of -69.73%.

The balance sheet shows a current ratio of 2.66, indicating adequate liquidity, but the debt-to-equity ratio of 0.49 suggests moderate leverage.

Valuation and Market Sentiment

BiomX's valuation metrics reflect its distressed status:

The P/B ratio stands at 21.19, indicating a high valuation relative to book value.

Technical indicators show a RSI-14 of 35.83, suggesting the stock is approaching oversold territory.

Institutional ownership is at 35.28%, with minimal insider activity, reflecting cautious market sentiment.

Military families sacrifice stability, predictability, and support systems so their loved ones can serve the nation.
Through her social media and nonprofit work, she supports caregivers, disabled individuals, and military families.","As the federal government shutdown continues, much of the national conversation has centered on one question: will service members miss a paycheck? But for military families, it’s so much more than just a possible missed paycheck. For many families, especially junior enlisted households and those caring for medically complex children, the shutdown is proving to be a destabilizing event touching every part of life at once.

Active duty service members are still required to report to duty without any guarantee that the next paycheck will arrive in full or on time. Already, families have reported partial and incorrect pay during the shutdown, in some cases short by hundreds or thousands of dollars. This would be stressful for any American household, and for military families, it comes on top of unique pressures tied to service. Many military families operate on a single income due to frequent moves, deployments, child care challenges, and gaps in support, making consistent employment nearly impossible for spouses. Essential expenses often consume most of their income and make it nearly impossible to build savings, even when budgeting responsibly. Nearly 25% of military households have less than $500 in savings, which leaves little to handle unexpected expenses or financial strain during a shutdown. Income has also been cut off for some dual-income military families. More than 16,000 military spouses are employed by the federal government. When their paychecks pause along with uncertainty around military pay, families are finding themselves with two income streams at risk. It’s especially difficult for families who are already stretched thin, with almost no financial cushion.

Even in typical circumstances one in four military families experience food insecurity and the shutdown is making it worse. A late, reduced, or missed paycheck can lead to parents having to choose between bills and feeding their kids. About 23,000 active duty military households depend on programs like SNAP to help feed their children. While two judges have ordered SNAP contingency funds to be released, families will still face significant delays due to states needing time to receive and process the money and with only a portion of the necessary funding currently available, many households may receive reduced or partial benefits. These are households juggling service, sacrifice, deployments, unpredictable schedules, and the daily demands of raising children while one parent serves the nation. No military family should ever have to worry about whether they can afford groceries.

Healthcare access has also become more uncertain during the shutdown. Coverage through TRICARE continues, but TRICARE has stated that payments to medical providers may be delayed until funding is restored. That means doctors, therapists, and medical offices treating military families are now forced to wait for reimbursement. Some offices have already begun warning families that they may pause services, stop accepting TRICARE, or limit new appointments if the shutdown continues. For military families with medically complex children or loved ones who depend on regular therapies, specialty care, or consistent medical support, even the threat of service interruptions is deeply unsettling. Military pharmacies have begun to experience medication shortages or limited stock, forcing families to fill prescriptions at civilian pharmacies where co-pays apply. Families who normally pay nothing for essential medication have suddenly faced hundreds of dollars in unexpected costs. For children with rare diseases, seizure disorders, respiratory conditions, or other complex needs, medication consistency is a matter of safety, stability, and in some cases, survival. Junior enlisted families, already living on tight budgets, are being forced into impossible choices between medical necessity and what they can realistically afford.

Child care is being hit too. Some base child development centers have already reduced hours or closed certain services during the shutdown, and programs like Head Start are facing funding deadlines that could shut classrooms if this continues. For military families, child care is what allows spouses to work and what holds routines together during deployments and long duty days, it’s what gives medically complex kids and their sibling’s stability and support. And now, with financial uncertainty growing by the day, many families can’t even afford backup or civilian child care options if base care is limited or unavailable. Without child care, parents are left scrambling, jobs are put at risk, and families lose one more layer of stability they rely on.

Housing and relocation are under strain as well. Military families in the middle of permanent change-of-station (PCS) moves are reporting delays in travel approvals, shipment schedules, and on base housing processing due to the shutdown. This is forcing families into extended temporary lodging, prolonged housing overlap, and uncertainty about when their children can enroll in school at their next duty station. On top of the emotional and logistical stress, many families are fronting thousands of dollars in PCS costs and now face delayed reimbursements because of the shutdown, leaving them vulnerable to debt during an already difficult transition.

All of this uncertainty takes a toll on mental health. Military spouses report rising anxiety, stress, and emotional exhaustion. Spouses who are already carrying the load alone during deployments or long duty hours are stretched even further. Service members feel the strain too, especially those serving away from home who have to watch their families struggle without being able to step in and help. The emotional weight ultimately travels with them into their work, affecting focus, readiness, and overall well-being. This is a force readiness issue.

Government shutdowns are often framed as a political impasse or administrative pause. But inside military homes, it looks very different. It looks like a parent desperately calling multiple pharmacies to find seizure medication and hope they can afford it. It looks like a young family calculating whether they can afford groceries and gas in the same week. It looks like a child missing essential therapy sessions because TRICARE may not pay on time. It looks like a spouse refreshing the bank account at midnight hoping the pay processed correctly. It looks like a service member thousands of miles away worrying about whether their family back home can meet their basic needs.

Military families sacrifice stability, predictability, and support systems so their loved ones can serve the nation. They move frequently, endure separations, and stretch budgets that are often already strained. They shouldn’t be pushed into crisis because political leaders fail to work together to fund the basic functions of government.

This shutdown is a cascading threat to financial security, food access, medication continuity, mental health, educational stability, and family readiness. The longer it continues, the higher the cost, not only to military households but also to the force and to national security itself.

Ok I’ll help. 45 minutes would be 3 units. And yes, bill like Medicare timed codes. If the patient only has Tricare, it may be different, but Tricare is a federal government plan, so I think it would be the same billing rules. I see a lot of Medicare with Tricare as secondary, so I follow Medicare billing rules. I’m assuming this company wants you to bill 4 codes and not 3, but that would require you to spend more time to meet the time parameters set by Medicare. Look up the insurance providers in your state to see the type of billing required, but I’m pretty sure you bill as if it was Medicare. Remember it’s your license at stake. Don’t let the company push you into fraudulent billing practice. Best of luck to you.

Physical therapy is a dynamic field that is constantly evolving with new techniques and technologies. Here are some of the innovative techniques and approaches that are making a significant impact in physical therapy:

Exoskeletons for Spinal Cord Injury (SCI)

Exoskeletons are advanced robotic devices that help individuals with SCI regain mobility and perform daily activities. These devices provide support and assistance, allowing patients to stand, walk, and even climb stairs. ""Exoskeletons for SCI are making crazy advances which is promising.""

Ultrasound-Guided Dry Needling

Dry needling is a technique that involves inserting thin needles into trigger points in the muscle to relieve pain and improve muscle function. Ultrasound guidance ensures precise placement of the needles, enhancing the effectiveness and safety of the procedure. ""Ultrasound guided dry needling""

Shockwave Therapy

Shockwave therapy uses acoustic waves to stimulate healing in tissues. It is being used to treat various conditions, including tendonitis, plantar fasciitis, and even arthritis, with promising results. ""Europe is doing shockwave for some injuries and arthritis and its showing some good results.""

3D Printing for Adaptive Equipment

3D printing is revolutionizing the creation of custom adaptive equipment, reducing costs and improving accessibility. This includes printing custom-fit braces, prosthetics, and other assistive devices. ""3D printing DME and other costly materials, that would in hope lower the cost by cutting out the middleman.""

Remote Patient Monitoring

Remote patient monitoring allows physical therapists to track their patients' progress and provide guidance from a distance. This is particularly useful for patients in rural areas or those with limited access to clinics. ""So much remote patient monitoring.""

AI in EMR and Treatment Planning

AI is being integrated into electronic medical records (EMR) and treatment planning tools to improve efficiency and accuracy. It can help in diagnosing conditions, recommending exercises, and even providing real-time feedback on performance. ""AI will become more prominent in EMR and other platforms.""

Aquatic Therapy

Aquatic therapy utilizes the buoyancy of water to reduce the load on joints, making it easier for patients to perform exercises. It is particularly beneficial for individuals with conditions like dysautonomia and POTS. ""I had a really positive experience with aquatic therapy.""

Vestibular Exercises

Vestibular exercises are designed to improve balance and reduce dizziness by retraining the brain to process signals from the inner ear correctly. ""My daily dizziness has improved. We talked about moving onto a POTs program which I guess entails equipment such as a recumbent bike.""

Schroth Method for Scoliosis

The Schroth Method is a specialized physical therapy approach for scoliosis that focuses on correcting spinal alignment through specific exercises and breathing techniques. ""I went to pt for over a year with no tangible improvements. Finally started paying for schroth and my pain has definitely decreased""

Motivational Interviewing

Motivational interviewing is a communication technique used by physical therapists to help patients take ownership of their rehabilitation and improve compliance with home exercise programs. ""Motivational interviewing has been a fantastic tool to improve compliance for my patients.""

If you’ve ever wondered how to get TRICARE, the very first thing to nail down is eligibility. It’s kind of the gateway to everything else. Simply put, TRICARE is a health care program for uniformed service members, retirees, and their families, including some survivors. But it’s not one-size-fits-all—your eligibility depends on your military status and circumstances.

For starters, active duty service members and their families qualify, but so do National Guard and Reserve members when they’re activated. Retired military personnel and their dependents are also in, along with certain survivors and Medal of Honor recipients. Even some former spouses may be eligible under specific conditions.

Knowing your qualification status upfront is more than just a box to tick. It affects which TRICARE plans you can access, and those plans have different coverage levels and costs.

According to the official TRICARE Eligibility page, ensuring your DEERS (Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System) record is up to date is essential. Without that, even if you qualify, your access might get delayed or denied. So, keep that information current to prevent headaches.

Step-by-Step Enrollment Process: Navigating milConnect Like a Pro

Alright, you’ve checked eligibility—now how do you actually sign up? The hub for TRICARE enrollment is milConnect, an online portal where you manage your military benefits and health records.

Here’s a laid-back walk-through to get you enrolled without pulling your hair out:

Create or log into your milConnect account. Using your DoD ID or DS Logon credentials is your gateway here.

Verify your information. Double-check your personal and family data matches exactly what’s in DEERS.

Pick your TRICARE plan. There’s a bunch of options—TRICARE Prime, Select, Young Adult, etc. More on that later.

Submit your enrollment. After choosing your plan and reviewing costs, finalize the process online.

Keep a copy of your confirmation. Important if you need proof later or want to check your status.

Keep in mind, milConnect doesn’t play well with Internet Explorer anymore—you’ll need to use browsers like Edge, Firefox, or Chrome for smooth sailing. If tech issues hit, there’s a 24/7 support line just waiting for your call at (800) 477-8227.

This video clears up a lot of confusion about how TRICARE fits with Medicare and VA care, which is super handy if you’re juggling multiple benefits. Definitely worth a watch if you’re sorting through the maze of military health options.

Common Enrollment Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

There’s nothing worse than thinking you did all the right stuff only to find your TRICARE coverage isn’t kicking in. So, let’s talk about some of the usual slip-ups and how to dodge them:

Outdated DEERS info. This is the big one. Your eligibility can be flagged if your address, family status, or other details aren’t current.

Missing deadlines. TRICARE has specific windows for enrollment. If you miss those, you might face delays or have to pay penalties.

Choosing the wrong plan. Not every plan fits every lifestyle—picking the cheapest might leave you with hefty out-of-pocket costs later.

Not understanding your coverage. Some services require referrals or prior authorization. Skipping these steps can mean denied claims.

Assuming automatic enrollment. Spoiler: TRICARE usually requires you to actively sign up. Don’t just presume you’re covered.

To save yourself from these headaches, take a little extra time reviewing your info before submitting, mark key dates in your calendar, and ask questions if you’re unsure. Trust me, a quick call to the DEERS Support Office at (800) 538-9552 can clarify a lot.

Real-Life User Scenarios: Choosing the Right Plan for Your Needs

Picking your TRICARE plan feels like navigating a mini labyrinth unless you get clear on your personal circumstances.

Scenario 1: Active Duty Family Looking for Hassle-Free Coverage

If you’re an active duty member or your spouse, TRICARE Prime tends to be the easiest. It offers a managed care approach with a primary care manager and referrals for specialists. It’s low-cost, with less paperwork, perfect if you want predictable care without much legwork.

Scenario 2: Retiree on a Budget but Wants Flexibility

TRICARE Select might be your go-to. It lets you choose your providers without a referral, but costs are a little higher. Great if you want freedom but still want to keep expenses manageable.

Scenario 3: Young Adult Aging Out of Dependent Coverage

Your options here include TRICARE Young Adult or even continuing some benefits up to 26 years old. Each has different premiums and coverage options, so it pays to check the details.

Quick Plan Comparison Plan Cost Primary Care Manager Referrals Needed TRICARE Prime Lowest Yes Yes TRICARE Select Moderate No No TRICARE Young Adult Varies No No

As highlighted by the official TRICARE enrollment page, enrolling in the right plan for your lifestyle can streamline getting the care you need without surprises. So, don’t rush—consider your care needs, budget, and convenience before committing.

Expert Tips for Maintaining Your Coverage Without Stress

So you got your TRICARE up and running—awesome! But wait, ongoing upkeep is key. You don’t want your coverage to drop out on you just because you forgot to update your address or re-enroll when required.

Keep DEERS updated. It bears repeating because it’s that crucial. Every time your life changes—marriage, move, baby—tell DEERS within 30 days.

Mark enrollment periods. Some coverage plans need annual renewal or updates. You’ll get notifications, but setting your own reminders helps dodge lapses.

Check your healthcare providers. If you prefer certain doctors, verify they still accept your TRICARE plan to avoid unexpected refusals.

Keep track of your health benefits card. It’s your ticket to painless claims.

Reach out if confused. The DMDC/DEERS Support Office is not just a phone number; it’s your lifeline for help.

A little effort every few months keeps the whole system humming smoothly and saves you from last-minute panics before big appointments.

From education grants to home loan programs, hidden perks are designed to ease the financial and emotional load of military life. Yet thousands of eligible spouses never claim them, leaving valuable resources unused. Whether you’re active duty, retired, or part of the Reserve or National Guard community, these programs can make a real difference. Here are 10 powerful benefits military spouses should be taking advantage of right now.

1. MyCAA Education and Career Grants

The My Career Advancement Account (MyCAA) program offers up to $4,000 in tuition assistance for spouses pursuing certifications, licenses, or associate degrees in portable career fields. It’s available to spouses of active-duty service members in pay grades E1–E5, W1–W2, and O1–O2. Whether you’re training for nursing, IT, or education, MyCAA covers approved institutions and career programs. Many participants complete training entirely online, making it easy to learn from anywhere.

2. Free Career Coaching and Resume Support

The Military Spouse Employment Partnership (MSEP) connects spouses with employers who actively seek military talent. You can access one-on-one career coaching, federal resume help, and job boards featuring companies that understand the demands of military life. It’s an excellent resource for remote and portable positions. The partnership’s goal: make sure your career moves with you every PCS.

3. Military Home Loans and Fee Waivers

Military families can access special VA loan benefits, even if the service member isn’t the one applying. Surviving spouses of veterans may also qualify for zero-down VA home loans with no mortgage insurance. Many states offer additional property tax exemptions or closing-cost waivers. For families constantly relocating, these programs remove massive financial hurdles to homeownership.

4. Scholarships for Spouses and Children

Nonprofits like Fisher House Foundation, National Military Family Association (NMFA), and ThanksUSA offer annual scholarships to military spouses pursuing higher education. Awards typically range from $1,000–$5,000 and are available across all branches. Even dependents can qualify for additional funds through state programs or base-specific scholarships. Education doesn’t have to stop when your spouse deploys.

5. Free or Discounted Childcare Programs

Through Child Care Aware of America, military families can receive fee assistance for civilian childcare centers when on-base care isn’t available. Fees adjust to your rank and income, often cutting childcare costs by 50% or more. For dual-working spouses, this benefit can save thousands annually. It’s one of the most underused yet essential resources for families balancing military and career life.

6. Health Coverage Continuation Through TRICARE

Spouses and dependents qualify for TRICARE, which provides comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage. Even after separation, some families can extend benefits through the Continued Health Care Benefit Program (CHCBP). It bridges the gap while transitioning to civilian insurance. TRICARE also covers mental health services—something many families overlook but deeply need after deployments or relocations.

7. Military Store and Travel Discounts

Don’t overlook commissary privileges, base exchanges, and Space-A travel benefits. Spouses can save up to 30% on groceries and essentials, plus access deeply discounted flights through the military’s space-available program. ID cards are key—make sure yours is current to unlock access. These everyday discounts can stretch budgets significantly, especially overseas or in high-cost-of-living areas.

8. Free Financial Counseling and Tax Prep

Military spouses have access to free financial counseling, budget coaching, and tax preparation services through Military OneSource and on-base family centers. Certified counselors can help with debt reduction, investment planning, and benefits optimization. During tax season, Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) centers provide free, expert-level filing for both state and federal returns. One session could save hundreds in accountant fees.

9. Support for Entrepreneurship and Small Business Grants

Programs like Patriot Boot Camp, Veteran Women Igniting the Spirit of Entrepreneurship (V-WISE), and SBA’s Office of Veterans Business Development offer training and funding to military spouses starting small businesses. These initiatives help turn mobile-friendly ideas into real income. From Etsy shops to consulting firms, the military spouse community has become one of the fastest-growing groups of entrepreneurs in the U.S.

10. Survivor Benefits and Retirement Continuation

If the service member passes away, the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides ongoing monthly payments to the spouse. Combined with Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC), this financial safety net ensures stability after loss. Spouses also remain eligible for commissary, TRICARE, and base privileges under specific conditions. It’s a benefit no one wants to need—but one every spouse should understand.

Why Military Spouses Should Claim Every Benefit They Earned

Military spouses sacrifice careers, stability, and time with loved ones in service to the country. These benefits aren’t handouts—they’re earned rights meant to ease that burden. Knowing and using them can strengthen your finances, education, and overall well-being. Don’t let red tape or lack of awareness keep you from resources designed to support your family’s future.

Are you or someone you know a military spouse? Which benefits have made the biggest difference—or which ones were hardest to discover?

As the military chapter of the ACS, the ESS provides a voice and serves as a dedicated community for military surgeons within the nation’s largest surgical organization. The ESS acts as both a gateway for trainees beginning their ACS journey and a bridge for military surgeons moving into civilian practice. This military–civilian partnership aims to preserve the lessons of the past, improve care in the present, and anticipate the challenges of the future.

Baird is a captain in the United States Army and joined UAB in 2021 as the General Surgery Residency Program’s first ever military resident. Before completing medical school, Baird was a civilian counterterrorism analyst for the Department of Defense. Her deployment in this role gave her exposure to combat casualty care, which inspired her to attend the Uniformed Services University and become a military trauma surgeon.

As a medical student, she was named an abstract winner in the American College of Physicians National Abstract Competition for her work on enteral resuscitation in burn shock, highlighting innovative approaches to fluid management when IV therapy is limited. During residency, she has presented research at the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) Annual Meeting alongside UAB faculty, contributing to studies that strengthen military-civilian surgical partnerships and trauma readiness. Her research interests focus on combat casualty care, surgical innovation, and optimizing medical technology for austere environments.

“It’s an incredible honor to represent residents and fellows in the Excelsior Surgical Society,” Baird said. “Military medicine is built on collaboration, resilience, and shared service, and I’m excited to help strengthen mentorship and engagement opportunities across all training levels.”",https://www.uab.edu/joomla4/media/templates/site/sleepyDragon/favicon/favicon-196x196.png,N,0.0,2025-11-03 13:02:14.938565

And though she and her husband are stationed at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Ashcraft is grateful for Open Season in its entirety.
“It’s great when everything is free, but if your current TRICARE plan isn’t adequate, it’s not worth it,” she said.
Open Season applies for those who already have, or qualify for, TRICARE Prime, U.S. Family Health Plan or TRICARE Select.
This year’s TRICARE Open Season runs from Nov. 10 to Dec. 9.","When Army spouse Ashley Ashcraft first approached her husband about TRICARE’s Open Season — where beneficiaries have roughly one month from mid-November to mid-December to switch health plans for the upcoming year — he was hesitant.

“It’s free if we stay with TRICARE Prime,” he pointed out. “Why should we switch plans to TRICARE Select and have co-pays and deductibles?”

But a health scare with one of the Ashcrafts’ children demonstrated the need for more flexibility in their TRICARE plan.

After hearing about Open Season from other military families, they researched and found that switching from TRICARE Prime to TRICARE Select would allow them to book appointments for most primary and specialty care with any TRICARE-authorized providers without referrals. Pre-authorization from a member’s regional provider might be necessary in certain services.

And though some out-of-pocket costs vary depending on the sponsor’s military status, the couple realized Select’s pros outweighed its costs for them.

“We saw that if we switched over to Select, we wouldn’t have the wait times and could see the best doctors in the area without getting told who to see,” Ashcraft said. “That became worth it.”

Their decision became even firmer when they had a daughter diagnosed with Down syndrome and heart issues in 2023.

Open Season, which began in 2018, gives beneficiaries “maximum flexibility” so they can reevaluate every year and make health plan changes based on their family needs, according to Zelly Zim, a health system specialist with Policy and Programs at TRICARE.

“That’s the most important part,” Zim said.

Since its onset, the annual Open Season window usually sees “anywhere from 10[,000] to 20,000” beneficiaries switch plans, according to Zim. There could be any number of reasons why a beneficiary might consider switching, she said, including someone’s location and access to military hospitals and clinics, changes in military status or a desire for flexibility in picking providers.

“What type of access does your family need for care? Do you want to be going through a Primary Care Provider? Are you wanting to see a specialist?” she said. “There are a lot of families throughout their career who found that one plan or the other makes more sense.”

Zim said that looking at out-of-pockets costs, how healthy someone is in a given year or during that phase helps determine if a beneficiary should consider making changes during Open Season.

There’s something unique about this year’s Open Season, too: some TRICARE beneficiaries in the Atlanta, Georgia, and Tampa, Florida, areas can enroll in the TRICARE Prime Demo by CareSource Military & Veterans for expanded care opportunities.

“The goal is to give our beneficiaries an additional option,” Zim said.

And though she and her husband are stationed at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Ashcraft is grateful for Open Season in its entirety.

“It’s great when everything is free, but if your current TRICARE plan isn’t adequate, it’s not worth it,” she said. “We have seen some of the best doctors in the whole country for what our daughter needs without the red tape because of being able to switch from Prime to Select — what a gift!”

Zim recommended that all military-connected families first check which plans they are eligible for. Also, beneficiaries should ensure all information is up-to-date with the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS), especially with any recent births, adoptions or marriages.

Open Season applies for those who already have, or qualify for, TRICARE Prime, U.S. Family Health Plan or TRICARE Select. Those interested can find the best plan for them at TRICARE’s online plan finder at https://tricare.mil/Plans.

With TRICARE Open Season 2025 right around the corner, now is a perfect time to learn about TRICARE’s wide range of coverage options. Knowing the differences will ensure the right coverage for you and your family members.

“There are some differences in the types of plans TRICARE offers,” said Zelly Zim, senior program analyst, Policy & Programs Division, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “Provider preference, out-of-pocket costs, and referrals and pre-authorizations are all factors to consider when making your choice.”

TRICARE Open Season starts Monday, Nov. 10, and runs through Tuesday, Dec. 9. Learning about these plans now—whether you’re enrolling for the first time or making changes to fit your needs—will help you decide if you want to make changes to your coverage effective Jan. 1, 2026.

Comparing options

The easiest way to understand different TRICARE plans is to compare them in three simple steps:

Use the TRICARE Plan Finder. Answer a few questions and see which plans you may be eligible for.

Compare plans using the TRICARE Compare Plans Tool. Note differences in coverage, provider networks, and referral requirements.

Review your family’s 2025 costs carefully. 2026 costs will be available in early November.

There’s no need to compare plans if you’re on active duty or have TRICARE For Life. Coverage is automatic for active duty service members. TFL coverage is automatic if you have Medicare Part A and Part B.

TRICARE plans at a glance

TRICARE offers health plans designed to meet your needs. Two of the most common options are TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select.

TRICARE Prime

TRICARE Prime works like a health maintenance organization. It typically offers lower out-of-pocket costs, but your care is managed through a primary care manager. You’ll usually need referrals for specialty care. If you don’t mind a structured approach, TRICARE Prime is a good fit.

TRICARE Select

With TRICARE Select you don’t need a PCM, and you can see any TRICARE-authorized provider without a referral. This plan is good for those who want more flexibility with providers, though it generally has higher out-of-pocket costs.

If you’re interested in comparing TRICARE Prime to TRICARE Select, check out the TRICARE Open Season roadmap.

Other options

In addition to these options, TRICARE offers several others that may be a good fit, depending on where you live:

Overseas

For those stationed or living abroad, TRICARE offers both TRICARE Prime Overseas and TRICARE Select Overseas plans, depending on your location and preferences. (Note: TRICARE Prime Overseas is only available to ADSMs, activated National Guard and Reserve members, and their command-sponsored family members.)

These plans follow similar rules as in the U.S. but are tailored to those living overseas.

US Family Health Plan

This plan is available in certain U.S. regions. USFHP allows you to receive care through a network of nonprofit systems that give personalized care in a community-based setting.

Live in the Atlanta or Tampa areas?

Starting in January 2026, the TRICARE Prime Demo by CareSource Military & Veterans will bring more choices to eligible beneficiaries living in the Atlanta and Tampa areas. Enrollees will get care through CSMV’s network of care providers.

Benefits of enrolling include:

If you’re a retiree, a retiree family member, or survivor, your enrollment fees are waived for the first 12 months, regardless of when you enroll with CSMV. After the first year, you’ll pay TRICARE Prime enrollment fees.

You won’t need referrals to see network providers.

Check your eligibility and explore the benefits—but be sure to enroll by the TRICARE Open Season deadline to secure coverage beginning Jan. 1, 2026

What about dental and vision?

You may be eligible for dental or vision coverage through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program. These plans are separate from your TRICARE health coverage.

To enroll in FEDVIP:

You must be eligible under your beneficiary category.

You must be enrolled in a TRICARE health plan to qualify for FEDVIP vision coverage.

Federal Benefits Open Season runs Nov. 10 through Dec. 8—note the earlier end date compared to TRICARE Open Season.

How to make changes

First, you’ll want to make sure your information is up to date. Even if you don’t plan on making changes, it’s always a good idea to log in to milConnect and verify your personal information is right for you and your family members.

With so many plans available, it’s important to take the time to evaluate which one best aligns with your health care needs, lifestyle, and budget.

Once your information is up to date, read “Get ready for TRICARE Open Season 2025: What you need to know” to learn how to make changes to your plan.

“Our brave soldiers have been happily enjoying our vape pits in flavors such as crème brûlée, fruity pebble, and piña colada.” Burn pits have plagued the military for decades, reaching a peak during the Iraq War.
But the Department of Defense has pledged to address the very burn pits that inspired the law — by replacing them with environmentally questionable vape pits, capable of producing “phat clouds,” according to junior enlisted personnel.

“I’m proud to say we’ve replaced unhealthy fumes with tropical aromas,” boasted Dr. Steve Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, exhaling a custard-flavored cloud. “Our brave soldiers have been happily enjoying our vape pits in flavors such as crème brûlée, fruity pebble, and piña colada.”

Burn pits have plagued the military for decades, reaching a peak during the Iraq War. Many veterans would still be fighting to prove exposure and receive care if not for the PACT Act. But the Department of Defense has pledged to address the very burn pits that inspired the law — by replacing them with environmentally questionable vape pits, capable of producing “phat clouds,” according to junior enlisted personnel.

“It’s some of the best fucking stuff I’ve ever smoked,” raved Senior Airmen Anton Marc. “After a long day of swabbing the airfield, in the rain, nothing relaxes me more than taking a rip from the vape pit. Sure, there are times when I wake up coughing blood, but it’s all paid for by the morale fund!”

Defense officials expect a morale boost across the active-duty force.

“We anticipate a 300% increase in morale and a 40% rise in vaping-related lung collapses,” said one DoD official while standing beside a tent labeled ‘JUULCONEX.’

But not everyone is on board with this so-called solution. Jon Stewart, a prominent advocate for veterans' health and key player in the passage of the PACT Act, expressed frustration.

“We... god damn it... we JUST started to correct this issue. When we worked with the VA to fix the issue, I did not imagine an Agent Orange-filled hookah lounge.”

When surveyed, junior enlisted personnel overwhelmingly supported the vape pits, requesting additional flavors such as pink lemonade and blueberry jam, rather than removing them.",https://www.duffelblog.com/content/images/size/w1200/2025/08/vape.webp,N,-1.0,2025-11-03 13:02:57.707333

To determine the effect the COVID-19 pandemic had on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis in the Military Health System (MHS). Repeated cross-sectional study utilized MHS Data Repository from JAN2018 to FEB2023. ASD encounters identified by ICD-10 diagnosis codes. Incident ASD encounters and overall visits were evaluated. Study included periods: Pre-COVID (PCo) (1/18 -2/20), COVID-19 Year (CoY) CoY1(3/20 -2/21), CoY2(3/21 -2/22) and CoY3(3/22 -2/23). Incident rates and overall visits were compared across time periods using Poisson regression, adjusting for sex, age group, region, and parent rank. Median age at first diagnosis across time periods were compared using generalized linear modeling. 2 million dependents ages 1-17 years were eligible for care over the study, with 44,508 incident ASD diagnoses (Table 1). ASD diagnosis incident rate decreased 10% in CoY1 vs. PCo (RR 0. 90, 95% CI 0. 87-0. 93) and increased during CoY2 and CoY3 [RR2 1. 21, 95% CI (1. 18-1. 24), RR3 1. 50, 95% CI (1. 46-1. 54)]. CoY1-CoY3 vs. PCo all had statistically significant increased ASD visit rates (RR1 1. 20, RR2 1. 44, RR3 1. 67). ASD diagnosis median age was 6 years (Table 1). The incidence of ASD and related encounters decreased at the COVID-19 pandemic onset, highlighting the impact COVID-19 had on a delayed process within the MHS. The ASD incidence and encounters following the pandemic onset improved and continued to increase through CoY3. This uptrend suggests adaptation by providers during COVID-19 restrictions to use telehealth for developmental screening and ASD diagnosis.

A central issue plaguing the company's finances is the ongoing payment suspension from its largest insurance client, Tricare. Despite Zynex filing an appeal and submitting data in April 2025, Tricare has maintained its temporary halt on payments. This blockage continues to place massive pressure on the company's revenue stream, and the market is keen to see if the Q3 report will indicate a resolution to this critical dispute.

Leadership Shake-Up Raises Strategic Questions

Adding to the company's instability, a significant change occurred in its executive team on October 10, 2025, when Anna Lucsok resigned from her position as Chief Commercial Officer. The company's Compensation Committee expedited the release of 60,746 stock options for the departing executive. The exit of a key leader from the sales division has prompted concerns about the future direction and execution of Zynex's sales strategy for its pain management and rehabilitation products.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Zynex?

Bearish Sentiment Dominates Trading

The stock's performance paints a clear picture of investor pessimism. On October 30, the equity experienced a sharp decline, falling 5.30 percent to close at $1.25. Over the preceding seven-day period, the stock accumulated a loss of 15.07 percent. Trading activity has been predominantly negative, with the stock closing higher on only 12 out of the last 30 trading days, while exhibiting a volatility reading of 5.04 percent.

Key price points include:

* October 30, 2025: Price fell to $1.25, a 5.30% drop.

* Previous 7 Days: A cumulative decline of 15.07%.

* 52-Week Low: $1.21

* 52-Week High: $9.33

This downward trajectory has drastically reduced the firm's market capitalization, which now stands at a mere $37.87 million, confirming the dominant bearish trend.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2373364_600_800.jpg,N,0.0,2025-11-02 15:59:38.758407

I just retired and kept mine. VA primary care doc just asked for model and serial number at my initial appointment. After a month or so, they sent me the supplies in the mail. Pretty seamless.

I had to contact the va sleep clinic. It was a pain in the ass. Eventually I just got someone..a technician? who called, walked me through pulling the settings off the machine, and she shipped me one from the va. That populated the ability to order supplies through va.gov.

When it showed it up was already preprogrammed with the settings I already had. I have no idea if someone is “monitoring” it. Nor do I really give a shit cause I can’t do without it for a good single night anymore so I have no worries about the non use part.

Following this thread. I'm still waiting on my BDD claim, but I have my Cpap since 2023. I know the fact that mine is a rental from a medical company (TYCOM). I've kinda thinking about it too, so I'm gonna call tricare and the hospital sleep clinic on how should I proceed after I retire.

If you have Tricare cover it (the cpap) you should be good, you will probably have a co-pay tho. I use the VA so yes, I had to swap, but no co-pay. I retired in 2022 and have a sleep apnea rating.",,N,0.0,2025-11-01 23:00:09.391602
