The births of these little ones mark a special moment for both sets of proud parents and the dedicated staff at TAMC. Col. William Bimson, commander of TAMC, along with department leadership, visited the parents to present baby gift baskets for the new arrivals, celebrating their milestones and offering support as they begin their journey of parenthood.

The first baby of the year, a boy, was born at 5:16 a.m. on Jan. 1 to U.S. Army Capt. Henry Zenger, a current graduate student at of the University of Hawaii, and U.S. Army Capt. Cecelia Zenger, a social work intern at TAMC. The couple arrived in Oahu in October 2024 and is thrilled to welcome their second child to the family.

The second baby, a girl, was born at 5:49 a.m. on Jan. 1 to Pfc. LaShawn Brabham, an infantry soldier with the 25th Infantry Division at Schofield Barracks, and his wife, Kayla Brabham. The couple arrived in Oahu in May 2025 and is excited to add their second child to the family.

Reflecting on their experiences at TAMC, both couples shared their positive thoughts about the physicians, nurses, and staff in the Mother Baby Unit:

“The support from the staff made all the difference, and we couldn’t be more grateful,” Henry Zenger said. “New year, new baby, let’s go!”

""I had a fast birth. It was four minutes, and I couldn’t have done it without my amazing nurse, Leilani Jimenez,” Kayla Brabham said.

“It’s always a privilege to be part of such a special moment for families,” Dr. Jonathon Yu, a family medicine physician at TAMC, said. “Seeing the joy on the parents' faces when they meet their babies for the first time is what makes our work so rewarding.”

“Every birth story is unique, and being able to support families through this journey is an honor,” Taylor Dusa, an attending registered nurse, said.” We’re thrilled to welcome two beautiful lives into the world.”

TAMC is a vital center for maternal care, delivering approximately 1,289 babies each year. The facility serves military families stationed in Hawaii and supports the entire Indo-Pacific region, including active-duty personnel, their dependents, and eligible beneficiaries from various branches of the military.

TAMC's Labor and Delivery Unit is equipped with state-of-the-art technology, ensuring comprehensive prenatal care, labor support, and postnatal care for mothers and babies. The services offered at TAMC include:

Comprehensive prenatal and postnatal care

Labor support services

Specialized care for high-risk pregnancies

Neonatal intensive care for premature or ill infants

In addition to medical services, TAMC engages with the local community through various programs aimed at supporting new parents. These include parenting classes and support groups focused on maternal health and wellness. TAMC also hosts an annual Baby Expo, offering valuable resources and information for expecting new parents, including workshops, vendor exhibits, and networking opportunities every spring.

The arrival of the first babies of 2026 at Tripler Army Medical Center is a testament to the dedicated care provided by the staff and the resilience of military families. As both sets of new parents embark on their journey of parenthood, TAMC stands ready to support them and the many families who will welcome new lives in the coming year.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2601/9467455/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2026-01-02 21:56:19.294588

Take these steps to avoid some common trouble spots, and check out this TRICARE.mil article for even more details:

Address Changes

You’ll want to ensure the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) has your new residence on file. Update your contact information via the ID Card Office Online or call DEERS at (800) 538-9552. Note: You cannot use a post office box as your DEERS address.

You’ll also need to update your address with Express Scripts to use the TRICARE Pharmacy Program. You can update your information online or by calling Express Scripts at (877) 363-1303.

Finally, update your address with the Social Security Administration, which handles Medicare processing.

Plan Changes

You will retain your Medicare and TRICARE For Life benefits in your new location, but keep these potential changes in mind:

If you’ve signed up for a Medicare Advantage Plan (MAP, or Medicare Part C) and you move out of that plan’s coverage area, you can enroll in a new MAP or revert to Original Medicare coverage during a special enrollment period.

Moving overseas? TRICARE For Life becomes your primary payer for TRICARE-covered services unless you have other health insurance. Note: You must continue to pay Medicare Part B premiums to use TRICARE For Life. Contact International SOS to find a provider or learn more about overseas care options.

It is so worth it to avoid nonsense like this article is describing.

Tricare as a whole isn't the best that's for sure. But I sure went prime when I was pregnant and I guess I was lucky everyone was covered(I was high risk both times).

Now, as far as using normal Tricare as opposed to prime or select(whatever they call it these days), I will say normal Tricare covered all of my gastric bypass and everything after it, including having to go back in for a bleed.

First off, I’m SO happy I found this forum. It’s helping me get answers and so I hope to contribute to answers and topics to help others. So here’s my newest speedbump, and maybe this will help others in the future if they find it!

I’m retired US military and through some inheritance, and careful saving through my time in the military, have had enough saved to apply for the Golden Visa (while my wife continues to work a full time job until she’s ready to leave). I have a retirement, some disability, and we look forward to spending our retirement time in Portugal.

As part of the AIMA appointment, they require an apostilled private health insurance showing that I am covered in Portugal (as I can’t be covered by the public system… fair). My Tricare coverage (tricare overseas) covers everything we need, for the duration of my lifetime. But in the US, as far as I can tell, you cannot apostille documents that are not issued by a government agency. I can apostille marriage certificates, FBI background checks, etc, because they are all signed by government agencies.

Tricare, is a private company, contracted by the government. THey also don’t have a pdf policy, you can only search online to get answers, so it’s hard to ‘prove’ that they cover the necessary things.

Any advice? I’d like to NOT purchase private insurance just to qualify for a VISA considering I have private insurance that DOES cover me… I’m just having a hard time getting apostilled proof.

With the TRICARE pharmacy contractor: Update your address with Express Scripts if you use the TRICARE Pharmacy Program.
Moving within or to the U.S. or U.S. territories Medicare provides coverage in the U.S. and U.S. territories, as described in the TRICARE For Life Handbook.
But moving is a QLE for family members who are enrolled in or eligible for TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select.","Are you planning to move soon? Whether you’re moving across town or overseas, TRICARE For Life moves with you.

“TFL provides Medicare-wraparound coverage for TRICARE beneficiaries who have Medicare Part A and Part B, regardless of their age or where they live,” said Anne Breslin, TRICARE For Life Program Manager at the Defense Health Agency. “In the U.S. and U.S. territories, Medicare and TRICARE work together to minimize your out-of-pocket costs. If you get care overseas, TRICARE For Life becomes your primary coverage, unless you have other health insurance.”

When you move, you’ll need to update your address. You’ll also need to explore your options for getting care and filling prescriptions.

Updating your address After you move, you need to update your address in a few places.

In the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System: Learn how to update your address in DEERS. You should also confirm that the rest of your DEERS record is correct.

With the Social Security Administration: Social Security maintains beneficiary records on behalf of Medicare. To update your address with Medicare, log in to your my Social Security account or call Social Security at 800-772-1213 (TTY: 800-325-0778).

With the TRICARE pharmacy contractor: Update your address with Express Scripts if you use the TRICARE Pharmacy Program. You can do this by logging in to your Express Scripts account or calling Express Scripts.

Moving within or to the U.S. or U.S. territories Medicare provides coverage in the U.S. and U.S. territories, as described in the TRICARE For Life Handbook.

If you have TFL and use Original Medicare (Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B), you can get care from Medicare participating and Medicare nonparticipating providers. You can find and compare Medicare providers in your new location.

You can also see providers who’ve opted out of Medicare. But keep in mind that Medicare doesn’t pay for services you get from opt-out providers. Learn more about getting care from Medicare providers and opt-out providers.

Are you enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan? If you move out of its service area, you’re eligible for a Medicare Special Enrollment Period. This means you’re eligible to enroll in a new Medicare Advantage Plan (Medicare Part C) and Medicare drug plan (Medicare Part D) or switch to Original Medicare. Learn more about Special Enrollment Periods.

If you have questions about Medicare, contact Medicare. In the U.S. and U.S. territories, WPS Military and Veterans Health administers the TFL benefit. Contact WPS if you have questions about TFL.

Moving overseas If you move overseas and you have Medicare Part A, you must also have Medicare Part B to remain eligible for TFL. Even though Medicare doesn’t provide coverage outside the U.S. and U.S. territories, you must continue to pay Medicare Part B premiums.

If you have TFL: • TRICARE is the primary payer for TRICARE-covered services and supplies, unless you have other health insurance. • You can get TRICARE-covered services and supplies from any TRICARE-authorized provider. (In the Philippines, you must get care from a Preferred Provider Network provider or a certified provider.) • If you get covered services from a network provider, your out-of-pocket costs will generally be lower than if you see a non-network provider. Search the overseas provider directory to find a network provider. • You’ll pay TRICARE cost-shares after you meet your TRICARE annual deductible. • You may need pre-authorization for some services.

International SOS is the TRICARE overseas contractor. Contact International SOS for help with finding providers, getting authorizations, filing claims, and more.

TRICARE Plus Have you moved close to a military hospital or clinic? You may be able to enroll in TRICARE Plus. TRICARE Plus is a health care program offered at some military hospitals and clinics. Contact your local military hospital or clinic to see if they offer the program.

Note: You can’t enroll in TRICARE Plus if you’re enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan health maintenance organization option.

Filling prescriptions You may have different pharmacy options depending on where you move: • Military pharmacies are located throughout the U.S. You can also find them in some U.S. territories and some locations overseas. Find a military pharmacy near you. • TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery will ship to any address in the U.S. or U.S. territories. This includes APO, FPO, and DPO addresses. There are different rules for using home delivery in other overseas locations. • TRICARE retail network pharmacies are located throughout the U.S. You can also find them in most U.S. territories. Find a network pharmacy near you. • At non-network pharmacies, you’ll have to pay full price for your prescription drugs. Then you can file a claim for reimbursement. Overseas, a non-network pharmacy might be your only pharmacy option. In the Philippines, you must fill prescriptions at a certified pharmacy. Learn more about filling prescriptions overseas.

Your family members When you have TFL, moving isn’t a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event for you. But moving is a QLE for family members who are enrolled in or eligible for TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select. Your family members should also update their address in DEERS after they move. They’ll have 90 days from the date of the address change to change their TRICARE health plan.

Check out “Your TRICARE Checklist for Moving” for more information and tips for what to do when you and your family move.

For aspiring mental health professionals eager to care for those who serve, the https://deploymentpsych.org/ (CDP) at the Uniformed Services University (USU) offers a rare and transformative experience — the https://deploymentpsych.org/the-summer-institute. Since 2015, this immersive program has helped future psychologists and social workers chart a course toward impactful careers supporting military service members, veterans, and their families. This year’s three-day session, held July 15–17 on USU’s Bethesda, Maryland campus, once again drew top students from across the country to learn, connect, and envision their future in military behavioral health.

The Summer Institute: Born from Necessity, Shaped by Evolution

The Summer Institute addresses a critical national shortage of mental health providers and highlights those career opportunities within the framework of military populations. Part of the design was, “How do we create a program that helps to highlight a career option in terms of serving military populations as an active duty behavioral health officer?"" explains Dr. Timothy Rogers, Pathways Program associate director.

The program began with a focus on psychology students preparing for internships, but over the years it has expanded to include first-year doctoral students, providing them with early exposure to the knowledge and skills needed for military careers. This strategic evolution allows students to explore military behavioral health as a potential career path well before they begin advanced training.

To make the program more accessible, the Summer Institute was streamlined from five days to three. Along with this change, the curriculum shifted its focus from how to perform the job to what the job entails. By consolidating previously scattered information on military and civilian opportunities, the program gives participants a clearer picture of the field, helping them determine whether this unique career path aligns with their aspirations and talents.

And new this year, the Summer Institute expanded in 2024 to include a track for social workers. This expansion underscores CDP's commitment to a ""total force concept"" for career paths, encompassing not just active duty but also other uniformed services and civilian opportunities within the DoD and VA. This inclusion strives to help with the high demand for mental health services and the challenges for access to care that can arise within the Military Health System. Rogers emphasizes, ""there's a high demand and there's a real need and we need really good clinicians to help take care of our service members and veterans and family members in all of our communities.""

Distinguished Speakers and Diverse Perspectives

This year's three-day program includes both a psychology and social work track. Both tracks share a foundational curriculum, beginning with a welcome and overview by Rogers. Afterwards, guests attend a distinguished session on the importance of military mental health with retired Lt. Gen. Raymond “Scott” Dingle, the U.S. Army’s 45th Surgeon General, and retired Command Sergeant Major Diamond D. Hough, the 20th Command Sergeant Major of the Army Medical Command.

Participants in both tracks will gain an in-depth understanding of military culture through sessions tailored to their fields. Psychology students will learn from Dr. Debra Nofziger, a former active-duty Army psychologist, while social work students will hear from Dr. Katrice Byrd and Ms. Allison Hannah, both military behavioral health social workers with the CDP. Additional presenters — ranging from early-career professionals sharing insights on first assignments to seasoned experts discussing long-term career growth and broader industry trends — round out the program. While both tracks feature recruiter presentations and training directors’ panels, students will also join together for collaborative activities, then break into discipline-specific sessions for more focused learning.

Beyond Seminars: Offering Mentorship and Resources

The Summer Institute goes beyond simply offering an overview — it provides concrete, practical guidance for building a career in military behavioral health. Students gain insider perspectives on the application process, including how to navigate the complexities of recruiting and the Medical Examination Processing Station (MEPS). The CDP also equips participants with long-term career tools and strategies. Suggestions include tailoring class projects toward military psychology topics and seeking clinical training experiences that align with military needs. As Rogers explains, the program is designed to be “a platform for people to learn,” filling a gap in education where few programs offer in-depth insight into this specialized career path.

Proven Impact and Future Vision

The program’s impact is clear in its consistently high satisfaction ratings and the large proportion of alumni who go on to military internships or related roles. Since its launch 10 years ago, more than 548 students from over 130 doctoral programs in 34 states, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico have taken part in the Summer Institute. This year alone, 56 participants completed the program.

Looking ahead, the initiative will expand into three distinct events: the Summer Institute, focused on active-duty careers; a fall event highlighting other uniformed career paths such as the Public Health Service or Coast Guard; and a winter institute dedicated to civilian opportunities within the DoD and VA. To broaden reach, the fall and winter programs will be held virtually, making them accessible to an even wider pool of future professionals.

""I'm always excited to work with students,"" Rogers shares, ""always excited to help them to realize that working with our military population can be extremely rewarding"". He concludes, ""there are real problems that need real solutions and we need people who are well trained to meet that moment"". The Summer Institute is a crucial stepping stone for those ready to meet that moment.",,N,1.0,2026-01-01 11:56:33.964606

Dr. William Kelly isn’t your typical military physician—he’s a game-changer in military medical education. From leading medical students through rotations at military medical centers across the country to pioneering educational innovation, Kelly is transforming the way future military doctors learn. His drive for growth led him to earn a Master’s in Health Professions Education (HPE) from the Uniformed Services University (USU), where he enhanced his teaching strategies and integrated interactive learning techniques, including gamification. His mission? To equip students with the tools they need to become confident, self-sufficient leaders in military medicine.

Kelly, a professor of Medicine and clerkship director at USU’s F. Edward Hebert School of Medicine, also serves as a pulmonary physician at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Whether in the classroom or at the bedside, his leadership helps shape the next generation of military physicians, ensuring they receive the education, training, and experience necessary for success.

“I’ve been fortunate to learn from exceptional mentors and students,” Kelly says. “The HPE program appealed to me as a way to solidify my teaching methods, delve deeper into leadership and educational theories, and refine my research practices,” he adds.

Dr. Steven Durning, HPE department chair and director of the Center for Health Professions Education (CHPE) at USU, explains that CHPE offers certificate and degree programs for active-duty and civilian health professionals at U.S. military treatment facilities. These programs enhance academic leadership, educational research, and teaching skills through primarily online asynchronous learning, designed for busy healthcare professionals. To date, more than 450 learners have graduated, with over 300 currently enrolled.

Kelly’s research focuses on assessment, test-taking skills, and interactive learning. He recognizes that even brilliant clinicians can struggle with standardized test formats. Through self-regulated learning analysis and coaching, the clerkship equips students with strategies to overcome these hurdles—skills that translate into broader professional success.

""We focus on growing independence,"" Kelly explains. ""Our goal is to help these future leaders and healers transition from the classroom to the demanding world of internship, regardless of their chosen specialty."" His approach involves close collaboration with clinical supervisors and continuous feedback to ensure student success.

Kelly sees his HPE knowledge directly influencing his work as a professor and clerkship director. ""These individuals face unique challenges,"" he acknowledges. ""The HPE program has equipped me with tools to address these challenges, particularly in areas like learner remediation."" He leverages self-regulated learning techniques to help students overcome hurdles and become independent learners.

Kelly’s vision for medical education goes beyond traditional methods. He is a proponent of gamification—integrating game mechanics into learning experiences. His enthusiasm was evident at last year’s Military Health System conference, where he delivered a compelling talk on the subject.

""Learning is serious business,"" Kelly asserts, ""but teaching modalities don't have to be."" He believes educational games can enhance engagement, teamwork, and knowledge retention through repetition and feedback. Kelly has designed and implemented interactive learning programs since 2001. In collaboration with other experts, he helped develop the CHEST Challenge program, initially aimed at pulmonary/critical care fellows in the U.S. and Canada. Today, it includes high-fidelity simulation, live actors, and rigorous assessment methods. Since 2012, Kelly has introduced innovative educational games, such as diagnostic ultrasound training, escape rooms, and live medical knowledge game shows at professional conferences.

For military healthcare professionals considering an HPE degree, Kelly’s advice is: “Go for it!” He emphasizes the program’s ability to refine leadership and teaching skills, while also recognizing the value of the credential. Despite the time commitment, he assures it is manageable alongside a busy clinical schedule.

""The program is incredibly flexible,"" Kelly assures, ""and the benefits far outweigh the investment, especially considering the financial advantage of pursuing it within the military framework.""

Durning says Kelly's dedication and hard work were evident throughout his time in the HPE master’s degree program. “Dr. Kelly flourished in the MHPE program, excelling in all facets and producing an important and timely paper in Academic Medicine entitled Assessment Tools for Patient Notes in Medical Education: A Scoping Review.”

Kelly’s journey is proof that great educators never stop learning. From the bedside to the classroom—and even the game board—he is redefining how military medical students engage with education. His passion for teaching, commitment to innovation, and drive to help students succeed make him a transformative force in military medical education. And with his HPE degree in hand, he is more prepared than ever to shape the next generation of confident, capable military physicians.",,N,0.0,2026-01-01 11:56:36.654092

Surgeons from the Uniformed Services University (USU) and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) have earned national recognition for their dedication to surgical excellence and outstanding patient outcomes. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP®) awarded WRNMMC the prestigious Meritorious Achievement Award for 2023, placing the joint team among an elite group of just 77 hospitals out of 609 eligible participants. WRNMMC received this recognition in November 2024.

Faculty from both the USU and Walter Reed comprise the surgical team. WRNMMC has participated in the NSQIP program for over 10 years, building a long-standing tradition of providing nationally recognized excellent surgical care.

The Meritorious Achievement Award is based on a rigorous evaluation of risk-adjusted data in the July 2024 ACS NSQIP Semiannual Report, which analyzed surgical outcomes across eight key clinical areas. The USU-Walter Reed surgical team’s performance placed them in the top 10% of participating hospitals nationwide, including both Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and private sector hospitals. They also received distinctions of ""exemplary"" in all-case morbidity, all-case urinary tract infection, and all-case surgical site infection. Participation in the ACS NSQIP program requires hospitals to track and analyze surgical outcomes for both inpatient and outpatient procedures, using a data-driven approach to identify areas for improvement and enhance patient safety initiatives. Dr. Eric Twerdahl, associate chair of Surgery for Quality and Outcomes at USU, explains that WRNMMC submits approximately 1,700 cases per year, which NSQIP then compares to the roughly 1 million cases it receives worldwide. Twerdahl describes it as a continuous benchmark of their performance, both amongst their peers in the Military Health System and internationally.

“Being able to compare our outcomes to other hospitals in the country is a tremendous value. And like in most MTFs, that’s where we shine,” he says, adding that at WRNMMC “you have a lower chance of having a complication after surgery than you do at about 90% of the hospitals in America.”

Despite recent infrastructure challenges, the data reflects what’s happening inside the hospital – the expertise, dedication, and resiliency of the USU-Walter Reed surgical team lead to exceptional results. Twerdahl emphasizes that “the credit goes to the individual surgeons, nurses, and surgical technicians,” underscoring that no matter the environment, “the resiliency of military surgeons is being able to get the job done effectively and safely.”",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,0.0,2025-12-31 23:12:16.369242

Opioid overdoses are a serious public health crisis, and the Uniformed Services University (USU), in collaboration with the Defense Health Agency (DHA) Research & Engineering Implementation Science Branch, is tackling this issue head-on with the Opioid Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution (OEND) Program. This initiative focuses on increasing access to naloxone, a life-saving antidote, and educating both providers and patients about its importance.

The Need for Naloxone Access and Education

While many recognize the dangers of opioids and their link to fatal overdoses, awareness of naloxone—an emergency medication that can rapidly reverse an opioid overdose—remains limited. Addressing the opioid crisis requires not only understanding the risks of opioid use but also ensuring widespread knowledge and availability of naloxone. Despite its life-saving potential, naloxone remains historically underprescribed.

One contributing factor is that some prescribers assume their patients are unlikely to misuse opioids. Others may hesitate due to the stigma surrounding naloxone use. However, the reality is that anyone prescribed opioids faces a risk of accidental overdose. Factors such as medication interactions, alcohol consumption, or a weakened immune system can all increase this risk. Since 2019, the OEND program has worked to de-stigmatize conversations about opioid use and expand access to naloxone, ensuring that more people are prepared to prevent overdose deaths.

Creating the OEND Program: A Collaborative Effort

The Defense and Veterans Center for Integrated Pain Management (DVCIPM) at USU, inspired by the Veterans Administration’s Opioid Education and Naloxone Distribution (OEND) program, partnered with the Defense Health Agency (DHA) to tailor the initiative for the Military Health System (MHS). Leading this effort are Dr. Kris Highland, associate professor of Anesthesiology at USU, and retired Army Col. Kevin Galloway, DVCIPM’s director for Strategic Communications and Policy. Galloway also highlights the pivotal contributions of retired Army Col. (Dr.) Chester Buckenmaier III, DVCIPM’s founding director, in shaping the MHS pain management infrastructure.

A key element of OEND is encouraging providers to “co-prescribe” naloxone alongside opioid painkillers for patients with elevated overdose risks, including those on long-term opioid therapy, high opioid doses, concurrent respiratory depressants (such as benzodiazepines), or with a history of behavioral health conditions. This sustained effort has led to an impressive 79.5% compliance rate for co-prescribing naloxone.

How Naloxone Saves Lives

Naloxone is a fast-acting medication that temporarily reverses opioid overdoses by restoring breathing. Administered via IV or nasal spray, it works by binding to opioid receptors, blocking the effects of opioids, and counteracting the respiratory depression that can be fatal. While naloxone can be used by anyone in an emergency, it is not a replacement for professional medical care. Its effects are temporary, and individuals who receive naloxone still require immediate medical attention to ensure their safety and prevent a recurrence of overdose symptoms.

OEND’s Three-Phase Approach

The OEND program is specifically tailored to the MHS to bridge the gap between policy and practice. Highland’s team discovered that despite existing DoD policies promoting naloxone distribution, prescribing rates remained stagnant. While these policies allowed both physicians and pharmacists to prescribe naloxone and outlined opioid safety and pain management guidelines, they lacked the necessary programming and tools to effectively disseminate this information, slowing meaningful change.

To address this, the program was structured into three phases. Phase One began with interviews of clinicians and pharmacists to assess training and resource needs. Collaborating with OEND champions at Madigan Army Medical Center, the team developed targeted tools and training to enhance access to patient prescription history, improve provider-patient discussions about naloxone, and reduce stigma surrounding its use. Training focused on locating opioid prescription history and overdose risk indicators in CarePoint, initiating informed conversations with patients, and addressing stigma among both healthcare providers and patients.

A post-training review of 47 participating clinicians and pharmacists revealed that most regularly worked with patients concerned about opioid risks, and roughly 40% had received direct naloxone information requests from patients or caregivers.

Following the training, prescribers reported increased confidence in normalizing conversations about naloxone and educating patients on its benefits. Open discussions about opioid safety are essential—covering medication storage, access, and disposal, as well as how conditions like sleep apnea and medications such as benzodiazepines can heighten the risk of opioid-induced respiratory depression. ""Patients sometimes forget they've taken their medication and accidentally double-dose,"" Highland explains. ""Or they take their medication as prescribed, have a couple of drinks, and don't realize they've increased their risk of respiratory depression. Many things can happen accidentally. Empowering patients with knowledge for informed health decisions is a key component of OEND,"" Highland emphasizes.

Reaching a Wider Audience

In collaboration with the DHA, the OEND Program launched a dedicated Health.mil page to provide comprehensive resources for patients, caregivers, providers, and trainers. This centralized hub offers opioid fact sheets, infographics, videos, and train-the-trainer handbooks—all in one accessible location. Designed to support prescribers, pharmacists, and OEND champions, the site ensures that critical information is readily available to those who need it. A complementary social media campaign further amplifies the program’s reach, reinforcing the importance of naloxone education and accessibility. As Galloway emphasizes, “What if you had a fire extinguisher but didn’t know what it does?”

An Ongoing Effort

The OEND program remains committed to continuous improvement, ensuring providers have the tools and knowledge to engage patients effectively. “The teaching is different now,” Galloway explains. “We’re no longer just telling medical students to ‘treat the pain, treat the pain.’” While recent data suggests a decline in overdose deaths, Galloway attributes this to a combination of factors, including expanded naloxone access, harm reduction efforts, and greater awareness. He underscores that DVCIPM is not anti-opioid—these medications can be invaluable when prescribed and used responsibly. “The culture [around opioid prescribing] is still in the process of changing, and we’re better than we were, but not quite as good as we need to be,” he says.

Looking ahead, Highland highlights the program’s vision for a “triple risk-reduction kit”—a comprehensive emergency care package combining defibrillators, Stop the Bleed supplies, and naloxone. “We can’t predict where someone will have an overdose event, we can’t predict where there will be a mass casualty event such as a mass shooting, and we can’t predict when and where someone will have a cardiovascular incident that requires a defibrillator,” Highland notes. “So if you were to put those three together, and create awareness around that and create training information on how to use each part of the triple kit, then that would be the new emergency care kit that would be available to people.”",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,0.0,2025-12-31 23:12:06.389513

Beneficiaries in all counties and boroughs are now eligible to receive emergency prescription refills through Jan. 5, 2026.
To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy.
To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator at: https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/find-pharmacy.
The Defense Health Agency provides health services to 9.5 million beneficiaries, including uniformed service members, military retirees, and their families.","FALLS CHURCH, Virginia – The Defense Health Agency announced that temporary prescription refill waivers have been expanded and extended for TRICARE beneficiaries in New York due to a winter storm.

Beneficiaries in all counties and boroughs are now eligible to receive emergency prescription refills through Jan. 5, 2026.

The original counties affected were Albany, Broome, Cayuga, Chenango, Columbia, Cortland, Delaware, Dutchess, Fulton, Greene, Herkimer, Madison, Montgomery, Nassau, Oneida, Onondaga, Orange, Oswego, Otsego, Putnam, Rockland, Saratoga, Schenectady, Schoharie, Sullivan, Suffolk, Rensselaer, Ulster, Wayne, and Westchester, as well as the boroughs of The Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island.

For beneficiaries in Essex County, the date has been extended from Dec. 30, 2025, to Jan. 5, 2026.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator at: https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/find-pharmacy.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates at: https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/notices/weather.

The Defense Health Agency provides health services to 9.5 million beneficiaries, including uniformed service members, military retirees, and their families. The DHA operates one of the nation’s largest health plans, the TRICARE Health Plan, and manages a global network of more than 700 military hospitals, clinics, and dental facilities.

With the TRICARE pharmacy contractor: Update your address with Express Scripts if you use the TRICARE Pharmacy Program.
Moving within or to the U.S. or U.S. territories Medicare provides coverage in the U.S. and U.S. territories, as described in the TRICARE For Life Handbook.","Are you planning to move soon? Whether you’re moving across town or overseas, TRICARE For Life moves with you.

“TFL provides Medicare-wraparound coverage for TRICARE beneficiaries who have Medicare Part A and Part B, regardless of their age or where they live,” said Anne Breslin, TRICARE For Life Program Manager at the Defense Health Agency. “In the U.S. and U.S. territories, Medicare and TRICARE work together to minimize your out-of-pocket costs. If you get care overseas, TRICARE For Life becomes your primary coverage, unless you have other health insurance.”

When you move, you’ll need to update your address. You’ll also need to explore your options for getting care and filling prescriptions.

Updating your address

After you move, you need to update your address in a few places.

In the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System: Learn how to update your address in DEERS. You should also confirm that the rest of your DEERS record is correct.

With the Social Security Administration: Social Security maintains beneficiary records on behalf of Medicare. To update your address with Medicare, log in to your my Social Security account or call Social Security at 800-772-1213 (TTY: 800-325-0778).

With the TRICARE pharmacy contractor: Update your address with Express Scripts if you use the TRICARE Pharmacy Program. You can do this by logging in to your Express Scripts account or calling Express Scripts.

Moving within or to the U.S. or U.S. territories

Medicare provides coverage in the U.S. and U.S. territories, as described in the TRICARE For Life Handbook.

If you have TFL and use Original Medicare (Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B), you can get care from Medicare participating and Medicare nonparticipating providers. You can find and compare Medicare providers in your new location.

You can also see providers who’ve opted out of Medicare. But keep in mind that Medicare doesn’t pay for services you get from opt-out providers. Learn more about getting care from Medicare providers and opt-out providers.

Are you enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan? If you move out of its service area, you’re eligible for a Medicare Special Enrollment Period. This means you’re eligible to enroll in a new Medicare Advantage Plan (Medicare Part C) and Medicare drug plan (Medicare Part D) or switch to Original Medicare. Learn more about Special Enrollment Periods.

If you have questions about Medicare, contact Medicare. In the U.S. and U.S. territories, WPS Government Services administers the TFL benefit. Contact WPS if you have questions about TFL.

Moving overseas

If you move overseas and you have Medicare Part A, you must also have Medicare Part B to remain eligible for TFL. Even though Medicare doesn’t provide coverage outside the U.S. and U.S. territories, you must continue to pay Medicare Part B premiums.

If you have TFL:

TRICARE is the primary payer for TRICARE-covered services and supplies, unless you have other health insurance.

You can get TRICARE-covered services and supplies from any TRICARE-authorized provider. (In the Philippines, you must get care from a Preferred Provider Network provider or a certified provider.)

If you get covered services from a network provider, your out-of-pocket costs will generally be lower than if you see a non-network provider. Search the overseas provider directory to find a network provider.

You’ll pay TRICARE cost-shares after you meet your TRICARE annual deductible.

You may need pre-authorization for some services.

International SOS is the TRICARE overseas contractor. Contact International SOS for help with finding providers, getting authorizations, filing claims, and more.

TRICARE Plus

Have you moved close to a military hospital or clinic? You may be able to enroll in TRICARE Plus. TRICARE Plus is a health care program offered at some military hospitals and clinics. Contact your local military hospital or clinic to see if they offer the program.

Note: You can’t enroll in TRICARE Plus if you’re enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan health maintenance organization option.

Filling prescriptions

You may have different pharmacy options depending on where you move:

Military pharmacies are located throughout the U.S. You can also find them in some U.S. territories and some locations overseas. Find a military pharmacy near you.

TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery will ship to any address in the U.S. or U.S. territories. This includes APO, FPO, and DPO addresses. There are different rules for using home delivery in other overseas locations.

TRICARE retail network pharmacies are located throughout the U.S. You can also find them in most U.S. territories. Find a network pharmacy near you.

At non-network pharmacies, you’ll have to pay full price for your prescription drugs. Then you can file a claim for reimbursement. Overseas, a non-network pharmacy might be your only pharmacy option. In the Philippines, you must fill prescriptions at a certified pharmacy. Learn more about filling prescriptions overseas.

Your family members

When you have TFL, moving isn’t a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event for you. But moving is a QLE for family members who are enrolled in or eligible for TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select. Your family members should also update their address in DEERS after they move. They’ll have 90 days from the date of the address change to change their TRICARE health plan.

Check out “Your TRICARE Checklist for Moving” for more information and tips for what to do when you and your family move.

Learn more about TFL

Are you new to TFL? The information in the TRICARE For Life Handbook will help you make the most of your TFL coverage. You’ll learn about eligibility requirements, how Medicare and TFL work together, getting care, claims, and more.

Are you turning 65 soon? Check out the TRICARE and Medicare Turning Age 65 Brochure. You’ll learn important information on when to sign up for Medicare to avoid a break in your TRICARE coverage.",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Dec/31/2003849951/1920/1080/0/251231-O-D0202-1001.JPG,N,0.0,2025-12-31 13:11:46.462682
