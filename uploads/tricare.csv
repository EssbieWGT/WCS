Transition to a Payor-focused model and expansions of networks like Medicare and TRICARE promise revenue growth and improved profitability through a stable customer base.

AI-driven technologies and operational efficiencies enhance member engagement and reduce costs, leading to improved net margins and increased earnings.

Focus on Payor models and tech investments poses profitability and growth risks amid declining consumer revenue and marketing challenges.

Catalysts

About Talkspace

Operates as a virtual behavioral healthcare company that connects patients with licensed mental health providers in the United States.

What are the underlying business or industry changes driving this perspective?

Expansion to Medicare and TRICARE networks will unlock coverage for significant new populations, potentially increasing revenue due to a broader customer base.

The shift from a consumer subscription model to a Payor-focused approach has increased coverage to 179 million people, which is likely to enhance revenue growth and improve net margins due to a more predictable and scale-efficient business model.

The development and implementation of AI-driven technologies, such as Talkcast and other tools to improve the member journey, can enhance member engagement and retention, potentially boosting revenue and net margins by decreasing churn and increasing utilization rates.

Operational efficiencies, such as a decrease in operating expenses and an overall increase in the effectiveness of marketing spend, should improve net margins and earnings.

Strategic partnerships and marketing initiatives focused on covered life populations, like the military and Medicare recipients, are anticipated to enhance revenue growth and sustained profitability due to higher return on investment in these targeted marketing efforts.

Talkspace Future Earnings and Revenue Growth

Assumptions

How have these above catalysts been quantified?

Analysts are assuming Talkspace's revenue will grow by 21.4% annually over the next 3 years.

Analysts assume that profit margins will increase from 0.6% today to 11.4% in 3 years time.

Analysts expect earnings to reach $38.1 million (and earnings per share of $0.19) by about April 2028, up from $1.1 million today. The analysts are largely in agreement about this estimate.

In order for the above numbers to justify the analysts price target, the company would need to trade at a PE ratio of 25.8x on those 2028 earnings, down from 457.8x today. This future PE is greater than the current PE for the US Healthcare industry at 23.8x.

Analysts expect the number of shares outstanding to decline by 0.74% per year for the next 3 years.

To value all of this in today's terms, we will use a discount rate of 6.21%, as per the Simply Wall St company report.

Talkspace Future Earnings Per Share Growth

Risks

What could happen that would invalidate this narrative?

The shift towards a Payor-focused model and the resulting decline in gross margins may pose a risk to overall profitability, as the company navigates the trade-off between lower gross margins and the anticipated long-term benefits of improved unit economics.

Decreasing consumer revenue, as Talkspace focuses on Payor and DTE models, could negatively impact top-line growth if Payor-based strategies do not expand as projected, affecting revenue growth and market penetration.

Challenges in marketing strategies, particularly reaching new segments like Medicare and military populations, could lead to inefficient spend and slower user acquisition, impacting revenue growth.

Potential pricing pressures in negotiations with Payors, if they were to arise, could influence revenue levels negatively, despite current stable pricing conditions.

Heavy reliance on technologies to improve member retention and engagement may not yield expected results, which could adversely affect earnings by not generating sufficient return on investment in technological enhancements.

Valuation

How have all the factors above been brought together to estimate a fair value?

The analysts have a consensus price target of $5.0 for Talkspace based on their expectations of its future earnings growth, profit margins and other risk factors.

In order for you to agree with the analyst's consensus, you'd need to believe that by 2028, revenues will be $335.8 million, earnings will come to $38.1 million, and it would be trading on a PE ratio of 25.8x, assuming you use a discount rate of 6.2%.

Given the current share price of $3.12, the analyst price target of $5.0 is 37.6% higher.

We always encourage you to reach your own conclusions though. So sense check these analyst numbers against your own assumptions and expectations based on your understanding of the business and what you believe is probable.

,,2025-04-26 13:49:58+00:00,BioMed Central,Analysis of rare events in healthcare intervention using department of defense data,Not Available,,,,,https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-025-02559-5,"One real-life example is working with data on a rare disease such as bullous pemphigoid (BP), a rare skin condition.
Thus, \(\:{\pi\:}_{i}(1-{{\uppi\:}}_{\text{i}})\) will be larger for 1’s than 0’s, stating that 1’s are more informative than 0’s in rare events.
Since rare events have small sample sizes (usually < 200 observations), the logit models will yield a suboptimal result [7].
Table 2 shows the coefficients from standard logistic regression, prior correction regression, weighting regression, and reduced non-event sample regression.
These methods, based mostly on large-sample normal approximation (particularly inverse-variance) [31,32,33], lack power to investigate the incidence of rare events.","In outcomes research data, we deal with rare cases frequently. Currently, about 7,000 rare diseases have been identified, with an estimated 300 million people affected globally [1]. Rare diseases, although individually unique, collectively represent substantial unmet health and social care needs and a significant public health challenge to society as a whole [1]. Definitions of rare diseases vary: [1] under the U.S. Orphan Drug Act, a rare disease is defined as a disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals [2], whereas it is defined as a condition that affects fewer than 5 people per 10,000 population in Europe [1].

It is estimated that 95% of rare diseases have no approved treatment [1, 3, 4]. The treatments for the remaining 5% are frequently expensive and relatively unknown. In addition to the high research and development costs associated with largely limited treatment options, the rather small market for rare diseases is conducive to prohibitive pricing. Rare diseases present a challenge for clinicians in reaching a conclusive diagnosis and determining an appropriate course of treatment due to their low prevalence, heterogenicity, and complexity [1, 5, 6]. Thus, it can be challenging to predict and estimate rare-disease outcomes in a real-world setting.

A rare event is defined as a binary dependent variable characterized by dozens to thousands of times fewer 1’s (i.e., rare diseases, treatments, newly approved medications) than 0’s (“nonevents”) [7]. There are two main reasons for the difficulty in estimating rare events.

First, standard logistic regression can sharply underestimate the probability of events. Therefore, the estimates would be biased. One real-life example is working with data on a rare disease such as bullous pemphigoid (BP), a rare skin condition. It is estimated that BP affects fewer than 50,000 people in the U.S., primarily older people [8]. The most common treatment is prednisone, but long-term use increases the risk of weak bones, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and infection. As an alternative, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is effective, although optimal use of IVIg is yet to be determined. Most adverse effects of IVIg infusions are transient, infusion-related symptoms that do not have long-term sequelae, although serious adverse events such as thrombosis, renal dysfunction, and acute renal failure have been noted [9]. Additional concerns about IVIg treatment include its potential toxicity and cost. While a single infusion starts at $5,000 to $10,000, treatment usually requires repeated cycles for which insurance coverage is not always covered. Therefore, it is essential to know the probability of using IVIg treatment for a rare disease.

To study the usage pattern of IVIg therapy in BP, we can formulate the model as follows: Let the outcome variable (e.g., whether the patient had IVIg therapy) be \(\:{y}_{i}\) and follow a Bernoulli probability function that takes on the value 1 with probability \(\:{\pi\:}_{i}\). Let \(\:{x}_{i}\) be the vector of explanatory variables such as age, comorbid conditions, gender, or insurance type. Then it can be shown that the variance matrix takes the following form:

$$\:V\left(\widehat{\beta\:}\right)={\left[{\sum\:}_{\text{i}=1}^{\text{n}}{{\uppi\:}}_{\text{i}}\left(1-{{\uppi\:}}_{1}\right){\text{x}}_{\text{i}}{x}_{i}^{{\prime\:}}\right]}^{-1}$$

Rare events have small estimates for \(\:{{\uppi\:}}_{i}\) observations. Standard logit models that use approximation rather than actual values will usually have larger values for \(\:{\pi\:}_{i}\). Thus, \(\:{\pi\:}_{i}(1-{{\uppi\:}}_{\text{i}})\) will be larger for 1’s than 0’s, stating that 1’s are more informative than 0’s in rare events. Since rare events have small sample sizes (usually < 200 observations), the logit models will yield a suboptimal result [7]. Therefore, logit models need to be adjusted to control this effect.

The second problem is related to how the data are collected. There is a fear among analysts that collecting data sets with no events (and thus with no variation on outcome measures) has led researchers to choose very large data sets with few, and often poorly measured, explanatory variables. For example, to avoid rare events, a researcher could include a broader sample by including a wide variety of International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes, a Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) Level II alphanumeric code issued by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (J-Codes), or Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes rather than specific codes. This technique will cloud the estimates, making it challenging to see the true effect of treatment on an actual targeted sample.

The twofold problem outlined above arises when predicting health outcomes of rare diseases, rare treatments, or small numbers of recently approved medications. The objective of this study is to apply correction methods used in other rare event studies such as major stock market crashes to solve the aforementioned issues in performing research on rare diseases.

For this retrospective cross-sectional study, we extracted de-identified patient data for fiscal years (FYs) 2019 to 2022 from the Department of Defense TRICARE data. Each FY (October 1–September 30) is based on the U.S. federal budget calendar. The data from Military Health Services (MHS) has been recognized as a model of equitable healthcare access across socioeconomic and racial groups. The U.S. MHS is a global healthcare network with a diverse population that is more representative of the U.S. population than other data sets, with fewer disparities in healthcare services. The system serves 9.6 million beneficiaries, including active-duty service members, retirees, and family members, on an annual budget of $53 billion. The MHS delivers care through a direct-care/health maintenance organization system for Department of Defense military treatment facilities and a purchased-care/preferred provider organization system for civilian facilities. In addition, the MHS provides universal coverage for its beneficiaries under its TRICARE program. The data do not capture healthcare delivery in combat zones or care received in the Veterans Administrative system. All individuals were in the TRICARE Prime® managed care option.

Patients with BP were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes (L12.0). Our outcome variable was the use of IVIg therapy and identified by J codes (J1459, J1554, J1556, J1557, J1561, J1566, J1568, J1569, J1572, J1599). The inclusion criteria used were adults (≥ 18 years), diagnosed with BP and treated with or without IVIg. IVIg date was the index date; the index date for the non-event cohort was randomly assigned between the earliest IVIg date and latest IVIg date.

Patient age, gender, and comorbidities were available in the data sets. We identified the top 10 comorbidities associated with BP. Hypertension emerged as one of the most prevalent comorbidities in patients with BP, with studies reporting its occurrence in up to 76% of cases [10]. The association between hypertension and BP is hypothesized to stem from shared inflammatory pathways or medication effects. Esophageal involvement is another frequent complication in BP cases, potentially manifesting as reflux symptoms or, in some instances, esophagitis dissecans superficialis [11]. Dermatological comorbidities are also common in patients with BP. Research has demonstrated an increased risk of BP in patients with pre-existing dermatitis, and BP may initially present with eczematous or urticarial lesions before the characteristic blistering occurs [12]. Rash, a primary symptom of BP itself, often manifests as urticarial plaques preceding blister formation [13]. Urinary tract involvement is another significant comorbidity in patients with BP. One study reported characteristic lower urinary tract lesions in 93% of BP cases [14]. The increased prevalence of urinary tract infections in patients with BP is attributed to advanced age and the use of immunosuppressive treatments [14]. Neurological comorbidities are frequently observed in patients with BP, often manifesting as limb pain. Multiple sclerosis (MS) has been found to have a significant association with BP, with one study reporting an odds ratio of 5.36 for neurological diseases, including MS, in patients with BP [15]. Cardiovascular comorbidities are also prevalent in patients with BP, with dyspnea being a common related symptom [16]. Additionally, several studies have reported an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma in patients with BP [17]. A flag was created for patients who had at least three of the following comorbidities: hypertension, hyperlipidemia, esophagitis reflux, dermatitis, urinary tract infection, limp pain, rash, skin cancer, dyspnea, and MS prior to treatment to proxy for severity.

For descriptive analysis, we compared the patients with and without IVIg therapy. Numbers and percentages were provided for dichotomous and polychotomous variables. Means and standard deviations were provided for continuous variables. For dichotomous and polychotomous variables, P values were calculated according to the chi-square test, and for continuous variables, t-tests were used to calculate P values. Nonparametric tests (e.g., the Mann-Whitney U test, log-rank test, or McNemar test) were applied if there was a deviation from asymptotical assumptions.

Since it is well documented that logit coefficients are biased in small samples, we proposed a correction method to solve the possible “rare event” bias in log estimation. Consider a logit model for outcome variable y and set of k explanatory variables x:

$$\:\left[P\right(y=1\left|x\right)=\:G({{\upbeta\:}}_{0}+{{\upbeta\:}}_{1}{x}_{1}+\dots\:+{{\upbeta\:}}_{k}{x}_{k})],$$

where G is the logistic function:

$$\:G\left(z\right)=\:exp\left(z\right)/\left[1+exp\left(z\right)\right],$$

which is between 0 and 1 for all real numbers z.

To apply the first correction method, we obtained information about the fraction of 1’s in the population \(\:{\uprho\:},\) and then the observed fraction of ones in the sample \(\:\stackrel{-}{y}\). Then the adjusted coefficient in the logit model is

$$\:\widehat{{{\upbeta\:}}_{0}}-ln\:\left[\left(\frac{1-\rho\:}{\rho\:}\right)\left(\frac{\stackrel{-}{y}}{1-\stackrel{-}{y}}\right)\right].$$

Note that prior correction affects only constant terms (therefore, not the odds ratio), but since most of the time interest lies in estimated probabilities:

it is necessary to estimate a rare-event bias-adjusted constant term, with the first correction technique, called prior correction.

For the second correction technique, we used weights determined by the proportion of 1’s and 0’s in the sample to equal the true proportion in the population, letting \(\:{w}_{1}=\frac{\rho\:}{\stackrel{-}{y}}\) and \(\:{w}_{o}=\frac{1-\rho\:}{1-\stackrel{-}{y}}\) be the dependent variable and weighting independent variables by \(\:{w}_{1}\) if \(\:{y}_{i}=1\:\)and \(\:{w}_{o}\) if \(\:{y}_{i}=0.\) Then, we ran a standard logistic regression of weighted dependent and independent variables. In other words, the second correction technique aims to address the issue of imbalanced data in logistic regression by applying weights to both the dependent and independent variables. The rationale for this technique is to adjust the influence of each observation in the model to reflect the true events (1’s) and nonevents (0’s) in the population. By doing so, it attempts to correct for the bias introduced by imbalanced samples, where one class may be overrepresented or underrepresented compared with the true population. For example, if age=75 and w=1, the age variable would remain 75, but the observation would be a given weight of 1.5 in the model fitting process. This means that this observation would have 1.5 times the influence on the model parameters compared with an observation with a weight of 1. To solve commonly used data collection biases under rare-event data, King and Zeng have proposed collecting all (or all available) 1’s and a small random sample of 0’s to avoid losing consistency or even much efficiency relative to the full sample [7]. Wang et al. have also proposed an adjusted logistic propensity weighting method, a more advanced version of this approach [18]. Both methods were validated under different scenarios (e.g., varying sample sizes, different event rates) using Monte Carlo simulation techniques, as described in previous research [7].

For the second part of the analysis, we tested differences in predicted probabilities. We proposed nonparametric tests since these tests are most appropriate when the sample sizes are small. The Mann-Whitney U test and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test were used on predicted probabilities of logit regressions to see whether differences exist. To assess the independence of our predictor variables in the regression model, we employed two established methods: variance inflation factor analysis and examination of pairwise correlations.

The analysis used SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.) and STATA 17 (STATA Corp., LLC).

We identified 2,720 unique individuals diagnosed with BP in FY 2019–2022. Among these patients diagnosed with BP, 14 were treated with IVIg. The remaining sample was a non-event cohort (n = 2,706). Overall, 54.19% of individuals were women, and 85% of our sample was 65 years or older (mean, 78 years). We identified the most frequent 10 comorbidities from our sample. According to Table 1, the most frequent comorbidity prior to treatment with IVIg was hypertension (61.32%), followed by hyperlipidemia (37.20%), pemphigoid (34.70%), pain limp (24.15%), dyspnea (23.82%), dermatitis (23.49%), skin cancer (22.31%), urinary tract infection (20.25%), esophageal reflux (19.44%), and rash (16.43%). Within this sample, 54.08% of patients had more than three comorbidities within one year prior to treatment.

Patients with BP receiving IVIg therapy were younger (65.07 vs. 75.85, P =.0016) and more likely to be female (13 vs. 1, P =.0036). Overall, patients with IVIg treatment had significantly more comorbidities than patients without IVIg therapy. (78.57% vs. 53.95%, P =.0653). Patients receiving IVIg therapy also had a significantly higher likelihood of esophageal reflux (42.85% vs. 19.44%, P =.0265), dermatitis (57.14% vs. 23.49%, P =.0029), urinary tract infection (50.00% vs. 20.25%), P =.0055), and rash (42.85% vs., 16.43%, P =.0075).

Table 2 shows the coefficients from standard logistic regression, prior correction regression, weighting regression, and reduced non-event sample regression.

The correction rate for the prior correction technique assumes that the IVIg rate for BP is 0.00538918 (\(\:\rho\:)\). This rate is obtained from an open-claims database that covers 330 million patients in the United States. When comparing unadjusted rates for IVIg treatment, our rates were lower (0.00515). There was agreement on the sign of the coefficients across regressions. Older age, male self-identification, and fewer comorbidities decreased the likelihood of BP being treated with IVIg. Coefficients from weighting and prior correction logistic regression were statistically similar, but both were statistically different from and standard logistic regression (P =.0001). The coefficients from the regression that used the reduced random sample of non-events were also different from standard logistic regression (P =.004) (Table 2).

We randomly selected 140 patients from 2,706 non-event patients, so the total regression sample was 154, with 10% of the sample in the IVIg cohort (i.e., the rare-event proportion increased from 0.5% to 10%). The reduced random sample increased the event proportion in the regression sample. We calculated event probabilities for each group of patients with respect to age, gender, and comorbidities (Table 3). As expected, standard logistic regression significantly underestimated the event probabilities. The underestimation ranged from 11% to 102% using the prior correction method and from 15% to 107% using the weighting correction method. For example, standard logistic regression predicted that male patients 18 to 64 years old with few comorbidities have a 0.1% probability of receiving IVIg treatment; however, the actual probability was double according to prior correction and weighting correction. Random selection of non-event samples significantly biased the results and found probabilities 10 times larger than corrected probabilities and 20 times larger than probabilities calculated by standard logistic regression.

Rare-event correction affected the constant term the most. Table 3 shows the constant term for each model with its lower and upper confidence intervals.

The development of rare-event sampling techniques can be traced back to the early 1950s, primarily motivated by the need to solve complex problems in nuclear physics, particularly the neuron shielding problem that was crucial for designing nuclear facilities [19]. Later, researchers addressed the challenge of extremely rare events using Monte Carlo random sampling [20]. The importance of sampling methods, another key technique in rare-event simulation, also emerged during this period, setting the stage for the evolution of rare-event sampling techniques that continue to be refined and applied in various fields today [21]. For example, in physics, the search for dark matter involves detecting extremely rare particle interaction [22]. In earth sciences, methods were developed to analyze extremely rare natural disasters with occurrence rates of 1% or less [23]. In the telecommunication sector, researchers have focused on detecting and analyzing rare network anomalies [24]. In political science, case study approaches are used to analyze rare events like successful coups or the peaceful dissolution of countries [7, 25]. In economics, agent-based modeling used to simulate complex financial systems and identify conditions that may lead to rare market crashes [26]. In health care, researchers are used genomic sequencing techniques to identify genetic markers associated with rare disorders or Bayesian hierarchal models applied to analyze small sample sizes typical in rare diseases [27, 28]. Here, we applied a logistic regression technique for rare event rates among large sample sizes.

Due to the structured data entry system used by TRICARE, the data set used in this study had minimal missing data. Across all variables included in the analysis, less than 1% of data points were missing. This extremely low rate of missingness did not warrant the use of advanced imputation techniques or separate complete case analyses. The completeness of the TRICARE data contributes to the robustness of the findings and minimizes potential bias from missing information.

While the traditional rule of thumb for logistic regression suggests 10 to 20 events per variable are necessary, recent research has shown that this guideline can be relaxed under certain circumstances [29]. When dealing with rare events, total sample size becomes more critical than the number of events alone. The large sample size of 2,720 provides substantial information even with only 14 events. The empirical example provided here illustrates why specialized techniques for rare events logistic regression were developed. Several correction techniques were applied to a rare treatment for BP using a military health data set. As expected, the results yielded that standard logistic regression significantly underestimated the event probabilities. The underestimation in this study ranged from 11% to 102% using the prior correction method and from 15% to 106% using the weighting correction method. For example, in this study, standard logistics regression predicted that male patients 18 to 64 years old, with fewer comorbidities, have a 0.1% probability of receiving IVIg treatment; however, the actual probability was more than double according to prior correction and weighting correction. This discrepancy could give rise to a large margin of error and, ultimately, cost-ineffective decisions.

Furthermore, this study showed that the random selection of non-event samples significantly biased the results. The probabilities were found to be 10 times larger than the corrected probabilities and 20 times larger than the probabilities calculated by standard logistic regression. These results support King and Zeng’s findings, which indicated that a second, more important common problem in analyzing rare events lies in how data are collected [7]. The reduced sample size in this study demonstrated the most bias, supporting the idea that data collection can greatly influence results.

Other techniques such as meta-analysis have been suggested for rare event bias correction. However, meta-analyses of binary data can be problematic when the proportion of events is low [30, 31]. Meta-analyses of binary data are frequently performed using the standard inverse-variance fixed-effects model, based on large-sample normal approximation, or fixed-effects methods, based on exact distributional theory such as the Mantel–Haenszel (MH) or Peto model, or the standard random-effects DerSimonian-Laird (DL) model [31]. These methods, based mostly on large-sample normal approximation (particularly inverse-variance) [31,32,33], lack power to investigate the incidence of rare events. Therefore, their statistical properties for estimating treatment effects are often judged as suboptimal either through biased results, inappropriately wide confidence intervals, or insignificant statistical power to detect true differences.

The Cochrane guidelines (version 6.1, 2020) recommend the use of methods mostly accessible in Review Manager (RevMan), a free-access software developed by the Nordic Cochrane Centre [31, 33]. Its guideline suggests that, at event rates less than 1%, the Peto odds ratio should be utilized [31]. In circumstances where event rates are above 1% and meta-analyses involves many studies with imbalanced treatment groups, the MH odds ratio should be used [31, 34]. However, some of these methods, notably, the MH without continuity correction, logistic regression, and exact methods, are not available in RevMan. Second, meta-analysts must often revert from inverse-variance weighting to a random-effects DL model to reduce bias in estimation when heterogeneity is present.

Most recently, new methods, including maximum likelihood, profile likelihood, and restricted maximum likelihood or the nonparametric “permutations” methods, have been proposed for improved estimation of variance (τ) [31, 35, 36]. The nonparametric bootstrap of the DL estimator was shown to be a better performer in small meta-analyses that were falsely assumed to be homogenous under the standard DL model [31]. Although this nonparametric bootstrap of the DL model has now been extended for both the MH and Peto models, little is known about the performances of these methods in meta-analyses involving rare events when heterogeneity is an issue.

Limitations

This study utilizes data from the Department of Defense TRICARE system, which primarily serves military personnel, veterans, and their families. We acknowledge that this population may have unique characteristics that could affect the generalizability of the findings to the broader U.S. population [37]. TRICARE beneficiaries may have different healthcare access patterns, comorbidity profiles, and treatment preferences compared to civilians [38]. For instance, active-duty personnel might have better overall health due to physical fitness requirements, while veterans may have higher rates of certain conditions related to military service [39]. Additionally, TRICARE’s structured healthcare system and coverage policies may influence treatment choices and outcomes in ways that differ from other insurance plans [39].

This study also has several limitations related to the use of administrative data sets and retrospective analysis. Although retrospective studies are an important tool to study rare diseases, manifestations, and outcomes, their design is subject to limitations [40]. Since the analysis was done on the review of claims data that were not originally designed for research, some information is bound to be missing. Selection, recall, and loss of follow-up biases may affect how representative the data is for the rare event of interest.

Using an administrative database has many strengths as it includes a large population/base sample size, which provides an established denominator [41]. The data include patient demographics, clinical characteristics, detailed healthcare use, and cost information allowing for identification and comparison of treatments and outcomes across populations included in the data [41]. However, some limitations warrant mentioning. First, as with most claims-based data sources, there is a time lag between an individual’s receipt of services and when the files become available for research (average, 2–3 years) [41]. Thus, the data may not be generalizable to the entire population, as some information may be missed in processing or reimbursement. Also, not all health data are captured in the claims. Although diagnoses are included, information such as health-related behaviors, anthropomorphic data, and nonprescription medication use that may be found in medical records are not captured in the claims. Further, claims for which services were recommended but not yet received would not be captured in the data set. Additionally, administrative claims data lack information about the decision-making process (e.g., who made the decisions, how or why the decisions were made, the correlation between planned and received treatment, why treatment was altered or discontinued) and other patient-reported outcomes [41].

We recognize the potential for overfitting in our model given the limited number of rare-event cases (14 IVIg patients). To address this concern, we have included confidence around regression (see Table 2). Additionally, we acknowledge that the small sample size may limit the generalizability of our results. In future analyses, one can plan to explore regularization techniques such as ridge or LASSO regression to mitigate overfitting and improve model performance. These methods can help reduce model complexity and potentially enhance the robustness of our predictions, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data or limited sample sizes.",https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/cover-hires/journal/12874,N,0.0,2025-04-26 09:56:44.393094

I submit that Tricare is better because it covers the veteran. CHAMPVA is the finest healthcare that the VA offers, and it’s particularly exceptional as a co-insurance, but it doesn’t cover the veteran unless both spouses are rated P&T.

ChampVa out of pocket max is 3k for the year. If you qualify for tricare you can not have ChampVa.

Use Tricare, the VA is a joke. The VA employees on here will disagree. As someone who has used both, If I could talk to myself before separating I would not have wasted my time with the VA. Just being honest.

Husband and I have Tricare Select and we love it. It's a PPO plan which means you go anywhere you want and do not need a referral.

It’s a day to safely dispose of unwanted, expired, or excess medications. But it’s also important to know that military pharmacies offer ways to safely dispose of drugs all year long through the Military Health System Drug Take Back program.

“National Drug Take Back Day promotes a healthier community by helping to prevent accidental misuse of expired or unused drugs,” said U.S. Army Maj. Danielle Zsido, Direct Care Branch Deputy Chief, Pharmacy Operations Division, at the Defense Health Agency. “It also helps protect the environment by reducing the chemicals that can enter our water system.”

Keep reading to learn more about why—and how—you should dispose of expired or unused drugs.

Why you should dispose of old prescriptions

Keeping expired or unused prescriptions at home can be risky. Children might find them, or someone might misuse them. Disposing of old prescriptions from home helps prevent potential harm and medication misuse.

Additionally, throwing drugs in the trash or flushing them down the toilet can harm our water supply and soil. When you dispose of drugs properly, you:

Keep children safe from accidental poisoning

Help prevent potential drug misuse

Protect your environment

Help keep your community safe

How military pharmacies help

Per Drug Enforcement Administration rules, pharmacists and other pharmacy staff can’t physically accept patients’ drugs for disposal. This is why you must physically put the drugs in the collection bin or envelope yourself, though the pharmacy is happy to provide you with the drug disposal receptacle. Every military pharmacy offers at least one way to dispose of drugs:

Secure blue drop boxes where you can leave unused drugs

Secure mail-in envelopes you can take home

The process is simple. Before you drop them off, just remove or black out your personal information on the labels.

What you can drop off

You can dispose of most drugs, including:

Prescription drugs

Over-the-counter drugs

Vitamins and supplements

Pet medications

Controlled substance prescription drugs

Note: You can’t dispose of more than four ounces of liquid drugs. You also can’t dispose needles, aerosol cans, or illegal drugs. If you aren’t sure whether you can drop off a certain item, check the list of items that your pharmacy will accept.

How to get rid of your expired or unused medications

Follow these simple steps:

Find your military pharmacy by visiting Find a Military Hospital or Clinic or calling directly.

Ask if they have a drop box or secure mail-in envelopes.

Remove personal information from prescription containers.

Drop off drugs during regular pharmacy hours.

Can’t get to a military pharmacy? The DEA has other drop-off sites on April 26. Check the DEA website to find one near you.

If you can’t get to a drop-off site and must dispose of drugs at home, follow these steps:

Remove drugs from original containers.

Mix with an undesirable substance like coffee grounds or cat litter.

Put the mixture in a sealable container.

Remove personal information from empty containers.

Place the sealed container in the trash.

It ripples through families, communities, and generations, making its impact especially profound for military families who already face unique challenges. According to recent studies, nearly 1 in 10 veterans struggle with substance use disorders. Mental health conditions like PTSD often go hand in hand with addiction. These numbers underscore why accessible, effective treatment is vital.

At Westwind Recovery® in Los Angeles, we understand the importance of addressing both addiction and mental health through personalized programs, including outpatient care and intensive options. For military families, TRICARE insurance can be a crucial lifeline, helping to reduce the financial burden of rehab while ensuring you or your loved one receives the care they deserve. By understanding TRICARE rehab services, you can take the first step toward lasting recovery and brighter futures for your family.

What is TRICARE?

TRICARE is a healthcare program designed for uniformed service members, retirees, and their families. It provides various plans that cover medical services, preventive care, and mental health support. The program ensures comprehensive healthcare for those serving in the military and their dependents, emphasizing the importance of mental wellness. It offers resources for counseling and therapy, which are crucial for service members transitioning back to civilian life or coping with military service stresses.

Eligibility for TRICARE

Eligibility for TRICARE extends to active duty service members, retired service members, and their families, including certain National Guard and Reserve members and survivors of deceased service members. Understanding eligibility via insurance is vital for military families seeking rehabilitation services. TRICARE also covers special populations, including those with disabilities, ensuring all service members and their families have access to necessary care, reflecting the program’s commitment to their health and well-being.

Types of TRICARE Plans

TRICARE offers several plans to meet the diverse needs of military families, including TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, and TRICARE for Life. Each plan has distinct features, including network requirements and cost-sharing structures. Families should evaluate their options to choose the plan that best suits their needs.

For instance, TRICARE Prime requires a primary care manager, facilitating coordinated care. TRICARE Select offers flexibility in choosing healthcare providers, which is beneficial for those in remote areas. Understanding each plan’s nuances empowers military families to make informed healthcare decisions.

Understanding Addiction Treatment Services

Engaging in addiction treatment not only aids in physical recovery, but also plays a significant role in emotional and psychological healing, restoring confidence and independence. Addiction treatment services through TRICARE encompass various therapies aimed at helping individuals recover from substance abuse. These services can include detox, outpatient programs, intensive outpatient programs (IOP), and partial hospitalization programs (PHP). For military families, accessing these services through TRICARE is crucial for recovery and overall well-being.

Many expectant and new military mothers are not being screened sufficiently for mental health by their providers, according to a new report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

The nation’s primary federal watchdog agency stated in the report that the lack of such care could exacerbate problems that arise during pregnancy and childbirth, to include mental health issues that could be exacerbated by deployment.

The report stated that roughly half of all service members covered under TRICARE, the military’s managed-care program, got the recommended health-care screenings when giving birth in military treatment facilities.

Incidence of such screenings in non-military facilities was much lower, GAO reported, noting that the Defense Department does not monitor these screenings.

“GAO estimates that 52 percent of the 6,151 service members who delivered through direct care in fiscal year 2022 [Oct. 1, 2021-Sept. 30, 2022] received the Defense Health Agency’s three recommended perinatal mental health screenings,” the report stated. “These screenings used on of two DHA-recommended tools and were performed at DHA’s specified time intervals. All service members were screened at least once during their perinatal period.”

In the private sector, however, screenings were less likely to occur. One contractor, the report stated, found that 30 percent were screened at least one time. Only 6 percent were screened more than once.

The report noted that while DHA recognizes screening as the main strategy for protecting this high-risk group of patients, the agency neither monitors nor directs its contractors to monitor how frequently it takes place.

“By routinely monitoring the frequency of screenings in direct or private sector care, and taking corrective actions as needed to ensure adherence to DHA’s recommendations and evidence-based practices, DHA can help ensure that beneficiaries receive high-quality care,” GAO concluded.

We received a bill from a lab (that part is legit), that says it was (supposedly) sent to TriCare-East, which denied the claim. The first problem is that it should have gone to TriCare-West.

When called about it, they said it was too late to resubmit, because the date of service was more than 90 days in the past. This is flat out wrong, but the phone rep refused to resubmit to TeiCare-West and just said we needed to pay the bill.

We called back to speak to another rep, asking that the claim be reprocessed with TriCare-West, and this rep said that the error was a birthdate mismatch and we needed to fix the information with TriCare. When I pointed out that there has never been a birthdate problem in the nearly 20 years that patient has been on TriCare Reserve Select, and that all the other claims from that date of service process without any troubles, they then claimed that the problem was that they were given my DoD Benefits ID, and not my dependent’s.

I said that was impossible because the dependent doesn’t have my CAC, was six states away, and handled everything on their own. I then said, “Let’s just call TriCare and straighten this out.” They refused stating they don’t have the time to make the call.

I pointed out again that we’ve literally had TriCare Reserve Select from the first month we could apply for it and have never had a provider need anything more than the TriCare card and again asked to get TriCare on the line to straighten it out. They then said they couldn’t process the claim w/o a copy of the dependent’s Military ID, front & back. I repeated that no provider has ever needed copies of the dependent’s Military ID, and that the other providers from that date of service, processed the claims correctly, with the exact same information they had.

The rep then repeated they couldn’t process the claim without a copy of the Military ID, they don’t have time for this and hung-up.

We literally have never had to provide anything other than the TriCare card. Are they confusing Reserve Select requirements with another TriCare flavor? Have we just been lucky?

Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Zynex, Inc. (""Zynex"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ:ZYXI) and reminds investors of the May 19, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills."" The report claimed Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex further revealed ""Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims."" Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military.

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Zynex's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Musculoskeletal injuries (MSKIs) are a major cause of morbidity and lost duty time for military service members, impacting overall military readiness, with overuse injuries being particularly prevalent among them. Musculotendinous injuries, affecting the musculotendinous unit, are especially problematic due to their long recovery times and limited treatment options. To better understand these injuries, this review delves into the developmental, homeostatic, and structural biology of musculotendinous units, with a focus on the myotendinous junction (MTJ). Additionally, it explores the biomechanical model of the musculotendinous unit and the complexities of endogenous repair processes for muscle, tendon, and MTJ injuries. Based on these insights, the review discusses promising therapeutic approaches for treating these injuries, such as anabolic agents, metabolic reprogramming, scaffold or cell-based therapies, and physical therapy. These emerging therapies offer potential avenues for accelerating endogenous healing, reducing recovery time, and improving long-term outcomes for musculotendinous injuries.

“Thank you so much for taking the time to deliver that compassionate touch, that five minutes of education, or that voice of reassurance in a moment where our patients are experiencing fear and uncertainty,” said Boudreaux. “We have all been there – either as a patient or a family member. And it’s so reassuring when someone goes above and beyond to provide safe, compassionate care.”

Womack has even purchased a device used for soft tissue incisions when bleeding control and minimal thermal injury are desired.","FORT BRAGG, N.C. – Sometimes being green is a good thing! Womack Army Medical Center proudly marks its seventh consecutive year as the leading facility in Single-Use Device reprocessing within the Department of Defense/Defense Health Agency and celebrates a decade of receiving the Stryker Sustainability Solutions Environmental Excellence Healthy Hospital Award.

Brandy Mitchell, Directorate of Logistics Clinical Analyst and SUD Reprocessing Manager at Womack, said the ‘green curve’ at Womack continues its trajectory upward. “Womack is honored to be recognized for our outstanding efforts in reprocessing single-use medical devices,” she noted. “This recognition highlights WAMC's commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship, which has resulted in significant cost savings and waste reduction.”

In 2024, the facility achieved significant cost savings of $933,023 including $896,123 through collaboration with Stryker Sustainability and an additional $36,900 via Cardinal Health reprocessing—while diverting more than 51,000 devices, which translates to almost 15,000 pounds of waste from local landfills.

“The dedication of leadership at all levels across our Womack departments and clinics plays a vital role in the successful implementation and sustainability of the reprocessing program,” said Col. Stephanie Mont, Commander of Womack Army Medical Center. “Their continued emphasis enables our team to maximize our resources and reduce waste.”

Since the inception of the Reprocessing Program in 2008, Womack has saved $9 million and successfully reduced over 140,000 pounds of medical waste. The innovation of reprocessed medical devices has become a hallmark of healthcare efficiency, reducing costs and environmental impact. Reusing SUDs not only mitigates waste but also strengthens the supply chain by retaining resources locally, thereby reducing reliance on imported products and the materials required for their production.

Lt. Col. Cynthia Styner, Logistics Registered Nurse Liaison at Womack, said the operating rooms at Womack have a strong history of sustainability excellence. “Partnered with Stryker, numerous devices such as sequential compression device sleeves, pulse oximeter sensors, electrode leads and cables, trocars, harmonics, ligasures, tourniquet cuffs and ultrasonic scalpels are recycled and redesigned, aligning with the overall impact of cost savings and waste diverted from landfills,” she said.

Womack has even purchased a device used for soft tissue incisions when bleeding control and minimal thermal injury are desired. The instrument can be used as a substitute for electrosurgery, lasers, and steel scalpels. By the Operating Room purchasing one reprocessed handpiece device, it minimized carbon dioxide emissions by 889.29 kg. This reduction is comparable to the emissions from traveling over 1,000 miles, consuming 45 gallons of gasoline, charging 50,000 smartphones, or reducing a hospital stay by nine days in an acute care unit or three days in the ICU, as well as switching 15 incandescent bulbs to LED.",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/8989558.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-25 10:56:24.170163

It’s a day to safely dispose of unwanted, expired, or excess medications. But it’s also important to know that military pharmacies offer ways to safely dispose of drugs all year long through the Military Health System Drug Take Back program.

“National Drug Take Back Day promotes a healthier community by helping to prevent accidental misuse of expired or unused drugs,” said U.S. Army Maj. Danielle Zsido, Direct Care Branch Deputy Chief, Pharmacy Operations Division, at the Defense Health Agency. “It also helps protect the environment by reducing the chemicals that can enter our water system.”

Keep reading to learn more about why—and how—you should dispose of expired or unused drugs.

Why you should dispose of old prescriptions

Keeping expired or unused prescriptions at home can be risky. Children might find them, or someone might misuse them. Disposing of old prescriptions from home helps prevent potential harm and medication misuse.

Additionally, throwing drugs in the trash or flushing them down the toilet can harm our water supply and soil. When you dispose of drugs properly, you:

• Keep children safe from accidental poisoning

• Help prevent potential drug misuse

• Protect your environment

• Help keep your community safe

How military pharmacies help

Per Drug Enforcement Administration rules, pharmacists and other pharmacy staff can’t physically accept patients’ drugs for disposal. This is why you must physically put the drugs in the collection bin or envelope yourself, though the pharmacy is happy to provide you with the drug disposal receptacle. Every military pharmacy offers at least one way to dispose of drugs:

• Secure blue drop boxes where you can leave unused drugs

• Secure mail-in envelopes you can take home

The process is simple. Before you drop them off, just remove or black out your personal information on the labels.

What you can drop off

You can dispose of most drugs, including:

• Prescription drugs

• Over-the-counter drugs

• Vitamins and supplements

• Pet medications

• Controlled substance prescription drugs

Note: You can’t dispose of more than four ounces of liquid drugs. You also can’t dispose needles, aerosol cans, or illegal drugs. If you aren’t sure whether you can drop off a certain item, check the list of items that your pharmacy will accept.

How to get rid of your expired or unused medications

Follow these simple steps:

• Find your military pharmacy by visiting Find a Military Hospital or Clinic or calling directly.

• Ask if they have a drop box or secure mail-in envelopes.

• Remove personal information from prescription containers.

• Drop off drugs during regular pharmacy hours.

Can’t get to a military pharmacy? The DEA has other drop-off sites on April 26. Check the DEA website to find one near you.

If you can’t get to a drop-off site and must dispose of drugs at home, follow these steps:

• Remove drugs from original containers.

• Mix with an undesirable substance like coffee grounds or cat litter.

• Put the mixture in a sealable container.

• Remove personal information from empty containers.

• Place the sealed container in the trash.

To help provide meaningful guidance for these and other emerging uses of AI, the FDA is developing regulatory frameworks and policies to ensure AI is used safely and ethically.
Valeria Sena-Weltin, a regulatory affairs scientist at ORA, uses the analogy of a smart watch to describe how the risk-based credibility assessment works.
As the use of AI in military medicine R&D increases, researchers need to take precautions to ensure the resulting products are safe and effective, says Sena-Weltin.
Frempong and Sena-Weltin discussed the use of AI to support regulatory decision-making for drug and biological products during a recent presentation to DHA R&D-MRDC staff.","FORT DETRICK, Md. – As drug developers rely increasingly on artificial intelligence to assist with the discovery, testing and manufacture of new medicines, researchers at the Defense Health Agency Research and Development-Medical Research and Development Command are learning how to apply the latest regulatory guidance related to AI to better carry out their mission to develop life-saving medicines that protect our warfighters and enable them to maintain operational effectiveness even in chemically and biologically contaminated environments.

“The use of AI in the drug product life cycle continues to increase,” says Dr. Barima Frempong, a regulatory affairs analyst at the Defense Health Agency Research and Development-Medical Research and Development Command’s Office of Regulated Activities. “AI is transforming how drug development is conducted by accelerating discovery, improving accuracy and reducing costs.”

ORA plays a vital role in each of DHA R&D-MRDC’s strategic lines of effort to tightly integrate medical research and development with the DOD’s warfighter requirements. The office’s regulatory affairs, compliance and clinical support professionals specialize in identifying and mitigating regulatory risks early in a product’s development life cycle, which helps them pass more smoothly – and quickly – through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s rigorous review process and get approved for licensing and manufacture.

Until recently, AI has mostly been used to accelerate the process of discovering promising new drug candidates, thanks to its ability to process vast amounts of data quickly and accurately. However, drug developers are increasingly using AI to assist with other data-intensive tasks such as assisting with patient diagnosis, improving the fidelity of augmented reality and imaging systems, and informing treatment decisions. To help provide meaningful guidance for these and other emerging uses of AI, the FDA is developing regulatory frameworks and policies to ensure AI is used safely and ethically.

In January, the FDA issued a new draft guidance document, “Considerations for the Use of Artificial Intelligence to Support Regulatory Decision-Making for Drug and Biological Products,” which lays out a seven-step method for assessing an AI model’s ability to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and quality of a new drug. The new approach lays out a risk-based assessment process that determines how an AI model will impact the regulatory decision-making and documentation requirements associated with a particular project.

Valeria Sena-Weltin, a regulatory affairs scientist at ORA, uses the analogy of a smart watch to describe how the risk-based credibility assessment works. “The regulations that apply to a smart watch that can track your heart rate will be different than for a watch that can detect atrial fibrillation, because that watch would be considered a medical device,” says Sena-Weltin. “The more power you give to an AI model for decision making, the greater the documentation requirement will be to support its safe use.”

DHA R&D-MRDC researchers who develop vaccines, therapeutics, and devices for detecting and combating infectious diseases, biological agents and chemical weapons are increasingly incorporating AI into their new products. For example, the Automated Processing of the Physiological Registry for Assessment of Injury Severity Hemorrhage Risk Index, which uses vital-sign data from trauma patients to assess their risk of hemorrhage, and SeptiBurnAlert, which identifies whether burn patients are at risk of experiencing life-threatening complications from sepsis, both use AI to help clinicians and first responders make timely and life-saving health care decisions.

As the use of AI in military medicine R&D increases, researchers need to take precautions to ensure the resulting products are safe and effective, says Sena-Weltin. To avoid the introduction of bias that could skew the accuracy of a readout, researchers need to ensure the data sets used to train the algorithm are reliable, accurate, and complete. Because AI relies on complex computational and statistical methodologies, researchers must provide the FDA with detailed and transparent explanations of the methods they use to train the algorithm, so that they can be independently verified. And to ensure the data sets remain trustworthy over time, they should be monitored and evaluated regularly throughout its life cycle, especially after they are put into use and new data are added over time.

Frempong and Sena-Weltin discussed the use of AI to support regulatory decision-making for drug and biological products during a recent presentation to DHA R&D-MRDC staff. The presentation, which was a follow-up to ORA’s previous session on the use of AI in drug development, was part of a series of bimonthly “lunch and learn” sessions conducted by ORA for MRDC staff as a way to share the latest regulatory guidelines from the FDA related to drugs, biologics, and medical devices, and how they apply to medical research and development efforts at MRDC.",https://www.dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/8632859.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-24 18:56:31.290836

“MSMR’s role within and supporting the overall mission of the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Division, Public Health Division, and the Defense Health Agency remains vital,” said MSMR editor-in-chief Robert Johnson, MD, MPH, MBA.

“The need for appropriate database utilization, information review, and methodologically valid analysis remains the ‘gold standard’ of epidemiological surveillance and medical knowledge development,” said Johnson.

MSMR aims to provide military public health leaders and line staff officers with timely access to militarily-relevant, readiness-focused, routine and specialized reports. This access also helps them to identify and contain outbreaks, understand disease burden, guide policy changes, and evaluate and improve prevention and control strategies.

MSMR History

The need for a publication like MSMR became evident in the early 1990s due to the lack of distribution of routine periodic medical surveillance in the U.S. military, worsened by the end of publication of service-specific surveillance reports, including Health of the Army and Statistics of Navy Medicine in the late 1980s. At the time, there were no ready or centrally available sources of timely and reliable information on existing medical threats, and published insights on medical situational awareness were generally out-of-date, incomplete, and largely uninformative.

One of MSMR’s core functions was to report routine monthly surveillance statistics not otherwise readily available to intended readership. MSMR was also intended to emulate, for the U.S. military, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, or MMWR, published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Like MMWR, MSMR is a mechanism to distribute public health data and reports, targeted mostly to military public health professionals, in addition to military commanders, leaders, and policymakers, as well as the scientific and lay press.

MSMR Milestones

Since its beginning, MSMR has achieved many milestones. In 2011, it was accepted for indexing in MEDLINE, the principal online bibliographic citation database of the National Library of Medicine’s MEDLARS® system. MSMR’s inclusion in MEDLINE not only helped to expand the scope and reach of MSMR’s content, but also increased the number and quality of external submissions from potential authors.

The establishment of the Defense Health Agency formally consolidated the medical services of all branches of the U.S. military, which included integration of all U.S. military public health surveillance activities. These integration efforts reinforced MSMR’s focus on reporting results for all service branches.

Over the past decade, MSMR has continued to explore ways to expand and improve its content and make it more readily usable to readers. MSMR increased its production of thematic issues and made significant efforts to engage subject matter experts throughout the Military Health System. These thematic issues have focused on a wide range of subjects including overall health, mental and behavioral health, heat illness and injury, sexually transmitted infections, gastrointestinal infections, and vision-related conditions. A Global Emerging Infections Surveillance-themed issue featured surveillance reports from GEIS partners.

U.S. Navy Capt. Richard Langton, MD, MPH, chief of AFHSD, confirmed the publication’s value.

“For 30 years, the MSMR has advanced military public health surveillance, research, policy, practice, and education influencing the discussion at the intersection of health readiness and military operations,"" Langton said. ""Congratulations to the MSMR team for the standard they’ve set for military health surveillance. May the great reporting continue for the next thirty years.”

As MSMR enters its 31st year, its editorial staff aims to continue its tradition of excellence while making its content more clinically relevant, continuing to increase collaboration with external agencies and individuals, publishing topics of military relevance, and making practical, military-specific recommendations.

As winter’s chill dissipates and spring’s rain gives way to summer’s warmth, we shed layers of clothing and venture outdoors to enjoy the weather.

Spending time outside is a known mood booster. The increased physical activity of outdoor recreation is good for overall health and wellness. However, hidden dangers can lurk among the blossoms – and ticks come out of hiding in the springtime, too.

May is Lyme Disease Awareness Month. Spring is one of the most important times of year to become “tick smart” by learning about the risks ticks pose and how to avoid tick bites. Ticks are tiny and can be hard to notice — even after they bite — due to chemicals in their saliva that make them invisible to our body’s defenses. While not every tick is infected with a disease-causing pathogen, one unlucky bite can infect a person with one or multiple disease agents.

Lyme disease

Lyme disease is by far the most common tick-borne disease in the United States, infecting approximately 476,000 people in the U.S. every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The ticks that transmit the bacteria that cause Lyme disease are called blacklegged ticks, also known as deer ticks. Their tiny nymphs (smaller than a sesame seed) come out in force during May. More than 25% of blacklegged ticks can be infected with the Lyme pathogen.

Blacklegged ticks can be hard to find and remove quickly because of their small size. During warmer seasons, we tend to wear fewer clothes, making us more susceptible to bites and subsequent infections. It generally takes around 48 hours for a tick to transmit the Lyme disease pathogen, so time is of the essence once one of these bloodsuckers latches on.

For the military community, one weapon in the fight against ticks and Lyme disease is a program known as MilTICK: the Military Tick Identification/Infection Confirmation Kit program. Service members and their families, as well as retirees, civilians, contractors, and others can submit human-biting ticks to the MilTICK program for free and receive an emailed report describing the tick species, how long the tick was attached, and whether or not the tick tested positive for any pathogens.

MilTICK started in 1995 and is run by the Defense Health Agency - Public Health at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. Most military clinics have tick kits on site; individuals or clinics can request tick kits by contacting MilTICK program staff. The kits never expire and are great to have on hand, just in case a tick bite occurs.

MilTICK uses the data generated to better understand tick-borne disease risks to the military community. In 2024, over 3,000 ticks were tested; 167 were found to be positive for one or more human pathogens. It might come as no surprise that May is the month when the most Lyme disease agent is detected, although MilTICK has found the Lyme agent in human-biting ticks submitted during every month of the year. The Lyme agent peaks in the spring and fall, when the numbers of nymph and adult ticks are at their highest.

Of course, Lyme disease isn’t the only tick-borne disease out there, and not even the only one you need to worry about from a blacklegged tick bite. Blacklegged ticks also transmit a relapsing fever illness, a bacterial disease called anaplasmosis, a parasitic disease similar to malaria called babesiosis, and Powassan virus, which can cause encephalitis and even death. MilTICK tests for all of these; fortunately, these pathogens are much rarer than the Lyme pathogen. For example, only one confirmed positive tick for Powassan virus has been found since MilTICK started testing for it in 2020.

Other tick species become active in the springtime, too, especially the human-biting lone star tick and the American dog tick. Lone star ticks make up the bulk of ticks received by MilTICK, since they’re the most common tick in the Southeastern U.S., where many military installations are located. Lone star ticks can transmit a disease called ehrlichiosis and have also been associated with a red meat allergy known as alpha gal syndrome.

Your risk of tick-borne disease depends on where you live and how you spend your time. Lyme disease is endemic to the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and upper Midwestern U.S., where the blacklegged tick is abundant. Move further South and you’re in lone star tick country, where your risk of ehrlichiosis is much higher than your risk of Lyme disease.

To learn more about the risks at your installation, visit the CAC-enabled MilTICK data dashboard and see exactly what kinds of ticks are being submitted from the area where you live.

The more time you spend outside in tick habitat, the greater your risk of a tick bite and potentially developing a tick-borne disease. Treating clothes with tick-killing sprays such as permethrin, using bug spray on exposed skin, and covering up with long pants and socks even during warmer months will all help prevent tick bites.

If you do get bitten, sending the tick for testing through MilTICK can help provide peace of mind if the tick is negative for pathogens. If the tick is positive, the MilTICK report can help your medical provider diagnose and treat any symptoms that may develop.

Taking walks in the woods, playing sports outside with friends, and stopping to smell the flowers are all wonderful ways to enjoy the outdoors this May. Staying aware and being tick smart can help keep you safe all year.

What GAO Found

The Department of Defense's (DOD) Defense Health Agency (DHA) has 13 contracts with private sector companies to provide TRICARE health, dental, and pharmacy benefits generally through networks of civilian providers.

Current TRICARE Contracts for Health, Dental, and Pharmacy Benefits

GAO identified changes in the key characteristics of these current contracts compared with the prior version of these contracts that had recently ended. For example, 11 of the 13 current contracts had an increase in their total contract value at the time of award (i.e., the sum value of the contract's base period including all option years). GAO found various reasons that contributed to the higher award values, including changes in geographic service areas and longer periods of performance. DHA officials also told GAO that health care costs have increased significantly over the last 10 years due to inflation and the COVID-19 pandemic.

GAO also found that seven of the 13 TRICARE contracts were competitively awarded and of those, four received fewer bids for the current contracts compared with the prior contracts. The remaining three competitively awarded contracts received the same number of bids for the current and prior contracts, with one contract receiving a single bid each time. In addition, DHA awarded six of the seven contracts to the incumbent contractors.

Why GAO Did This Study

DOD offers health care services to over 9 million eligible beneficiaries through its TRICARE program. TRICARE beneficiaries may obtain care through either military medical treatment facilities, including medical centers, hospitals, and clinics or through the private sector care system of civilian providers. Within DOD, DHA is responsible for TRICARE, including the award, administration, and oversight of 13 health, dental, and pharmacy contracts used to provide care and services through civilian providers. As of September 30, 2024, these current contracts were collectively valued at about $168 billion.

The James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 includes a provision for GAO to report on key characteristics of certain contracts related to the TRICARE program. Some of these key characteristics include total contract values, the products or services procured, and health care or service delivery time frames. Among other things, this report describes changes in the key characteristics between the current and prior TRICARE health, dental, and pharmacy contracts.

GAO analyzed DHA documentation for the current and prior TRICARE contracts for health, dental, and pharmacy benefits. In addition, GAO reviewed data from the Federal Procurement Data System. GAO also interviewed DHA officials responsible for each of the TRICARE contracts.

A BSI is a type of musculoskeletal overuse injury resulting from gradual, repetitive force on bone tissues.
“Our ongoing studies are finding that NSAIDS may increase BSI risk as much as five times during initial military entry training,” she says.
Recent evidence suggests similar risks among young adults of both genders may contribute to low bone density and thus increase BSI risk.
By reducing BSI rates and severity during initial training, the military can improve the readiness and resilience of its fighting force.","Bone stress injuries, which include stress fractures, can be debilitating to athletes but are also a problem for the U.S. military, according to public health experts.

“Service members who develop BSIs may be placed on a medical profile limiting duty or training activities, or even need orthopedic surgery,” says U.S. Army Maj. Shay Lopez, a physical therapist and chief of the Defense Health Agency-Public Health Injury Prevention Branch at Aberdeen, Maryland.

“By finding ways to prevent and reduce the number and severity of BSIs, the military can improve force readiness, lethality, and reduce costs,” says Lopez.

In pursuit of this goal, experts from the DHA-PH have been studying trends and risk factors of BSI with scientists at the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine and military leaders at the U.S. Army Training Center at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, an initial entry training installation for nearly half of the U.S. Army.

These scientists now have a better understanding of some factors that may increase the risk of service members’ developing a BSI.

What are bone stress injuries?

A BSI is a type of musculoskeletal overuse injury resulting from gradual, repetitive force on bone tissues. Common activities in the military that cause these injuries are running, marching, and load-bearing exercises. MSK overuse injuries continue to be a primary reason for service members’ medical visits and cost the Department of Defense billions of dollars annually.

“While a gradual increase of exercise and physical activity will encourage bone and other supporting musculoskeletal tissues to strengthen over time, a BSI happens when the bone tissue doesn’t have enough time to build between activities,” says Katelyn Guerriere-Aaron, a senior research physiologist at USARIEM.

DHA-PH injury experts agree.

Lopez explains that BSIs may be missed during an initial medical exam. BSIs may take time to develop, are confused with other types of injuries, or are painless until becoming severe. Catching early signs of BSIs is also difficult with motivated military personnel, who want to ‘tough out’ physical training programs for fear of restarting (known as being “recycled”) or failing military training due to injury.

“Data show most BSIs in the military are to the lower parts of the body. This includes areas extending from the hip down to the toes,” says Ryan Steelman, a DHA-PH injury prevention epidemiologist. “BSIs to the tibia, which includes a condition sometimes referred to as shin splints, are especially common among men. Women more often experience BSI to the hip or the femoral neck, an upper portion of the thigh bone.”

Diagnosing BSI injuries can be challenging, even by doctors.

“BSIs, particularly hips, can be tricky to diagnose as the pain level doesn’t always equal the severity level, and X-ray imaging doesn’t always show early BSI,” says U.S. Army Maj. Gary Helton, assistant chief of the Fort Jackson Department of Sports Medicine. “Tibial BSIs, and hip BSIs, particularly the femoral neck, can lead to a complete fracture needing surgery if not addressed in a timely manner.”

Evidence indicates extensive running and long road marches with heavy rucksacks – especially on consecutive days – are associated with military lower-body MSK injuries like these BSIs.

“These training activities, however, are critical to ensuring personnel are ready for the physical rigors of combat operations,” says Steelman. “By studying BSI trends and risk factors, we are better able to help identify ways to reduce BSI impacts and build more resilient warfighters.”

Who is at risk?

New military recruits are particularly at risk of BSIs because their initial entry training, typically 10 to 16 weeks, often brings a sudden and substantial increase in the amount and intensity of their physical activity. DHA data show that while female service members have a higher risk of BSI, there are almost five times more male service members, so more men than women will develop a BSI.

“We have been diagnosing BSIs in recruits at Fort Jackson for years. A large number of these BSIs are diagnosed as early as the second and third week of training,” says Helton.“The treatment for these BSIs detracts from the success of the training.”

With support from DHA public health experts and USARIEM researchers, Helton has been able to objectively review BSI trends and risk factors and identify potential ways to reduce BSI severity and case numbers.

“Many recruits who are eventually injured in training lead relatively sedentary lives prior to enlistment, so they do not have the foundation necessary for the rigors of military training,” says Helton. “Preparing their bodies with physical training before volunteering for initial military training can reduce their risk of developing a BSI during initial training programs.”

While all forms of exercise before initial military entry can improve fitness, the type of physical activity may also be important.

“Our findings suggest that specific activities that require multi-directional body movement, such as soccer or basketball, may lower rates of BSI more than exercises like running or lifting by helping build stronger overall MSK structure,” says Julie Hughes, a senior researcher and colleague of Guerriere-Aaron at USARIEM.

What risk factors can be controlled?

USARIEM experts have highlighted an especially critical finding that could help reduce the risk of BSI.

“Several studies have pointed to excessive use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDS, during rigorous physical training activities as a factor that will increase BSI risk,” says Guerriere-Aaron. “NSAIDS have also been found to delay healing in those who do have a bone stress injury.”

Hughes agrees that use of NSAIDs, which include products that can be purchased over the counter, such as ibuprofen, may be one of the most significant and preventable risks of BSI.

“Our ongoing studies are finding that NSAIDS may increase BSI risk as much as five times during initial military entry training,” she says.

Many orthopedic doctors are aware that NSAIDs delay healing, but this may not be well known by others in the medical field, says Helton.

“Since NSAIDs can be effective for pain management, many providers may prescribe NSAIDS, such as ibuprofen, for pain,” he says. “But if pain is the result of potential bone injury, research suggests NSAIDS should be avoided.”

Helton points out that recruits in military initial entry training are dependent on military medical providers for any form of medication and typically cannot purchase over-the-counter medication such as ibuprofen.

“We are working to ensure military providers are aware of the NSAID risks with bone injuries. This is a key message we want to get out,” he says. “We also discourage NSAID use by recruits who may be able to access NSAIDs over the counter or from a buddy.”

Past evidence has also indicated that low bone density is a risk factor for BSI among young women who have other risk factors. Key underlying risks include poor nutrition and/or being underweight, and excessive exercise. Recent evidence suggests similar risks among young adults of both genders may contribute to low bone density and thus increase BSI risk.

Another consideration Helton observed is the added stress on recruits’ lower body bones during running or ruck march formations if drill sergeants tell recruits to ‘stride it out’, particularly shorter trainees.

“There appears to be more bone stress if a trainee has to change their normal gait and stretch their legs forward to keep up with formation, landing harder on the heel and increasing stress at the hip,” Helton says. “Quicker, shorter steps may be safer, or – even better – putting shorter persons up front in a formation to manage the pace.”

What can be done by service members?

An estimated one-third of applicants to military entry training don’t meet basic military fitness standards. Recruits who are more physically fit before their initial training program have lower BSI rates. Other underlying factors, such as poor diet and lack of sleep, may make some service members more vulnerable to developing a BSI than others.

Lopez recommends that before military initial training, recruits should—

Gradually increase various exercising drills to include agility, power and balance training along with more traditional aerobic endurance (cardio) and strength exercises.

Allow time between exercise sessions for rest and bone recovery.

During training, recruits should —

Avoid NSAIDS for bone pain.

Eat nutritional foods to maintain energy levels.

Prioritize sleep to allow for bone recovery.

Avoid overreaching gaits and striding out; aim for shorter quick steps.

Seek medical assessment at the earliest signs of bone pain and follow recovery treatment plans to avoid more serious BSIs.

By reducing BSI rates and severity during initial training, the military can improve the readiness and resilience of its fighting force.

“Through continued dialogue between Pentagon leadership, frontline providers, and the total force in Japan, the DOD aims to develop tailored solutions to address the distinct challenges of delivering military health care in Japan while maintaining the highest standards of care for service members, their families, and DOD civilian employees,” she said.","Susan Orsega, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Services Policy and Oversight, visited military installations in Japan, April 7-11, 2025, to better understand challenges and successes to accessing health care in the region.

Orsega met with military hospital and clinic leaders at Misawa Air Base and Commander, Fleet Activities Yokosuka on mainland Japan and at Camp Foster on the island of Okinawa. Staff from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs also held listening sessions with Department of Defense civilian employees who are enrolled in the new Pilot Health Insurance Enhancement for DOD Civilian Employees in Japan as part of the pilot's evaluation.

Orsega's visit underscores the DOD’s and the Military Health System's focus on the Indo-Pacific region and commitment to ensuring and improving access to health care for active duty service members, family members, and DOD civilian employees. It also reflects the focus of Dr. Stephen Ferrara, the Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, to directly engage with military hospital and clinic staff to understand local challenges and successes.

""When Dr. Ferrara came on board, he gave us clear directives: He challenged us to immerse ourselves in the problems you face daily, especially given the unique complexities of this remote base,"" Orsega shared with military hospital and clinic staff at Misawa’s 35th Medical Group. ""He wanted us to understand your realities, roll up our sleeves, and work collaboratively to make your roles more effective, more efficient, and ultimately, more successful at serving our beneficiaries.""

During staff and leadership engagements, medical personnel in Japan highlighted challenges unique to this remote region. Supply chains face lengthy logistical hurdles, with United States’ medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, and equipment requiring more lead time compared to stateside facilities. Healthcare delivery for military families relies heavily, or even solely, on the military hospitals and clinics in comparison to installations in the United States with more robust and Click to closeprivate sector careNetwork and non-network TRICARE-authorized civilian health care professionals, pharmacies, and suppliers.private sector care networks that are readily accessible through TRICARE.

The readiness mission remains top of mind for all healthcare personnel in Japan, given the region's strategic importance.

As Orsega emphasized during her visits, ""Ensuring that we're supporting our warfighters is a critical component of the Military Health System's mission, alongside sustaining clinical skills and supporting military families.”

This readiness focus takes on heightened significance in the Indo-Pacific region, where military hospitals and clinics operate on the frontline of potential conflict zones.

Despite these challenges, leadership across the MHS in Japan demonstrates “remarkable innovation and collaboration,” Orsega said.

Military hospitals and clinics have successfully built relationships with host nation healthcare systems, overcoming difficult language barriers and different medical practices. Leadership teams work across services, with U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Army medical personnel collaborating to provide seamless care, as evidenced by partnerships like the joint neonatal intensive care unit operations and related evacuations between U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa and the U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka

U.S. Navy Capt. Kathleen Cooperman, commanding officer at U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, highlighted how staff have remained mission-focused through numerous transitions, including, ""staffing challenges, systems upgrades, changes to financial systems, mergers of dental corps,"" and various inspections. ""Not once did any one of these individuals lose sight of why we're here and what we need to do,"" she emphasized.

A team from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, led by the Chief of Staff Dr. Bryce Slinger, hosted six listening sessions with DOD civilian employees to inform an evaluation of the Pilot Health Insurance Enhancement. The services under this pilot began on Jan. 1, 2025, in response to DOD civilian employees' challenges in navigating the host-nation’s healthcare system. The pilot assists eligible DOD civilian employees with healthcare navigation, including provider-finder services, direct billing agreements, and insurance reimbursement.

The team received positive feedback, though civilians noted gaps in some specialty services, family coverage, and translation services. Based on these qualitative findings, paired with quantitative analysis, the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness will determine if the pilot will be extended past the current period of performance, ending on Sept. 29, 2025, and will consider additional solutions to bolster civilian care options.
