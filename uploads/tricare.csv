BiomX, a clinical-stage biotechnology company, has recently made significant strides in its phage therapy development. The company successfully dosed the first patient in its Phase 2b trial for BX004, a treatment for cystic fibrosis patients with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections. This milestone has rekindled investor interest in BiomX's novel approach to treating antibiotic-resistant infections, which has been underperforming in recent years.

The Phase 2b trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving approximately 60 cystic fibrosis patients. The trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of BX004, with topline results expected in the first quarter of 2026. The therapy has already received both Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations from the FDA, potentially accelerating its development timeline.

BiomX's pipeline extends beyond its cystic fibrosis program. The company recently reported positive Phase 2 results for BX211, its phage therapy for diabetic foot osteomyelitis, showing statistically significant improvements in ulcer healing compared to placebo. This program has attracted $40 million in non-dilutive funding from the U.S. Defense Health Agency, highlighting its strategic importance in addressing battlefield wound infections as well as civilian medical needs.

Investors are particularly encouraged by the regulatory pathway for BX004. The company anticipates feedback from the FDA in the second half of 2025 regarding plans to use real-world evidence linking bacterial reduction to clinical outcomes, which could further streamline the approval process. Despite the recent drop in stock price, the company's innovative approach to phage therapy and its potential to address significant unmet medical needs continue to attract investor attention.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,0.0,2025-07-15 07:56:16.786869

[WASHINGTON, D.C.] — Combat Veteran and U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL)—who served in the Reserve Forces for 23 years and had both of her daughters through in vitro fertilization (IVF)—successfully secured a provision in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) approved last week which would require TRICARE coverage of fertility services, including IVF for servicemembers who rely on it to build their families.

The SASC-passed bill will soon be considered by the full Senate.

“Even before I was wounded, I had made the difficult decision to delay building a family because I knew getting pregnant would impact my ability to be an Army aviator and to advance in the career I loved. Because of the miracle of IVF—and my access to reproductive healthcare through the VA—I’m now a mom to two beautiful girls. The reality is that members of the uniformed services face unique challenges when trying to start or build a family, and studies show that servicemembers and Veterans have higher rates of infertility compared to the general population. Given how much we ask of our heroes, we should do what we can to support them in building their families.

“After successfully securing this provision in last year’s bill that passed through committee, I’m so proud my colleagues helped me build on this progress to include it in this year’s bill as well. It’s past time our nation provides uniformed servicemembers with the same access to IVF that all Members of Congress already have and ensure our heroes can access the fertility treatment they need to start the families they’ve dreamed of.”

Patient Testimonials

“I suffered for years with foot and ankle pain. I tried orthotics, PRP, and multiple rounds of physical therapy on base, but nothing helped. I was told surgery might be the only fix because of a tendon tear. Then I found Dr. Repko. Two months later, I’m pain-free—no surgery, no downtime. I’m still amazed.”

,,2025-07-14 18:45:06+00:00,DefenseScoop,Pentagon reviewing payment applications from Havana Syndrome victims - DefenseScoop,Jon Harper,,,,,https://defensescoop.com/2025/07/14/havana-syndrome-dod-military-payment-applications/,"The Defense Department has started reviewing applications from personnel seeking financial compensation for brain health issues associated with the phenomenon known as Havana Syndrome, according to the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson.
“Although there are reports that predate these incidents, the media originally called these phenomena Havana Syndrome, as they were the first to garner public attention.
“The Department of Defense has begun reviewing applications by DoD personnel for payments pursuant to the Helping American Victims Afflicted by Neurological Attacks Act of 2021 (HAVANA Act),” chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement Friday.
The Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service (DCPAS) is responsible for administering the HAVANA Act-related payment program for the Pentagon.
“DCPAS will collect and review applications that have been submitted, using the DD Form 3220, ‘Eligibility Questionnaire for HAVANA Act Payments,’ claim form, to the HAVANA Act email address (dodhra.mc-alex.dcpas.mbx.dod-havana-act@mail.mil).","The Defense Department has started reviewing applications from personnel seeking financial compensation for brain health issues associated with the phenomenon known as Havana Syndrome, according to the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson.

The term Havana Syndrome was coined after people working at the U.S. Embassy in Cuba’s capital city in 2016 reported a sudden onset of symptoms that had no obvious cause, including vertigo, imbalance, blurry vision, tinnitus, headache, hearing loss, nausea and cognitive dysfunction.

“Although there are reports that predate these incidents, the media originally called these phenomena Havana Syndrome, as they were the first to garner public attention. Such events have affected U.S. government employees, military servicemembers, and their families in countries around the world, and are now referred to as anomalous health incidents (AHI) by the U.S. government,” the Government Accountability Office explained in a July 2024 report, which also highlighted challenges that sufferers faced in accessing the Military Health System.

Congress several years ago passed legislation that authorized federal agencies to compensate affected employees, former employees and dependents for qualifying brain injuries.

“The Department of Defense has begun reviewing applications by DoD personnel for payments pursuant to the Helping American Victims Afflicted by Neurological Attacks Act of 2021 (HAVANA Act),” chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement Friday.

“Under the HAVANA Act, DoD employees and their covered dependents who suffered qualifying brain injuries on or after January 1, 2016, in connection with certain Anomalous Health Incidents (AHI), are eligible for a one-time payment. The Department is committed to helping DoD personnel affected by AHIs,” he added.

A House Intelligence subcommittee report issued last December noted that Havana Syndrome incidents have also been reported in Austria, China, Colombia, Georgia, Germany, India, Poland, Russia and Vietnam, as well as the United States.

Estimates vary as to the number of individuals affected by the problem, GAO noted in last year’s report. As of January 2024, 334 people had qualified for care in the Military Health System, according to the government watchdog.

Some observers believe that incidents of Havana Syndrome may have been intentionally caused by adversaries using pulsed radio-frequency energy or focused ultrasound devices, but others are skeptical.

“Various government agencies and medical researchers have conducted studies on aspects of AHIs, but none have isolated a cause,” the GAO report stated.

A study by a panel of U.S. intelligence community experts — whose findings were declassified in 2022 — found that “known medical and environmental conditions, including psychosocial factors, could not explain some AHI cases with abrupt-onset, location dependent, audio-vestibular phenomena. It concluded that various forms of pulsed radiofrequency energy, as well as focused ultrasound in close access scenarios, were plausible explanations for these cases, though information gaps existed,” according to the GAO report, which noted that the experts “did not address the question of attribution to an actor, including the question of whether a foreign actor may be involved.”

Another IC assessment, released in March 2023, concluded it was “very unlikely” that a foreign adversary was responsible for the reported incidents, and that deliberate causal mechanisms were “very unlikely” to have produced the sensory phenomena and symptoms associated with them — although confidence levels in those conclusions varied among the IC agencies, per the GAO report.

Leadership of a GOP-led House Intelligence subcommittee criticized the 2023 IC assessment, saying it “lacked analytic integrity.”

“It appears increasingly likely and the Chairman is convinced that a foreign adversary is behind some AHIs,” officials wrote in a subcommittee report released in December 2024.

A former U.S. Army officer who led an official investigation told journalists from the show 60 Minutes that he believed Russia was behind attacks that caused Havana Syndrome symptoms, according to CBS News.

The Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service (DCPAS) is responsible for administering the HAVANA Act-related payment program for the Pentagon.

“DCPAS will collect and review applications that have been submitted, using the DD Form 3220, ‘Eligibility Questionnaire for HAVANA Act Payments,’ claim form, to the HAVANA Act email address (dodhra.mc-alex.dcpas.mbx.dod-havana-act@mail.mil). Individuals applying on behalf of a covered employee or covered dependent must provide documentation demonstrating the individual is authorized to act on behalf of the applicant,” Jules Hurst III, acting undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, wrote in a June 20 memo, which provides details about the adjudication, payment and appeals processes.

“DCPAS may consult with offices within the Office of the Secretary of Defense to determine whether the incident causing the injury was in connection with war, insurgency, hostile act, or terrorist activity. For applications involving incidents that have been designated by DoD as ‘other incidents’ … DCPAS will request that the applicant or Director, Defense Health Agency, provide a designation letter … to validate that an incident at a particular location has been reported and the covered employee or covered dependent is authorized to receive medical care from DoD in relation to the incident,” Hurst wrote in the memo.",https://defensescoop.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2020/06/6192861.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-14 15:56:25.587524

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: The TRICARE referral and authorization waiver for the West Region expired on June 30. Providers must now follow standard TRICARE requirements for all new outpatient services.

The U.S. Defense Health Agency has confirmed that the temporary waiver of referral and authorization requirements for TRICARE Prime beneficiaries in the West Region ended on June 30, 2025. As of July 1, 2025, all outpatient services for TRICARE Prime patients once again require appropriate referrals and authorizations in accordance with standard TRICARE guidelines.

The waiver was initially enacted to ease administrative burdens during the transition of managed care responsibilities to TriWest Healthcare Alliance (TriWest), which assumed management of TRICARE West Region services on January 1, 2025. Under the waiver, providers did not need to submit referral or authorization requests for TRICARE Prime patients seeking TRICARE-covered outpatient services, with some exceptions.

Referrals for care that extend beyond June 30, 2025, will need to follow the prior established TRICARE referral and authorization requirements and obtain approval to continue care after June 30. Referrals issued after June 30, 2025, will be subject to normal TRICARE referral and authorization requirements.

Providers are strongly encouraged to review the TriWest TRICARE Provider Handbook and referral protocols to avoid disruptions in care or reimbursement issues effective July 1.

The Problem Solvers Caucus gladly endorses this bill, and we’ll keep working across the aisle to help military families in whatever way we can,” said Problem Solvers Caucus Co-Chair Congressman Tom Suozzi (NY-03).
(link is external) ### The Problem Solvers Caucus is a group of Members of Congress — split between Republicans and Democrats — committed to advancing common-sense solutions to key issues facing our nation.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the Problem Solvers Caucus announced its endorsement of the TRICARE OB-GYN Treatment and Access without Lags in Care (TOTAL Care) Act, bipartisan legislation to make it easier for women enrolled in TRICARE Prime to access OB-GYN services.

Under current TRICARE Prime rules, beneficiaries must obtain a referral before visiting an OB-GYN, even for routine care like annual exams or prenatal appointments. This requirement often leads to delays and unnecessary administrative burdens for military families who already frequently face gaps in healthcare access due to relocations and deployments.

The TOTAL Care Act would remove outdated referral requirements for OB-GYN care under TRICARE Prime to ensure timely access to essential reproductive and maternal health services. Specifically, the bill would:

Allow TRICARE Prime beneficiaries to access OB-GYN care without a referral

Permit patients to designate an OB-GYN as a primary care provider

Allow OB-GYNs to directly order related services without extra approvals

The bipartisan legislation was introduced by Representatives Steven Horsford (NV-04), Maria Salazar (FL-27), and Chrissy Houlahan (PA-06) and has 12 additional cosponsors, four of whom are Members of the Problem Solvers Caucus. The bill was brought forward for Caucus endorsement by Representatives Horsford and Salazar.

“Ensuring military personnel and their loved ones have the best care available isn’t partisan politics – it’s common sense,” said Congressman Steven Horsford (NV-04). “I’m proud to partner with Rep. Salazar on the TOTAL Care Act, and I’m grateful for the Problem Solvers Caucus’ endorsement. Our legislation cuts through red tape to ensure servicemembers have access to the same, high-quality care that every other American has.”

""Our women in uniform risk their lives to defend this country, yet they’re forced to navigate unnecessary bureaucracy just to see an OB-GYN. That’s unacceptable,"" said Congresswoman María Salazar (FL-27). ""The TOTAL Care Act fixes that. I’m proud to help lead this effort, and I thank the Problem Solvers Caucus for endorsing this bipartisan solution. This is not a partisan issue, it’s about basic dignity, respect, and doing right by the servicewomen who fight for us. Together, we’re cutting the red tape and delivering the care they’ve earned.""

""OB-GYN care is primary care,” said Congresswoman Chrissy Houlahan (PA-06). “As a veteran, I am proud to stand with my colleagues to introduce this long overdue legislation to ensure our servicemembers and their families receive care in line with their civilian counterparts and without additional referrals or barriers. Servicemembers and their families should not be unfairly burdened simply because they raised their right hands in service. This bipartisan effort eliminates redundancy and delays and ensures access to critical women's healthcare.""

“Cutting down red tape to allow service members and their families easier access to critical care is a common sense fix. The Affordable Care Act got rid of the need for referrals for this kind of coverage years ago — leaving out members of our military is legislative oversight. The Problem Solvers Caucus gladly endorses this bill, and we’ll keep working across the aisle to help military families in whatever way we can,” said Problem Solvers Caucus Co-Chair Congressman Tom Suozzi (NY-03).

“The TOTAL Care Act is a smart, bipartisan fix that removes an outdated barrier to care and restores direct OB-GYN access for military families under TRICARE. It reflects exactly the kind of commonsense, patient-first reform I’ve long championed—cutting bureaucracy, improving care delivery, and ensuring our servicemembers and their families get the support they’ve earned,” said Problem Solvers Caucus Co-Chair Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01). “The Problem Solvers are proud to support this effort—and we’ll continue championing bipartisan solutions that ensure our military families receive the care, respect, and commitment their service has earned.”

First figure out if you're in the West or East region.

Find a doctor in the West region

Find a doctor in the East region

You don't need a referral from a military doc, just find an in-network urologist in your region, call and make an appointment. Your health insurance card is your CAC and/or your SSN.

That said, you really need to go to the doctor more, at least to get an annual physical done. You might feel healthy now but you never know what a physical might catch, a lot of medical issues show no symptoms until they're severe, but easily treated if caught early. The copays are absurdly cheap and in my experience most clinics accept TRS.

You haven't been to the doctor and gotten an annual physical / check up? Or even gone to urgent care? If nothing else, I would highly recommend finding a primary family care doctor. Please get in the habit of preventative care.

Practically - you can go to your Tricare provider's website (mine is Triwest) and look up in network doctors. Or. start with the Tricare website and go from there. From there you can work out which hospitals / clinics / specialties are covered. I don't know if you need a referral for a urologist, but once you find out if they are in network you can call their office and find out.

But part of finding out who is in network will also let you know which urgent care / emergency room is in network so you don't need to stress about where you can go / who covers you when you actually need care in the moment.",,N,0.0,2025-07-14 16:56:16.176866

Charles Rhyee has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors that highlight Talkspace’s promising growth trajectory. The company is expected to achieve significant payor revenue growth, particularly with a 35% year-over-year increase, as it expands its Medicare and TRICARE contributions through 2025. Management has indicated that TRICARE is performing better than anticipated, benefiting from efficient marketing strategies and lower competition, which supports a positive outlook.

Furthermore, Talkspace’s strategic focus on enhancing utilization in the Payor segment is anticipated to yield returns on marketing investments in the latter half of 2025. The company has reaffirmed its revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance, with expectations of a stronger performance in the fourth quarter. This strategic positioning, along with the potential for revenue reacceleration, underpins Rhyee’s confidence in Talkspace’s future prospects, justifying the Buy rating.
