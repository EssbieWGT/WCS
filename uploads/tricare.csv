The military provides a continuum of care for service members and families who may face unique mental health challenges coping with daily life. This means the right resource is out there to match warfighters and families to the care they need.

“The wonderful thing in the Department of War is that we have a lot of different modalities, and so we can individualize treatment and find out what is going to work best for them,” said Navy Capt. (Dr.) Elle Marie Schollnberger, a psychiatrist and director of mental health for the Office of the Assistant Secretary of War for Health Services Policy and Oversight.

Personalized care can strengthen resilience and improve overall health, said Dr. Marjan Holloway a clinical psychologist and the director of the Suicide Care, Prevention, and Research initiative at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Maryland, adding that mental health care is “delivered in the context of what is the best evidence there is for the treatment that's being provided.”

Military Health System is there for you wherever and whenever you need help

Therapy can take many forms, such as nonmedical, toll-free advice, nurse advice lines, and lifestyle coaching to provide support and connect with professionals before issues become severe. Along the spectrum of care, support can include interactive mental therapy, medications, and hospitalization, if needed. The MHS Mental Health Hub provides information on resources that can be accessed around the world 24/7, and via telehealth.

The care and prevention components come together “such as that we all work as a team and do a better job in the context of suicide prevention,” Holloway said. “While sometimes, it is a one-on-one setting, there are people all around you that are willing to help, be they a barracks buddy, platoon leader, or a volunteer on a free 24/7 telephone line dedicated to helping military mental health.”

The aim of these efforts is to make military life fulfilling at a high level.

“Allow our mental health clinics and other professionals like Military and Family Life counselors, Military OneSource, and all those other support agencies to serve you and make you a better version of you,” said Air Force Tech. Sgt. Jacob Cote, a mental health flight chief at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in Washington, D.C.

To reach that better version, you have to give these military support programs “that chance,” Cote said. If you don’t feel comfortable with the first or second resource or program, “That’s OK, there are other resources service members can utilize, too.”

MHS mental health professionals emphasize a ready military force must be at its best physically and mentally to be most effective in action.

“The human weapon system is one of the most valuable systems that we have in the United States,” observed Air Force Tech. Sgt. Martina MooreTerry, also a mental health flight chief at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. “Mental health and readiness go hand in hand in the military.”

Mental health professionals are “ready to take care of that fight downrange, ready to take care of those individuals in their hardest and darkest of times,” she added.

“If an individual doesn’t take care of their mental health, and only focuses on the physical aspect — how can we expect them to go out and perform their duties, day in and day out? If one is not psychologically resilient, the DOW is at risk of failing, and readiness could be directly impacted,” concurred Cote.

Service members may find themselves hesitant to take the first step toward mental health support. “Being hesitant is normal. I cannot stress that enough,” said Cote. “It is OK to feel hesitant. It is OK to feel cautiously optimistic. It is OK to wonder if it will help you. Let us show you that it can and does work.”

According to Schollnberger, there are a variety of therapy types that can help. Individual therapies available at military clinics include cognitive behavioral therapy, prolonged exposure therapy, or psychoanalysis. There are also group therapies, which “can be very beneficial for individuals to have an understanding that they're not alone in what they're facing and really get support from the group,” she explained.

There are other ways to learn coping … we also have virtual therapy. So, for those folks in remote locations, we do have the ability to make sure they have access to therapy as well,” she noted.

Nonmedical resources are also available and are ideal to look at or consult with if a service member or family member thinks they may need mental health help, said Navy Cmdr. Stephanie Long, a clinical and medical psychologist, U.S. Navy director for psychological health.

“I think partially because when we think about mental health and mental health care, a lot of times we think straight to the clinic or the military treatment facility and the specialty mental health care that is there, but there are tons of other resources that can still provide care,” Long said. For example, she noted, are Military and Family Life counselors and chaplains who are often trained in pastoral care.

With Military and Family Life counselors, “they’re confidential to a point just like mental health, but they have the ability to meet you where you're at on base and do not document what is discussed,” Cote said. The first step can be to ”shop around, for example, living in the National Capital Region, there are tons of resources to best fit your needs,” Cote stressed.

He noted that mental health professionals are skilled at ""meeting you where you’re at on your mental health journey, coming to your level, and showing you that ‘I'm here for you while you are on this journey’ and that it is OK to not be OK.”

If you’re still unsure about which resources to try — or feeling emotional distress — Cote said “call your local mental health clinic. They will be able to help match you with the most appropriate resource.”

The new commercial off-the-shelf solution replaces a longstanding electronic health record system and introduces a more agile, mission-ready capability designed to support the realities of care in maritime and contested environments.

As one of the Navy’s earliest implementation sites, Carney will play a critical role in shaping the evolution of OpMed CDP across the fleet. Feedback from medical personnel and operational users will drive rapid refinement cycles and guide deployment strategy as the Navy scales a more resilient, data-driven approach to operational medicine.

OpMed CDP is engineered to provide care teams with a clear, real-time operating picture -streamlining documentation, integrating essential clinical data, sharpening decision making, and enabling health information to move seamlessly with the patient. These advances strengthen readiness and improve continuity of care in the dynamic scenarios faced by sailors and medical staff underway.

""The Navy operates in some of the most demanding environments in the world, and sailors deserve medical technology built for that mission,” said Igor Muravyov, Chief Operating Officer at T6 Health Systems. “The USS Carney’s deployment of OpMed CDP reflects the Department of War’s commitment to modernizing shipboard medicine and ensuring that warfighters have the most advanced technologies to enhance lethality of our forces everywhere.”

The deployment aboard Carney adds to a period of significant growth and momentum for T6 Health Systems. In recent weeks, T6’s technology has gone live at the White House, Brooke Army Medical Center and Al Dhafra Air Base - demonstrating the platform’s versatility across global operational and executive care environments. The company was also recently awarded a multi-year agreement with the Defense Health Agency and PEO DHMS to further configure its commercial offering as a secure, cloud-enabled capability supporting the next generation of operational medicine. These milestones underscore T6’s expanding role as a key technology partner in advancing modern, interoperable solutions across the Military Health System.

""Today, I once again voted against passage of the Republican’s National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). While I support several important components of this legislation, I could not in good conscience vote for the bill in its entirety. The FY26 NDAA authorizes over $890 billion in additional Pentagon spending. That is $8 billion more than the Pentagon itself said it needed. Our greatest security threats have no military solutions, and it is time our budget reflects that. We must instead make the investments in health care, education, housing, clean air and water, and public transit that Americans deserve.

“Further, this legislation removed House-passed provisions that would lead to In vitro fertilization (IVF) coverage under TRICARE and restore collective bargaining rights to civilian employees. I was also discouraged to see that the bill still discriminates against the transgender community. With this year’s illegal military strikes against innocent boats in the Caribbean, the last thing we need to do is give the Pentagon even more power.

""Although I opposed this bill, there were several bright spots, including a 3.8% pay raise for all service members, the repeal of the 1991 and 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), and a new requirement for military personnel to display the name of the military service they are affiliated with when supporting civilian law enforcement activities in our communities.

""Despite these important provisions, this legislation exacerbates an already over-bloated Pentagon budget and funds several defense policies which will not make people any safer. This is why I could not support its final passage.""

Washington, D.C. — Today, the House passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, Congresswoman Jen Kiggans (VA-02) secured a number of wins for military families, shipyard workers, and Hampton Roads.

The FY26 NDAA authorizes $900.6 billion for national defense discretionary programs, strengthening America’s military while saving taxpayers nearly $20 billion through targeted cuts to wasteful spending and bureaucracy. It fully carries out President Trump’s “Peace Through Strength” agenda by rebuilding readiness, revitalizing the defense industrial base, securing the border, and improving quality of life for servicemembers and their families.

“Today’s legislation is a major win for our Armed Forces and for the men and women who risk their lives every day for our freedom,” said Congresswoman Kiggans. “This NDAA makes our military more ready, more capable, and more lethal—while finally delivering the quality-of-life improvements our servicemembers and their families deserve.”

“As a Navy veteran, Navy spouse, and Navy mom, I am especially proud that this bill supports a 3.8% pay raise for our troops, invests over $1.5 billion in new housing, nearly $500 million in childcare centers, and more than $335 million to improve military hospitals and clinics,” Kiggans continued. “It strengthens TRICARE, improves mental health access, boosts childcare assistance, and helps military kids succeed in school.”

“This NDAA also delivers on our commitment to ‘Peace Through Strength’ by investing $26 billion in shipbuilding; over $25 billion to rebuild our munitions stockpiles; and more than $145 billion in cutting-edge research and development—including hypersonics, AI, unmanned systems, and new space capabilities,” she added. “It removes China from our supply chains, supports Israel’s security, secures our southern border, and makes sure our allies pay more for their own defense.”

“I came to Congress on a mission to rebuild our Navy, revitalize our shipyards, and take care of our all-volunteer force,” Kiggans concluded. “This bill moves us decisively in that direction. It strengthens our industrial base, advances American shipbuilding, and improves day-to-day life for our servicemembers and their families—especially those stationed in Hampton Roads and across coastal Virginia. As a third-generation veteran, I will always be the loudest voice for our military men and women in Congress.”

Authorizes $900.6 billion in total national defense discretionary spending while saving nearly $20 billion through targeted cuts to wasteful climate programs, duplicative bureaucracy, inefficient contracts, and obsolete platforms.

Codifies all or parts of 15 of President Trump’s national security executive orders—including those restoring America’s fighting force, ending wasteful DEI programs, securing the border, modernizing defense acquisitions, deploying advanced nuclear energy, and unleashing American drone dominance.

Fully supports President Trump’s priority programs, including the Golden Dome missile defense initiative, next-generation fighter aircraft, submarines, warships, advanced munitions, and autonomous systems.

Improving Quality of Life for Servicemembers and Civilian Mariners

Supports a 3.8% pay raise for all servicemembers, reauthorizes and expands bonuses and special pays, increases Family Separation Allowance, and expands convalescent leave.

Authorizes over $1.5 billion for new construction of barracks and family housing, requires a plan to meet health and safety obligations in military housing, and strengthens oversight of privatized housing providers.

Authorizes more than $335 million to renovate military hospitals and build new medical facilities, prevents reductions in uniformed medical billets, improves specialty-care travel reimbursement (lowering the mileage threshold from 100 to 75 miles), and expands cooperation with civilian healthcare systems.

Authorizes over $491 million to design and build new childcare centers, extends the Child Care in Your Home pilot, and starts a pilot to increase childcare assistance in high-cost areas.

Invests more than $206 million to build new schools for military children, protects DoD schools from sudden closure, expands Impact Aid (including an additional $20 million for schools serving children with severe disabilities), allows Guard and Reserve families to enroll in DoD schools when activated, and permits schools to limit or ban student cell phone use.

Strengthens the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) by allowing retiring servicemembers to immediately move into careers in the defense industrial base and medical professions, establishing a spouse-focused transition pilot, and improving metrics to ensure servicemembers get timely access to resources.

Enhances military recruiting by extending enlistment bonuses, requiring uniform medical accession standards, improving recruiter access to schools, expanding JROTC units, and authorizing bonuses for hard-to-fill JROTC instructor positions.

Strengthens the Military Sealift Command workforce by eliminating pay caps for civil-service mariners and expanding commissary and MWR access, improving retention and supporting the readiness of the Navy’s global logistics fleet.

Strengthening Shipbuilding, Readiness & the Defense Industrial Base

Invests over $25 billion to rebuild U.S. munitions stockpiles, including procurement of precision strike missiles, JAGMs, Naval Strike Missiles, Javelins, Stingers, Tomahawks, GMLRS, AMRAAMs, LRASMs, advanced anti-radiation missiles, JDAMs, MK-48 torpedoes, and artillery rounds.

Authorizes more than $145.7 billion for research, development, testing, and evaluation—including hypersonics, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, autonomous platforms, directed-energy systems, and space-based capabilities.

Expands the use of the Defense Industrial Base Fund to invest in critical mineral mining and refining, demands multi-year procurement for high-demand munitions, and directs DoD to streamline qualification of advanced manufacturing methods like 3D printing.

Requires DoD to identify and remove regulatory barriers that discourage maintaining surge capacity, creates new forums to tackle parts obsolescence and supply-chain fragility, and launches a program to mature robotic automation for munitions manufacturing.

Strengthens the maritime and shipyard industrial base through military construction reforms—allowing accelerated and progressive design-build, expanded use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA) for complex projects, and enhanced Navy contracting flexibility for major shipyard modernization efforts.

Reforming Acquisition to Deliver for the Warfighter

Implements major elements of the “SPEED Act” to streamline acquisitions, creating a new accelerated requirements process focused on rapid, innovative solutions instead of slow, bespoke systems.

Centralizes program management under a portfolio acquisition executive to speed decisions, and requires early life-cycle sustainment planning to avoid long-term readiness gaps.

Puts commercial solutions first by requiring DoD to look to commercial off-the-shelf capabilities before launching expensive new development programs, removing burdensome compliance requirements for small businesses, and easing use of subscription services like commercial satellites.

Establishes the BOOST program within the Defense Innovation Unit to bridge the “Valley of Death” and transition promising technologies into operational use.

Modernizes Cost Accounting Standards implementation, eases regulatory burdens on smaller programs, and strengthens the acquisition workforce through improved training, public-private exchanges, and new pathways from the Defense Civilian Training Corps into civil service.

Ready, Capable, and Lethal Fighting Force

Improves readiness by mandating at least 90 days’ worth of F-35 parts by FY2028, ensuring amphibious ships receive a fair share of maintenance funding, investing in depot and arsenal capacity, and launching AI pilots to improve ground-vehicle maintenance.

Protects critical capabilities by prohibiting retirement of key aircraft fleets, accelerating Virginia-class submarine construction, and providing multi-year procurement authority for UH-60 Blackhawks.

Enhances force protection and counter-drone authorities, establishes a new interagency task force to coordinate counter-UAS efforts, and strengthens protection of nuclear facilities from unmanned aerial threats.

Advances energy independence on military installations by codifying President Trump’s advanced nuclear energy initiatives, directing a program of record for military micro-reactors, and requiring a Navy pilot for small modular or mobile reactors.

“No woman should feel unsafe receiving medical care, especially during sensitive and private health services. Yet, far too many survivors have come forward with their experiences of alleged exploitation and abuse by a doctor who reportedly violated not just the basic principles of medical care and human decency, but also the expected conduct of a U.S. Army officer and physician,” said Senator Hirono. “The Department of Defense and U.S. Army must take accountability for their failure to rapidly respond to servicemembers and patient complaints. While nothing can reverse the harm reported by patients, a comprehensive investigation into this alleged misconduct, resulting in stronger protections for patients, is necessary to ensure that no one experiences abuse by our military health system again.”

In their letter, the lawmakers expressed their outrage over Army leadership’s inaction despite numerous complaints from servicemembers and their families that Dr. McGraw had sexually exploited patients in his care for years. They also explained some of the unconscionable abuses women experienced, including details from the story of Jane Doe.

The lawmakers shared how the Army ignored Jane Doe’s attempts to report her abuse:

“After reportedly being assaulted during a patient visit with Dr. McGraw, Jane Doe said she begged a desk attendant to make a report. Instead, she was told to ‘call or send an email.’ Jane Doe alleges she called the hospital seven different times but she was dismissed and hung up on each time. The purported lack of response and urgency to respond to these complaints would clearly violate reporting policy and the Army’s Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Program protocols.”

They also expressed deep concern in their letter that this abuse is part of a recurring pattern of the Army failing to intervene in reports and cases of sexual misconduct:

“In the lawsuit, female servicemembers and patients noted that a recurring issue was the lack of adequate response from Army leadership. Reportedly, when victims and their loved ones tried to make complaints with Army leadership, they were ‘refused meetings at every level.’ If true, these women deserve better. The alleged dismissive response from the Army demonstrates an immense failure at every level to properly support survivors.”

The members and senators concluded the letter by demanding a full investigation from the DOD Inspector General, explanations on how complaints were handled, and stronger protections to ensure no patient faces this abuse again:

“The allegations against Dr. McGraw are extremely serious, and the Army’s criminal investigation of this matter must continue unabated. That said, the separate concerns raised by survivors about members of the Army at many levels not timely acting on their complaints must be confronted immediately. Additionally, we request that DoD IG investigate to determine whether personnel within the Army properly followed procedures to timely report allegations of sexual misconduct to law enforcement and whether other SAPR procedures and existing protections were followed or not.”

Last week, Senator Hirono and the Hawaii Congressional delegation also sent a letter calling on the DOD to thoroughly investigate every complaint against McGraw and the Army’s own failures in allowing his alleged misconduct to persist.

In addition to Senator Hirono and Representatives Houlahan, Tokuda, Barragan, Trahan, Escobar, and Garcia, the letter was also signed by Senators Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Representatives Joyce Beatty (D-OH), Julia Brownley (D-CA), Nikki Budzinski (D-IL), Andre Carson (D-IN), Judy Chu (D-CA), Maxine Dexter (D-OR), Debbie Dingell (D-MI), Sarah Elfreth (D-MD), Lizzie Fletcher (D-TX), Valerie Foushee (D-NC), Lois Frankel (D-FL), Laura Friedman (D-CA), Robert Garcia (D-CA), Adelita Grijalva (D-AZ), Val Hoyle (D-OR), Jonathan Jackson (D-IL), Sara Jacobs (D-CA), Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), Julie Johnson (D-TX), Timothy Kennedy (D-NY), Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-NM), Lucy McBath (D-GA), Sarah McBride (D-DE), Betty McCollum (D-MN), James McGovern (D-MA), LaMonica McIver (D-NJ), Gwen Moore (D-WI), Kelly Morrison (D-MN), Seth Moulton (D-MA), Eleanor Norton (D-DC), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Nellie Pou (D-NJ), Delia Ramirez (D-IL), Emily Randall (D-WA), Deborah Ross (D-NC), Andrea Salinas (D-OR), Janice Schakowsky (D-IL), Lateefah Simon (D-CA), Melanie Stansbury (D-NM), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Norma Torres (D-CA), Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), Nikema Williams (D-GA), and Frederica Wilson (D-FL).

The full text of the letter is available here and below.

Dear Mr. Stebbins:

We write to express our strong concerns about the Army’s purported failure to timely intervene in the alleged misconduct of Dr. Major Blaine McGraw at Fort Hood and Tripler Army Medical Center, allegations, which if true, would possibly constitute the largest sexual misconduct case in U.S. military history. According to reports, for years, Dr. McGraw allegedly sexually exploited women, including servicewomen and military wives, in his care. When these women attempted to report their concerns and experiences were purportedly repeatedly ignored and Dr. McGraw was kept on staff. The Army, like the other Services, has a history of failing to adequately address sexual misconduct in the ranks, which required Congress to step in and institute hundreds of reforms over the last fifteen years, culminating in the establishment of the Office of the Special Trial Counsel in the FY22 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). One of those issues involved military services being slow to intervene in cases at an early stage. This appears to have happened in this case since Dr. McGraw was not suspended until this October. This delayed response is unacceptable, and we need answers. Separate, and not to interfere with the ongoing Army criminal investigation into the alleged misconduct of Dr. McGraw, we request the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General review if appropriate Military Health System policies were followed, to include whether patient complaints were timely evaluated and considered, and provide recommendations to the Defense Health Agency (DHA) to prevent further instances like this from occurring in the future.

This month over 80 women joined a lawsuit together alleging that Dr. McGraw made lewd sexual advances and comments towards them, as well as secretly recorded patients during exams. One example of the women’s horrific experiences is captured through Jane Doe’s story. After reportedly being assaulted during a patient visit with Dr. McGraw, Jane Doe said she begged a desk attendant to make a report. Instead, she was told to “call or send an email.” Jane Doe alleges she called the hospital seven different times but she was dismissed and hung up on each time. The purported lack of response and urgency to respond to these complaints would clearly violate reporting policy and the Army’s Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Program protocols.

In the lawsuit, female servicemembers and patients noted that a recurring issue was the lack of adequate response from Army leadership. Reportedly, when victims and their loved ones tried to make complaints with Army leadership, they were “refused meetings at every level.” If true, these women deserve better. The alleged dismissive response from the Army demonstrates an immense failure at every level to properly support survivors.

The allegations against Dr. McGraw, and the Army’s purported failure to timely address survivor complaints, are not isolated. A separate investigation deemed Fort Hood as a notoriously “permissive environment” for sexual harassment and assault. The base has been plagued by this issue for years. For example, in 2020, Army Specialist Vanessa Guillén was murdered by a fellow soldier while stationed at Fort Hood. Throughout her time on base, Specialist Guillén was sexually harassed by a separate supervisor. Specialist Guillén’s tragic murder was the impetus for the aforementioned changes in the FY22 NDAA. However, even with these positive reforms, it is clear more needs to be done. The fact that this reported abuse occurred at the same base as Specialist Guillen’s murder is appalling. All women should be safe on a military base, and they surely should be able to safely seek treatment without fear of sexual assault or abuse.

The allegations against Dr. McGraw are extremely serious, and the Army’s criminal investigation of this matter must continue unabated. That said, the separate concerns raised by survivors about members of the Army at many levels not timely acting on their complaints must be confronted immediately. Additionally, we request that DoD IG investigate to determine whether personnel within the Army properly followed procedures to timely report allegations of sexual misconduct to law enforcement and whether other SAPR procedures and existing protections were followed or not. We therefore request a response to the following questions from the Defense Health Agency and the Inspector General within 60 days of receipt:

Please provide the range of dates for the sexual harassment/assault complaints filed, including the number of complaints received at Fort Hood and Tripler Army Medical Center relating to Dr. McGraw.

What was the Military Treatment Facility management’s response to each complaint at Fort Hood and Tripler Army Medical Center?

How did the Military Treatment Facility management at Fort Hood and Tripler Army Medical Center follow appropriate policies to supervise staff, prevent patient harm, and address patient complaints?

What are the next steps the Military Treatment Facility management at Fort Hood and Tripler Army Medical Center will take to further protect patients from sexual assault?

How will the Defense Health Agency ensure that no Military Treatment Facility will ignore sexual abuse allegations again?

How will the Defense Health Agency prevent future concealment and employment of sexual abusers on their staff across Military Treatment Facilities?

Was a quality assurance investigation initiated? If so, please share the status with the House Armed Services Committee.

Why did the Army fail to take disciplinary actions against Dr. McGraw until his October 2025 suspension?

We are committed to demanding justice for victims of sexual assault and harassment, and we will not stay silent while the safety of women is at risk. Again, we request prompt and thorough answers to these questions to prevent further harm and hold those responsible for this accountable.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this request.

Sincerely,

Read the full article here.

This research addresses a critical gap in understanding treatment pathways for musculoskeletal shoulder conditions—one of the most frequent causes of pain and disability among active-duty service members and veterans. By analyzing longitudinal data from the Military Health System, the team identified patterns in healthcare utilization, including diagnostic imaging, physical therapy, surgical interventions, and medication use.

""Our findings provide a clearer picture of how care is delivered for shoulder disorders in a large, integrated health system. This knowledge is essential for identifying opportunities to improve efficiency and ensure patients receive the right care at the right time,"" said Steven Z. George, PT, PhD, professor in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Duke.

Key Findings:

Shoulder disorders represent a significant burden in military populations, often requiring multi-modal care.

Utilization patterns varied based on diagnosis type, patient demographics, and care setting.

The study highlights opportunities to optimize care delivery, reduce unnecessary interventions, and improve outcomes.

Why It Matters:

Musculoskeletal injuries are among the leading causes of limited duty and medical discharge in the military. Understanding how patients navigate care systems can inform evidence-based guidelines, improve resource allocation, and enhance patient-centered care for both military and civilian populations.

""By examining real-world data from the Military Health System, we can better understand treatment patterns and identify gaps in care. These insights are critical for developing strategies that improve outcomes and reduce unnecessary costs,"" said Maggie E. Horn, PT, DPT, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Duke.

The House passed a defense authorization bill Dec. 10 without a provision to allow health care coverage of in vitro fertilization for active-duty military.

Pro-life groups cheered the provision’s removal from the bill. The original bill would have required Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to “ensure that fertility-related care for a member of the uniformed services on active duty (or a dependent of such a member) shall be covered under TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select.” Tricare does not cover IVF.

The House passed the bill (S. 1071) by a vote of 312-112, and Senate consideration is next.

Like last year, the IVF provision was eliminated from the defense authorization bill shortly before its consideration. President Donald Trump had made a campaign promise to make IVF free.

A spokesperson for House Speaker Mike Johnson told CNA in a statement that “President Trump and Congressional Republicans have been working to lower costs and expand access to IVF.”

“The Speaker has clearly and repeatedly stated he is supportive of access to IVF when sufficient pro-life protections are in place, and he will continue to be supportive when it is done responsibly and ethically,” the spokesperson said.

Live Action President Lila Rose praised Johnson for “ensuring TRICARE was not used to subsidize this destruction of life.”

“Students for Life has opposed IVF as practiced, as it's a business model that by design, destroys far more lives than are allowed to live and thrive,” Students for Life Vice President Kristy Hamrick told CNA in a statement responding to Speaker Mike Johnson’s move to strip the bill of IVF provisions. “The move to pull the funding for IVF will free up resources to seek better answers,” she said.

“Unquestioning financial support props up an industry known to prey on people's hopes for a child while ending many lives. We need to seek better answers for the question of how to help people have families than to assume that IVF is the solution,” she said. “We can do better.”

The Advancing American Freedom Foundation, which is led by former Vice President Mike Pence, posted a memo on X stating “many pro-life Americans are opposed to IVF because the standard process destroys human embryos.”

Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council reacted to news that IVF would be cut from the bill by praising Johnson, and said in a post on X: “The Speaker is right to put the pause on IVF funding in the Defense spending bill.”

“The IVF industry operates with little, if any, oversight, which has led to the creation and destruction of tens of thousands of so-called ‘excess’ embryos,” he said. “There are other pro-life options. Taxpayers' dollars should fund fertility methods that respect human dignity, treat the underlying causes of infertility, AND are successful—like Restorative Reproductive Medicine.”",https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/images/invitrofertilization022025.jpg?jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-11 07:57:07.149522

Veterans will be forced to navigate a perfect storm – an understaffed VA health care system, increased wait times for VA health care, Medicaid cuts, and the loss of affordable health insurance.
So do millions of Americans who will be impacted by the potential failure to extend these tax credits.
Veterans will be forced to navigate a perfect storm - an understaffed VA health care system, increased wait times for VA health care, Medicaid cuts, and the loss of affordable health insurance.

Recent analysis found 267,000 veterans who rely on the ACA enhanced premium tax credits will no longer be able to afford ACA marketplace coverage if these credits are not extended.

Blumenthal pressed the urgency of addressing this issue ahead of a vote tomorrow on a Democratic proposal to extend ACA enhanced premium tax credits for three years before they expire at the end of the year: “…[W]e have to recognize the importance of votes that we will take tomorrow, one of them to extend the health care tax credits under the Affordable Care Act that will affect literally 267,000 veterans who rely on the ACA enhanced premium tax credits to afford health insurance. And whether you support the ACA, whether you have other views on what might be a perfect system in the long run if we had tons of time, the simple fact is we face a deadline at the end of the year when these tax credits will expire and 267,000 veterans will no longer be able to afford ACA coverage if these credits are not extended.”

The Senator continued, “These are primarily veterans not eligible for Medicaid, TRICARE, or Medicare, and often not eligible to get care through VA – leaving them with ACA marketplace plans as their only option for health care coverage. The ACA isn’t perfect… but the fact of the matter is the consequences of failing to extend these tax credits will be devastating for veterans and their families. Veterans will be forced to navigate a perfect storm – an understaffed VA health care system, increased wait times for VA health care, Medicaid cuts, and the loss of affordable health insurance. They deserve better. So do millions of Americans who will be impacted by the potential failure to extend these tax credits. I hope that we approve them to the benefit of those veterans and countless other Americans affected.”

Veterans who benefit from ACA tax credits are primarily those not eligible for Medicaid, TRICARE, or Medicare, or who are not eligible to get some or all of their health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). In addition, 1.6 million veterans and four million family members of veterans utilize Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and are at risk of losing Medicaid or CHIP coverage because of the “Big Beautiful Bill.” One in ten veterans under the age of 65 rely on Medicaid, and forty percent of these veterans rely on Medicaid as their sole coverage.

Republicans have thus far refused to work with Democrats to extend the enhanced premium tax credits that have helped millions of Americans afford health insurance. Now, tens of millions of Americans across the country are staring down increased health insurance rates that are set to double and even triple their monthly premiums. Coupled with Republicans’ Medicare and Medicaid cuts that go into effect next year, Americans, including millions of veterans, are bracing for higher costs and a looming health care crisis.

Video of Blumenthal’s opening statement is available here and the full text is copied below.

Senator Blumenthal: Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity to hear testimony on some very important bipartisan legislation today. But, before we begin, I think we have to recognize the importance of votes that we will take tomorrow, one of them to extend the health care tax credits under the Affordable Care Act that will affect literally 267,000 veterans who rely on the ACA enhanced premium tax credits to afford health insurance. And whether you support the ACA, whether you have other views on what might be a perfect system in the long run if we had tons of time, the simple fact is we face a deadline at the end of the year when these tax credits will expire and 267,000 veterans will no longer be able to afford ACA coverage if these credits are not extended.

These are primarily veterans not eligible for Medicaid, TRICARE, or Medicare, and often not eligible to get care through VA – leaving them with ACA marketplace plans as their only option for health care coverage. The ACA isn’t perfect. We need to lower the costs of health care generally. We need to work on reforms, and we need to eliminate any fraud that exists in these programs, but the fact of the matter is the consequences of failing to extend these tax credits will be devastating for veterans and their families. Veterans will be forced to navigate a perfect storm - an understaffed VA health care system, increased wait times for VA health care, Medicaid cuts, and the loss of affordable health insurance. They deserve better. So do millions of Americans who will be impacted by the potential failure to extend these tax credits. I hope that we approve them to the benefit of those veterans and countless other Americans affected.

On the legislation today, I particularly want to thank Mr. Stichman for his work, alongside the Yale Veterans Legal Services Clinic, to improve how federal appellate courts process VA appeals.

I’ve worked with the Yale Veterans Legal Services Clinic over the years, and I know how important their work is generally. The Veterans Appeals Efficiency Act, which I co-lead with Senator Banks, is one of many bills that we’re here to discuss. And I will be supporting many, if not all of them. For example, the Molly Loomis Act which would build on the promise of the PACT Act by exploring health conditions prevalent among descendants of veterans who were exposed to toxic substances during their service. And we have to confront, as well, the painful legacy of discrimination. The Commission on Equity and Reconciliation in the Uniformed Services Act would investigate the harm done to LGBTQ+ servicemembers and veterans, many of whom received punitive discharges, and were forced to hide their identities and ultimately denied benefits.

These measures are not partisan. This Committee generally is not partisan. And I welcome the support of my Republican colleagues for many of these important measures that we hopefully will advance after today’s hearing.

Mental health professionals are not immune to the pressures associated with deployments or their care of service members and their families. Many specialists put their own advice into practice, seeking support when faced with mental health challenges.

One of the most important first steps they can take is finding someone to help ease the load. That’s the advice of Navy Cmdr. Stephanie Long, a clinical and medical psychologist who is the director for psychological health for the U.S. Navy.

Long said she found it challenging to reconnect with her family after a deployment to Joint Task Force Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. She and her spouse discovered couples’ counseling through their local Fleet and Family Service Center that combined with resources for their toddler.

The couples’ counseling “made such a difference, because I knew what I wanted, and I knew that it was important for me to reconnect. I just didn't know exactly how to do that,” Long said. “Just a little bit ironic, given what I do, but we all need help sometimes.”

Therapy helps resolve bad experiences

Long praised her experience seeking support. “Therapy can be so helpful for folks, whether they're struggling with relationships, anxiety, depression, or trauma-related symptoms. In some ways, it forces us to confront our problems.”

“Most of us want to compartmentalize our issues. We don't want to think about our negative past experiences and problems. We want to distract ourselves or focus on career or something else,” Long said. “Therapy gives us that dedicated time and space to talk through something, to gain that awareness, that insight.”

Therapy can identify what is contributing to a mental health challenge. “Having someone guide that process helps,” said Long. “We do it together because it's not easy to figure it out on our own.”

“I think focusing efforts on strengthening true connections, and having service members supporting others can go a long way,” she said.

“I’ve seen mental health (counselors) … it’s not a secret and I’m wildly open about it,” said Air Force Tech. Sgt. Jacob Cote, a mental health flight chief at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in Washington, D.C., noting that he sought care through military family life counselors and Military OneSource.

Mental health professionals are “not perfect. We all feel overwhelmed?” Cote said. “Seeking these resources has been beneficial in that I can treat my patients better now.”

Long said her own success with counseling could parallel with anyone who needs support — wherever they are in their mental health journey.

“Connection with others — true, deep, meaningful connection with others — that’s one of the things that can draw people to the service,” she said.

Long said fears of losing security clearances, not promoting, or separation from the military may hinder a service member from seeking help. However, a study from 2021 to 2023 by the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency found barely 1/100th of 1% of cases resulted in security denials or revocations were due to psychological health and additional conditions.

In fact, DCSA said seeking support leads to recovery and is more likely to enhance a military career than harm it, because of the openness demonstrated by the applicant in the process.

Get help early to boost recovery

Unfortunately, some people don't seek help until they're in crisis mode, which can make recovery harder. “Not impossible,” Long said. “But it requires so much more work to intervene later versus earlier.”

“Getting help early is critical and connecting with someone is such an important protective factor against suicide,” Long said. “There's so much more opportunity to get to work on something, to improve before it becomes a crisis.”

The MHS Mental Health Hub provides a comprehensive listing of mental health services available throughout the MHS. This includes options to seek care, tips from experts, and in-depth information on a variety of resources. You can connect directly to mental health support services near you with one click.

Targeted Care. This new process connects you to the specific type of care you need after an initial evaluation — and can be an individual appointment, in-person group therapy or virtual group therapy. Targeted care is now available at many military mental health clinics.

TRICARE covered mental health services are available through its worldwide network of civilian providers. To set up a mental health appointment through TRICARE, visit the mental health doctors and appointments page.

Virtual care: The Defense Health Agency continues to expand mental health services available to service members at remote installations. One example is BRAVE, the DHA’s Behavioral Health Resources and Virtual Experience, provides tele-mental health services at 84 locations around the world by connecting service members with counselors through virtual sessions.

inTransition is a confidential program that offers specialized coaching and assistance for active duty service members, National Guard and Reserve members, veterans, and retirees, who are receiving mental health or traumatic brain injury care and experiencing disruption in their lives, like a PCS (permanent change of station) move, separation, or retirement.

The Real Warriors Campaign, a Department of War public health initiative, strives to decrease stigma, increase psychological health literacy, and encourage early mental health help-seeking behaviors in the military community.

The Warrior Care Recovery Coordination Program, executed by the three branches of service, provides holistic care to wounded, ill, or injured service members and their families and caregivers. Recovery Care Coordinators serve as a guide through recovery, rehabilitation, and transition or reintegration by facilitating a comprehensive recovery plan. This plan covers needs associated with daily living, career, family, finances, health, legal, military issues, and spirituality.

The Brandon Act is a law that empowers service members to receive the help they need by seeking a referral for a mental health evaluation through their commander or supervisor. This guidance helps with the process. The purpose of the Brandon Act is to reduce the stigma associated with mental health.

Military OneSource. Service members and their families can also receive referrals to nonmedical support such as a chaplain, financial advisor, or a military family life counselor through Military OneSource, a one-stop 24/7 gateway to trusted resources, information, and confidential help. Call 800-342-9647. Military OneSource can also help with referrals such as the impact of a parent on deployment to a child’s health and happiness, or a substance abuse issue.

The military provides a continuum of care for service members and families who may face unique mental health challenges coping with daily life. This means the right resource is out there to match warfighters and families to the care they need.

“The wonderful thing in the Department of War is that we have a lot of different modalities, and so we can individualize treatment and find out what is going to work best for them,” said Navy Capt. (Dr.) Elle Marie Schollnberger, a psychiatrist and director of mental health for the Office of the Assistant Secretary of War for Health Services Policy and Oversight.

Personalized care can strengthen resilience and improve overall health, said Dr. Marjan Holloway a clinical psychologist and the director of the Suicide Care, Prevention, and Research initiative at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Maryland, adding that mental health care is “delivered in the context of what is the best evidence there is for the treatment that's being provided.”

Military Health System is there for you wherever and whenever you need help

Therapy can take many forms, such as nonmedical, toll-free advice, nurse advice lines, and lifestyle coaching to provide support and connect with professionals before issues become severe. Along the spectrum of care, support can include interactive mental therapy, medications, and hospitalization, if needed. The MHS Mental Health Hub provides information on resources that can be accessed around the world 24/7, and via telehealth.

The care and prevention components come together “such as that we all work as a team and do a better job in the context of suicide prevention,” Holloway said. “While sometimes, it is a one-on-one setting, there are people all around you that are willing to help, be they a barracks buddy, platoon leader, or a volunteer on a free 24/7 telephone line dedicated to helping military mental health.”

The aim of these efforts is to make military life fulfilling at a high level.

“Allow our mental health clinics and other professionals like Military and Family Life counselors, Military OneSource, and all those other support agencies to serve you and make you a better version of you,” said Air Force Tech. Sgt. Jacob Cote, a mental health flight chief at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in Washington, D.C.

To reach that better version, you have to give these military support programs “that chance,” Cote said. If you don’t feel comfortable with the first or second resource or program, “That’s OK, there are other resources service members can utilize, too.”

MHS mental health professionals emphasize a ready military force must be at its best physically and mentally to be most effective in action.

“The human weapon system is one of the most valuable systems that we have in the United States,” observed Air Force Tech. Sgt. Martina MooreTerry, also a mental health flight chief at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. “Mental health and readiness go hand in hand in the military.”

Mental health professionals are “ready to take care of that fight downrange, ready to take care of those individuals in their hardest and darkest of times,” she added.

“If an individual doesn’t take care of their mental health, and only focuses on the physical aspect — how can we expect them to go out and perform their duties, day in and day out? If one is not psychologically resilient, the DOW is at risk of failing, and readiness could be directly impacted,” concurred Cote.

Service members may find themselves hesitant to take the first step toward mental health support. “Being hesitant is normal. I cannot stress that enough,” said Cote. “It is OK to feel hesitant. It is OK to feel cautiously optimistic. It is OK to wonder if it will help you. Let us show you that it can and does work.”

According to Schollnberger, there are a variety of therapy types that can help. Individual therapies available at military clinics include cognitive behavioral therapy, prolonged exposure therapy, or psychoanalysis. There are also group therapies, which “can be very beneficial for individuals to have an understanding that they're not alone in what they're facing and really get support from the group,” she explained.

There are other ways to learn coping … we also have virtual therapy. So, for those folks in remote locations, we do have the ability to make sure they have access to therapy as well,” she noted.

Nonmedical resources are also available and are ideal to look at or consult with if a service member or family member thinks they may need mental health help, said Navy Cmdr. Stephanie Long, a clinical and medical psychologist, U.S. Navy director for psychological health.

“I think partially because when we think about mental health and mental health care, a lot of times we think straight to the clinic or the military treatment facility and the specialty mental health care that is there, but there are tons of other resources that can still provide care,” Long said. For example, she noted, are Military and Family Life counselors and chaplains who are often trained in pastoral care.

With Military and Family Life counselors, “they’re confidential to a point just like mental health, but they have the ability to meet you where you're at on base and do not document what is discussed,” Cote said. The first step can be to ”shop around, for example, living in the National Capital Region, there are tons of resources to best fit your needs,” Cote stressed.

He noted that mental health professionals are skilled at ""meeting you where you’re at on your mental health journey, coming to your level, and showing you that ‘I'm here for you while you are on this journey’ and that it is OK to not be OK.”

If you’re still unsure about which resources to try — or feeling emotional distress — Cote said “call your local mental health clinic. They will be able to help match you with the most appropriate resource.”

“Our National Guard members put their lives on hold to serve and protect our state,” said state Senator Veronica Klinefelt (D-Eastpointe).","LANSING, Mich. — Today, Governor Whitmer signed Senate Bills 370, 540, and 542.

Evidence-based medical standards help ensure that service members can perform their duties effectively and safely — directly contributing to mission success.","2025 marks the 30th anniversary of the Medical Standards Analytics and Research program, the Department of War's premier analytical capability, providing policymakers with actionable data to shape evidence-based medical standards and support military health and performance.

In 1995, the U.S. Army Surgeon General established the Accession Medical Standards Analysis and Research Activity to improve the health, readiness, and resilience of service members by transforming complex data into actionable insights to guide policy. With its mission expanded, it is now known as the Medical Standards Analytics and Research program, or MSAR, and is housed in the Statistics and Epidemiology branch at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. The program continues to deliver science-based recommendations to optimize recruitment and retention and enhance warfighter readiness.

“The standards for accession into the U.S. military are high, uncompromising, and clear,” wrote Secretary of War Pete Hegseth in an April 2025 memo emphasizing that “Young Americans seeking to serve in the greatest fighting force in history must be physically and mentally capable of performing their duties in the harshest conditions.”

Data-driven support for these rigorous standards makes MSAR’s key capabilities even more imperative, as MSAR generates knowledge products tracking that service members are physically and medically fit to meet the demands of military service.

With physicians, epidemiologists, statisticians, and data analysts at the helm, MSAR oversees large-scale epidemiological analyses, predictive modeling, and biostatistical assessments to evaluate medical standards by examining the impact of medical conditions, occupational exposures, diseases, and injuries on military service.

""MSAR's core mission is to validate, standardize, analyze, and transform complex data into actionable insights,” said Dr. Natalya Weber, director of the WRAIR’s Statistics and Epidemiology branch and chief of MSAR. “Our work empowers leaders to make informed decisions regarding medical standards, recruitment, and warfighter health and readiness.”

Over the last 30 years, the team has generated dozens of reports, above 60 peer-reviewed journal publications, and countless other products to provide valuable insights into medical readiness, adverse attrition, and disability evaluations.

Guided by the Offices of the Assistant Secretary of War for Health Affairs, Health Services Policy and Oversight, and Under Secretary of War for Personnel and Readiness Military Personnel Policy, MSAR provides continuous data-driven assessments, evaluating the rigorousness of medical standards and service-specific waiver decisions. The offices oversee data provision to MSAR and direct the depth and breadth of its programmatic tasking. This is just one example of leadership’s dedicated efforts to foster a data-driven culture across the department, which helps inform decisions at all levels.

“The MSAR focus is on ensuring that we fulfill our mission with precision and uphold the highest standards of data integrity,” said Caitlin Rushin, deputy chief of MSAR. “We ensure that our analytic datasets are accurate, actionable, and expertly analyzed to provide the insights necessary for informed decision-making.”

Evidence-based medical standards make sure service members can perform their duties effectively and safely — directly contributing to mission success. By proactively enforcing clear medical standards, the DOW reduces long-term health care costs, optimizes personnel availability, and supports veteran care.

For 30 years, MSAR has provided critical epidemiologic and analytic support to the Accession and Retention Medical Standards Working Group, providing numerous analyses detailing accession, waiver, disqualification, retention, and disability evaluation trends. The team’s systematic generation of critical data metrics and comparative analyses has allowed the working group to address medical readiness more efficiently and adjust when needed. This approach maximizes cost benefits, workload, and time, all while advancing readiness.

“MSAR’s value isn’t just in describing medical trends, but in predicting potential challenges to warfighter readiness,” said Army Maj. Jared Egbert, the associate director of WRAIR’s Statistics and Epidemiology branch and associate chief of MSAR. “Ultimately, our work ensures policy isn't reactive, but anticipatory, safeguarding our nation’s fighting strength.”

Notably, MSAR follows service members who enter service with medical waivers to examine their attrition, deployability, and health care utilization in comparison with those fully medically qualified. MSAR also identifies medical conditions that are most often waived, rarely approved, or frequently associated with high attrition and cost. These important indicators keep senior leaders informed regarding where policies might need to change and estimate impact of the changes.

The data collected directly informs the DOW’s medical standards policies, particularly DoDI 6130.03 Volumes 1 and 2 which are instrumental for maintaining a strong and lethal military. By identifying these trends, the MSAR team improves efficiency and saves time, money, and effort in the recruitment and medical screening process.

Accession and retention medical standards ensure service members can perform their duties without posing undue risk to themselves or others. These standards provide clear guidance for military health care providers, line officers, and other officials to determine whether a service member can continue service.

Without standards, the consequences could be dire.

“Without solid accession and retention medical standards, we would have a military that is likely not medically ready to perform routine service duties and support our nation in the event of a conflict,” said Tim Powers, MSAR’s senior statistician.

With a focus on readiness, MSAR continuously reevaluates standards and concludes that Service Medical Waiver Review Authorities strike an appropriate balance between managing adverse attrition and meeting the unique needs of each service. MSAR findings validate the effectiveness of its data-driven approach, confirming that medical standards are upheld to align with dynamic operational requirements and applied within the established evidence-based framework.

Darnall Army Medical Center on Tuesday, the same day military prosecutors preferred four charges and 61 specifications against Maj. Blaine McGraw, an OBGYN assigned to the hospital who is now in custody.

Under Secretary of the Army Mike Obadal and Army Surgeon General Lt. Gen. Mary K. Izaguirre toured the facility to review Defense Health Agency policies, patient safety practices and overall care standards. Rear Adm. Matthew Case, acting deputy director of DHA, also joined the visit. Darnall operates under the DHA network, which oversees military medical facilities worldwide.

Obadal emphasized that maintaining patient trust and safety remains the Army’s highest priority, particularly in light of the allegations against McGraw.

“Our ethical and moral imperative is to ensure deployment-ready forces while providing a safe and professional environment for all patients,” Obadal said. “I’m proud of our leaders and medical providers for the swift action taken to initiate the criminal investigation and prioritize patient safety.”

Izaguirre said the Army is closely examining how medical training, standards and oversight are carried out across facilities.

“We are looking closely at how training is conducted, how standards are enforced and how leaders ensure that policies are being followed,” she said. “Based on this review, we will work with the DHA to implement any necessary recommendations quickly and transparently to maintain faith with soldiers and families.”

Those steps will align with an Army-directed Inspector General review focused on medical treatment policies and practices.

McGraw faces allegations involving more than 100 individuals across multiple states for secretly recording patients during their exams. The claims involve patients from Fort Hood, Darnall Army Medical Center and Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii.

""These reports are deeply concerning and indescribably horrific. I and my staff are in contact with the Army and monitoring their investigation. I'm committed to ensuring a full accounting of the facts and that justice is served,” said Senator Ted Cruz in a statement.

McGraw is being held at the Bell County Jail as an inmate of the U.S. Army.

MTEC and QNova LifeSciences will co-host the 12th Annual Partnering Forum from January 12–15, 2026, at the Hilton San Francisco Union Square, with virtual partnering to follow from February 2–6, 2026. The Forum convenes investors, innovators, service providers, and global economic development organizations for targeted one-on-one meetings and strategic networking designed to accelerate medical technology commercialization.

The 2025 Forum attracted more than 1,500 participants representing over 600 companies across 30 countries. The 2026 program will expand on that momentum with sessions featuring leaders from the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. military, international trade organizations, angel networks, and private investment groups. This year's event will also bring an Investment Brunch hosted with CONNECTpreneur, offering an additional venue for high-value introductions during JPM Week.

MTEC also issued a Pre-Announcement for the upcoming ""Single Blood Donor Collection and Storage Bags Manufactured in CONUS"" Request for Project Proposals on behalf of the Defense Health Agency. The effort supports the U.S. military's priority to expand domestic manufacturing capacity for blood collection and storage kits, a critical need given ongoing shortages and the operational requirements of far-forward medical support. The U.S. Government currently has up to $4 million available for this effort, with anticipated Phase I awards of approximately $1 million to $3 million. Organizations must be MTEC members to submit proposals. Membership information is available at https://mtec-sc.org/join.

In addition, MTEC is collaborating with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and the Defense Health Agency to host the Platelet & Platelet-like Products State of Technology Meeting in Washington, D.C., from February 17–19, 2026. The meeting will bring together leading researchers, developers, and companies to examine emerging technologies, including extracellular vesicles, synthetic nanoparticles, and next-generation platelet substitutes, and to discuss government funding priorities, translational challenges, and clinical development pathways.

The removal of the IVF provision in the 2026 NDAA is a tactical defeat, but the war is not over.","For military families, the promise of comprehensive reproductive healthcare has long felt like a mirage, always visible on the horizon but forever dissolving as you approach. For the past year, beneficiaries have been led to believe that relief is finally inbound. The Fiscal Year 2026 National Defense Authorization Act included bipartisan language that would have required Tricare to cover In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) for all active-duty service members, finally modernizing a benefit stuck in the Cold War era for decades.

But as the final conference report dropped on Dec. 9, 2025, that provision was nowhere to be found.

It was not lost to a clerical error or a budget oversight, either. It was stripped by House leadership behind closed doors, reportedly due to ideological disputes regarding the status of embryos created during the IVF process. The result is that while members of Congress and federal civil servants enjoy comprehensive fertility coverage, the troops who deploy to defend them do not.

For the average military family, the 2026 landscape is now a little bleaker, leaving them to navigate a broken system with nothing but their own bank accounts and perhaps a few tactical workarounds.

The Financial Scunion

To understand the frustration rippling through the spouse networks, one must look at the math. Excluding this provision not only hurts morale; it also erodes savings accounts. Tricare currently covers only the diagnostic portion of infertility, the labs and exams that identify the problem, but pays zero dollars for the actual treatment unless the service member has a “serious or severe” illness or injury directly caused by their service.

For everyone else, the cost is draining. The average price of one single IVF cycle in the civilian world now runs between $15,000 and $30,000 after factoring in items like medications and genetic testing. Let’s put that into perspective: an E-5 with six years of service takes home a base pay of about $3,800 a month. That means their first attempt to start a family costs almost 75 percent of a sergeant’s annual base pay before taxes.

The Department of Defense is basically asking families to pay a “retention tax” to have children, forcing them to choose between staying in uniform or separating to work for a company like Starbucks, Amazon, or the federal civil service that offers the benefits the military refuses to fund.

The Loophole: MTFs and the “Discount”

If the Pentagon will not pay the bill, families must find a way to hack the system. The most viable workaround is the Military Treatment Facility (MTF) “cost-recovery” program. While Tricare will not cover a civilian clinic, roughly seven military hospitals across the globe offer IVF, in which the professional fees, including the doctors’ and surgery costs, are covered. The patient is responsible only for the contracted laboratory fees and medications, which typically run between $5,000 and $8,000 per cycle, rather than the civilian average of $25,000.

However, accessing these hubs is a logistical nightmare, akin to changing a hot machine-gun barrel with your bare hands. Patients must be stationed near one or get command approval to travel out of pocket.

With 2026 around the corner, the open and operational hubs include Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland, which serves as the East Coast flagship, with costs around $6,383 plus medications. Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio serves the central region but operates on a batched cycle system with a waitlist that can stretch up to a year. Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii and Naval Medical Center San Diego handle the Pacific demand, though travel costs often wash out the savings for those not locally stationed.

A critical warning for families in the Pacific Northwest: Madigan Army Medical Center is currently closed to new IVF referrals until at least March 2026 due to severe provider shortages. Relying on outdated referral lists for Madigan will result in dead ends and lost time.

The “Civilian Spouse” Maneuver

Perhaps the most overlooked strategy involves leveraging state law against the federal policy. While Tricare is a federal program exempt from state insurance mandates, civilian employers are not always afforded the same exemption. If a non-active duty spouse secures employment with a company based in a “mandate state“, such as New York, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, or Colorado, that employer’s “fully insured” health plan is legally required to cover IVF.

Of course, families should verify with human resources whether a plan is “fully insured” or “self-insured,” since “self-insured” is regulated by federal ERISA laws and often exempt from state mandates.

Pharmaceutical Hacks and Grants

For those forced into the civilian sector, the medication bill alone can rival the cost of a car. Some pharmaceutical companies do offer discount programs that can create a financial tourniquet in dire times. Compassionate Corps provides free fertility medication to eligible veterans with service-connected injuries who lack insurance coverage. For active-duty personnel, ReUnite Assist offers an automatic 25 percent discount on specific medications such as Follistim and Ganirelix, with deeper discounts available based on financial need.

The non-profit sector has also stepped into the breach. The Bob Woodruff Foundation’s VIVA program offers grants of up to $5,000 per cycle for veterans, often covering costs that the VA rejects, such as donor gametes or surrogacy. Baby Quest and the Cade Foundation also provide substantial grants ranging from $2,000 to $16,000 open to active-duty families.

The removal of the IVF provision in the 2026 NDAA is a tactical defeat, but the war is not over. Advocacy groups like the Military Officers Association of America and RESOLVE are already pivoting their strategy for the FY2027 cycle. The argument is shifting from a plea for social benefits to a hard-nosed assessment of readiness. With the military facing historic recruiting challenges, the data suggests it simply cannot afford to bleed mid-career talent because it refuses to support the families it claims to cherish.

Until the policy changes, families must utilize every loophole, apply for every grant, and document every dollar spent. The receipts of 2026 will likely be the ammunition needed to win the fight in 2027. As always, we must do what we do best: adapt and overcome.

When to use civilian dental care Military dental clinics are the main providers of dental care for ADSMs.
• Care unavailable at your military dental clinic: Your military dental clinic doesn’t offer the dental services you need and will refer you out.
You’ll need authorization from your civilian dentist, as described in the Active Duty Dental Program Handbook.
• The TRICARE Dental Program offers coverage to family members of ADSMs and National Guard or Reserve members not on active orders and family members.","Maintaining dental health is a critical part of overall force readiness. Are you on active duty but live far away from your nearest military dental clinic? Or do you need dental care that your military dental clinic can’t provide?

You should know that TRICARE offers the Active Duty Dental Program. This program allows active duty service members to get care through civilian providers under certain circumstances. The ADDP helps catch problems early and prevents them from becoming more serious.

“Knowing when to see a civilian dentist can save time and prevent complications,” said Douglas Elsesser, dental program analyst, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “ADDP guides you to the right dental care without unnecessary delays. It helps make sure you get the care that you need, when you need it.”

Who can get care through the ADDP The ADDP is available to all ADSMs. It also covers National Guard and Reserve members who are on active duty for more than 30 consecutive days. Some members in early activation, the Transitional Assistance Management Program, or in line of duty status also qualify.

How you get care depends on where you’re stationed and if you’re remotely located. • CONUS: o You’re remotely located if you live and work more than 50 miles away from a military dental clinic. o Not remote? You can see a civilian dentist through the ADDP with a referral from your military dental clinic. • OCONUS: You must be enrolled in TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas.

When to use civilian dental care Military dental clinics are the main providers of dental care for ADSMs. However, they can’t always provide every type of treatment. Also, not every service member is stationed close to one. In those cases, the ADDP lets you see a civilian dentist at no cost, as long as you follow the ADDP rules.

You may be eligible to see a civilian dentist through ADDP in two situations: • Remote locations: You’re assigned to a duty station more than 50 miles from a military dental clinic. • Care unavailable at your military dental clinic: Your military dental clinic doesn’t offer the dental services you need and will refer you out.

Getting an Appointment Control Number Before scheduling with a civilian dentist, you’ll need an Appointment Control Number.

An ACN allows TRICARE to pay for your civilian dental visit under the ADDP. You must have one before getting care outside a military dental clinic. • If you already have an authorization or referral: Your authorization letter will list your ACN. You can find this letter in your ADDP My Account. • If you don’t have an authorization or referral: You may still be able to request your own ACN for routine dental care. The needed care must meet these criteria: o It’s a covered benefit. o It costs less than $750 per procedure or appointment. o It totals no more than $1,500 in a 12-month period. o It’s scheduled with a network dentist (CONUS).

Do you need specialty care? Or do your costs exceed these limits? You’ll need authorization from your civilian dentist, as described in the Active Duty Dental Program Handbook. You can find more details on ACNs and other program rules in the handbook.

How to request an ACN: • Submit an ACN Request Form online (fastest option, CONUS only). • Call the ADDP contractor, United Concordia, at 866-984-2337 (CONUS) or 844-653-4058 (OCONUS).

How to make an appointment with a civilian dentist: Once you have an ACN, here’s what to do:

If you’re in a CONUS location: • You can schedule an appointment with a network dentist. United Concordia can help you. Do you have a referral? Your military dental clinic can also schedule your appointment.

If you’re in an OCONUS location: • Call United Concordia for help finding a TRICARE OCONUS Preferred Dentist. A TOPD will: o File claims for you o Submit pre-authorizations before you get costly or complex treatment

New tool for military dental care: findDHA If you aren’t using the ADDP for civilian care, you’ll go to a military dental clinic. The Defense Health Agency recently launched findDHA, an interactive mapping tool. This tool can help you find the closest military dental clinic for routine care.

ADDP vs. other TRICARE dental programs Are you a family member, retiree, or service member who isn’t on active duty? You won’t get care through the ADDP. You can buy dental coverage through a different program. • The TRICARE Dental Program offers coverage to family members of ADSMs and National Guard or Reserve members not on active orders and family members. • The Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program offers coverage to retired service members and their family members.

By covering care at military dental clinics with support from civilian dentists in the ADDP, TRICARE helps you maintain dental readiness wherever you serve.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2512/9430964/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-10 12:57:03.756553

The three pieces of legislation, Senate Bills 370, 540 and 542, follow House Bill 4962, which establishes a Michigan National Guard Member Benefit Fund to help servicemembers afford childcare, health care and tuition. House Bill 4962 did not take effect immediately as the tie-barred legislation was not passed until earlier this month.

Now, that Michigan National Guard Member Benefit Fund can be drawn upon thanks to the recent legislation passing.

“These bills reaffirm our commitment to fight for those who fight for us,” said Gov. Whitmer. “We are lowering the cost of health care and child care for members of the Michigan National Guard, ensuring they can carry out their missions to keep us all safe and provide for their families too. I’m proud that legislators worked across the aisle to pass these commonsense bills, building on years of bipartisan progress we have made to help our National Guard balance their service and their daily lives. Let’s keep working together to make health care and child care more affordable for everyone and stay focused on getting things done that make a real difference in people’s lives.""

Senate Bill 370, which establishes the Tricare Premium Reimbursement Program Act, will reimburse eligible members of the Michigan National Guard for the costs of Tricare health and dental insurance premiums.

According to the legislation's language, eligibility for the reimbursements is defined as: ""a member of the Michigan National Guard who is eligible for coverage under the Tricare reserve select program or the Tricare dental program and meets any other eligibility criteria established by the department.""

Senate Bill 370 was passed nearly unanimously in both chambers and takes effect immediately. Only Rep. Steve Cara (R-Three Rivers) voted against the bill.

Senate Bill 540 establishes the Michigan National Guard Child Care Assistance Program, which would provide a stipend for childcare to eligible members of the Michigan National Guard.

The bill defines eligible members of the Michigan National Guard as:

The member is in active service

The member is not absent without leave (AWOL) or under charges described in the Michigan Code of Military Justice

Any other criteria determined by the adjutant general consistent with Michigan National Guard recruiting and retention requirements

The stipend is only given to applicants if both the following apply:

There is enough money in the Michigan National Guard Member Benefit Fund proposed by House Bill 4962 to cover the amount of assistance applied for

Either of the following:

The applicant is a single parent

The applicant’s spouse is also an eligible member

Child care assistance through the stipend can only be provided for up to 12 hours a day for weekend drills and annual training, and up to a maximum of 39 days a year.

Senate Bill 540 passed with strong bipartisan support in both chambers and goes into effect immediately.

Senate Bill 542 amends the Michigan National Guard Tuition Assistance Act to move its remaining unencumbered balance from the Michigan National Guard Tuition Assistance Fund to the Michigan National Guard Member Benefit Fund proposed by House Bill 4962.

The tuition assistance program will eligible members of the Michigan National Guard to pay for education that would culminate in:

A vocational or technical training

A certificate

The individual’s first associate degree

The individual’s first bachelor’s degree

The individual’s first master’s degree

Senate Bill 542 passed with strong bipartisan support in both chambers and goes into effect immediately.

All of the above mentioned assistance programs will be overseen by the Michigan National Guard General Adjutant, the senior military officer for a state's National Guard.

Shoulder conditions and disorders are commonly experienced musculoskeletal pain conditions and have a prevalence (20.9%) comparable to back (26.9%) and neck pain (20.6%).1 For example, in a 15-year population-based study in the Netherlands, only 47% of the cohort were free of chronic arm, neck, or shoulder pain throughout the observation period.1 The 53% experiencing these conditions were further described as having either development (18.3%), persistence (8.5%), recovery (7.5%), or variable (18.7%) disease courses.2 Moreover, the healthcare burden is high for those with shoulder injuries, including up to 58% of those with chronic arm, neck, and shoulder pain from the aforementioned Netherlands cohort study.3

Health system level care utilization patterns for shoulder conditions and disorders have not previously been well described; a stark contrast to other commonly occurring musculoskeletal conditions like low back pain.4,5 Furthermore, available literature for characterizing shoulder conditions has included cross-sectional analysis which does not allow for an understanding of healthcare utilization and care trajectories over time.6 This knowledge gap has potentially important ramifications for data-driven recommendations improving care for this highly prevalent musculoskeletal condition. Also, in many instances, shoulder conditions are grouped broadly as “musculoskeletal pain” for population-based studies, including being clustered with neck and arm pain as in the aforementioned cohort study in the Netherlands, as well as other studies.7,8 Most large-scale healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) studies have focused on other areas of musculoskeletal pain, leaving shoulder conditions and disorders as under-studied. Furthermore, the lack of shoulder-specific data on HCRU limits the development of value-based models that have been established in similarly prevalent conditions.

Similar to other body regions, several different diagnostic categories of shoulder conditions exist, ranging from acute injuries to severe degenerative disease requiring surgery. Moreover, prognosis and care trajectories can vary substantially across shoulder conditions. Therefore, when examining healthcare utilization patterns at the population level, conditions should be evaluated separately. From a policy and planning perspective, knowledge of how healthcare use varies across different diagnostic categories is a necessary first step to understanding which care patterns have the highest impact on the health system. The knowledge of healthcare use across different shoulder diagnostic categories is important because it informs whether ongoing management is potentially aligned with best practice recommendations. Investigation of alignment with best practice recommendations for shoulder conditions and disorders is largely missing from existing literature but is important to know given its high prevalence. One analysis investigating the timing and ordering of manual therapy and opioid prescription for shoulder pain within the military health system provided insights related to the economic burden of these care pathways.9 Another analysis of the same health system, this time for knee disorders, demonstrated cost savings to the organization when stepped care pathways are followed.10 However, such examples are rarely reported in the literature. Filling this information gap will also allow future assessment of whether shoulder care (in this and other health systems) aligns with best practice recommendations for diagnostic imaging use,11–13 and pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments.12,14,15

This analysis used routinely collected health data to 1) describe the frequency and timing of diagnostic imaging (x-rays and advanced imaging services) and treatment use (non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic) for a new episode of shoulder pain and 2) identify how usage varied across high-volume shoulder conditions in different settings (military clinics versus private sector care). High volume conditions represent those most commonly seen within the health system. This analysis adds to the existing literature by HCRU among patients within different shoulder diagnostic categories, thereby enabling future efforts to better understand what constitutes value-based care for this highly prevalent musculoskeletal condition.

Methods

Study Overview

This was a retrospective cohort study of United States Military Health System (MHS) beneficiaries seeking care for a shoulder disorder. The MHS is a single-payer government health system and one of the largest health systems in the US, with over 50 hospitals and over 400 clinics. We used de-identified data from the MHS Data Repository (MDR) from January 2013 to July 2019; specifically, the Comprehensive Ambulatory/Professional Encounter Records (CAPER), the Non-Institutional TRICARE Encounter Data (TED-NI), the Ancillary Laboratory and Radiology data (Ancillary), the Pharmacy Detail Transaction Service data (PDTS), the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS), the Institutional TRICARE Encounter Data (TED-I), and the Standard Inpatient Data Records (SIDR). CAPER and SIDR include data from the outpatient and inpatient electronic medical records used in military clinics. TED-NI and TED-I include claims data from outpatient and inpatient visits in the private sector. The ancillary file includes imaging procedures that take place in military clinics, and PDTS includes all prescription data from outpatient encounters. The index date was defined as the date the individual had their first encounter that recorded a shoulder disorder diagnosis or procedure (Supplemental Table 1). Both sources that feed to the MDR, from military or private sector care clinics, are based on procedure (Current Procedural Terminology – CPT) and diagnosis (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) codes, allowing for a standardized comparison).16

Ethics Approval

This project received ethics approval from the Institutional Review Board at US Army Medical Center of Excellence, San Antonio, TX (#25-00019n, PI: Dan Rhon). The Institutional Review Board at Duke University reviewed this project and declared it as exempt because statistical analyses were performed on de-identified data (Pro00109909, PI: Steven George).

Eligibility Criteria

Individuals had an index date between July 2013, and March 2019. To be eligible, all cases were required to have a minimum six-month lead-in period (ie, no care seeking for shoulder disorder) and a three-month follow-up period to ensure this was a new episode of shoulder pain and to allow for a three-month analysis window of initial care utilization.

Patients were excluded if they were older than 65 years old, or less than 18 years old on the index date except those on active duty as emancipated minors, or their index visit was in an inpatient setting. Patients were further excluded if, during the surveillance period, they had a diagnosis or procedure indicating trauma, open dislocation, shoulder/humerus fractures, or upper extremity amputation. Diagnosis codes for the exclusion criteria can be found in Supplemental Table 1.

Exposures

Using encounters within three months of the index visits, the primary diagnostic shoulder group exposures were classified as: 1) non-specific shoulder diagnosis only, 2) rotator cuff/sub-acromial pain, 3) acromioclavicular (AC joint) dysfunction, 4) shoulder instability/dislocation, 5) hypomobility/adhesive capsulitis, 6) osteoarthrosis (OA), and 7) multiple diagnoses (Supplemental Table 1). Individuals with more than one specific diagnosis were placed in the multiple diagnoses category. The secondary exposure was the location of the index visit, which could be either military clinics or private sector (civilian clinics) care.

Outcomes

The study outcomes were HCRU within the first three months from the index visit and were broadly classified into three main groups: diagnostic imaging, pharmacological, and non-pharmacological treatments (codes in Supplemental Table 2). Diagnostic imaging procedures included radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance arthrogram (MRA), and computed tomography (CT) scans. Imaging that included MRI, MRA, or CT was further categorized as advanced imaging. Patients who received both radiographs and advanced imaging were further categorized based on the order of imaging (radiograph prior to advanced imaging or vice versa). Pharmacological treatments included prescriptions for NSAIDs, opioids, benzodiazepines, muscle relaxers, analgesics, and steroid joint injections, based on American Hospital Formulary Service therapeutic class codes in the PDTS file. Non-pharmacological treatments included receipt of acupuncture, physical therapy, and then more specifically whether patients received supervised therapeutic exercise, passive modalities (eg, ultrasound, electrical stimulation, heat/cold therapy), or manual therapy. These outcomes were defined as binary indicators of utilization and as continuous variables (ie, number of procedures, prescriptions, and treatment visits per patient).

Data Analysis

For Aim 1, the HCRU in the first three months of shoulder care across the diagnostic shoulder groups was summarized as the number of unique people who received that care at least once. In addition, descriptive statistics, including the mean and standard deviation, summarized the number of times the care was received per patient. Chi-square and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to test the difference in treatment receipt between diagnosis categories without adjusting for multiple testing. However, given the large sample size of this study, a small non-clinically important difference can be claimed as statistically significant with a p-value <0.05.17 Therefore, the focus on clinical relevance was prioritized, and inferential statistical testing was not performed.

For Aim 2, we descriptively compared the same HCRU outcomes between cases that occurred initially in military clinics versus private sector clinics for each shoulder disorder category. All statistical analyses were completed using SAS 9.4 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

Results

The initial data abstraction from MDR identified 1,488,821 unique persons with care for an initial episode of shoulder pain from January 2013 to July 2019 in MDR. After exclusions for age, prior shoulder care, trauma-related incidents, and minimum eligibility periods, the research team was provided with a file representing 663,573 unique individuals. Manual validation of the data removed additional cases based on age, presence of shoulder trauma, and beneficiary eligibility windows not met. This led to 456,241 individuals meeting eligibility for inclusion in the final cohort (Table 1). The two most common reasons an individual was excluded during manual validation were not having the index visit in an outpatient setting (n = 22,046) and having evidence of fracture or trauma (n = 106,772). The summary of this cohort by diagnostic group is presented in Table 2 and by index clinic type (Supplemental Table 3). The size of the diagnostic groups ranged from non-specific shoulder pain as the largest (n = 305,764, 67%) to rotator cuff injury (n = 84,698, 18.6%) to AC joint disorders as the smallest (n = 4,013, <0.1%).

Table 2 Demographic Characteristics by Diagnostic Groups

Table 2 was stratified by the diagnostic groups and the characteristics summarized include the data source of the patient’s index date, age, index year, sex, beneficiary category, pay plan, and service branch (the latter two variables represent the status of the sponsor). Sex was missing for 14.4% of the total patients. All diagnostic groups showed a higher percentage of male patients (between 49.7% and 73.4%) except for the Hypomobility/Adhesive Capsulitis disease group which had 50.9% female patients and only 39% male. Patients with hypomobility/adhesive capsulitis, OA, and multiple diagnoses had a higher mean age (47, 50, and 48, respectively), whereas patients with AC Joint and instability/dislocation had a lower mean age (33 and 30, respectively). The AC Joint and Instability/Dislocation disease groups had the highest percentage of active duty patients (63.8% and 67.5%, respectively), compared to the others which ranged from 22.4% to 47.3%. Across all diagnostic groups, patients were mainly enlisted members (ranging from 70.4% to 76.9%; compared to officers) within the Army (37.5–43.1%; compared to the other service branches).

Supplemental Table 3 reports patient characteristics based on the location of the initial shoulder care (military or private sector clinic). Patients with missing sex were all initially seen in military clinics. Patients whose initial care occurred in the military clinics had a lower mean age compared to patients with initial care occurring in private sector clinics (38 vs 46, respectively). As expected, a higher percentage of active-duty service members were seen in military versus private sector clinics (63% vs 17%), compared to fewer dependent (18.3% vs 47.5%) and retired service members (13.4% vs 28.3%).

Diagnostic Imaging (Aim 1)

A majority of the cohort never received diagnostic imaging (76.7% overall), but there was variability in imaging use among diagnostic groups (Supplemental Table 4). For example, 61.4% of patients with OA and 73.5% with multiple diagnoses had at least one imaging procedure. Radiographs were the most common imaging (18.3% overall), except for the multiple diagnoses group receiving equal radiographs and MRIs (53.6% and 53.0% respectively). Advanced imaging was most common for the multiple diagnoses group (53.6%), followed by OA (22.8%), rotator cuff (17.4%), and instability/dislocation disorders (12.4%). When examining the order of imaging services among patients who used imaging services, 34.4% of the patients with multiple diagnoses had a radiograph first, 27.1% had only a radiograph, 27% had only advanced imaging, and 11.1% had advanced imaging prior to a radiograph. Of the patients who used imaging services, the percentage of patients with advanced imaging first was the highest in the multiple diagnoses group (11.1%), followed by the rotator cuff group (5.5%) and Hypomobility/Adhesive Capsulitis disease group (3.5%). Advanced imaging prior to radiograph occurred for only <3% of those in all other diagnostic groups.

Pharmacologic and Nonpharmacologic Treatments (Aim 1)

Supplemental Table 4 summarizes pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments by the shoulder diagnosis groups. NSAIDs were the most common pharmacological treatment across the entire cohort, with 10.4% receiving at least one prescription. Within the diagnostic groups, almost 13% or higher received an NSAID prescription in hypomobility/adhesive capsulitis, OA, and multiple diagnoses groups. This was closely followed by steroid injections with 10.2% overall, and within the diagnostic groups, >20% for rotator cuff, OA, and multiple diagnoses groups. Opioid prescriptions were filled by 8.4% of the patients overall, but within the diagnostic groups >10% in hypomobility/adhesive capsulitis, OA, and multiple diagnoses groups. Benzodiazepine prescriptions were the least common, with only 3.6% of the cohort receiving this medication. Among those who had at least one prescription of NSAIDS or opioid, the mean numbers of NSAIDS or opioid prescriptions were around 5 or 3 for all diagnostic groups, respectively. Among those who had at least one steroid joint injection, the mean number was 1 across all diagnostic groups.

Physical therapy was received by 31% of the cohort. Specific elements included therapeutic exercise (32.2% having at least one occurrence), followed by manual therapy (19.7%), and passive treatments (13.7%). Those who received therapeutic exercise or physical therapy had a mean number of around 5 sessions, with the diagnostic groups of Hypomobility/Adhesive capsulitis and multiple diagnosis groups having the most sessions. Acupuncture was used for 0.4% of the cohort, thus limiting the ability to explore variation across different diagnostic groups.

Differences in Military and Civilian Care Settings (Aim 2)

Supplemental Table 5 compares HCRU between patients initially seen in civilian and military clinics. Figure 1 illustrates the percentages of patients utilizing at least one pharmacological treatment by diagnostic groups and location of the initial shoulder care encounter (military or private sector clinic). Receipt of pharmacological treatments was relatively similar between clinic types within the same disease group, except for a few instances. NSAIDs were filled about 3% more often for private sector shoulder care compared to military clinics for patients with rotator cuff disorders, AC joint, instability/dislocation, and non-specific diagnosis. The percentages of patients using opioids were higher by 1–2% when care was initiated in a private sector clinic compared to a military clinic for all diagnostic groups except for Hypomobility/Adhesive capsulitis and OA. Patients with rotator cuff disorders, Hypomobility/Adhesive capsulitis, and multiple diagnoses were more likely to have received at least one steroid joint injection if shoulder care was initiated in the private sector compared to military clinics (28.1% vs 16%; 18.6% vs 13.3%; and 41.2% vs 32.0%, respectively).

Across all diagnostic groups, care initiated in a military clinic was more likely to consist of at least one session of a non-pharmacological treatment compared to care initiated in a private sector clinic (Figure 2). However, manual therapy was similar across both settings for Hypomobility/Adhesive capsulitis and multiple diagnoses groups. On the other hand, if care was initiated in a private sector clinic, patients were more likely to have received an advanced imaging or X-ray than if care was initiated in a military clinic (Figure 3).

Discussion

Shoulder conditions are highly prevalent in both military and civilian populations and are a common reason to seek healthcare. This comparative analysis of shoulder diagnostic groups provided novel data on HCRU patterns that, to the best of our knowledge, had not been previously described at the health system level. For example, shoulder disorders have the highest rates of diagnostic imaging compared to competing musculoskeletal conditions, like back, knee, or neck pain;18 yet guidance for imaging decision-making is often left to expert opinion for the shoulder.19 These findings provide patients, clinicians, and policy-makers the ability to identify overall prescription rates among commonly used modalities for the management of shoulder disorders. These data may be critical to establishing benchmarks and HCRU metrics that inform the development of value-based care pathways in this population.

In this cohort, there were relatively low rates of diagnostic imaging (almost 77% of the cohort received none) and low prescription rates for opioids and steroid injections (each ≤10%). Furthermore, the variability observed in the HCRU largely coincided with what would be considered clinically appropriate for a given diagnostic group. For example, the multiple diagnoses group had the highest rates for advanced diagnostic imaging, steroid injections, and physical therapy. Relative to the other diagnostic groups, these higher rates appear justified given the multiple diagnoses group likely represents individuals with more complex cases.

There were some HCRU patterns, however, that indicated an opportunity for improvement. The limited use of acupuncture as a non-pharmacologic treatment was one notable finding, given that the treatment modality has been used to improve short-term shoulder outcomes.20 Another interesting finding is that large differences in military and civilian clinics were noted in the use of imaging, steroid injections, and physical therapy for specific diagnostic subgroups. These differences provide circumstantial evidence that system-level factors may facilitate care decisions.11,21 For example, in civilian clinics, higher reimbursement could lead to greater use of diagnostic imaging and steroid injections, while copayments could be a barrier to the use of physical therapy.

The strengths of this analysis include a large sample size of both military and civilian care recipients, likely one of the largest existing samples for shoulder disorders. This analysis also used data collected from a closed single-payer healthcare system, increasing the likelihood it represents a true reflection of actual care received. Comparisons to the existing literature are challenging because our approach investigated HCRU patterns along with increased granularity in shoulder diagnostic groups. A study by Joo et al6 described healthcare use for three different shoulder diagnostic groups (ie, adhesive capsulitis, rotator cuff syndrome, and shoulder impingement syndrome) from National Health Insurance (Korea) claims data. However, their focus was on describing the location, provider type, and cost of service making difficult direct comparisons with our cohort. Another study from Leggit et al22 assessed shoulder disorders across this same health system in fiscal year 2014. They reported 55,643 individuals that met study inclusion, with 75.3% undergoing radiological assessment and 91% being prescribed pain medications.22 However, case assessment was limited to only ICD-9 codes, and they did not investigate patterns based on diagnostic groups or differentiate between care in military versus civilian clinics. When considering these results within the context of a theoretical framework for orthopedic hospitals, our data were best aligned with one domain (provision of sustainable medical care services), while less informative for other domains (organizational management, economic, environmental, and social).23

There are some limitations to consider. First, our sample included cases from the years 2013–2019 which may not represent current practices. We intentionally chose the time frame to exclude years overlapping with the COVID pandemic because of the disruption in ambulatory care. More recent years were not yet available for analysis. Second, we used a washout period to avoid prior care seeking; but there remains a possibility these findings do not represent their true initial index shoulder visit for all patients. Another important limitation to consider when interpreting these findings is that over-the-counter medications and healthcare visits outside of civilian/military clinics may not be captured. No costs for care in the MHS versus the likely need to fund additional care out of pocket makes over the counter medication use less likely. However, due to this limitation, we cannot directly comment on any rates or differences in rates for over-the-counter medication use. Finally, medication prescriptions could not be directly linked to a diagnosis, so the shoulder disorder could not validated as the primary reason for the order.

Conclusion

This study describes the use of care for different shoulder diagnostic groups and adds to the existing literature by comprehensively describing patterns within a large health system; one of the first studies to describe care at this level of detail for this highly prevalent musculoskeletal condition. Collectively, care patterns were congruent across military and civilian clinics with notable exceptions being much higher imaging rates and steroid injection use in civilian clinics and higher physical therapy use in military clinics. These findings suggest that policies in the MHS may facilitate clinical practices that are more likely to be consistent with existing practice guidelines, especially with regard to use of imaging, steroid injection, and physical therapy. However, future research is needed in this area to determine what are the definitive or primary drivers for the care variability observed in this cohort study.",https://www.dovepress.com/assets/img/addon/og_logo.png,N,0.0,2025-12-09 12:56:39.775726

Are you on active duty but live far away from your nearest military dental clinic? Or do you need dental care that your military dental clinic can’t provide?

You should know that TRICARE offers the Active Duty Dental Program. This program allows active duty service members to get care through civilian providers under certain circumstances. The ADDP helps catch problems early and prevents them from becoming more serious.

“Knowing when to see a civilian dentist can save time and prevent complications,” said Douglas Elsesser, dental program analyst, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “ADDP guides you to the right dental care without unnecessary delays. It helps make sure you get the care that you need, when you need it.”

Who can get care through the ADDP

The ADDP is available to all ADSMs. It also covers National Guard and Reserve members who are on active duty for more than 30 consecutive days. Some members in early activation, the Transitional Assistance Management Program, or in line of duty status also qualify.

How you get care depends on where you’re stationed and if you’re remotely located.

CONUS:

You’re remotely located if you live and work more than 50 miles away from a military dental clinic.

Not remote? You can see a civilian dentist through the ADDP with a referral from your military dental clinic.

OCONUS: You must be enrolled in TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas.

Military dental clinics are the main providers of dental care for ADSMs. However, they can’t always provide every type of treatment. Also, not every service member is stationed close to one. In those cases, the ADDP lets you see a civilian dentist at no cost, as long as you follow the ADDP rules.

You may be eligible to see a civilian dentist through ADDP in two situations:

Remote locations: You’re assigned to a duty station more than 50 miles from a military dental clinic.

Care unavailable at your military dental clinic: Your military dental clinic doesn’t offer the dental services you need and will refer you out.

Getting an Appointment Control Number

Before scheduling with a civilian dentist, you’ll need an Appointment Control Number.

An ACN allows TRICARE to pay for your civilian dental visit under the ADDP. You must have one before getting care outside a military dental clinic.

If you already have an authorization or referral: Your authorization letter will list your ACN. You can find this letter in your ADDP My Account.

If you don’t have an authorization or referral: You may still be able to request your own ACN for routine dental care. The needed care must meet these criteria:

It’s a covered benefit.

It costs less than $750 per procedure or appointment.

It totals no more than $1,500 in a 12-month period.

It’s scheduled with a network dentist (CONUS).

Do you need specialty care? Or do your costs exceed these limits? You’ll need authorization from your civilian dentist, as described in the Active Duty Dental Program Handbook. You can find more details on ACNs and other program rules in the handbook.

How to request an ACN

Submit an ACN Request Form online (fastest option, CONUS only).

Call the ADDP contractor, United Concordia, at 866-984-2337 (CONUS) or 844-653-4058 (OCONUS).

How to make an appointment with a civilian dentist

Once you have an ACN, here’s what to do:

If you’re in a CONUS location:

You can schedule an appointment with a network dentist. United Concordia can help you. Do you have a referral? Your military dental clinic can also schedule your appointment.

If you’re in an OCONUS location:

New tool for military dental care: findDHA

If you aren’t using the ADDP for civilian care, you’ll go to a military dental clinic. The Defense Health Agency recently launched findDHA, an interactive mapping tool. This tool can help you find the closest military dental clinic for routine care.

ADDP vs. other TRICARE dental programs

Are you a family member, retiree, or service member who isn’t on active duty? You won’t get care through the ADDP. You can buy dental coverage through a different program.

The TRICARE Dental Program offers coverage to family members of ADSMs and National Guard or Reserve members not on active orders and family members.

A recent study led by researchers at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU) has found that nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs) deliver care for mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in the Military Health System (MHS) at significantly lower costs than primary care physicians (PCPs), with no clear compromise in quality.

physician assistants in treating mild traumatic

brain injury. (Photo credit: Tom Balfour, USU)

Released online in the October 2025 issue of Value in Health, the study examined more than a decade of data from the Military Data Repository, analyzing care encounters from 2011 to 2021 for active-duty service members, retirees, and military dependents diagnosed with mTBI.

According to the findings, both PAs and NPs provided care at per-patient cost savings ranging from $53 to over $275 when compared to PCPs, depending on the patient’s risk category and whether they were new or existing patients. Among dependent populations, PAs and NPs were also associated with significant savings.

“Our research highlights the important and growing role that nurse practitioners and physician assistants play in military medicine,” said lead author Dr. Patrick Richard of USU’s F. Edward Hébert School of Medicine. “In a healthcare environment facing ongoing shortages of primary care physicians, these results suggest that advanced practice providers are a cost-effective and viable solution—particularly for treating common conditions like mild traumatic brain injury.”

While the cost advantages were clear, the study revealed mixed outcomes when it came to quality. For example, PAs were found to order fewer brain and spine imaging scans—an evidence-based practice—when treating high-risk new patients, but also conducted fewer depression assessments in the same group. NPs, on the other hand, performed more neuropsychological testing for high-risk existing patients and were associated with fewer hospital readmissions among low-risk new patients in the dependent population.

The study was supported by the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program and the USU Center for Health Services Research. It leveraged the unique structure of the MHS, where NPs and PAs often provide care independently, allowing for a natural comparison of provider types without the confounding influence of patient self-selection.

In addition to Dr. Richard, co-authors of the study include researchers from USU’s Graduate School of Nursing, the National Intrepid Center of Excellence, Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine, and Brown University.

As the signature injury of recent military conflicts, traumatic brain injury—particularly mild forms—remains a top health concern within the Department of War. The results of this study could inform staffing models, training priorities, and policy decisions aimed at maximizing readiness while controlling healthcare costs.

“These findings not only reinforce the value of non-physician providers in delivering efficient care,” said Dr. Richard, “but also identify specific areas where clinical practice guidelines and provider education can help optimize outcomes.""",https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg81EDCUBaAfczSf6ANFkecdXkbGJMBBpKoQC_Ca8A3LFMbk_VTJ8P96IwCIoChT0h0lflh6xtnO7t8fOKiTWqU_LqbCZxMY-veaeTjAejKhYbWBX4vNTRjZGdnVHUTnc9iPnbtG-T7S7NbzeJ8GQ41E9-zUV4SgbabMjoph2N1yxjXx_Vmajq0IL0YWK4/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/cropBM%202024%20(1).jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-09 11:56:51.384257

“This victory shows us a sensitivity to that.” (Polling has found that an overwhelming majority of Americans support access to IVF.)
It’s Speaker Johnson and his key staffers in his office,” Duckworth told NOTUS.
“This is a religious opposition to it, and it’s sad that they’re doing it in the dark of night, you know, behind closed doors.” Some Republicans, however, lamented the removal of the IVF provision from the bill.
“The people I’ve talked to in the administration have said very explicitly, you know, these concerns have been heard, these moral concerns,” Pavone told NOTUS.”","Republicans loudly declared in 2024 they backed access to in vitro fertilization, even changing their party’s platform to highlight their support.

But little has been done to actually deliver on those campaign promises. And when lawmakers unveiled over the weekend the final negotiated language for the National Defense Authorization Act, a provision that was passed in both the House and Senate versions requiring insurance coverage of IVF for active-duty service members was missing.

Anti-abortion leaders, who have long opposed IVF over the practice of discarding embryos, are now declaring victory.

“When you have a significant, and I would call it a significant portion of the public having moral concerns about this … let’s be sensitive to that,” Frank Pavone, the national director of Priests for Life, told NOTUS. “This victory shows us a sensitivity to that.” (Polling has found that an overwhelming majority of Americans support access to IVF.)

Kristi Hamrick, vice president of media and policy for Students for Life of America, added in a statement that “more pre-born lives are lost in IVF than abortion.”

“IVF is not an industry that deserves blanket support and funding,” Hamrick continued. “We can do better.”

Tricare, the Pentagon’s health care program for service members, currently does not cover IVF or other assisted reproductive technologies.

The provision stripped from the NDAA would have required Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to “ensure that fertility-related care for a member of the uniformed services on active duty (or a dependent of such a member) shall be covered under TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select.”

Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a Democratic member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who championed the IVF provision, last week urged President Donald Trump to stop Speaker Mike Johnson from removing the provision from the bill. At the time, a Johnson spokesperson told NOTUS the speaker is “supportive of access to IVF when sufficient pro-life protections are in place.”

The White House did not respond to NOTUS’ request for comment on whether it supported the IVF measure.

Advancing American Freedom, a conservative group led by former Vice President Mike Pence, released a memo celebrating the removal of the provision: “Many pro-life Americans are opposed to IVF because the standard process destroys human embryos.”

“Mike Johnson is an effective Speaker because he is taking public arrows for his team. The majority of the Republican conference is pro-life and understands that this controversial provision should have never been in NDAA in the first place,” John Shelton, the group’s policy director, said in a statement.

Similarly, Lila Rose, president of Live Action, thanked Johnson for “ensuring TRICARE was not used to subsidize this destruction of life.”

While anti-abortion advocates were quick to say they won the battle, Senate Republicans involved in the discussions on the NDAA language were fairly tight-lipped as to exactly why the IVF provision was suddenly removed from the bill. When asked about the issue, The chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Roger Wicker, told NOTUS, “I can’t speak to that.”

Sen. Markwayne Mullin said the provision was removed as a negotiating tool, as senators considered what compromises could be made to “get this thing passed.”

“I think it’s got a chance to find its way back in, but it ought to be clean, because there was other language attached that caused it to be, what we call, a poison pill,” Mullin continued. He declined to say what language Republicans opposed because “we’re still negotiating.”

Duckworth scoffed at Mullin’s explanations for why the clause was excluded, adding that the move was not exactly surprising because the provision was also eliminated at the last minute from the NDAA last year.

“It passed out of the House; it passed out of the Senate committee; it passed out of both chambers; I negotiated in committee, it passed. It’s Speaker Johnson and his key staffers in his office,” Duckworth told NOTUS. “This is a religious opposition to it, and it’s sad that they’re doing it in the dark of night, you know, behind closed doors.”

Some Republicans, however, lamented the removal of the IVF provision from the bill.

“It’s not the way that I would do it,” Sen. Mike Rounds — who said he’d “personally” like to see the provision reinstated — told reporters. “But remember that a bill this size and this critical will have to have a consensus approach to it. If the House doesn’t have a consensus, or if the White House doesn’t have an agreement on it, we still need the rest of the bill.”

“While the bill is not as good as it could be, it’s still better than not passing the bill,” Rounds continued.

Back in October, after months of speculation on how Trump would fulfill his campaign promise to make IVF free, the president announced a plan to lower the prices of a commonly used fertility drug and encouraged employers to offer IVF coverage for employees — though he did not offer any incentives to insurance companies or employers to do so.

The plan fell short of his proposal to fully cover IVF costs — and some anti-abortion advocates took that as an indication that the administration and Republicans were listening.

Spearheading the effort is Master Sgt. Anthony Eberly, who assumed leadership of the program in early 2024 following a prolonged vacancy in the coordinator position.

“When I stepped into the role, the program hadn’t had a full-time lead since 2022,” Eberly said. “Despite that, several long-standing volunteers remained dedicated, keeping things afloat. But we knew it could be so much more, with a little structure and a lot of heart.”

Since then, the program has expanded significantly growing from 42 active volunteers contributing 545 hours in Oct. 2023 to 84 volunteers providing 1,171 hours in Oct. 2025. This doubling of personnel and more than 100% increase in volunteer hours reflects a deliberate effort to strengthen patient support and enhance clinical efficiency across the 59th Medical Wing.

“Volunteers fill critical gaps, especially when military or civilian manpower isn’t available,” Eberly said. “They answer phones, help transport patients, escort families, and provide information to visitors who might otherwise be waiting or confused. It’s about enhancing the entire experience.”

The strategic revamp of the program led to a greater community impact while revitalization led to several new initiatives:

• Step Saver Program: Relaunched in partnership with the Safety Office, volunteers now assist in transporting over 2,000 patients annually between the parking lot and clinic.

• Teen Volunteer Opportunities: A new youth outreach component enables volunteers as young as 14 to gain service hours while contributing to healthcare support.

• Red Cross Partnership: A renewed collaboration brings Red Cross support back into WHASC and other JBSA locations.

• Streamlined Onboarding: Onboarding timelines have been reduced to as little as two weeks for many roles, making it easier for newcomers to get started.

• Expanded Roles: Volunteers now serve across 31 departments, including laboratory, pharmacy, PACU, and the front desk.

Beyond administrative duties, volunteers now average over 800 annual patient escorts and assist more than 900 patients traveling between clinics and parking lots. Additionally, they answer more than one in four patient inquiries by phone or in person—filling a vital communication role.

“This program has become a lifeline not just for our patients, but for our clinics,” Eberly added. “We’ve also opened the door for Airmen and Guardians in casual status—those waiting for reassignment or training—to step in and support our mission.”

Recent retirees from military service also make up a growing portion of the volunteer base, including former physicians who wish to continue contributing to the military community.

“Volunteers bring wisdom, experience, and compassion into our facility,” said Col. Karen Buikema, Lackland Medical Support Group deputy commander. “Their dedication is a reflection of what service truly means and we’re grateful for every one of them.”

How to Join:

Volunteer Services welcomes individuals age 14 and older. Those interested in serving at one of the Wing’s San Antonio clinic locations can contact MSgt. Eberly directly at anthony.j.eberly2.mil@health.mil to schedule an appointment and learn about next steps.

It’s amazing, I had fehb which is comparable with coverage but it was double what I paid in tricare. Only other ppl that had better health insurance than tricare was if they were in a good union or defense contracting where they paid for it all.

It’s absolutely worth it if you need regular healthcare. I had a high deductible plan with a HSA through my employer for awhile and it was great until me and my family members had a string of hospital visits that completely drained 2 years worth of HSA savings and I still ended up having to pay thousands out of pocket. I switched to Tricare reserves select after that and have had many hospital visits, procedures, and prescriptions and have paid almost nothing out of pocket. The monthly premium is about the same as my current employers plan too

Tricare reserve select is truly a Cadillac healthcare plan and generally will be better than most healthcare plans provided by employers. The low premiums combined with a Catastrophic Cap of no more than $4,635 is really great. You also have the ability to go to a Military treatment facility on a space available basis.

Now I will say I would explore what the provider base is for the plan especially if you live in a non military area. Also check with your primary care provider to see if they take tricare.",,N,0.0,2025-12-09 02:56:45.761994

The total reimbursement to the provider is the same, but with INN you would just have a copay.
So let's say BCBS allows $200 and assigns all $200 to PR, but Tricare's max allowed is $100.
They would then process the claim (assuming deductible is met) with you paying $25, them paying $75, and the provider writing off $100.
If they send less then you just pay 25% of whatever that amount is after Tricare finishes processing.","I'm not sure where you're seeing 75% of the allowed charges at, as unless there's been a change for 2026, Tricare reimburses based on a federal fee schedule that's the same for INN and OON. I haven't had a chance to look at Tricare's 2026 rates yet so I don't know the amount for 97530 (the code that will most likely be used for OT) that would be allowed. What I think that 75% means is Tricare will pay 75%, and you'll pay 25% (coinsurance), after your deductible is met. The total reimbursement to the provider is the same, but with INN you would just have a copay.

If you go with Tricare as secondary, then it'll still be that 25/75 split (after the deductible), but the amounts will be based off the patient responsibility assigned by BCBS, up to the maximum allowed by Tricare. So let's say BCBS allows $200 and assigns all $200 to PR, but Tricare's max allowed is $100. They would then process the claim (assuming deductible is met) with you paying $25, them paying $75, and the provider writing off $100. If BCBS applies nothing to PR, then Tricare doesn't get billed.

Now, OON providers may balance bill you UP TO 115% of the Tricare allowable. So instead of writing off $100, the provider could choose to write off $85 and bill you for $40 instead of just $25. However I don't know of any providers who actually do this, as generally Tricare (especially Select) is a no muss, no fuss, super easy to deal with payor so we like to stay in the good graces of Tricare patients. At least Tricare East is.

I handle the commerical insurance coding, billing, contracting, and follow ups for a pediatric therapy office (which includes OT), feel free to ask anything else you want clarification on.

-edit- I just noticed you mentioned that provider is the only one who does the services your son requires. If that's the case, the provider may be able to get a pre-authorization under the consideration that they're the only option, which would then have your claims processed as INN. I think. I've never actually done this with a Select plan, as there are numerous INN providers in my area, but with our Tricare Prime patients we have to get a pre-authorization, which then results in the claims processing as INN. That may be something to look into, assuming the PR from BCBS would be excessive.

-edit 2- so I just checked Health.mil and it doesn't appear reimbursement is changing for 2026, so if the Therapist is an actual Doctor (MD, DO) then the price per unit of 97530 (in TX as a whole, though I don't think the amount will change per Zip since this amount is the same as NC) will be $33.02. If they're an Occupational Therapist, then it's $28.06. Each unit is 15 minutes, so pediatrics OT is usually 4 units, an hour session. I'm going to assume the OT is just a therapist, not a Dr, so that puts the allowed amount for treatment at $112.24, meaning at a 25% coinsurance you would pay, well, $28.06. This is if Tricare is billed as primary, or if BCBS sends more than $112.24 to patient responsibility. If they send less then you just pay 25% of whatever that amount is after Tricare finishes processing.

Honestly, if it were me personally, I'd drop BCBS and put the money you would spend on premiums into savings or something. Tricare is a pain to deal with as a patient sometimes, but Select is much more lenient than Prime and unless the BCBS plan is self-funded (paid by the employer), just Tricare alone is going to come out far cheaper for you.",,N,0.0,2025-12-08 20:56:34.527663

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye disease that affects your central vision, impacting sight for objects directly in front of you. It is a common age-related eye condition that occurs mostly in people over the age of 50. An estimated 20 million American adults have some form of AMD.

The macula is the central section of your retina, which is the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of your eye. The retina captures light and converts it into electrical signals your brain interprets as images (or vision).

Potential signs of AMD include:

Blurry vision.

A decrease or loss of central vision, including grayed out, dark, or missing areas.

Trouble recognizing familiar faces.

The misjudgment of spatial distances, sometimes resulting in bumping into walls, steps, or other obstacles.

Straight lines appearing wavy or broken.

[RELATED: MOAA's TRICARE Guide]

Eighty percent of those with AMD develop the “dry” version. That’s when parts of the macula thin with age and tiny clumps of protein, called drusen, grow.

The “wet” version is less common but more serious. It occurs when new, abnormal blood vessels grow under the retina. These vessels might leak blood or other fluids, causing scarring of the macula. Vision deteriorates faster with wet AMD.

AMD might develop in one or both eyes with different levels of severity but does not impact peripheral vision. Risk factors other than age include obesity, smoking, and more.

Regular eye examinations can help detect the onset of AMD. TRICARE covers routine exams every two years. Most separate vision insurance policies include at least one annual eye exam.

Medicare and TRICARE cover medically necessary treatments and diagnostic services for AMD. This includes anti-VEGF injections (which stands for “vascular endothelial growth factor”) and low-vision aids for wet AMD, along with preventive care.

[RELATED: How Much Will Your Medicare Part B Premium Rise in 2026?]

Photodynamic therapy, which combines eye injections and laser treatment, can help slow or halt the advance of the disease.

Dry AMD can turn into wet AMD. One low-vision aid that can help determine if your AMD is progressing is the Amsler grid. This is a square containing a grid pattern and a dot in the center. It can point to deteriorating spots in your field of vision.

There is no cure for AMD, but low-vision devices and technology can help maintain vision and improve your quality of life.",https://www.moaa.org/contentassets/ffa2e6acbfa446369703b4af9eb5fb96/eye-exam-h.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-08 18:56:35.295234

Kentucky Health News

Year two of the state’s Our Healthy Kentucky Home campaign will focus on the various programs and resources available to all Kentuckians that work to improve health.

November kicked off the second year of the campaign, with a focus on community health workers, who act as liaisons between health care providers and patients, improving communication, facilitating access to services and educating individuals on health-related issues.

This month, the campaign highlights Kynect, the state’s one-stop website that helps Kentuckians connect with essential support services, including the state-based marketplace for federally subsidized health insurance.

Kentucky’s health secretary, Dr. Steven Stack, reminded Kentuckians that open enrollment for federally subsidized health insurance plans on Kynect runs through Jan. 15. During this time, consumers can purchase a new plan or change plans for coverage year 2026.

Kentucky residents who don’t have coverage through an employer, Medicare, Medicaid, the Kentucky Children’s Health Insurance Program, or the Pentagon’s Tricare program can shop for individual coverage on Kynect.

To qualify for coverage beginning Jan. 1, Kentuckians need to sign up for their health plan by Dec. 15. Coverage for Kentuckians who enroll from Dec. 16 through Jan. 15 will start Feb. 1.

To sign up for coverage, Kentuckians can visit kynect.ky.gov or call 855-459-6328. The website also offers a prescreening tool to see if your family may be eligible for benefits.

Stack also encouraged Kentuckians to reach out to a “kynector” for help choosing a health plan that best suits their needs.

“These are trained professionals who provide free and unbiased guidance to help you enroll in health coverage and benefits, such as Medicaid, Kentucky Children’s Health Insurance Plan, qualified health plans and nutrition or child care assistance programs,” he said. “Licensed insurance agents can also assist at no cost to you in choosing a good plan for you.

“Whether you’re looking for an individual plan, family coverage or help paying your premiums, now is the time to act and let Kynect help link you to trusted options.”

Information about kynectors and licensed insurance agents can be found under the “Get Local Help” tab at the top of the Kynect website page.

Stack said 90,000 Kentuckians got insurance last year during the open enrollment period and so far this year, that number is just over 80,000.

“So we’ve got just under six weeks to close that gap and try to make sure that even more Kentuckians this year get coverage through the open enrollment period than last,” he said.

At a Nov. 18 ThriveKY meeting, David Verry, assistant director with the state’s Division of Health Plan Oversight, said that despite the loss of the enhanced tax credits that are set to expire on Dec. 31 if Congress doesn’t act to extend them, Kynect is “open for business” and that the process to enroll is the same as it has been before.

In addition to being able to apply for health insurance, including Medicaid and qualified health plans, Kynect is where Kentuckians sign up for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, apply for childcare assistance through the Child Care Assistance Program, get energy and heating help through the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, and find mental health, employment, housing and transportation resources through the community resource portal.

And with a nod to the first year of the Our Healthy Kentucky Home campaign, Stack said the state will continue its efforts to promote simple, attainable lifestyle changes and goals to help Kentuckians achieve better health and wellness, such as eating at least two servings or fruits and vegetables every day, exercising at least 30 minutes three times per week, and remaining socially engaged to stay socially connected.",https://lexingtonky.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/kynect_Overarching.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-08 15:57:09.078737

On Sunday, US lawmakers released the annual defense policy bill authorizing a record $901 billion in national defense spending in 2026. The bill was somehow $8 billion more than President Trump requested, and bans transgender women from competing in sports at military universities.

The 3,086-page bill states that the secretary of defense will ensure military academies do not permit a person “whose sex is male to participate in an athletic program or activity that is designated for women or girls.” The text codifies “sex” as “a person’s reproductive biology and genetics at birth.”

The bill has already been negotiated between Republicans and Democrats and is set to go to a House vote this week, likely leaving little room for significant changes.

But the new version does drop the ban on Defense Department funding on gender-affirming surgeries. Previous versions passed by both the House and the Senate incorporated the ban.

The House bill approved in September also prohibited gender transition services for family members through the Exceptional Family Member Program: “No gender transition procedures, including surgery or medication, may be provided to a minor dependent child through an EFMP.”

Last year’s National Defense Authorization Act restricted TRICARE, the health care program that provides civilian health benefits for US military personnel, their dependents, and retirees, from covering “certain medical procedures for children that could result in sterilization.”

The NDAA is must-pass legislation as it sets the defense budget and determines the policies it will apply to each year. NDAA laws from previous fiscal years thus have a knock-on effect, opening the door for lawmakers to flood the new bill with anti-trans provisions that would likely not pass on their own and force Democrats to block them while on limited time.

The House bill that was passed in September contains several anti-LGBT amendments in addition to the ban on “gender transition procedures” for servicemembers’ children. Many of Rep. Nancy Mace’s (R-S.C.) proposed additions were adopted—including prohibiting coverage for “gender-related medical treatment,” defined to include puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgeries, as well as mental health care for transgender young people and requiring the use of single-sex facilities such as restrooms and locker rooms according to their “reproductive system.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP221164851522011.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,0.0,2025-12-08 15:57:13.415506

“Speaker Johnson just stole the opportunity for service members to build their families through IVF, putting his personal beliefs over their dreams,” Jacobs said in a statement on Sunday.
“Like any American, Speaker Johnson is fully entitled to hold personal views on IVF and to make his own family building decisions accordingly,” Tipton said.
Julie Eshelman, founder, CEO and president of the Building Military Families Network, said in a statement to Military.com that Johnson’s message is “clear” and that military families’ goals of having a family by way of IVF are not as valued.
“Military families have waited far too long to access the full range of medical care needed to build their families.","House Speaker Mike Johnson praised the final version of the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) bill text released Sunday, saying it further promotes President Donald Trump’s “America First” agenda while eliminating a provision on IVF and undoing “woke” policies from the Biden administration.

The 3,086 page bill that could be voted on as soon as this week and typically passes Congress on bipartisan lines has a budget request that adds $8 billion to the $892.6 billion initially requested in Trump’s budget.

“This year’s National Defense Authorization Act helps advance President Trump and Republicans’ Peace Through Strength Agenda by codifying 15 of President Trump’s executive orders, ending woke ideology at the Pentagon, securing the border, revitalizing the defense industrial base, and restoring the warrior ethos,” Johnson said in a statement.

“This legislation includes important House-passed provisions to ensure our military forces remain the most lethal in the world and can deter any adversary. It roots out Biden-era wokeism in our military and restores merit-based promotions and admissions to service academies, prohibits contracts with partisan firms, counters antisemitism, and halts harmful, unnecessary programs like CRT, DEI, and climate initiatives,” the Speaker added.

NDAA Highlights

Johnson also noted the bill’s guardrails aimed to protect U.S. long-term investments, economic interests and sensitive data from adversaries like China.

Other highlights of the NDAA include the following:

Providing enlisted servicemembers with a 4% pay raise.

Strengthens U.S.-Israel military operations and cooperative missile defense programs.

Expanding counter-drone defenses and new technologies.

Advances the “Golden Dome” and enhances America’s nuclear deterrent and new nuclear power technologies.

Fully supports the deployment of National Guard and active-duty troops at the southwest border to intercept illegal immigrants and drugs.

Enhances U.S. defense initiatives in the Indo-Pacific to bolster Taiwan’s defense and support Indo-Pacific allies.

Revitalizes American shipbuilding and expands the Maritime Industrial Base.

Strengthens the defense industrial base and supply chains.

""The FY26 NDAA delivers on President Trump’s promise of peace through strength and ensures America can deter our adversaries and protect our homeland,” House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-AL) said in a statement. “This legislation builds on the wins from the Working Families Tax Cut, revitalizing our defense industrial base, improving our servicemembers’ quality of life, and building out critical warfighting capabilities.

“We’re also reforming the Pentagon’s broken, bureaucratic acquisition process so that our troops can quickly get the tools they need to deter our enemies, instead of waiting up to a decade while our adversaries field new technologies within months.”

IVF Provision Removal

Some Democrats and an array of reproductive organizations warned prior to the final version of the drafted bill text that the removal of a provision mandating health care coverage for assisted reproductive technology, including in vitro fertilization (IVF), for all active-duty service members was not going to make the cut.

They raised alarm that Johnson was targeting TRICARE, the insurance plan for service members and their families outside of military facilities that covers IVF for everyone regardless of health situations.

If it remains out of the version that passes Congress, it would prevent the expansion of IVF access to all servicemembers due to current insurance plans through TRICARE only covering fertility services for service members whose infertility was caused by “a serious or severe illness or injury while on active duty.”

Johnson made no mention of the IVF provision removal in his most recent statement. Military.com reached out to Johnson’s office for comment on that issue.

'Shame On Them'

Concerns expressed in Washington by Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-CA) ultimately came to fruition, at least as the bill is currently drawn.

“Republicans repeatedly make promises to the public that they support IVF, but their extreme actions tell a different story from their lip service during election years,” Duckworth said in a statement shared with Military.com. “Time and again when given the chance to make IVF available and affordable, they cave to far-right extremists who see families and their doctors as murderers. And for the second year in a row, our servicemembers are paying the price of that extremism.”

Duckworth focused her ire on Johnson and Trump, the latter for his various statements assuring to provide IVF to Americans at reduced or no cost. Trump referred to himself as the “father of IVF” while on the 2024 campaign trail.

“[Trump’s] proved he’s a deadbeat dad by not only failing to make IVF free for anyone but standing by as Speaker Johnson undermined one of his key campaign promises and stripped coverage from servicemembers behind closed doors that both the House and Senate approved. Shame on them,” Duckworth said.

She added that Johnson’s actions are “deeply hypocritical” considering that military heroes do not receive the same care and access that congressional members receive.

Duckworth and Jacobs earlier this year passed the TRICARE provisions on bipartisan votes in the Senate and House. Now, that’s in jeopardy.

“Speaker Johnson just stole the opportunity for service members to build their families through IVF, putting his personal beliefs over their dreams,” Jacobs said in a statement on Sunday. “It’s an unbelievably selfish and callous move against people who’ve served and sacrificed so much for us, especially when he and his own staff have access to health care plans that provide IVF coverage.

“I’m also disappointed that President Trump failed to do anything to change Speaker Johnson’s position on this issue despite his alleged love for our military and supposed support for IVF. But the fight isn’t over.”

When asked by Military.com whether she would still vote for a defense policy package that omits such IVF-related care, a spokesperson for Jacobs said the congresswoman is still reviewing the entire bill in full and that it remains undetermined whether she will support it.

“She did vote against it in committee and on the House Floor this year,” the spokesperson said. “I can’t speak for the caucus but the NDAA typically passes with bipartisan support.”

Other Legislative Avenues For IVF

National fertility and reproductive organizations lamented the final NDAA text, saying that if the bill forges on without aid for IVF then it puts Republicans at odds with the president’s own publicly stated remarks on the issue.

Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, said in a statement shared with Military.com that the final text implies ‘unilateral” decision making by Johnson himself.

“Like any American, Speaker Johnson is fully entitled to hold personal views on IVF and to make his own family building decisions accordingly,” Tipton said. “What he is not entitled to do is override the will of Congress and strip away a provision that was negotiated during committee markups and ultimately approved by both the House and Senate on the floor—particularly at the eleventh hour of NDAA negotiations and without transparency.

“Actions taken in this manner—out of sight, without debate, and contrary to broad bipartisan agreement—are precisely why public trust in today’s Congressional leadership has eroded.”

Should the provision be left out, Tipton suggested a standalone floor vote on the IVF for Military Families Act so that every congressional member’s vote could be on record for the American people to judge.

Julie Eshelman, founder, CEO and president of the Building Military Families Network, said in a statement to Military.com that Johnson’s message is “clear” and that military families’ goals of having a family by way of IVF are not as valued.

“Our military families already sacrifice so much for this country and denying them the same level of healthcare access that the Speaker himself has, is disrespectful to the brave men and women who are willing to sacrifice their lives and fertility in service to our country,” Eshelman said. “While we are deeply disappointed the IVF provision was excluded from the final version of the NDAA, we don't think Congress should delay passing it any further.”

Echoing Tipton, Eshelman said Congress can “still pass meaningful legislation to improve access to care and all family building options for military and veteran families” by voting for bills like the IVF for Military Families Act and the Veterans Infertility Treatment Act of 2025.

Danielle Melfi, CEO of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, said in a statement provided to Military.com that the removal of IVF coverage “is a dishonor to our servicemembers who make extraordinary sacrifices for our freedoms.”

“There was bipartisan support for this coverage, and its exclusion fails to advance President Trump’s call to expand IVF access,” Melfi said. “Military families have waited far too long to access the full range of medical care needed to build their families. RESOLVE will not stop fighting until every American has access to the care they need to build the family they dream of.”

Stand with Speaker Johnson Against Expanding IVF in Military Health Coverage: Do Pro-lifers Mean What They Say?

Sometimes there are issues with really big worldview significance that don’t get a lot of national attention, and they should because for one thing, today we’re going to be talking about a national issue that is a very important pro-life issue. This has to do with IVF, assisted reproductive technologies, IVF, in vitro fertilization. This is the process whereby the male and the female cell are brought together in a laboratory setting. Embryos are created. And in the general process, the general application of the IVF procedure, multiple embryos are made and that’s one of the big problems.

There’s a fundamental problem I would argue with alienating the process from the conjugal act, that is to say from the act of marriage. But the larger significance is the fact that pro-lifers have to look at the discarding and destruction of these embryos. Also, the sorting and quality screening of these embryos, something that is deeply, inherently, morally, murderously wrong. And the IVF is right now a very crucial issue in one particular respect. This has to do with TRICARE, the reauthorization for the medical coverage for military personnel in the US armed forces, particularly for medical facilities outside of the military facilities themselves.

Now, this is a big issue because you’re talking about millions of Americans within the US military covered by this. And you had people in both the House and in the Senate. Representative Sarah Jacobs in the House. Senator Tammy Duckworth in the Senate. They’ve been pressing for the full inclusion of IVF for all personnel. Now, this is really a much bigger issue than it may even sound at first. And it was Speaker Johnson who pulled this out of the authorization bill last year out of the insurance coverage for TRICARE. And he is doing it again and he is under direct fire. He deserves our support.

There’s a very important reason why at this juncture this has to take place. And the forces against the speaker are coming out in full force. And quite honestly, this is a situation that may well divide some Republicans. And indeed, one of the big questions is how President Donald Trump will respond to this himself. President Trump has identified himself with IVF treatments and has said that one of the goals of his administration is to make those treatments more available to American, he always says basically to American couples who want to have children. What is not even acknowledged in a lot of this conversation is that there are so many multiple issues, and one of them has to do with the fact that if you just put this out there available through, say, insurance policies, or in this case, this policy, this entire program for medical coverage for US military personnel, then there are going to have to be some strictures.

And the strictures thus far when it comes to IVF has been that IVF was available only to heterosexual couples when there was a military reason, an injury, or some other reason for why the IVF was made necessary. So it wasn’t just blanket IVF coverage, even for married heterosexual couples in the military. It was for some linkage to a military cause. And that has left some couples very frustrated, but it’s not just couples. And I want to point out something that several military advocacy sites have noted.

For example, military.com, which is a news site, reminds us of this, “A Biden era Defense Department policy in March 2024 expanded TRICARE eligibility for infertility treatments to unmarried service members and those needing donated eggs or sperm, adding onto a previous policy when the Department of Defense only offered such treatments to certain married service members.” So here’s 2024, President Biden, the Biden administration, enlarging that so that marriage isn’t an issue.

All right. So even then, however, there were some people who didn’t have access, and so listen to the next sentence, “Eggs or sperm donated by a third party were also prohibited by the Department of Defense at that juncture, effectively barring same-sex couples from the benefit.” Okay. So the way that it would stand if blanket coverage is given is that it would be blanket coverage. And that even means that individual service members, unmarried, who want to have a child by IVF could call upon this policy and upon this medical coverage.

This is a very, very important issue. This is where we either stand or fall when it comes to the pro life movement. And when pro life conviction, when people who hold to those convictions say very clearly that our belief is that life begins at fertilization and life is to be protected from the point of fertilization. And by the way, that’s the only logical point, it’s the only theologically viable point at which we can possibly make the argument. If you say it’s at some point thereafter, then all you have is an argument about which point, which could take you all the way up to the point of birth. And that’s exactly the way this argument has operated. This is the way the abortion argument has unfolded.

This is why we have to keep pressing back to an objectively true point. When life begins, when God says, “Let there be life,” and that point is when the sperm and the egg come together and we believe–let’s remind ourselves of this–we believe that that should take place within the context, the conjugal context of marriage, the union of a man and a woman before God. And at the very least, we should not be paying for. The very issue as to whether these things should be available legally. You know my position on that. But to force the American taxpayer to pay for it, even beyond that, is really a stretch. And in this case, I think we need to acknowledge that Speaker Mike Johnson who is already in a very difficult position, just because of the small margin that Republicans have in the house and all kinds of political pressures from within the Republicans themselves, we need to support Speaker Johnson in this particular effort. And those on the other side are going at him full bore. And they are also trying to work the Republican Party and they’re trying to work the White House into forcing the speaker to back down on this issue.

It reminds us of how important elections are. Every single election. The speaker of the House is elected to the House by his congressional district there in Louisiana. He is elected by fellow Republicans in the majority to the office of speaker. If Republicans aren’t the majority, he simply becomes the Republican leader. And what you’re looking at in this case is the fact that this is incredible political pressure and an incredibly delicate moment. And with so many other things piling on in terms of big issues at the end of the year, this is one of those issues that should have the attention of Christians and Christians need to understand what is at stake.

I have gone through page after page of legislative and media material on this going into the background. And I think most Christians and most pro lifers would be very surprised to know how long advocates for the inclusion of IVF have been working in terms of the US military. And sometimes from within the military, sometimes on behalf of military personnel. But we just need to recognize that we have multiple problems here and one of them is that once you even offer this, the question is, how do you exclude anyone? And long term, I think we all know, just look at the people pushing this, everyone will be included and everyone’s going to mean everyone.

And so we’re looking at multiple levels of moral collapse. It’s a subversion of marriage, it’s a subversion of sexual morality and it’s a subversion of the sanctity of human life. We just need to understand that on this issue, things are not moving in our direction. And that’s just something we need to recognize. The culture is pressing really hard on this issue. And I think of the president, for example, President Trump speaking about this, speaking of couples who want to have children, I understand he has the right heartfelt concern there.

But by the time this is put into law, by the way, it won’t even be restricted to couples, much less a man and a wife. The Supreme Court’s decision on same-sex marriage pretty much took care of that. It’s always been hard to have to show up all the time in defense of human life. It’s never been easy. And the things are getting more complicated all the time. And that just means we have to bring even more conviction and more clarity to these issues.

One other related issue, by the way, that’s just much lower, frankly, in terms of moral significance is the money because the cost of this, if it’s approved as Senator Duckworth and others have pushed, it will be astronomical. That’s not my main concern, but you would think of nothing else that would get the attention of some Republicans. It’s a big concern.

Part II

‘I Got Myself in Good Trouble’: Former President Biden Brags About His Contributions to the LGBTQ Revolution

All right. So we just talked about what the Biden administration had attempted to do on this issue in 2024. The former president is back in the news, and he’s back in the news because of an address he gave just in recent days to the LGBTQ+ Victory Institute. The New York Times defines that as, “An organization that supports LGBTQ people in public office.” The particular issue here is also the context. Former President Biden is in a very weak position at the present. He’s in a very weakened political position. Even people in his own party don’t generally want to be seen with him. He’s having difficulty raising money for a presidential library.

Democrats generally want to try to forget the Biden administration, at least in terms of the end, and they especially want to try to forget the 2024 presidential election. They want to just move on. And it’s also true that the former president is in a weakened physical condition. He’s fighting a diagnosis of advanced prostate cancer, and he’s had other issues as well. And so his appearances in public have been fairly rare. That makes this one even more important, more worthy of our attention.

As Amy Harmon reports, “Former President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. on Friday offered a defense of his support for transgender rights, addressing an issue that has prompted debate and soul searching among Democrats, some of whom attribute losses in 2024 to a focus on identity politics.” Well, okay. So a focus on identity politics, but you know what? The way that the article began was honest. It’s not just identity politics. It is the specific identity politics of the transgender movement. And there is no doubt that played out in a big way in the 2024 presidential election and also in other dimensions of that election.

It played apparently a lesser role in the 2025 off-year elections, but so those elections are not necessarily a bellwether of anything other than say a political direction party by party. The point is that President Biden was pushing the transgender agenda, just like he pushed the same sex marriage agenda ahead of his own party.

And so he was basically bragging to this group about the fact that he had in effect pushed former President Barack Obama, he was serving at that time as President Obama’s vice president into support for same-sex marriage, by mentioning it out loud before President Obama was prepared to. He said he basically didn’t regret that. He said, “I got myself in a bit of trouble, good trouble,” he said. But of course, all of this is reflective of the fact that you have to consider that the former President also had a very long, very long tenure in the United States Senate.

And then he ran for president, ran for president more than once, had to withdraw, was certainly not a leading candidate in the 2008 round, but ended up being chosen by Barack Obama who won the Democratic nomination as his vice president. Former President Biden has always been gaff prone and yet he’s also changed a lot of his positions. And you look at same-sex marriage, you’re looking an array of some of these issues, even some of the transgender issues, he knows he changed his positions in his view to get on the right side of history. And in this address Friday, he was speaking to a group that thought he was on the right side of history. They’re on the same side of this issue and pushing very, very hard.

It is really interesting to see what the former president had to say. And when it came to transgender issues, it’s really clear he was pushing them. No less than 16 members of his administration were publicly identified as transgender.

In his address, the claim was made that about 15% of his appointees identified as LGBTQ. Now, I’ll just point out that that’s a much higher percentage than activist groups have historically claimed for the LGBTQ percentage in the population. So that’s another way of saying. We all knew President Biden was sending a message. We knew that he knew he was sending a message and we, and he both knew what message he was sending. He came to this LGBTQ activist group on Friday to brag about that activism.

Biden was also proud of the fact that in 2022, he signed the Respect for Marriage Act, which was an attempt to try to put in place federal legislation. It was a successful attempt. The legislation passed. It doesn’t guarantee a right to marriage in all 50 states, but it says that every state must recognize a legally issued marriage certificate from a state that does approve of same-sex marriage, which means basically the same thing. You might not be able to get a same-sex marriage in every state if the Supreme Court’s decision on Obergefell were to be reversed. Of course, that’s out there in the future. The point is this was activism on the part of Congress, activism on the part of the White House, and they get it through in 2022.

I think it’s also important to look at some of the comments made here in this article, Evan Low, president and chief executive of this group, the LGBTQ+ Victory Institute, “Said that Mr. Biden had been intentional about understanding that a historically marginalized community can participate fully and openly in our democracy.” What you need to note there is the doubling down on identity politics because this is a group. By the way, groups don’t vote, citizens vote. They may be members of any number of groups and they still have the right to vote. This is really not about the right to vote. When they say participated democracy here, they’re talking about the affirmation of their sexual identity and their lifestyle.

We also read this, “Mr. Biden’s support for transgender rights stands in contrast to the Trump administration’s efforts to impose strict limits on transgender people, including requiring that US passports reflect the sex on people’s original birth certificates, a reversal of a decade’s old policy. Mr. Trump has called transgender teenagers, mutilated and barred transgender people from serving in the military, asserting that having a transgender identity is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of people who serve in the US military forces.”

It’s a very interesting point made here, by the way, that President Trump has appointed a number of openly gay men to his administration, but not transgendered individuals. It shows you something of a line in the Trump administration. It’s something of a line in the culture too, and this is where it is clear that the culture writ large is rethinking the T in LGBTQ and has been, especially when it comes to, say, private spaces such as locker rooms and bathrooms, and especially when it comes to males in those spaces, and when it comes to especially minors, to children and teenagers, but also to women in women’s sports, girls’ sports.

You’re looking at, let’s just say, very legitimate concerns and they have resonated with the American people. The Democratic Party, by the way, and this is also clear in the background to all of this, the Democratic Party recognizes that the transgender issue lost them a lot in 2024. They are at least claiming that they don’t think it lost them so much in 2025 and the recent off-year elections, and yet they’re not going to avoid having to deal with this issue in 2026 and in 2028, and especially in 2028, the next presidential round.

And so they can say, “We don’t want to make this an issue. We don’t think the American people want to make it an issue.” But it’s going to be really interesting to see how this argument shapes up in the larger context, the larger political and national context, because I don’t think most parents are going to become friendlier to the idea of boys on their girls team, or boys in the girls’ bathroom, or for that matter, men beating women in women’s sports. I don’t think that’s going to get better.

Now, that doesn’t mean that I think most Americans have a comprehensively healthy and accurate understanding of these things. I’m telling you that Christians have a reason for explaining there’s a moral intuition. We believe it’s put there by the creator. It’s in creation order, that is at least, well, it’s showing up in the resistance to the transgender agenda and it’s showing up in a big way. So much so that we see an interesting development, we’ll talk about more on briefings to come in which you have some gay men in particular who are now openly complaining about transgender identity being lumped into one group. “We’re not one thing,” they’re saying. And of course they’re not. Many of us said that all along, but they are united in rejecting biblical commands. They are united in rejecting creation order to a greater or a lesser extent, and they are united in terms of the moral agenda.

Before I leave this story, I just want to go back to the language that is just routinely used and it’s a matter of heartbreak to notice this. So just even trying to take this out of politics for a moment, it’s the President, the former President who’s making the statement, former President Biden. He said as the story comes to a conclusion, “Because of our national debate on LGBTQ issues,” he said, “there are young people sitting alone as I speak, scrolling through social media, wondering whether they will ever truly be accepted for who they are. ” The former president said evidently as if he were addressing those young people, “You are heard and you belong.” And we’re told he said that to a standing ovation.

Okay. So here’s the thing, the crucial language is they’re wondering whether they will ever truly be accepted for who they are. That is a seismically important statement for who they are. It all comes down to who they are. It all comes down to who determines who they are. It all comes down to whether or not their bodies, by God’s intention, tell them who they are. And in this case, we know what the former President’s point is. We know he’s trying to say that whatever they feel themselves to be, that’s what they are.

We have to resist that. We have to resist the idea that it is those who hold to a biblical worldview who are not telling people they’re free to be who they are. That is exactly the point we are trying to make. It’s the question as to where in the world they come to know, how in the world they come to know who they are. There is simply no way that Christians can come to a biblical understanding that says that who they are is separate from the body that God gave them.

The Battle for Your Entertainment Attention: Netflix and Warner Bros. Agree to Seismic Deal – This is a Battle For Much More Than Your Entertainment

All right. Finally, there were some really big business news also breaking over the weekend, and that is that Netflix announced that it is going to buy Warner Brothers, the famed Hollywood Studio, and much of that Warner Brothers Empire for $83 billion. Okay, so that’s $83 billion. According to most reports, Netflix had never made a purchase of even a billion dollars, now $83 billion.

Now, why in the world would a streaming service, this vast platform, Netflix, why would it want to buy Warner Brothers? And a part of the deal is that they’re not buying some parts of Warner Brothers, including some parts of the empire like CNN, but they are agreeing that they will continue in theater distribution, they don’t say for how long, of Warner Brothers movies, and that’s something quite unexpected because the leadership at Netflix, it actually made fun of theater saying that that was much a part of the past and not so much of the future.

Well, now I guess they’re counting on it being a part of the future, at least for some term, because they’re putting $83 billion on the line. Now, this is going to have to go through review process. It’s going to have to go through antitrust review and all of that. And there are enemies of this plan. But the fact is that these two giants wouldn’t have agreed to this unless they think it’s going to go through.

Now, I want to bring up one of the issues that I think will come up in that kind of antitrust challenge, and that is whether or not this reduces the number of companies that are operating in terms of entertainment media. And it does mean that. There’s no doubt it means that. And if they weren’t trying to economize, this deal wouldn’t make any sense. They’re going to try to cut down the cost at Warner Brothers, and they’re going to try to bring in more profits to Netflix. Otherwise, there’s no purpose to the deal. That’s the only way the deal works.

But you can hear some people saying, “Look, this is too much consolidation in the hands of one company.” And this gets into some very deep waters in the antitrust matters. But I just want to point out from a Christian perspective, this shows further consolidation in these giant companies of the entertainment attention of the American people. And at the very least, this ought to have some attention from Christians. We ought to be more thoughtful about the media we consume than others are. We understand more is at stake. We understand that what we let in our eyes, what we let in our headphones, we’re also effectively letting into our brains and effectively letting into our hearts.

And we need to know that others are too, including the little kid with the iPad screen and the teenager with the ear pods. This is a huge problem and we are huge consumers of entertainment. For most of human history, think about this, for most of human history, people saw very little entertainment. They consumed very little entertainment. They might see a play, maybe somewhere they might see some work of art in public somewhere, but their access to entertainment was basically members of their own family, their own extended community, and in their neighborhood. That was basically it.

And entertainment had a place, of course, in every society, that’s why you have surviving plays from ancient Greece and you’ve got artifacts and cultural products from ancient peoples all over the world. But now we’re talking about an entertainment world that is 24/7. It’s all around us. It’s everywhere. It’s all accessible. It’s privatized. It’s no longer in the main a group experience. That’s why Netflix made fun of the theaters. My guess is they’re not going to make fun of them anymore, but nobody thinks theaters are the wave of the future.

Everybody knows that the streaming platform is hungry for more content and it’s hungry for more contracts. It’s hungry for more customers and for more contact hours. That’s what’s behind all of this. It’s a battle for your eyes. It’s a battle for your ears. It’s a battle for your attention. It is a battle for your hearts. It’s an $83 billion deal. Just let that settle in, $83 billion.

This company is putting its own existence at risk. Netflix is basically putting itself at risk in an $83 billion deal. They wouldn’t be making it if they didn’t think it was pretty much a sure fire win. We need to know, and think about the fact that someone is paying $83 billion just for a bit more chance to have our attention. That ought to have our attention.",https://cf.albertmohler.com/uploads/2025/12/gettyimages-2249635311.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-08 15:57:54.791955
