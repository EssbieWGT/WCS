The test of the Operational Medicine Care Delivery Platform (OpMed CDP) was conducted between Dec. 1 and Dec. 12 aboard the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS Carney. The effort was led by Navy Medicine, which includes more than 44,000 military and civilian health care professionals supporting forces at sea and ashore.

OpMed CDP was developed by the Joint Operational Medicine Information System (JOMIS) under the Program Executive Office for Defense Healthcare Management Systems as part of a broader modernization of military health information technology.

The pilot was carried out in partnership with the Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, U.S. Fleet Forces Command, Commander, Naval Surface Force Atlantic, Commander, Naval Medical Forces Atlantic, and JOMIS to evaluate the system’s functionality for fleet use.

During the trial, Carney’s crew received training designed to help users document and access electronic health records efficiently. The system is intended to support a range of medical functions, including pharmacy services, laboratory work, and routine medical visits, while maintaining connectivity with the Military Health System’s MHS GENESIS platform.

“The JOMIS ecosystem will transform the way our clinicians, physicians, and corpsmen provide care to warfighters in operational settings to maintain patient data flow through the continuum of care,” said. Lt. Cmdr. Erik Lawrence, the Navy’s chief nursing informatics officer for JOMIS, said in a statement.

Lawrence added that the system is intended to improve continuity of care in operational environments.

Hospital Corpsman 3rd Class Johnny Percadoni, assigned to Carney, said the hands-on training allowed crew members to provide feedback as they learned the new system.

“We’re still learning how it works, but the team has been really helpful with answering questions and listening to feedback,” Percadoni said. “It’s a different day and a new system, but I think it’s going to become a lot more prevalent and useful for us.”

Following the initial test, Naval Surface Force Atlantic approved moving OpMed CDP into an extended pilot phase to further assess its performance and reliability.

Cmdr. John de Geus, the Navy’s chief health informatics officer, said the software has been developed over the past three and a half years to support medical decision-making and provide data to operational commanders in real time.

“A successful fielding isn’t just about delivering software; it’s about delivering the right capability,” de Geus said.

Once all testing phases are complete, Carney is expected to become the first ship to use OpMed CDP for daily medical operations. Navy officials said the phased fielding approach is intended to support a disciplined rollout across the fleet while incorporating user feedback and aligning with operational readiness cycles.",https://meritalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/shutterstock_3558313-min.jpg,N,0.0,2026-01-05 18:56:23.500878

The new enterprise-wide process reduces administrative burdens and addresses long-standing concerns with the privileging process.
“We needed to increase readiness and increase efficiency in our privileging process,” said Dr. Todd Poindexter, DHA’s chief of credentialing and privileging.
When transferring between MHS entities, health care providers will now sign an attestation for an approved scope of work.
A health care provider’s current privileges will now remain valid at any MHS entity for the duration of their existing term.","Through meticulous, rigorous training, the Defense Health Agency launched a streamlined provider-privileging process that allows health care providers to care for patients right away in any military hospital or clinic.

As of Oct. 15, 2025, Military Health System providers will retain their clinical privileges when moving between stateside and overseas military hospitals, clinics, and deployed settings. The new enterprise-wide process reduces administrative burdens and addresses long-standing concerns with the privileging process.

“We needed to increase readiness and increase efficiency in our privileging process,” said Dr. Todd Poindexter, DHA’s chief of credentialing and privileging. “DHA was charged with making changes, and we are no longer requiring an additional privileging action just because a provider moved locations.”

The DHA effort was “an amazing project. I have not seen anything this big, this fast, in the military medical system,” he said. “Almost no one in the country has this ease of movement among facilities — and in this instance, not only among facilities, but even from a military treatment facility to a deployed location.”

DHA’s diligent preparation

Training and education were a vital part in bringing the new process to life.

Leading up to the rollout, DHA trained nearly 1,000 individuals across credentialing and privileging staff, as well as chief medical officers and senior department heads. The multiple training sessions were followed by office hours and an open line for trainee questions.“ It was detailed so that each group knew exactly what was expected of them and how they would be able to do it,” Poindexter said.

DHA then sent out a needs assessment asking the various groups what future things would be most helpful for them. The DHA credentialing and privileging team wanted to “make sure we understood exactly what their further needs were so that we could then provide any additional training to meet the needs of the people who had to fulfill this process,” Poindexter said.

The new system is an exciting industry innovation, he added, and was accomplished in an amazingly short time considering its scale. He also noted that the effort unified all of military medicine for efficient patient care while maintaining appropriate safety mechanisms.

“It applies everywhere, not just DHA,” Poindexter said. “While DHA is responsible for the MTFs, all of those representatives — the surgeon generals, Army, Navy, Air Force and the DHA director — make up one large Military Health System.”

Provider privileging necessary for quality

Privileging is central to clinical quality assurance and patient safety. To acquire privileges, a provider’s scope of practice is determined through a thorough review of their training, accumulated experience, current competence and health status, as well as input from peers and department leaders.

In the past, under an installation-based system, each military hospital or clinic operated its own privileging process, requiring providers to undergo a full review every time they relocated. If a provider’s qualifications and duration of privileges for the same scope of practice were valid at one military hospital or clinic, the process had to be repeated if they moved to another.

According to Poindexter, the overall onboarding process was complicated and could delay patient access to care.

The new goal, he said, is to complete the credentialing and privileging portion of the onboarding process expeditiously with an authorization to practice decision within five business days — ideally, even before the provider gets to the new location — so that there would be no additional credentialing and privileging actions required once “boots are on the ground,” he said, noting this change along with other onboarding process changes ensures well-organized provider transitions.

“By being able to transfer providers more easily and shortening the time it takes for the onboarding process, we're moving providers more quickly into an operational environment which would increase readiness and force projection,” he said.

‘Significant change’ for faster, more flexible care

Under the revised MHS-wide policy, an approved health care provider will now receive privileges from a MHS privileging authority, which is part of a unified governing body.

“In our old system, every single location was its own entity. When you left, you had to start over. Now, we are operating as a closed system under an overarching MHS governing body,” Poindexter said.

When transferring between MHS entities, health care providers will now sign an attestation for an approved scope of work. System-wide privileges will last for a period of three years.

A health care provider’s current privileges will now remain valid at any MHS entity for the duration of their existing term. Once privileges expire, they can be renewed at the health care provider’s current duty station for a term of three years.

The rigorous standards for earning clinical privileges remain unchanged, and the update does not alter the credentialing requirements or safeguards built into the quality assurance process. Providers will continue to be accountable for safe patient care at whichever facility they are working.

By simplifying movement across the MHS while preserving these protections, Poindexter said the process is designed to speed workflows, reduce delays, and support an agile, unified medical force that can respond swiftly to operational demands.

He credited the effort to a “great DHA team. There were so many people who have worked really hard on this. We have been a part of a very significant change.""",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2601/9468545/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2026-01-05 18:56:26.423182

The overarching theme reveals a systemic challenge within the Marine Corps recruitment framework, where the drive for high enlistment numbers often places ethical considerations in precarious balance.","Recruiting efforts for the Marine Corps in certain regions of the United States, particularly the Rust Belt, have faced significant challenges, culminating in reports of widespread fraudulent practices among recruiters. A recent investigation by Business Insider into the 4th Marine Corps District has uncovered alarming instances of rule-breaking, including the use of forged police records and fake medical documentation.

Interviews with two recruiters who were dismissed due to their involvement in these activities reveal the intense pressures faced by staff. One of the former recruiters, Staff Sgt. Calvin Grimes, provided insight into the tactics employed within the recruiting environment, including the creation of electronic templates used to forge a variety of documents such as medical clearances and diplomas. He described the internal turmoil of having to engage in deceit, stating, “You have to live with that feeling that your heart’s beating out of your chest ready to explode.”

The investigation highlighted that of the ten Marines in the field between 2018 and 2024, five admitted to engaging in unethical practices to meet their monthly goal of enlisting two new recruits. The pressures intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic, which posed further complications in reaching potential candidates as traditional recruiting avenues were disrupted.

Moreover, the introduction of the Military Health System Genesis created additional hurdles for recruiters. This medical data system flagged applicants for minor issues that could lead to extended delays in the enlistment process. As a result, recruiters felt compelled to expedite applications through unethical means, like forging documents to bypass these obstacles.

The culture surrounding recruitment pressures was vividly illustrated by former Gunnery Sgt. Logan Krivak, who, during his tenure in the Marines, faced the fraught dynamics of an amped-up demand to deliver results amid overwhelming stress. Reflecting on his experience, Krivak noted that the environment had shifted over time, leading some to question the integrity of their work. His own experience with faking a required police document led to an investigation and ultimate dismissal, which he stated left him feeling conflicted about the morality of his actions versus the expectations set by his superiors.

Grimes echoed these sentiments, revealing that from the very beginning of his recruiting career, there was an implicit acceptance of bending the rules. “You have to do what you have to do to be successful,” his supervisor had encouraged, contributing to a cycle of dishonesty that seemed to normalize rule-breaking as a necessary means to an end.

While the Marine Corps maintains that fraud isn’t a widespread issue, it does seem to be more prevalent in areas facing the toughest recruiting challenges. Some current and former recruiters confirmed that they had not witnessed fraudulent practices, although they did acknowledge that those working under immense pressure sometimes succumbed to temptation.

Addressing the situation, a Marine Corps Recruiting Command spokesman stated that they have mechanisms in place to monitor and mitigate fraud. This includes conducting thorough quality control checks throughout the enlistment process and reviewing records rigorously when recruits arrive at boot camp. However, recruiters have indicated that while progress has been made since the pandemic—particularly in streamlining the waiver process and expanding recruiting hubs—the fundamental issue of pressure to meet quotas remains a significant concern.

The overarching theme reveals a systemic challenge within the Marine Corps recruitment framework, where the drive for high enlistment numbers often places ethical considerations in precarious balance. As recruiters continue to navigate this complex landscape, there is an ongoing debate about how best to meet recruitment goals without compromising integrity.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Marine-Recruiters-Resort-to-Fraud-Amidst-Intense-Quota-Pressures-in.jpeg,N,0.0,2026-01-05 14:56:37.003837

For government contractors supporting health IT, enterprise systems integration and digital transformation, the FEHRM fireside chat at the 2025 Healthcare Summit is expected to be one of the most consequential conversations on the agenda.

Why Should GovCons Pay Attention to FEHRM Now?

The Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization program has moved decisively beyond initial deployment and into a phase defined by optimization, interoperability and future capability delivery, with MHS GENESIS now fully deployed across the Military Health System.

With the common federal EHR in place, FEHRM’s focus has shifted toward enhancing performance, integrating user feedback and enabling advanced capabilities, including artificial intelligence, virtual care and data-driven clinical decision support. These efforts are central to how the Military Health System is rethinking care delivery, not only in hospitals and clinics, but also in deployed and contested environments.

For government contractors, this transition signals sustained demand for expertise in system optimization, analytics, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, AI enablement and legacy system retirement. As FEHRM works to ensure the EHR can support real-time data sharing from battlefield settings to stateside facilities and veteran care environments, industry partners will play a critical role in helping the platform scale, adapt and remain resilient.

The Healthcare Summit fireside chat offers GovCons a rare opportunity to hear directly from FEHRM leadership about how requirements are evolving now that MHS GENESIS is operational, and where industry support will be most impactful in the next phase of modernization.

Bill Tinston serves as director of the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization office, overseeing the implementation and continued evolution of a single, common federal EHR across multiple agencies.

Tinston brings more than 30 years of experience in defense acquisition, enterprise IT and portfolio management. He previously served as program executive officer for the Program Executive Office, Defense Healthcare Management Systems, where he led deployment of the Department of War’s EHR and worked closely with VA and the Coast Guard to align systems and workflows.

Before joining PEO DHMS, Tinston held senior executive roles at the Defense Logistics Agency, including program executive officer, where he oversaw major automated information systems and served as milestone decision authority for enterprise programs.

He holds a bachelor’s in business and information systems, is Defense Acquisition University Level III-certified in program management and information technology, and has received honors including the DLA Meritorious Civilian Service Award.

Tinston has consistently emphasized the importance of EHR systems that support clinical and operational decision-making without allowing IT constraints to dictate outcomes, a theme expected to feature prominently in the summit discussion.

Who Is Cori Hughes?

Cori Hughes serves as director of program integration for the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization office and also holds the same role for the Program Executive Office, Defense Healthcare Management Systems.

In these positions, Hughes manages FEHRM’s cross-cutting integration efforts, including communications, government affairs, risk and issue management, integrated scheduling and performance optimization across federal stakeholders.

She also oversees public and government affairs activities for PEO DHMS, including congressional engagement, audit coordination and external communications related to EHR modernization.

Before joining FEHRM, Hughes supported senior leaders across the Department of War as a contractor, including within the Defense Health Agency and offices responsible for health affairs, acquisition and sustainment and personnel and readiness.

What Will the FEHRM Fireside Chat Cover?

At the 2025 Healthcare Summit, Tinston and Hughes’ fireside chat will explore how FEHRM leaders are building on the full deployment of MHS GENESIS to support a more connected, technology-enabled Military Health System.

Discussion topics are expected to include how the federal EHR is enabling virtual care, real-time consultation and advanced data sharing, including deployed and theater-specific use cases where specialists can support frontline medics remotely. The conversation will also address how FEHRM is preparing the EHR environment to support AI-driven tools, reduce administrative burden for providers and improve continuity of care as service members transition from active duty to veteran status.

As legacy systems are retired, FEHRM leaders are also expected to discuss the technical and operational challenges of maintaining an evergreen EHR platform, including cybersecurity considerations, performance in contested environments and integration with emerging technologies that support readiness and patient outcomes.

For attendees, the session will provide concrete insight into how FEHRM is translating deployment success into long-term capability growth, and what that means for contractors supporting health IT, data modernization and digital health innovation.

Why Register for the 2025 Healthcare Summit?

Potomac Officers Club’s 2025 Healthcare Summit gives GovCons direct exposure to the strategies and technologies shaping federal healthcare modernization. In addition to keynote-level conversations, the event will feature panel discussions focused on:

Accelerating healthcare delivery to improve benefits access and strengthen public confidence

Streamlining government health operations through modern IT solutions that drive efficiency and mission impact

It's been a while since I lived there, but I was a dependent back then. For the most part they would refer you if you needed any specialist. The only thing I've used since joining the Air Force is the pharmacy for my spouse or children while on leave. The pharmacy sucks every time I use it. It's about 45 minutes to activate a prescription and then 45 minutes for it to be ready. Either way, you can still use walgreens or any other pharmacy that takes Tricare and have a prescription ready quicker and, for dependents, you pay a tiny fraction of the cost. The only reason I use it there is because they're refills, not new prescriptions.

I'd say stick with prime and then only switch if getting into the PCM is too much of a hassle. You'd be fine there. I'm at Goodfellow right now and it makes no sense to be on select because your wait time to see a civilian doctor is ridiculously long.

Hubby works as a mechanic technician for the army. Unfortunately, his salary disqualifies him from Tricare so he is on a healthcare plan with SelectHealth through his job. It seems to take a decent amount out of his check and benefits are so/so.

I'm currently on my parents insurance but I turn 26 in a few months so I'll be kicked off at that point. I will also be finishing a limited term internship the same month as my birthday so I will (hopefully) be transitioning to a new job around that same time that will be full time and likely offer benefits.

As a military spouse should I just get on Tricare and not sign up for any healthcare plans through my employer? Are Tricare benefits and cost typically better than what I could be offered through other major healthcare insurance providers?

I also have to consider that hubby and I want to have kids within a couple years and I've heard that Tricare is really good for families including covering all delivery costs at the hospital etc. Also, I might have some employment gaps so I can stay at home once I start having kids.

There is also, of course, the option of getting added onto my husband's healthcare plan with SelectHealth. Not sure if that will somehow be cheaper or easier than me being on Tricare separate from him but obviously I want the best coverage I can get.
