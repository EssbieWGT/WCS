The Pentagon leader said the contracts amounted to “nonessential spending” on third-party consultants for services “more efficiently” performed by the department’s workforce using existing resources.
“That’s a lot of consulting.” Hegseth said a Defense Health Agency contract for consulting services from Accenture, Deloitte, Booz Allen and other firms was discontinued alongside an Air Force contract with Accenture to resell third-party enterprise cloud IT services.
A Navy contract for business process consulting services was also eliminated as was a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s contract for IT helpdesk services was canceled, according to Hegseth.

The Pentagon leader said the contracts amounted to “nonessential spending” on third-party consultants for services “more efficiently” performed by the department’s workforce using existing resources.

“We need this money to spend on better health care for our warfighters and their families, instead of $500 an hour business process consultant,” he said in a statement announcing the cuts. “That’s a lot of consulting.”

Hegseth said a Defense Health Agency contract for consulting services from Accenture, Deloitte, Booz Allen and other firms was discontinued alongside an Air Force contract with Accenture to resell third-party enterprise cloud IT services.

A Navy contract for business process consulting services was also eliminated as was a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s contract for IT helpdesk services was canceled, according to Hegseth.

He added that the department is also slashing 11 contracts related to diversity, equity and inclusion, climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic and related “nonessential activities.”

“If you’re keeping score at home, today’s cuts bring our running total to nearly $6 billion in wasteful spending over the first six weeks of the Department of Government Efficiency effort here at the Defense Department,” Hegseth said.

The Trump administration has been on a drive to eliminate waste and inefficiency, and had already told the top ten consulting firms, and top five software suppliers, that they were in its cross hairs.

Yesterday, Hegseth terminated “A Defense Health Agency contract for consulting services from Accenture, Deloitte, Booz Allen, and other firms that can be performed by our civilian workforce”.

He also axed an air force contract with Accenture “to re-sell third party Enterprise Cloud IT Services which we can already fulfill directly with existing procurement resources”

Alongside them on the chopping block were a Navy contract for business process consulting, and a DARPA contract for IT Helpdesk Services.

Hegseth, in a DoD video highlighting the cuts, said the DHA contract was worth $1.8bn, while the enterprise cloud contract was worth $1.4bn. The Navy and DARPA contracts each had a $500m price tag.

""We need this money to spend on better health care for our warfighters and their families, instead of $500 an hour business process consultant,"" Hegseth said. ""That's a lot of consulting.""

Hegseth didn’t stop there, with cut to “11 contracts related to diversity, equity and inclusion, climate change, the department's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and related nonessential activities”. And he hit pause on $500m of funding for two universities accused of tolerating “antisemitism and support divisive DEI programs.""

The Elon Musk piloted DOGE appears to have been the prime mover behind the cuts, and Hegseth said, “Today's cuts bring our running total to nearly $6 billion in wasteful spending over the first six weeks of the Department of Government Efficiency effort here at the Defense Department.”

That $6 billion represents just under half a percent of the DoD’s $1.39 trillion budget. Which might not sound a lot in percentage terms. But for slim margin business, such as supermarkets and other retailers, it could be the different between profit and loss.

Consultancy firms tend not to be low margin, but the contract losses are still likely to be meaningful for the consultants involved.

The Pentagon's budget for 2025 is some $850 billion.

In February, a memo from Hegseth ordered the development of plans for eight percent to be cut from the budget in each of the next year, according to the Washington Post.

If implemented in full, the cuts would reduce the budget by tens of billions each year to some $560 billion by the end of the five years.

Last April 3, this well-known Hollywood actor celebrated the premiere of his Broadway play, Good Night, and Good Luck, at the Winter Garden Theatre in New York. An event marked by the absence of his wife, Amal.

As expected, this detail once again brought to the table the rumors about their supposed marital crisis. That's why George Clooney had no qualms about clarifying this misunderstanding to the media and assured that his wife had to stay home with their children.

Now, after the commotion that was caused, Julia Roberts has stepped forward to talk about the bond that exists between her and the actor. A confession she revealed on the show hosted by Jimmy Kimmel.

As we all know, these two great figures of American cinema met during the filming of the movie Ocean’s Eleven, and the connection between them was practically instantaneous. ""From there, we became friends instantly,"" the actress assured during her latest television interview.

""There are times when you meet someone and from the beginning you don't like them. But then there are other people, like it happened with George, where you say, 'I'm going to be with this person until the end of the world.'""

Since that first meeting, Julia Roberts and George Clooney have shared film projects on several occasions. So much so that, after the connection that was caused between them during the filming of Ocean’s Eleven, they collaborated again in Ocean’s Twelve.

Additionally, in between these two titles, the actors worked together in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, a film directed and starred by Clooney himself, which premiered in 2002.

The aim is to “cut wasteful spending” and “support the continued rationalization” of the Defense Department’s IT enterprise, Hegseth wrote.
The new call for in-sourcing comes as Pentagon leaders are advancing efforts to make major cuts to the civilian workforce.
The memo also tasks the chief information officer to complete an audit of Pentagon software licensing by April 18.
Earlier this week at the Sea-Air-Space conference, Navy Chief Information Officer Jane Rathbun said DOGE and the DOD CIO were reviewing the service’s software enterprise.","Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth signed a memo Thursday ordering the termination of several IT services contracts and directing the Pentagon’s chief information officer to draw up plans for in-sourcing, among other measures.

The aim is to “cut wasteful spending” and “support the continued rationalization” of the Defense Department’s IT enterprise, Hegseth wrote.

The move comes amid a broader push by the Trump administration to implement Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiatives across federal agencies.

Hegseth’s new memo to senior Pentagon leadership ordered the termination of contracts affecting a variety of DOD components, including a Defense Health Agency contract for consulting services; an Air Force contract to re-sell third party enterprise cloud IT services; a Navy contract for business process consulting services; and a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) contract for IT helpdesk services.

In a video released on social media touting these DOGE-related efforts, Hegseth estimated that those contract terminations would save the Pentagon approximately $1.8 billion, $1.4 billion, $500 million and $500 million, respectively.

“These contracts represent non-essential spending on third party consultants to perform services more efficiently performed by the highly skilled members of our DoD workforce using existing resources,” he wrote in the memo.

Hegseth also tasked the Pentagon CIO to work with the DOGE team to produce a plan within 30 days for how DOD will in-source IT consulting and management services to the department’s civilian workforce.

The new call for in-sourcing comes as Pentagon leaders are advancing efforts to make major cuts to the civilian workforce. Hegseth has said he wants to reinvest savings from employee reductions into higher-priority warfighting capabilities.

The plan from the CIO that Hegseth ordered in Thursday’s memo must also address how the Defense Department will negotiate “most favorable rates on software and cloud services, so the DoD pays no more for IT services than any other enterprise in America,” the SecDef wrote.

The memo also tasks the chief information officer to complete an audit of Pentagon software licensing by April 18. The purpose of the audit is “to ensure we are only paying for the licenses we actually use, the features we actually need, at the most favorable rates,” according to Hegseth.

Katie Arrington is currently performing the duties of DOD CIO.

Earlier this week at the Sea-Air-Space conference, Navy Chief Information Officer Jane Rathbun said DOGE and the DOD CIO were reviewing the service’s software enterprise.

“It’s all about making the right investments in modernizing, but modernizing with an eye towards effectiveness and efficiency. We’ve got this new administration. We’ve got the DOGE in working with us, and they’re focused on effective consumption of commercial software. Are we doing the best job we can deliver in buying and utilizing the software that we have?” she said.

The Navy is a huge purchaser of software licenses, Rathbun noted.

“It’s a big number. And so are we buying effectively? Are we utilizing the things that we’re buying effectively? There’s always opportunity for improvement. And I would say that’s an area in my portfolio that I want to focus on but have not a lot of people to do that, which is something that has always bothered me and I want to be doing better at is really this optimization concept. I’ve got to continuously modernize but I have to do it in an optimal way,” she said.",https://defensescoop.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2025/04/Hegseth.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-11 05:56:32.601573

Some of the biggest adjustments Soldiers face as they retire are related to health insurance and medical care, but brushing up on your health care knowledge pre-transition can help smooth the way.

Until now, you’ve received most or all of your care at military treatment facilities. You likely pay little or no out-of-pocket expenses for prescriptions, co-pays, and deductibles. At the same time, you probably don’t have many choices when it comes to selecting your providers.

Things will be a little different as a civilian, as this Soldier for Life Podcast explains.

TRICARE and Retirement

If you’re retiring, you will remain eligible for space available care at military clinics, hospitals and pharmacies. TRICARE has several plans, depending on your age and

location, including:

TRICARE Prime, the plan you’re probably most familiar with.

TRICARE Select, a fee-for-service plan that will give you more provider choices.

TRICARE Prime Option — US Family Health Plan, a community-based option available at six regional, nonprofit health care systems.

TRICARE For Life, a default plan that provides wraparound coverage if you have both Medicare Part A and Part B.

In addition, TRICARE has Retired Reserve, overseas, and young adult options. You may also be able to obtain dental and vision benefits via the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program.

However, coverage doesn’t automatically continue after retirement. To avoid a break in coverage, you must reenroll within 90 days of retirement, although you may request retroactive enrollment for up to 12 months. Otherwise, you can enroll during a TRICARE Open Season or after a qualifying life event (QLE), such as marriage, divorce, birth or adoption of a child or loss of other health benefits.

To see if something is covered or not covered, you can visit TRICARE’s Covered Services page. Keep in mind that you may have to pay annual enrollment fees, and your out-of-pocket costs — premiums, office co-pays, deductibles, etc. — will be higher than your active-duty Army medical expenses.

TRICARE and Separation

Some Soldiers who separate from the Army before becoming eligible for retirement may still qualify for short-term health insurance from TRICARE:

The Transitional Assistance Management Program provides 180 days of premium free health care benefits for eligible new veterans.

The Continued Health Care Benefit Program provides premium based coverage equivalent to TRICARE Select for eligible new veterans for up to 36 months.

Civilian Insurance

Compared to many civilian insurance programs, TRICARE offers excellent coverage at reasonable rates. However, you could be eligible for competitive health, dental, and vision benefits from your new employer or from a spouse’s employer. Consider comparing plans to determine which coverage best meets your family’s needs. Make sure to look up your preferred providers in each plan directory to see if they’re in network.

Common civilian medical plans include:

Exclusive Provider Organizations: Nonemergency services are only covered if you use doctors and hospitals in the plan’s network.

Health Maintenance Organizations: HMOs often provide integrated care that focuses on wellness and prevention, but limit nonemergency coverage to doctors who work for them.

Points of Service: You pay less if you use hospitals and providers in the plan’s network. You must obtain a referral from your primary care doctor to see a specialist.

Preferred Provider Organizations: Providers in the plan's network cost less, but you can still use out-of-network doctors, hospitals, and providers for an additional cost.

High-Deductible Health Plans: High-deductible plans have higher deductibles than traditional insurance plans, but lower monthly premiums. You pay more before insurance kicks in.

If you have a family member with a chronic or severe illness that requires many out-of-pocket expenses, depending on cost, it may make sense to enroll in two plans. Your civilian insurance would serve as your primary coverage, and TRICARE would become secondary. While you would spend more on monthly premiums, it could eliminate some or all of your co-pays.

On the other hand, some civilian companies will pay you a stipend if you decline their health benefits.

You could use this to cover a portion of your TRICARE enrollment fees. If you need help deciding what health coverage makes the most sense financially, check with a trusted personal financial manager or counselor.

In a Department of Defense memo, Hegseth said he would cut a Defense Health Agency contract ""for consulting services from Accenture, Deloitte, Booz Allen, and other firms that can be performed by our civilian workforce.""
Hegseth said the terminations ""represent $5.1 billion in wasteful spending"" at the DOD and would result in nearly $4 billion in savings.

Last month, Hegseth announced that the Defense Department was terminating over $580 million in programs, contracts, and grants that DOGE had identified as wasteful spending.","The US's defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, just ordered the termination of IT and consulting contracts with companies like Accenture and Deloitte, calling it ""wasteful spending.""

In a Department of Defense memo, Hegseth said he would cut a Defense Health Agency contract ""for consulting services from Accenture, Deloitte, Booz Allen, and other firms that can be performed by our civilian workforce.""

Also on the chopping block is the Air Force's contract with Accenture to ""re-sell third-party Enterprise Cloud IT Services,"" which Hegseth says the government can ""already fulfill directly with existing procurement resources.""

In the memo, Hegseth also said he was terminating 11 other contracts for ""consulting services"" that support ""non-essential"" activities, like Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI), climate matters, and the Pentagon's COVID-19 response.

Hegseth said the terminations ""represent $5.1 billion in wasteful spending"" at the DOD and would result in nearly $4 billion in savings.

The savings would be reallocated, Hegseth said, to serve ""critical priorities to Revive the Warrior Ethos, Rebuild the Military, and Reestablish Deterrence.""

He did not specify in his memo which Pentagon projects this money would go to.

In response to a request for comment, the DOD directed Business Insider to an X video of Hegseth talking about the terminations.

""By the way, we need this money to spend on better healthcare for our warfighters and their families, instead of $500 an hour business process consultant. That's a lot of consulting,"" Hegseth said in the video.

Hegseth also expressed his gratitude to Elon Musk's cost-cutting outfit, the Department of Government of Efficiency. DOGE has been slashing federal spending across various agencies, whether it be by laying off thousands of federal workers or shuttering foreign aid programs.

""So we want to thank our friends at DOGE. We want to thank all the folks here that have helped us unpack this, reveal it, and we're excited to make these cuts on behalf of you, the taxpayer and the warfighters at the Department,"" Hegseth said in his X video.

Additionally, Hegseth said the department is cutting 11 contracts related to diversity, equity and inclusion, climate change, the department's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and related nonessential activities across DOD.
""We are committed to rooting out DEI — root and branch — throughout this department … [And] I'm going to keep looking,"" Hegseth said.

The memo lists some of the cuts, including $1.8 billion in consulting contracts the Defense Health Agency awarded to various private sector firms, a $1.4 billion enterprise cloud IT services contract awarded to a software reseller, and a $500 million Navy contract for business process consulting.

""We need this money to spend on better health care for our warfighters and their families, instead of $500 an hour business process consultant,"" Hegseth said. ""That's a lot of consulting.""

He also mentioned cutting a $500 million contract awarded to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency for IT help desk services that are ""completely duplicative"" of services that the Defense Information Systems Agency already provides.

Additionally, Hegseth said the department is cutting 11 contracts related to diversity, equity and inclusion, climate change, the department's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and related nonessential activities across DOD.

""We are committed to rooting out DEI — root and branch — throughout this department … [And] I'm going to keep looking,"" Hegseth said.

He also announced cuts on the academic front, saying that DOD would be pausing over $500 million in funding to a pair of universities that ""tolerate antisemitism and support divisive DEI programs."" This is in addition to the $70 million already cut in funding at three other colleges in the past weeks.

Today's announcement follows Hegseth's initial March 20, 2025, announcement that the department would be cutting $580 million in programs, contracts and grants.

""If you're keeping score at home, today's cuts bring our running total to nearly $6 billion in wasteful spending over the first six weeks of the Department of Government Efficiency effort here at the Defense Department,"" Hegseth said, adding that DOGE's job is to find wasteful spending at DOD so that the funds can be driven back into the department's warfighting capabilities.

The central check-in offers a new and convenient method for patients to begin their healthcare process at the clinic. This streamlined approach reduces wait times and improves overall efficiency during the patient’s visit. By centralizing check-in operations, the 55th MDG can better allocate staff resources, allowing medical professionals to focus on providing high-quality patient care throughout their time at the clinic.

Starting today, all patients will need to sign in at the central check-in desk located in the main pharmacy waiting area except for those being seen in the following clinics: dental, immunizations, lab, mental health (including Family Advocacy and True North), and women’s health.

Implementing the central check-in represents the 55th MDG's commitment to innovation and patient-centered care. This enhancement will improve and optimize clinic flow and standardize other administrative processes. “We are excited to offer this enhanced experience to our patients. The central check-in aligns us with healthcare industry standards and continues to show our commitment to being our patients’ facility of choice,” said Col. Tracy Bozung, commander of the 55th MDG.

$500 Million: Cut from a Navy contract for business process consulting within administrative offices at the Bureau of Medicine.
“We are committed to rooting out the DEI root and branch throughout this department, and we have found 11 more contracts.
According to Hegseth, these latest cuts bring the total identified wasteful spending eliminated over the past six weeks to nearly $6 billion.
The goal, he stated, is to redirect these funds “back into war fighting capabilities here at the defense department.” “We’re excited to make these cuts on behalf of you, the taxpayer, and the warfighters here at the department,” Hegseth concluded.","Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth today announced a significant move to reduce spending at the Department of Defense (DOD), signing a memo to terminate $5.1 billion in existing contracts deemed non-essential or wasteful.

“This is another update on cutting wasteful spending here at DOD, and this one is, as they say, a big one,” Hegseth stated during the announcement. “We’re signing a memo right now, directing the termination of 5.1 billion – that’s with a B – billion in DOD contracts for ancillary things like Consulting and other non-essential Services.”

The specific cuts highlighted by the Secretary include:

$1.8 Billion: Saved by eliminating Defense Health Agency (DHA) consulting contracts with firms such as Accenture, Deloitte, and Booz Allen Hamilton.

$1.4 Billion: Saved from terminating a software reseller contract related to enterprise cloud IT services.

$500 Million: Cut from a Navy contract for business process consulting within administrative offices at the Bureau of Medicine. Hegseth commented, “We need this money to spend on Better Health Care for our Warfighters and their families, instead of 500 an hour business process consultant.”

$500 Million: Saved by cancelling a DARPA contract for IT help desk services described as “completely duplicative” with services already provided internally.

Hegseth also announced the termination of 11 additional contracts related to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), climate initiatives, and COVID-19 response activities across the department. “We are committed to rooting out the DEI root and branch throughout this department, and we have found 11 more contracts. We’re going to keep looking,” he affirmed.

In a related action aligned with stated presidential priorities, Hegseth noted the DOD is also pausing over $500 million in funding to Northwestern University and Cornell University this week due to concerns over DEI programs at those institutions.

This follows $70 million in funding pauses previously implemented for Columbia, Penn, Brown, and Princeton universities.

According to Hegseth, these latest cuts bring the total identified wasteful spending eliminated over the past six weeks to nearly $6 billion.

He credited the “DOD-DOGE” partnership for identifying these savings. The goal, he stated, is to redirect these funds “back into war fighting capabilities here at the defense department.”

“We’re excited to make these cuts on behalf of you, the taxpayer, and the warfighters here at the department,” Hegseth concluded.

Zynex's Disappointing Fourth Quarter Results

ZYXI share price depression stems from its disastrous 4Q 2024 earnings release. The Englewood, Colorado-based firm reported fourth-quarter 2024 revenue of $46.0 million, a roughly 2% year-over-year decline, falling short of Wall Street's expectations. The company also swung to a net loss of $0.02 per share, a stark contrast to the $0.04 net income per share reported in the same period last year.

The disappointing results reportedly prompted RBC Capital Markets to downgrade Zynex to Sector Perform from Outperform. According to news outlets, in a report to its clients, RBC analyst Shagun Singh cited a ""lack of visibility"" into the company's operations and commercial outlook, particularly concerning its relationship with Tricare, the military health program that represents a significant portion of Zynex's revenue.

Singh reportedly noted that Tricare, Zynex's largest customer, has temporarily suspended payments amid an ongoing review of prior claims. Singh added that the company's decision to withhold 2025 guidance and implement a 15% workforce reduction further compounded investor concerns. Singh revised RBC's price target for Zynex shares to $5.50, down from $11.00, warning of a potential ""domino effect"" stemming from Tricare's payment suspension.

Zynex Securities Class Action

Adding to Zynex's woes, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the District Court of Colorado, alleging that the company made false and misleading statements regarding its revenue recognition practices and its relationship with Tricare. The suit, captioned Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., et al., seeks to represent investors who purchased Zynex securities between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

The complaint alleges that Zynex engaged in ""oversupplying"" customers with products, including electrodes, leading to inflated revenue figures. It further claims that this practice drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare, and that Zynex failed to disclose the potential for adverse consequences, such as removal from insurer networks and government penalties.

According to the complaint, revelations of Zynex's alleged practices surfaced with a June 4, 2024 report by medical journal STAAT detailing an ""oversupplying scheme"" involving excessive shipments of supplies and subsequent inflated billing. The report also indicated that insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

The truth allegedly emerged on March 11, 2025, when Zynex reported its dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The complaint highlights Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard's attributing the fourth-quarter revenue shortfall to ""slower than normal payments from certain payers"" and the Tricare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman's Investigation

Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. ""We are examining Zynex's financial reporting and business practices. We believe investors deserve a complete and transparent understanding of these events,"" said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

“We are the only U.S. health care system that goes to war,” said Ferrara, who deployed four times when he served as an active duty U.S. Navy surgeon.
The chain he is referring to is the continued evolution and modernization of the health care system to improve access, quality, and safety.
He explains the MHS optimizes warfighter performance by sustaining readiness of the military force and those charged with their care and recovery.
“It starts with maintaining the ready medical force,” he explained.","For the Military Health System, readiness is a strategic imperative to ensure warfighter dominance, survivability, and resilience, said the acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Dr. Stephen Ferrara.

“Readiness cannot be secondary. You cannot do readiness at the last minute. You cannot cram for readiness. When it comes to mission success, readiness is everything,” he said.

During his first two months on the job, Ferrara delivered that message at speaking engagements, visits to military hospitals and clinics, town hall forums, and interviews.

“We are the only U.S. health care system that goes to war,” said Ferrara, who deployed four times when he served as an active duty U.S. Navy surgeon.

“When America's sons and daughters go downrange and go into harm's way, we honor the pact we made with them and with their parents—that should they become ill or injured, they will receive prompt and effective medical attention anywhere in the world. That is the trust that we have. That's something that our adversaries don't always have, and it gives us an incredible strategic edge.”

His priorities for the Military Health System are to increase lethality of the warfighter, sustain the skills of the medical force, and ensure accessible, high-quality, and sustainable care.

“We have to support the warfighter, sustain our skills, and strengthen our chain,” he said. The chain he is referring to is the continued evolution and modernization of the health care system to improve access, quality, and safety.

“If we support, sustain, and strengthen, that is how we build a system that will fight and win, because fundamentally, this is what our job is: to fight and win,” he said.

“We do this by having a ready medical force, so we can provide strong battlefield care and keep guns in the fight,” he said. “We do this by maintaining the medically ready force—because readiness is a medical imperative like it is a moral imperative.”

Ferrara noted that part of his role is conveying to the Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth how the MHS is a tremendous force in his priority of force lethality. He explains the MHS optimizes warfighter performance by sustaining readiness of the military force and those charged with their care and recovery.

The Defense Health Program budget, which this year is approximately $61 billion, is about 7% of the Pentagon’s topline budget. “I show the Secretary how we take that topline budget, and how we use that to make the force more lethal, more fit to fight, and win,” he said.

“It starts with maintaining the ready medical force,” he explained. “We must ensure that every member of the team—from the surgeon who wields a scalpel, to the logistician who procured the scalpel, from the nurse who transfuses the blood, to the team who runs the blood bank—is at the top of their game. A team ready to go downrange to fight and win.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2503/8923017/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-04-10 14:56:17.816588

To find the right plan you will need to do some shopping around as deductibles, premiums, and coverage percentages vary.

The proposed reforms would reduce the volume of prior authorization requests, expedite approvals, extend authorization validity, and ensure that appeals are reviewed by qualified specialists.
This will help ensure that providers can discuss prior authorization denials with a professional peer who understands the recommended treatment and underlying condition.
“It’s vital that health care decisions must be made by professionals who understand the complexities of a patient’s condition,” said Assemblymember Addis.
“AB 512 is a crucial step toward improving patient access to timely care,” said Assemblymember Harabedian.","April 10, 2025

The president of California Medical Association (CMA), state legislators and dozens of physicians unveiled the Prioritizing Patients, Empowering Physicians bill package, a suite of legislation aimed at cutting red tape in the health care system and ensuring patients receive timely, medically necessary care.

“When people have health insurance, they expect to be able to get the health care they need when they need it,” said CMA President Shannon Udovic-Constant, M.D. “But too often, bureaucratic delays get in the way, forcing patients to wait for essential treatments while their physicians navigate unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles. This legislative package will put patients first, allowing doctors to focus on providing all our patients the best possible care.”

The package, which is sponsored by CMA and includes AB 510, AB 539, AB 512, and SB 306, addresses the burdensome prior authorization process that often delays patient care and, in some cases, leads to severe health consequences, including permanent bodily damage, hospitalizations, and even death. The proposed reforms would reduce the volume of prior authorization requests, expedite approvals, extend authorization validity, and ensure that appeals are reviewed by qualified specialists.

SB 306 by Senator Josh Becker (SD 13) requires health plans to remove the requirement for prior authorization from any service that they approve more than 90% of the time. This will reduce the overall volume of prior authorization requests and ensure that patients can receive the care they need with minimal delay and physicians can spend more time focusing on patient care.

“Doctors should be treating patients – not spending hours buried in paperwork that needlessly delays access to treatment. SB 306 cuts through the red tape to accelerate approval of services that are almost always approved anyway,” said Senator Becker. “It’s a simple, data-driven solution that will reduce delays in care, free up providers to do their jobs, and help patients get the timely treatment they need. This bill is about restoring common sense and compassion to our healthcare system.”

AB 510 by Assemblymember Dawn Addis (AD 30) requires that appeals of prior authorization denials be performed by a provider of the same or similar specialty. This will help ensure that providers can discuss prior authorization denials with a professional peer who understands the recommended treatment and underlying condition.

“It’s vital that health care decisions must be made by professionals who understand the complexities of a patient’s condition,” said Assemblymember Addis. “AB 510 is critical to protecting patient rights and ensuring access to a fair, transparent process that prioritizes health over profits.”

AB 539 by Assemblymember Pilar Schiavo (AD 40) extends the validity of an approved prior authorization to one year (current industry standard is 60 to 90 days). This will provide patients with a longer window of time to receive medically necessary care and avoid the cumbersome prior authorization review and appeal processes.

“People with often chronic health conditions should not have to argue with their insurance company every couple months just to continue their already approved treatment. Our bill - The Timely Care Act (AB 539) - will cut the red tape that often delays care so people can focus on their health, not on paperwork,” said Assemblymember Schiavo. “As someone who spent over a decade fighting for patients as a nurse advocate, I know how critical timely care is, and how much time is wasted by doctors having to spend time on paperwork rather than caring for patients. Reducing barriers to medically necessary care for both patients and physicians will make a real difference in people’s lives.”

AB 512 by Assemblymember John Harabedian (AD 41) requires health plans to respond to urgent prior authorization requests within 24 hours and respond to nonurgent requests within 48 hours. Currently, health plans have 72 hours for urgent requests and five days for nonurgent requests. This change will ensure more patients can receive care or appeal denials in a timely fashion.

“AB 512 is a crucial step toward improving patient access to timely care,” said Assemblymember Harabedian. “By shortening response times for both urgent and nonurgent prior authorization requests, we are ensuring that patients can receive the care they need when they need it most. This bill represents a dedication to putting patient well-being at the forefront of our healthcare system.”

CMA thanks its partners in the legislature for championing reforms to our broken prior authorization system. The Prioritizing Patients, Empowering Physicians bills are part of CMA’s sponsored bill package for the 2025 legislative session.

Service members experience 25 million limited duty days annually due to injuries, most of which are musculoskeletal injuries, also known as MSKI.

When on limited duty status, a service member may not be able to maintain required training activities and may not be deployable. As a result, the combat readiness of the U.S. military forces is substantially reduced by MSKI, costing the Department of Defense billions of dollars annually.

“For decades, the data have consistently shown that MSKI are the primary reason for service members’ medical visits,” says Dr. Bruce Jones, a retired Army physician and current senior advisor to the Defense Health Agency-Public Health Clinical Public Health and Epidemiology Directorate in Aberdeen, Maryland. “Though MSKI most commonly occur in lower body areas such as the knees, legs, ankles and feet, approximately 20% of all military medically reported injuries are to upper extremity areas, such as to shoulders, elbows, wrists, hands and fingers.”

Upper extremity injuries require unique recovery treatments that are most effective when tailored to an individual’s injury, as well as their specific work and personal activities. This treatment is provided by military Occupational Therapists Practitioners, known as OTPs, who are trained to treat service members’ upper extremity injuries from shoulders to fingertips.

“The treatment of an upper extremity injury depends on many factors: how long ago the injury occurred, the overall health of the service member, and compliance with the treatment plan,” says U.S. Army Maj. Amanda Hetzler, an OTP currently assigned to DHA-Public Health in Aberdeen.

She points to evidence that early access to OT is the leading factor in reducing a patient’s recovery time.

“The sooner we can start working with an injured service member, the better outcomes can be,” says Hetzler.

What are common upper extremity injuries?

Military injury data indicate that among the upper extremities, the shoulder is the most commonly injured body area.

Some units may be at higher risk of these injuries. For example, an analysis of medical data found that compared to other service members, military paratroopers have been treated for more acute shoulder injuries, such as fractures, sprains or dislocations of the shoulder or acromioclavicular joint (where the shoulder and collarbone meet). The data also showed paratroopers were more likely to develop shoulder overuse injuries than non-paratroopers. Shoulder injuries can be more severe and require a longer recovery period than lower extremity injuries.

While Hetzler says she also often sees acute, or single incident, pain injuries to the wrist or hand caused by a fall on outstretched hands while a service member is running and carrying gear, most injuries she has seen in the military population are the result of overuse.

Overuse injuries occur from a repeated, low-intensity force over time that damages tendon, joint, ligament, muscle and/or skeletal tissue, overwhelming the tissue’s normal ability to recover. Over two-thirds (69%) of military injuries are cumulative microtraumatic injuries that result from overuse.

Hetzler describes other upper extremity overuse injuries commonly treated by OTs:

• Thumb and wrist pain, including de Quervain's Tenosynovitis and Gamer’s thumb: Also sometimes called de Quervain's tendinosis or de Quervain's tendinitis, this condition occurs when thumb tendons become inflamed and cause pain and swelling at the base of thumb into the side of the wrist or lower arm. Symptoms can include numbness and/or a sensation that your thumb is sticking when you try to move it.

• Elbow and forearm pain, especially Lateral Epicondylitis: Also referred to as elbow tendonitis or sometimes tennis elbow, this condition causes pain in the affected forearm when you’re trying to complete ordinary movements such as gripping or holding even relatively light objects, turning knobs, driving, typing, or shaking hands.

What causes upper body injuries?

“Overuse injuries can be attributed to various activities that require repetitive motion such as pushing, pulling, and lifting and can also be impacted by ergonomics, tool use, and the overall strength and condition of a person,” says U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr. Emmy Hartley, an OTP currently assigned to Naval Hospital Pensacola, Florida.

Some upper body diagnoses such as ‘Gamer’s thumb’ are commonly given due to the many cases in the U.S. that are caused by excessive use of video game remote control devices and cell phones. The term ‘tennis elbow’ is frequently used because of the popularity of racquet sports that contribute to repetitive strain on the wrist, causing the condition. Although the condition ‘tennis elbow’ may be diagnosed for service members, it is rarely caused by tennis play within the military population.

“More relevant to the military, evidence has shown that certain occupations that require intense repetitive physical activity, such as shooting rifles, performing mechanic work, or carrying objects during military tasks, can increase the risk of certain upper body injuries,” says Hartley.

In addition to unique mission activities such as paratrooper duties, Hetzler recalls patients describing some examples of triggering military activities:

• Pushups

• Weightlifting (especially ‘snatching,’ which involves taking a wide grip on a weighted barbell, pulling it off the floor rapidly, and lifting the barbell over the head with arms outstretched in one continuous motion, placing stress on the wrist.)

• Lifting of gear (loading and unloading)

“While these activities are often critical to military training or duties, the patient can often not perform them while injured,” says Hetzler. “In addition, a key part of most OT treatment plans will require a recovery period where these activities should not be performed.”

What can you do to minimize the impact of an upper extremity injury?

“The best way to reduce the impact of an injury is to prevent it from occurring. Most injuries, especially overuse injuries, are preventable,” says Jones. “Various military resources are available to help service members target key injury risk factors and improve service member readiness by reducing injury risk.”

These resources can help service members avoid injuries while maximizing fitness, and allow early accessibility to an OTP. For example, some Army units are including Holistic Health and Fitness, known as H2F, teams into their brigade formations, while Navy and Marine units have the Navy Operational Fitness and Fueling System, or NOFFS.

“If you develop a MSKI or experience painful symptoms not yet limiting you, seek immediate care,” says Hetzler. “With delayed care or a lack of proper intervention, injuries can result in reduced readiness of the unit, limited military career progression or worse—permanent disability.”

Hetzler and Hartley also highlight that OTPs can provide activity analysis of specific tasks, such as lifting, pushups, and body mechanics, while the task is being performed. These analyses result in preventive education and training that can further reduce the risk of MSKI.

“The most important step is early diagnosis and referral to an OT who will help develop and monitor your treatment plan. Especially, don’t ignore pain in joints,” says Hetzler. “Once you are under the care of an OT, of course, you need to follow the treatment plan. This is the best way to reduce your chance of a longer recovery or permanent condition.”

The order published in the Official Gazette changes the legal regime of full dedication, extending the option of individual membership to doctors in establishments and services covered by the special medical career regime.

Thus, the full dedication regime can be applied to medical workers in the areas of primary health care, hospital care and pre-hospital emergency care, who express an interest in individually joining the regime, particularly in situations where it is not possible to join a Family Health Unit (USF) or an Integrated Responsibility Center (CRI).

It also applies to workers in the special medical career who perform functions in the Military Health System, as well as in prison establishments of the General Directorate of Reintegration and Prison Services.

General and family medicine specialists who provide care in organic units integrated into the SNS that do not correspond to USF or Personalized Health Care Units, namely in the areas of palliative care and dependencies and addictive behaviors, can also adhere to full dedication.

The decree-law published on November 07, 2023 had established the legal regime for full dedication in the NHS, applicable to multidisciplinary teams in family health units and in integrated responsibility centers.

It also provided for the possibility of individual membership by primary and hospital healthcare doctors who expressed an interest in this regard, particularly when they were unable to join a USF or a CRI.

“Despite this provision, doubts remain about the applicability of this individual membership in relation to some doctors”, reads the diploma approved today.

In this context, the Government considered it “essential to make a specific change to Decree-Law No. 103/2023, of 7 November”, to ensure that these professionals can adhere to the full-time dedication regime.

“The amendment will also make it possible to clearly define the obligations arising from this membership”, states the dispatch, highlighting that the structures representing medical workers were consulted.

The contractors are ensuring members will not be delayed this year with the TRICARE Dental Program.

""We're excited about the improvements the new contracts will bring in 2025, especially if you get specialty care in the TRICARE civilian network,"" said Tonya Utterback, referral management subject matter expert at the Defense Health Agency.

The United Concordia will still administer care, offering many members new services and lower costs.

TRICARE's New Dental Contract

TRICARE has brought a new contract, and it has also got three main improvements. Members will find more dentists near them, and they'll be able to choose, including specialists; they’ll pay lower monthly premiums and can now meet with dentists online for checkups, planning their care, and other basic services.

The TRICARE Dental Program is a voluntary dental plan. It's available to active duty family members, National Guard and Reserve members, and their family members. The United Concordia has dentists in all 50 United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The monthly premiums will decrease with the new contract. The monthly premium depends on the sponsor's status (Active duty, Selected Reserve, or Individual Ready Reserve) and enrollment type.

The TRICARE Dental Program Handbook mentions that it is a pay-ahead program. This means members will begin paying the new rates in February for coverage starting in March.

How TRICARE Will Benefit Families

The new and improved TRICARE Dental Program will surely be beneficial for a lot of military families and members. May it be Veterans, Guards, or Reserve, all will be covered. Preventive care and checkups are included.

The high costs of dental care will no longer be a problem because the new contract has ensured that everyone gets proper treatment without breaking the bank. The new contract will also allow members to search for proper health care near their homes.

No hassle, improved communication, and better providers are also coming to light.

What to Expect in the New TRICARE Dental Program

TRICARE Dental Program is a voluntary insurance plan for members of the military. They now offer many families restorative services, cleanings, checkups, and dental surgeries.

TRICARE Dental Program's new benefits promise to deliver military families their well-deserved care, allowing them to have broad coverage and access.

On March 1st, members can expect a wide range of dental specialists, making finding the care that all members need easier. Plus, it's close to their home.

TRICARE Dental Coverage

TRICARE is the health care program for uniformed service members, retirees, and their families worldwide. Just like most private employers, dental insurance or dental coverage is separate from regular medical coverage.

Unlike TRICARE's medical coverage, which is automatic for every military dependent, TRICARE's dental coverage requires special enrollment. It's important to note that TRICARE dental coverage does not start automatically upon enrollment.

If you enroll in the TRICARE Dental Program by the 20th of February, your coverage will start on the first day of March. If enrollment happens after the 20th, you'll have to wait more than a month for your coverage to begin on the first day of the second month. The contract focuses on improved access to families and offers a big network of dental specialists to ensure that dental care is within every member's reach.

Enhanced coverage for preventive and essential services highlights the program's commitment to maintaining long-term oral health.

Zynex’s Disappointing Fourth Quarter Results

ZYXI share price depression stems from its disastrous 4Q 2024 earnings release. The Englewood, Colorado-based firm reported fourth-quarter 2024 revenue of $46.0 million, a roughly 2% year-over-year decline, falling short of Wall Street's expectations. The company also swung to a net loss of $0.02 per share, a stark contrast to the $0.04 net income per share reported in the same period last year.

The disappointing results reportedly prompted RBC Capital Markets to downgrade Zynex to Sector Perform from Outperform. According to news outlets, in a report to its clients, RBC analyst Shagun Singh cited a ""lack of visibility"" into the company's operations and commercial outlook, particularly concerning its relationship with Tricare, the military health program that represents a significant portion of Zynex's revenue.

Singh reportedly noted that Tricare, Zynex's largest customer, has temporarily suspended payments amid an ongoing review of prior claims. Singh added that the company's decision to withhold 2025 guidance and implement a 15% workforce reduction further compounded investor concerns. Singh revised RBC’s price target for Zynex shares to $5.50, down from $11.00, warning of a potential ""domino effect"" stemming from Tricare's payment suspension.

Zynex Securities Class Action

Adding to Zynex’s woes, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the District Court of Colorado, alleging that the company made false and misleading statements regarding its revenue recognition practices and its relationship with Tricare. The suit, captioned Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., et al., seeks to represent investors who purchased Zynex securities between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

The complaint alleges that Zynex engaged in “oversupplying” customers with products, including electrodes, leading to inflated revenue figures. It further claims that this practice drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare, and that Zynex failed to disclose the potential for adverse consequences, such as removal from insurer networks and government penalties.

According to the complaint, revelations of Zynex's alleged practices surfaced with a June 4, 2024 report by medical journal STAAT detailing an ""oversupplying scheme"" involving excessive shipments of supplies and subsequent inflated billing. The report also indicated that insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

The truth allegedly emerged on March 11, 2025, when Zynex reported its dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The complaint highlights Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard’s attributing the fourth-quarter revenue shortfall to ""slower than normal payments from certain payers"" and the Tricare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman’s Investigation

Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. “We are examining Zynex's financial reporting and business practices. We believe investors deserve a complete and transparent understanding of these events,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

After a long and successful career in the US Army, Terry Walsh embarked on a new mission to serve older adults in the senior living sector.

He retired as a colonel after a 22-year career in the US Army Medical Corps. Over his distinguished military career, he served in field units, jumped out of airplanes, worked a brief stint in the Pentagon, walked the Korean Demilitarized Zone, ran active-duty military hospitals and led a regional startup of the military’s TRICARE health insurance program.

After retiring from the military, Walsh moved into the private sector in healthcare and senior living. He joined the corporate office of Ascension Health in St. Louis in nonacute care operations, where he spearheaded company efforts to establish retail health clinics in pharmacies such as CVS and Walgreens and on-site employee health clinics in Kohl’s department store fulfillment centers.

In his first foray into senior living, Walsh worked on a project to improve the health system’s post-acute and long-term care operations, leading to the creation of Ascension Health Senior Care (now Ascension Living), one of the nation’s largest senior living and care companies.

In 2016, he joined Friendship Village, a large resort-style retirement community in the St. Louis area, starting out as executive director before becoming the organization’s president and CEO the following year.

For his leadership of Friendship Village, Walsh has earned local and national accolades while also overseeing a $200 million expansion project in 2020. He also has received praise and numerous awards for adopting innovative new technologies to improve the quality of resident care.

He is three times a Titan 100 CEO in St. Louis, in 2024 became a member of the inaugural Titan 100 St. Louis Hall of Fame.

Walsh previously served as hospital president and CEO of the US Army’s Ireland Hospital in Fort Knox, KY.

He holds a bachelor’s degree in biology from Westminster College and a master’s degree in healthcare administration from Baylor University.

This includes helping navigate the TriWest authorization waiver, which has been extended through April 30, 2025, for TRICARE Prime beneficiaries with a referral from their military or civilian primary care manager to seek outpatient care for covered services without referral approval from TriWest.

April 30 is also the date for those who have not updated payment information with TriWest to do so to ensure continued access for important services and avoid disenrollment.

Naval Hospital Bremerton and other military treatment facilities will continue to submit referrals for specialty care, as usual. If a patient is wanting continuing care or requesting a specific private sector provider, the following information is needed:

Name of facility or provider

Address, phone, fax, and National Provider Identifier (NPI) if available.

Note: this information should always be provided when requesting continuity of care referrals or when requesting a specific provider.

What patients should know about their referral status:

Specialty care will be provided at a military treatment facility such as Naval Hospital Bremerton, including Madigan Army Medical Center, when – and if - that specialty is available.

During this waiver period, NHB’s Referral Management Center will manually fax the referral, a provider letter and waiver letter to one specific private sector provider. The waiver serves as the authorization. No authorization will be accessible through the TriWest patient portal.

Beneficiaries should access their electronic health record MHS GENESIS patient portal [ https://myaccess.dmdc.osd.mil/identitymanagement/app/login ] to determine where their referral has been sent.

All eligible beneficiaries – active duty, retirees and dependents - can also call the Pacific Integrated Referral Management Center [PIRMAC] at 800-404-4506 for assistance to help navigate where their referral has been sent.

If a beneficiary desires a different private sector provider, they can take the referral and waiver letter to the provider to schedule an appointment. If the beneficiary experiences any barriers or issues, they can contact NHB Health Benefits Advisor, 360-475-4768.

Other important information to provide to all beneficiaries:

All beneficiaries should consider also setting up a portal with TriWest by accessing www.tricare-west.com. This will enable them to see their referrals and authorizations and will eventually allow them to change a provider without calling TriWest or NHB RMC.

Beneficiaries can also contact TriWest, 1-888-874-9378.

This legislation directs the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) to improve TRICARE Prime access and travel benefits for Puerto Rico veterans. The bill also requires coordination between the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization Office and Puerto Rico’s Department of Health to share health data. Hernandez is joined by U.S. Representatives Julia Brownley (D-Calif.), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), and Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) as original cosponsors of the bill.

“Our veterans and military families in Puerto Rico have sacrificed just as much as their counterparts on the mainland, and they deserve equal access to the healthcare benefits they’ve earned. The TRICARE Equality Act will help close the unacceptable gaps in care faced by our servicemembers, retirees, and their families on the island. By improving TRICARE Prime access, expanding travel benefits, and ensuring better coordination of health data, this bill takes a critical step toward treating Puerto Rico’s military community with the dignity and fairness they deserve,” said Hernández.

TRICARE, the healthcare program that serves military personnel, retirees, and their families, is currently available in Puerto Rico through the TRICARE Overseas Program (TOP). Approximately 38,000 individuals in Puerto Rico rely on TRICARE, including active duty service members and their families, members of the National Guard and Reserve, and around 24,000 military retirees and their families. Under the TRICARE Area Office for Latin America and Canada, Puerto Rico offers several health plan options such as TRICARE Prime Remote, TRICARE Select, and TRICARE Reserve Select.

However, because Puerto Rico is excluded from the full TRICARE Prime network, beneficiaries on the island face significant barriers to accessing care. Many are forced to pay upfront for services and submit claims for reimbursement later, encounter gaps in access to specialty care that often require travel to the mainland, and endure delays in receiving necessary treatments.

This legislation addresses these disparities by directing the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) to improve TRICARE Prime access and travel benefits for Puerto Rico’s military community, ensuring they receive the same level of healthcare access as their counterparts on the mainland. It also requires the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization Office to coordinate with Puerto Rico’s Department of Health to share health data and improve care delivery.

Zynex’s Disappointing Fourth Quarter Results

ZYXI share price depression stems from its disastrous 4Q 2024 earnings release. The Englewood, Colorado-based firm reported fourth-quarter 2024 revenue of $46.0 million, a roughly 2% year-over-year decline, falling short of Wall Street's expectations. The company also swung to a net loss of $0.02 per share, a stark contrast to the $0.04 net income per share reported in the same period last year.

The disappointing results reportedly prompted RBC Capital Markets to downgrade Zynex to Sector Perform from Outperform. According to news outlets, in a report to its clients, RBC analyst Shagun Singh cited a ""lack of visibility"" into the company's operations and commercial outlook, particularly concerning its relationship with Tricare, the military health program that represents a significant portion of Zynex's revenue.

Singh reportedly noted that Tricare, Zynex's largest customer, has temporarily suspended payments amid an ongoing review of prior claims. Singh added that the company's decision to withhold 2025 guidance and implement a 15% workforce reduction further compounded investor concerns. Singh revised RBC’s price target for Zynex shares to $5.50, down from $11.00, warning of a potential ""domino effect"" stemming from Tricare's payment suspension.

Zynex Securities Class Action

Adding to Zynex’s woes, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the District Court of Colorado, alleging that the company made false and misleading statements regarding its revenue recognition practices and its relationship with Tricare. The suit, captioned Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., et al., seeks to represent investors who purchased Zynex securities between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

The complaint alleges that Zynex engaged in “oversupplying” customers with products, including electrodes, leading to inflated revenue figures. It further claims that this practice drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare, and that Zynex failed to disclose the potential for adverse consequences, such as removal from insurer networks and government penalties.

According to the complaint, revelations of Zynex's alleged practices surfaced with a June 4, 2024 report by medical journal STAAT detailing an ""oversupplying scheme"" involving excessive shipments of supplies and subsequent inflated billing. The report also indicated that insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

The truth allegedly emerged on March 11, 2025, when Zynex reported its dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The complaint highlights Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard’s attributing the fourth-quarter revenue shortfall to ""slower than normal payments from certain payers"" and the Tricare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman’s Investigation

Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. “We are examining Zynex's financial reporting and business practices. We believe investors deserve a complete and transparent understanding of these events,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Recruiting crisis for Uncle Sam? Elected officials and top Pentagon Generals earned it.

In The News

Troops need better health care access, top enlisted tell lawmakers

By Karen Jowers

Apr 8, 2025 – Marine Corps Times

“When care isn’t available in the military treatment facilities, beneficiaries rely on civilian networks. However, limited resources have affected care delivery, provider recruitment and Tricare’s ability to compete in the civilian insurance market, Honea said, adding that Tricare’s reimbursement rates are tied to Medicare rates and are often too low for providers.”

Uncle Sam is not paying the bills:

“Honea also noted complications with the new Tricare contracts have delayed claims processing and damaged civilian medical providers’ trust in their timely payment.”

TRICARE has earned a reputation:

“Rep. John Rutherford, R-Fla., said the continued payment problem could result in some providers leaving the Tricare network. He cited one provider who is owed about $100,000 from Tricare.”

Welcome Home Troops

“Military families have reported extensive issues with health care access since the new Tricare contracts began in January, which have caused medical shortfalls for some families and some providers dropping Tricare patients because of the difficulties, Military Times previously reported.”

Military suicide has been a thing for years now and this is what you get:

“For instance, some Marines are having to seek out mental health care from civilian providers because there aren’t enough mental health providers in military treatment facilities, Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps Carlos Ruiz told lawmakers. Because there are few providers and appointments available in the civilian community, they may have to wait 45 to 60 days to get the help they need, Ruiz said.”

Notice that elected officials have not taken the initiative to fix TRICARE problems that have dragged on since Jan first. They sit and listen to requests to take e action in April of 2025.

Not here to say that military benefits are inadequate. Just stick with whatever was offered when people signed up to stay on for multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and we’re good.

The US Dept. of Defense has really taken a dive since the 1980s. I’ll do a blog on that later.

Naval Hospital Bremerton in the news:

Decade of reductions at Naval Hospital Bremerton push out retirees, beneficiaries

Conor Wilson – Kitsap Sun April 3, 2025

“Over the last decade, the hospital has been gutted, leaving a major gap in the local health care sector and bogging down local providers. As large numbers of military retirees and beneficiaries are forced out of the military system, they increasingly find themselves searching for care in an overburdened civilian sector desperately short on providers and struggling to provide access to routine care.”

U.S. Sen. Patty Murray:

“This pattern of declining care and personnel mismanagement at one of the largest Naval bases in the nation suggests a lack of attention to the healthcare needs of servicemembers, veterans, and their families in Kitsap County.”

“Naval Hospital Bremerton did not make a member of its leadership available for an interview as part of this story, despite multiple requests since late February.”

“Kitsap County has a shortage of primary care providers, with about half as many per capita as the state average in 2023, according to Washington Health Care Research Center.”

Ask A Recruiter

“Reductions at Naval Hospital Bremerton over the last decade come as the Department of Defense, the federal agency that runs the military health system, has reduced spending on health care. As part of a major realignment designed to shed costs, it has prioritized operational readiness for wartime missions and care for those on active duty over that of beneficiaries and retirees.”

“Civilian providers say they are increasingly shouldering the load left by the Navy. The result is worse access across the board for primary, maternal and specialty care for all residents, including those not connected to the military. Shortages are driving up hospital bills, as more people depend on emergent care, and likely leading to worse outcomes for Kitsap patients.”

“Virginia Mason Franciscan Health, who own St. Michael Medical Center in Silverdale and St. Anthony Hospital in Gig Harbor, has seen “increased demand as military health care facilities have adjusted their offerings over the years,” St Michael President Chad Melton wrote in an email.”

“…military health care facilities have adjusted their offerings…”

Politician speak will take you to the highest levels.

Thousands of men and women who did time in uniform over the past 25 years did one or more tours in places like Syria, Africa, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kosovo. Some stayed for 20.

Now, these people are told that the benefits they thought they were earning when reenlisting for another tour are going away in order to save money. WTF?

Same country that sent big cash to Ukraine several times over in 2024.

Today, Uncle Sam needs more people to volunteer to go to far away places and maybe never come back again.

Good luck with your US Armed Forces recruiting crisis.

Zynex, headquartered in Englewood, CO, is a medical device company that makes electrotherapy devices for pain management and rehabilitation.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report titled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills,"" which claimed that Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of supplies, such as electrode pads and batteries, in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024.

On March 11, 2025, Zynex reported Q4 and full-year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex further revealed ""Tricare [health insurance program for the U.S. military] has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025.

A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. The lead plaintiff is usually the investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Communicating with any counsel is not necessary to participate or share in any recovery achieved in this case. Any member of the purported class may move the Court to serve as a lead plaintiff through counsel of his/her choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an inactive class member.

Unlock your health with TRICARE—learn how to get care based on your TRICARE health plan.","APRIL 9, 2025 – Are you moving to a new home? Is it more than a 30-minute drive from your primary care manager? If so, TRICARE is making it simpler to keep your TRICARE Prime coverage. Now, most families who live more than 30 minutes but less than 100 miles from their PCM can continue seeing them without taking action.

What’s new?

In the past, if you moved more than 30 minutes from your PCM, you would’ve had to fill out a drive time waiver to keep your coverage. Without this form, you would’ve risked losing access to your preferred PCM.

The new policy “flips” this process. If you live more than 30 minutes but less than 100 miles from your PCM, you won’t need to take any action to keep your coverage. TRICARE will automatically apply the drive time waiver for you, making it easier to keep your current PCM.

“Our data shows more than half of beneficiaries who waived their drive time access to care standard due to address issues lived less than 100 miles from their military hospital or clinic,” said Shane Pham, management and program analyst, TRICARE Health Plan Policy & Programs Branch, at the Defense Health Agency. “This new approach will help prevent unnecessary coverage gaps and ensure families keep access to their PCMs.”

How will it work?

If your TRICARE regional contractor learns that you’ve moved more than 30 minutes from your PCM, based on information on file, they’ll:

Call you

Send you a text

Mail you a letter

Email you

They’ll contact all adults in your household. You’ll have 90 days from the notification date to decide what to do about your coverage.

What do you need to do?

Your next steps depend on how far you live from your PCM.

If you live more than 30 minutes, but less than 100 miles, away:

You don’t need to do anything if you want to keep TRICARE Prime coverage. Your coverage will stay the same, and you’ll keep your same PCM.

You can switch health plans if you want to.

If you live more than 100 miles away, you must choose one of these options within 90 days being notified by your regional contractor:

Confirm your decision to keep your current TRICARE Prime coverage.

Switch to TRICARE Select.

Switch to the US Family Health Plan (if it’s available in your area).

Switching to TRICARE Select or the USFHP (where available) lets you choose your PCM regardless of distance from your home. TRICARE Select lets you manage your own health care and get care from any TRICARE-authorized provider without a referral (in most situations), as described in the TRICARE Choices in the United States Handbook.

If you live more than 100 miles away and don’t choose one of these options within 90 days, you’ll be disenrolled from TRICARE Prime and lose access to your PCM. You could then only get care at military hospitals and clinics if space is available. You’d need to wait until the next TRICARE Open Season to enroll in a plan.

Remember: Moving is a Qualifying Life Event. A QLE allows you and your eligible family members to change your TRICARE health plan outside of TRICARE Open Season. But if you don’t make a change within 90 days, you’ll need to wait until the next open season to enroll in a plan.

Are you planning to move soon? When you do, make sure to update your address in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. Check that your email address and phone number are current, too.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies.

For instance, some Marines are having to seek out mental health care from civilian providers because there aren’t enough mental health providers in military treatment facilities, Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps Carlos Ruiz told lawmakers.","Senior enlisted leaders called on lawmakers to help address ongoing problems with health care access for troops and their families during a congressional hearing on military quality-of-life challenges this week.

Funding shortages in the Military Health System and Defense Health Agency continue to affect the care available to beneficiaries and provider recruitment, said Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy James Honea during testimony before the House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday.

“I ask for your continued support for the Military Health System and finding innovative ways to ensure that DHA funding doesn’t compete with our warfighting priorities,” Honea told lawmakers.

When care isn’t available in the military treatment facilities, beneficiaries rely on civilian networks. However, limited resources have affected care delivery, provider recruitment and Tricare’s ability to compete in the civilian insurance market, Honea said, adding that Tricare’s reimbursement rates are tied to Medicare rates and are often too low for providers.

Honea also noted complications with the new Tricare contracts have delayed claims processing and damaged civilian medical providers’ trust in their timely payment.

Rep. John Rutherford, R-Fla., said the continued payment problem could result in some providers leaving the Tricare network. He cited one provider who is owed about $100,000 from Tricare.

“Our family members in Jacksonville deserve to have these outside providers available,” he said.

Tricare snafus cause medical shortfalls for military families

Military families have reported extensive issues with health care access since the new Tricare contracts began in January, which have caused medical shortfalls for some families and some providers dropping Tricare patients because of the difficulties, Military Times previously reported.

West Region beneficiaries and health care providers have reported a number of problems with the contract transition from Health Net Federal Services to TriWest Healthcare Alliance. Meanwhile, Humana Military has remained the East Region contractor, but a number of providers have reported difficulty getting paid since Jan. 1.

“I’ve taken a number of complaints from those providers,” said Honea. “They’re not being reimbursed on time. Defense Health Agency has worked with me to have those bills paid as quickly as possible.”

Medical provider shortages in the military health care system isn’t unique, as it is affecting communities across the country. However, with little to limited control over their assignment locations and providers, service members and their families are dependent on the Military Health System and local care.

When that access to health care doesn’t happen, Honea said, “It’s going to have detrimental effects to our family readiness and possibly to our military readiness, especially if we end up having to spend military readiness dollars toward making that account whole.”

Health care access is a pressing issue across all of the service branches, leaders said Tuesday. For instance, some Marines are having to seek out mental health care from civilian providers because there aren’t enough mental health providers in military treatment facilities, Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps Carlos Ruiz told lawmakers. Because there are few providers and appointments available in the civilian community, they may have to wait 45 to 60 days to get the help they need, Ruiz said.

“I can’t solve that problem, so I’m looking for you to help us bring attention to it,” he said.",https://www.navycrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cropped-favicon-32x32.png,N,0.0,2025-04-09 04:56:23.727051

They changed service providers and dropped ALL DMEs. They still offer DME coverage, so I cant get my secondary insurance to cover anything. But I also can't get anything I need because in thousand mile radius of me, there is no DME stores who take tricare now.

I am needing cpap supplies (ASV machine), it's to the point I can't breathe using my machine now. I keep blacking out and hoping I'll wake up in the morning, then when I do wake. I spend hours trying to stay awake because my body is so oxygen deprived.

I was at the end of the process of getting a custom wheelchair. Same provider. But it was dropped.

I have kids who need their incontinence supplies. Instead we have mounds of laundry.

We can't afford to pay out of pocket. My husband is a disabled veteran and I am disabled from a bad car accident, bad genetics, and now I also have an auto immune disorder causing paralysis.

Hours and hours of dealing with tricare on the phone. Different departments... express scripts, because tricare made me call them because they said express scripts was incharge of DME.... old tricare, waste of over 3 hours of my life for a 5 minute conversation to be told it was new tricare issue...

No options being offered. Until today they told me to find one out of state that a friend or family member could ship to me. So basically scour the website...Zip code by zip code... in 150 mile radius....until I find a DME who takes my insurance, and hope they ship free or I pay out of pocket to get supplies....., I dont know of anyone outside of the states Inalready checked, and ehat about my custom wheelchair? Nope. Not something I can just click and ship..... Just stay in bed forever. I told them lady this is not an option making me find a place. They should actually have DMEs with coverage or let me use my secondary insurance.

Read the full editorial below:

Public-sector workers spent 87,000 hours screwing you — just at one agency, just in two years

By: The New York Post Editorial Board

Unionized workers at the Defense Health Agency, tasked with overseeing benefits for US troops, spent 87,000 hours (and $3.3 million) during fiscal 2023 and 2024 doing union work instead of their actual jobs.

You read that right: 87,000 hours.

That’s equivalent to 3,625 days, almost a full man-hour decade.

Burned up by staffers tending to their own interests, to the detriment of the troops they’re nominally charged with helping and the taxpayers they’re answerable to: They spent those hours doing things like contract renegotiation and fringe-benefit squeeze-outs.

This info comes in a bombshell new report unearthed by Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), a veteran and a fierce advocate for the troops as well as a staunch fighter against fraud and waste as head of the Senate DOGE caucus.

Good: The more sunlight into government spending, the better.

Otherwise, there’s no way to ever know which handouts serve to advance America’s national interest and which line the pockets of powerful fiefdoms and their lords.

But it points to a bigger problem, i.e., that public-sector unions are bad news for everyone.

In the private sector, unionized workers use their collective power to win concessions from business owners. If that gums up the works too much, the company suffers and its customers and investors go elsewhere.

Government doesn’t work that way: The dissatisfied can’t escape so easily, and it’s politicians and other officials with no personal skin in the game who make the concessions.

And unionized government workers put the squeeze directly on you.

Every benefit, every pay hike, every extra comes out of the taxpayer’s pocket.

And by shielding the incompetent and criminal, stifling innovation and generally gumming up the works, public-sector unions screw over the people most dependent on government services.

That is, the poor, the disabled and the otherwise marginalized.

Even, in this case, the armed forces.

So the next time National Education Association head Becky Pringle starts in on one of her semi-comprehensible tirades about justice and equity, or any other municipal, state or federal public-union muckamuck throws a weepy, righteous temper tantrum — remember.

The only thing they want is to shove their hand deeper into your pocket.

A QLE allows you and your eligible family members to change your TRICARE health plan outside of TRICARE Open Season.
If you’re thinking of switching or enrolling in a new TRICARE health plan, check out the TRICARE Plan Finder tool.","Are you moving to a new home? Is it more than a 30-minute drive from your primary care manager? If so, TRICARE is making it simpler to keep your TRICARE Prime coverage. Now, most families who live more than 30 minutes but less than 100 miles from their PCM can continue seeing them without taking action.

What's new?

In the past, if you moved more than 30 minutes from your PCM, you would’ve had to fill out a drive time waiver to keep your coverage. Without this form, you would’ve risked losing access to your preferred PCM.

The new policy “flips” this process. If you live more than 30 minutes but less than 100 miles from your PCM, you won’t need to take any action to keep your coverage. TRICARE will automatically apply the drive time waiver for you, making it easier to keep your current PCM.

“Our data shows more than half of beneficiaries who waived their drive time access to care standard due to address issues lived less than 100 miles from their military hospital or clinic,” said Shane Pham, management and program analyst, TRICARE Health Plan Policy & Programs Branch, at the Defense Health Agency. “This new approach will help prevent unnecessary coverage gaps and ensure families keep access to their PCMs.”

How will it work?

If your TRICARE regional contractor learns that you’ve moved more than 30 minutes from your PCM, based on information on file, they’ll:

Call you

Send you a text

Mail you a letter

Email you

They’ll contact all adults in your household. You’ll have 90 days from the notification date to decide what to do about your coverage.

What do you need to do?

Your next steps depend on how far you live from your PCM.

If you live more than 30 minutes, but less than 100 miles, away:

You don't need to do anything if you want to keep TRICARE Prime coverage. Your coverage will stay the same, and you’ll keep your same PCM.

You can switch health plans if you want to.

If you live more than 100 miles away, you must choose one of these options within 90 days being notified by your regional contractor:

Confirm your decision to keep your current TRICARE Prime coverage.

Switch to TRICARE Select.

Switch to the US Family Health Plan (if it’s available in your area).

Switching to TRICARE Select or the USFHP (where available) lets you choose your PCM regardless of distance from your home. TRICARE Select lets you manage your own health care and get care from any TRICARE-authorized provider without a referral (in most situations), as described in the TRICARE Choices in the United States Handbook.

If you live more than 100 miles away and don't choose one of these options within 90 days, you'll be disenrolled from TRICARE Prime and lose access to your PCM. You could then only get care at military hospitals and clinics if space is available. You’d need to wait until the next TRICARE Open Season to enroll in a plan.

Remember: Moving is a Qualifying Life Event. A QLE allows you and your eligible family members to change your TRICARE health plan outside of TRICARE Open Season. But if you don’t make a change within 90 days, you’ll need to wait until the next open season to enroll in a plan.

Are you planning to move soon? When you do, make sure to update your address in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. Check that your email address and phone number are current, too.

Zynex's Disappointing Fourth Quarter Results

ZYXI share price depression stems from its disastrous 4Q 2024 earnings release. The Englewood, Colorado-based firm reported fourth-quarter 2024 revenue of $46.0 million, a roughly 2% year-over-year decline, falling short of Wall Street's expectations. The company also swung to a net loss of $0.02 per share, a stark contrast to the $0.04 net income per share reported in the same period last year.

The disappointing results reportedly prompted RBC Capital Markets to downgrade Zynex to Sector Perform from Outperform. According to news outlets, in a report to its clients, RBC analyst Shagun Singh cited a ""lack of visibility"" into the company's operations and commercial outlook, particularly concerning its relationship with Tricare, the military health program that represents a significant portion of Zynex's revenue.

Singh reportedly noted that Tricare, Zynex's largest customer, has temporarily suspended payments amid an ongoing review of prior claims. Singh added that the company's decision to withhold 2025 guidance and implement a 15% workforce reduction further compounded investor concerns. Singh revised RBC's price target for Zynex shares to $5.50, down from $11.00, warning of a potential ""domino effect"" stemming from Tricare's payment suspension.

Zynex Securities Class Action

Adding to Zynex's woes, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the District Court of Colorado, alleging that the company made false and misleading statements regarding its revenue recognition practices and its relationship with Tricare. The suit, captioned Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., et al., seeks to represent investors who purchased Zynex securities between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

The complaint alleges that Zynex engaged in ""oversupplying"" customers with products, including electrodes, leading to inflated revenue figures. It further claims that this practice drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare, and that Zynex failed to disclose the potential for adverse consequences, such as removal from insurer networks and government penalties.

According to the complaint, revelations of Zynex's alleged practices surfaced with a June 4, 2024 report by medical journal STAAT detailing an ""oversupplying scheme"" involving excessive shipments of supplies and subsequent inflated billing. The report also indicated that insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

The truth allegedly emerged on March 11, 2025, when Zynex reported its dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The complaint highlights Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard's attributing the fourth-quarter revenue shortfall to ""slower than normal payments from certain payers"" and the Tricare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman's Investigation

Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. ""We are examining Zynex's financial reporting and business practices. We believe investors deserve a complete and transparent understanding of these events,"" said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Zynex's Disappointing Fourth Quarter Results

ZYXI share price depression stems from its disastrous 4Q 2024 earnings release. The Englewood, Colorado-based firm reported fourth-quarter 2024 revenue of $46.0 million, a roughly 2% year-over-year decline, falling short of Wall Street's expectations. The company also swung to a net loss of $0.02 per share, a stark contrast to the $0.04 net income per share reported in the same period last year.

The disappointing results reportedly prompted RBC Capital Markets to downgrade Zynex to Sector Perform from Outperform. According to news outlets, in a report to its clients, RBC analyst Shagun Singh cited a ""lack of visibility"" into the company's operations and commercial outlook, particularly concerning its relationship with Tricare, the military health program that represents a significant portion of Zynex's revenue.

Singh reportedly noted that Tricare, Zynex's largest customer, has temporarily suspended payments amid an ongoing review of prior claims. Singh added that the company's decision to withhold 2025 guidance and implement a 15% workforce reduction further compounded investor concerns. Singh revised RBC's price target for Zynex shares to $5.50, down from $11.00, warning of a potential ""domino effect"" stemming from Tricare's payment suspension.

Zynex Securities Class Action

Adding to Zynex's woes, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the District Court of Colorado, alleging that the company made false and misleading statements regarding its revenue recognition practices and its relationship with Tricare. The suit, captioned Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., et al., seeks to represent investors who purchased Zynex securities between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

The complaint alleges that Zynex engaged in ""oversupplying"" customers with products, including electrodes, leading to inflated revenue figures. It further claims that this practice drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare, and that Zynex failed to disclose the potential for adverse consequences, such as removal from insurer networks and government penalties.

According to the complaint, revelations of Zynex's alleged practices surfaced with a June 4, 2024 report by medical journal STAAT detailing an ""oversupplying scheme"" involving excessive shipments of supplies and subsequent inflated billing. The report also indicated that insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

The truth allegedly emerged on March 11, 2025, when Zynex reported its dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The complaint highlights Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard's attributing the fourth-quarter revenue shortfall to ""slower than normal payments from certain payers"" and the Tricare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman's Investigation

Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. ""We are examining Zynex's financial reporting and business practices. We believe investors deserve a complete and transparent understanding of these events,"" said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

“Lean is the reduction of waste in a process to improve the efficiency, speed, and flexibility of a process.
“They achieved remarkable results as first patient surgical suite in-room time compliance increased from 34% (Baseline) to 90% (post-intervention),” Bloomer said.
“Process Yield (process effectiveness) for compliant surgical suite in-room time increased from 34% to 90%, with a net increase of 164.71%.
“Familiarize yourself with the tools, techniques, and methods involved in Lean Six Sigma to make meaningful improvements in organizational processes.","TWENTYNINE PALMS, Calif. – Sailors stationed at Naval Hospital Twentynine Palms took a significant step toward operational excellence on February 28, 2025, by participating in the Lean Six Sigma (LSS) Green Belt course, a rigorous and data-driven training program aimed at enhancing efficiency and patient care across Navy Medicine.

Led by James Bloomer, the Naval Medical Forces Pacific (NMFP) Regional Master Black Belt for Navy Medicine Improvement Sciences, the weeklong course introduced participants to the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control (DMAIC) methodology. This five-step approach is the cornerstone of Lean Six Sigma and a vital part of Navy Medicine's ""Get Real, Get Better"" initiative, designed to elevate readiness, reduce variation, and eliminate waste in daily operations.

“Lean Six Sigma Green Belt Training (LSSGB) introduces the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control (DMAIC) performance improvement methodology used to identify and increase efficiency opportunities by breaking down potential variables in a process to their individual steps, work to reduce or eliminate errors and defects and reduce risk,” said Bloomer. “Utilizing the DMAIC process not only helps in improving processes, but also aligns with the Surgeon General’s task for units to utilize the DMAIC process towards Get Real Get Better (GRGB).”

Throughout the course, Sailors from across NMRTC Twentynine Palms were immersed in the fundamental principles of Lean and Six Sigma. These complementary methodologies empower professionals to drive measurable improvements in both clinical and administrative settings.

“The two methodologies taught throughout the week are Lean and Six Sigma,” Bloomer explained. “Lean is the reduction of waste in a process to improve the efficiency, speed, and flexibility of a process. Six Sigma is the reduction of variation in a process to improve the quality within the process.”

With a blend of classroom instruction and real-world examples, participants learned how to collect and interpret data, identify root causes of inefficiencies, and implement sustainable solutions to complex problems. These skills are essential not only to the daily operations of military treatment facilities but also to broader Navy and Marine Corps readiness goals.

“LSS helps reduce waste and improve processes leading to faster and more effective patient care, significantly enhancing patient safety by minimizing errors and improving overall care quality,” Bloomer said.

According to Bloomer, military medical facilities face a range of recurring challenges that Lean Six Sigma is uniquely equipped to address — including patient wait times, lab testing efficiency, and appointment no-show rates. By reducing waste and process variation, LSS allows healthcare providers to focus more time and resources on delivering high-quality care.

One example of LSS’s impact comes from a recent project focused on the Main Operating Room (MOR) of a Navy medical facility. This initiative aimed to improve compliance with the Department of Defense’s standard for first-patient, in-room surgical start times.

“Compliance with surgical suite in-room time of 0730 for the first patient of the day in the Main Operating Room (MOR) had been a problem resulting in decreased surgical suite utilization, patient safety, as well as patient, surgeon, and perioperative staff satisfaction,” Bloomer shared. “If this problem continued, the Main Operating Room would continue to be non-compliant with DHA surgical suite in-room time standards.”

Through targeted interventions guided by the DMAIC process, the facility saw dramatic improvements.

“They achieved remarkable results as first patient surgical suite in-room time compliance increased from 34% (Baseline) to 90% (post-intervention),” Bloomer said. “Process Yield (process effectiveness) for compliant surgical suite in-room time increased from 34% to 90%, with a net increase of 164.71%. Their Sigma Level increased from 0.588σ to 2.282σ (post-intervention), exceeding the goal of 1.5σ and significantly reducing process variance.”

Bloomer emphasized that the project had far-reaching effects beyond just metrics. “Successful implementation of improving first patient surgical suite in-room time compliance for the MOR resulted in increased surgical suite utilization, patient safety, and patient/preoperative staff satisfaction, as well as compliance.”

The LSS Green Belt course is part of a broader effort by Navy Medicine to equip leaders with tools to optimize care delivery and strengthen the military health system. By training its personnel in proven business and quality improvement practices, the Navy ensures that its facilities remain adaptable, responsive, and mission-ready.

“LSS projects have led to significant increases in individual, dental, and overall readiness with our warfighters,” said Bloomer.

Upon completion of the course, each participant is expected to lead two DMAIC projects within a year to achieve full Green Belt certification. Successful certification results in the awarding of a new Additional Qualification Designation (AQD) for officers and a new Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) for enlisted personnel.

“Each student is expected to complete two DMAIC projects within one year to achieve LSSGB Certification. Once the students receive their certification, Officers receive a new Additional Qualification Designation (AQD) and Enlisted receive a new Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC),” Bloomer said.

More than just a resume-builder, the training offers lifelong value — both inside and outside the Navy.

“LSS training aligns with Navy Medicine’s broader goals for operational excellence by enhancing process efficiency and quality,” he added. “It helps in reducing waste, improving workflow, and increasing operational effectiveness, which are essential for achieving operational excellence. By applying LSS methodologies, Navy Medicine can create greater alignment across its operations, ultimately delivering sustained value and improving overall performance.”

For Sailors and staff interested in continuing their journey in process improvement, Bloomer offers straightforward advice.

“Utilizing the DMAIC roadmap, medical professionals can incorporate LSS principles by defining requirements for patient needs and expectations, measuring performance to ensure they meet patient requirements, analyzing data to identify areas for improvement and quality issues, improve processes to enhance efficiency and reduce waste, and control processes to maintain improvements and monitor processes,” he said.

“Familiarize yourself with the tools, techniques, and methods involved in Lean Six Sigma to make meaningful improvements in organizational processes. Also, pursue certification — LSS is highly sought after in the civilian community, so whether someone stays in the Navy for a short term or 30 years they can use LSS on the outside.”

As the Sailors of Naval Hospital Twentynine Palms continue their training and begin implementing their own process improvement projects, the impact of this course is expected to ripple throughout Navy Medicine — enhancing not only patient outcomes and operational readiness but also cultivating a culture of continuous improvement.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2504/8960438/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-08 17:57:00.930908

The researchers’ analysis highlighted differences between breast and cervical cancer screening rates.
For breast cancer screening, they found higher screening rates for older, married, more senior women (ages 50-64).
For cervical cancer screening, they found higher screening rates for younger, unmarried, more junior women (ages 21-29).
Similar results were observed when looking at two-year screening rates vs. one-year screening rates.","An interdisciplinary team of researchers including Joel Segel, associate professor of health policy and administration at Penn State, recently analyzed 2007-2019 Military Health System (MHS) data of female patients to examine individual and location factors associated with one- and two-year breast and cervical cancer screening rates. For cervical cancer screening, they examined data from women ages 21-64. For breast cancer screening, they examined data from women ages 40-64. Their findings, published in Military Medicine, showed higher rates for cervical cancer screening where more health care is delivered from civilian care providers.

The researchers’ analysis highlighted differences between breast and cervical cancer screening rates. For breast cancer screening, they found higher screening rates for older, married, more senior women (ages 50-64). For cervical cancer screening, they found higher screening rates for younger, unmarried, more junior women (ages 21-29).

“These findings are consistent with the recommendations made by the US Preventive Services Task Force for breast and cervical cancer screening,” Segel said. “While these results did not come as a surprise, we were happy our results showed the MHS is following those health care standards.”

The researchers also found minimal differences in screening across demographic groups likely due to comprehensive coverage and broad access to care.

While the researchers looked at demographic data, they also estimated differences in screening rates based on the fraction of purchased care vs. direct care from a military provider, and average per capita spending in catchment areas – a 40-mile radius around a military medical facility.

In the military, there are two primary ways to receive health care. Individuals can go to a military medical facility on or near their base or, depending on location, can go to a hospital or facility in a civilian setting and purchase care. The researchers found higher rates for both breast and cervical cancer screening in catchment areas where more health care was delivered via purchased care in a civilian setting.

Women living in an area with a higher rate of purchased care had an increased probability of receiving a mammogram screening within one year. For every additional $1,000 in per capita spending, women had an even higher likelihood of receiving a mammogram screening within one year. Similar results were observed when looking at two-year screening rates vs. one-year screening rates.

According to Segel, these differences are likely due to a larger availability of purchased care and more options for individuals to seek care and treatment, making it easier to get appointments with health care providers.

While many of the findings may be attributed to differences in these cancer screening types, they emphasize the importance of continuing to provide timely breast and cervical cancer screening, which looks to be a success of the options afforded to military personnel through the MHS.

This work is part of a broader study Segel is working on to better understand geographic variations in health care within the MHS.

“We’ve been looking at this data more broadly to determine if differences in screening rates are partially due to placement factors in the military,” Segel said. “The Defense Health Agency is very concerned about variation. When the military relocates individuals, they want to ensure everyone has the same access to the same quality of care. We hope to ultimately have a better understanding of why certain areas are higher or lower in terms of screening rates, as well as broader patterns of variation in treatment and prevention.”
