Zynex’s Disappointing Fourth Quarter Results

ZYXI share price depression stems from its disastrous 4Q 2024 earnings release. The Englewood, Colorado-based firm reported fourth-quarter 2024 revenue of $46.0 million, a roughly 2% year-over-year decline, falling short of Wall Street's expectations. The company also swung to a net loss of $0.02 per share, a stark contrast to the $0.04 net income per share reported in the same period last year.

The disappointing results reportedly prompted RBC Capital Markets to downgrade Zynex to Sector Perform from Outperform. According to news outlets, in a report to its clients, RBC analyst Shagun Singh cited a ""lack of visibility"" into the company's operations and commercial outlook, particularly concerning its relationship with Tricare, the military health program that represents a significant portion of Zynex's revenue.

Singh reportedly noted that Tricare, Zynex's largest customer, has temporarily suspended payments amid an ongoing review of prior claims. Singh added that the company's decision to withhold 2025 guidance and implement a 15% workforce reduction further compounded investor concerns. Singh revised RBC’s price target for Zynex shares to $5.50, down from $11.00, warning of a potential ""domino effect"" stemming from Tricare's payment suspension.

Zynex Securities Class Action

Adding to Zynex’s woes, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the District Court of Colorado, alleging that the company made false and misleading statements regarding its revenue recognition practices and its relationship with Tricare. The suit, captioned Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., et al., seeks to represent investors who purchased Zynex securities between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

The complaint alleges that Zynex engaged in “oversupplying” customers with products, including electrodes, leading to inflated revenue figures. It further claims that this practice drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare, and that Zynex failed to disclose the potential for adverse consequences, such as removal from insurer networks and government penalties.

According to the complaint, revelations of Zynex's alleged practices surfaced with a June 4, 2024 report by medical journal STAAT detailing an ""oversupplying scheme"" involving excessive shipments of supplies and subsequent inflated billing. The report also indicated that insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

The truth allegedly emerged on March 11, 2025, when Zynex reported its dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The complaint highlights Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard’s attributing the fourth-quarter revenue shortfall to ""slower than normal payments from certain payers"" and the Tricare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman’s Investigation

Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. “We are examining Zynex's financial reporting and business practices. We believe investors deserve a complete and transparent understanding of these events,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Recruiting crisis for Uncle Sam? Elected officials and top Pentagon Generals earned it.

In The News

Troops need better health care access, top enlisted tell lawmakers

By Karen Jowers

Apr 8, 2025 – Marine Corps Times

“When care isn’t available in the military treatment facilities, beneficiaries rely on civilian networks. However, limited resources have affected care delivery, provider recruitment and Tricare’s ability to compete in the civilian insurance market, Honea said, adding that Tricare’s reimbursement rates are tied to Medicare rates and are often too low for providers.”

Uncle Sam is not paying the bills:

“Honea also noted complications with the new Tricare contracts have delayed claims processing and damaged civilian medical providers’ trust in their timely payment.”

TRICARE has earned a reputation:

“Rep. John Rutherford, R-Fla., said the continued payment problem could result in some providers leaving the Tricare network. He cited one provider who is owed about $100,000 from Tricare.”

Welcome Home Troops

“Military families have reported extensive issues with health care access since the new Tricare contracts began in January, which have caused medical shortfalls for some families and some providers dropping Tricare patients because of the difficulties, Military Times previously reported.”

Military suicide has been a thing for years now and this is what you get:

“For instance, some Marines are having to seek out mental health care from civilian providers because there aren’t enough mental health providers in military treatment facilities, Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps Carlos Ruiz told lawmakers. Because there are few providers and appointments available in the civilian community, they may have to wait 45 to 60 days to get the help they need, Ruiz said.”

Notice that elected officials have not taken the initiative to fix TRICARE problems that have dragged on since Jan first. They sit and listen to requests to take e action in April of 2025.

Not here to say that military benefits are inadequate. Just stick with whatever was offered when people signed up to stay on for multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and we’re good.

The US Dept. of Defense has really taken a dive since the 1980s. I’ll do a blog on that later.

Naval Hospital Bremerton in the news:

Decade of reductions at Naval Hospital Bremerton push out retirees, beneficiaries

Conor Wilson – Kitsap Sun April 3, 2025

“Over the last decade, the hospital has been gutted, leaving a major gap in the local health care sector and bogging down local providers. As large numbers of military retirees and beneficiaries are forced out of the military system, they increasingly find themselves searching for care in an overburdened civilian sector desperately short on providers and struggling to provide access to routine care.”

U.S. Sen. Patty Murray:

“This pattern of declining care and personnel mismanagement at one of the largest Naval bases in the nation suggests a lack of attention to the healthcare needs of servicemembers, veterans, and their families in Kitsap County.”

“Naval Hospital Bremerton did not make a member of its leadership available for an interview as part of this story, despite multiple requests since late February.”

“Kitsap County has a shortage of primary care providers, with about half as many per capita as the state average in 2023, according to Washington Health Care Research Center.”

Ask A Recruiter

“Reductions at Naval Hospital Bremerton over the last decade come as the Department of Defense, the federal agency that runs the military health system, has reduced spending on health care. As part of a major realignment designed to shed costs, it has prioritized operational readiness for wartime missions and care for those on active duty over that of beneficiaries and retirees.”

“Civilian providers say they are increasingly shouldering the load left by the Navy. The result is worse access across the board for primary, maternal and specialty care for all residents, including those not connected to the military. Shortages are driving up hospital bills, as more people depend on emergent care, and likely leading to worse outcomes for Kitsap patients.”

“Virginia Mason Franciscan Health, who own St. Michael Medical Center in Silverdale and St. Anthony Hospital in Gig Harbor, has seen “increased demand as military health care facilities have adjusted their offerings over the years,” St Michael President Chad Melton wrote in an email.”

“…military health care facilities have adjusted their offerings…”

Politician speak will take you to the highest levels.

Thousands of men and women who did time in uniform over the past 25 years did one or more tours in places like Syria, Africa, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kosovo. Some stayed for 20.

Now, these people are told that the benefits they thought they were earning when reenlisting for another tour are going away in order to save money. WTF?

Same country that sent big cash to Ukraine several times over in 2024.

Today, Uncle Sam needs more people to volunteer to go to far away places and maybe never come back again.

Good luck with your US Armed Forces recruiting crisis.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report titled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills,"" which claimed that Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of supplies, such as electrode pads and batteries, in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. The lead plaintiff is usually the investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff.

Unlock your health with TRICARE—learn how to get care based on your TRICARE health plan.","APRIL 9, 2025 – Are you moving to a new home? Is it more than a 30-minute drive from your primary care manager? If so, TRICARE is making it simpler to keep your TRICARE Prime coverage. Now, most families who live more than 30 minutes but less than 100 miles from their PCM can continue seeing them without taking action.

What’s new?

In the past, if you moved more than 30 minutes from your PCM, you would’ve had to fill out a drive time waiver to keep your coverage. Without this form, you would’ve risked losing access to your preferred PCM.

The new policy “flips” this process. If you live more than 30 minutes but less than 100 miles from your PCM, you won’t need to take any action to keep your coverage. TRICARE will automatically apply the drive time waiver for you, making it easier to keep your current PCM.

“Our data shows more than half of beneficiaries who waived their drive time access to care standard due to address issues lived less than 100 miles from their military hospital or clinic,” said Shane Pham, management and program analyst, TRICARE Health Plan Policy & Programs Branch, at the Defense Health Agency. “This new approach will help prevent unnecessary coverage gaps and ensure families keep access to their PCMs.”

How will it work?

If your TRICARE regional contractor learns that you’ve moved more than 30 minutes from your PCM, based on information on file, they’ll:

Call you

Send you a text

Mail you a letter

Email you

They’ll contact all adults in your household. You’ll have 90 days from the notification date to decide what to do about your coverage.

What do you need to do?

Your next steps depend on how far you live from your PCM.

If you live more than 30 minutes, but less than 100 miles, away:

You don’t need to do anything if you want to keep TRICARE Prime coverage. Your coverage will stay the same, and you’ll keep your same PCM.

You can switch health plans if you want to.

If you live more than 100 miles away, you must choose one of these options within 90 days being notified by your regional contractor:

Confirm your decision to keep your current TRICARE Prime coverage.

Switch to TRICARE Select.

Switch to the US Family Health Plan (if it’s available in your area).

Switching to TRICARE Select or the USFHP (where available) lets you choose your PCM regardless of distance from your home. TRICARE Select lets you manage your own health care and get care from any TRICARE-authorized provider without a referral (in most situations), as described in the TRICARE Choices in the United States Handbook.

If you live more than 100 miles away and don’t choose one of these options within 90 days, you’ll be disenrolled from TRICARE Prime and lose access to your PCM. You could then only get care at military hospitals and clinics if space is available. You’d need to wait until the next TRICARE Open Season to enroll in a plan.

Remember: Moving is a Qualifying Life Event. A QLE allows you and your eligible family members to change your TRICARE health plan outside of TRICARE Open Season. But if you don’t make a change within 90 days, you’ll need to wait until the next open season to enroll in a plan.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies.

For instance, some Marines are having to seek out mental health care from civilian providers because there aren’t enough mental health providers in military treatment facilities, Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps Carlos Ruiz told lawmakers.","Senior enlisted leaders called on lawmakers to help address ongoing problems with health care access for troops and their families during a congressional hearing on military quality-of-life challenges this week.

Funding shortages in the Military Health System and Defense Health Agency continue to affect the care available to beneficiaries and provider recruitment, said Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy James Honea during testimony before the House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday.

“I ask for your continued support for the Military Health System and finding innovative ways to ensure that DHA funding doesn’t compete with our warfighting priorities,” Honea told lawmakers.

When care isn’t available in the military treatment facilities, beneficiaries rely on civilian networks. However, limited resources have affected care delivery, provider recruitment and Tricare’s ability to compete in the civilian insurance market, Honea said, adding that Tricare’s reimbursement rates are tied to Medicare rates and are often too low for providers.

Honea also noted complications with the new Tricare contracts have delayed claims processing and damaged civilian medical providers’ trust in their timely payment.

Rep. John Rutherford, R-Fla., said the continued payment problem could result in some providers leaving the Tricare network. He cited one provider who is owed about $100,000 from Tricare.

“Our family members in Jacksonville deserve to have these outside providers available,” he said.

Tricare snafus cause medical shortfalls for military families

Military families have reported extensive issues with health care access since the new Tricare contracts began in January, which have caused medical shortfalls for some families and some providers dropping Tricare patients because of the difficulties, Military Times previously reported.

West Region beneficiaries and health care providers have reported a number of problems with the contract transition from Health Net Federal Services to TriWest Healthcare Alliance. Meanwhile, Humana Military has remained the East Region contractor, but a number of providers have reported difficulty getting paid since Jan. 1.

“I’ve taken a number of complaints from those providers,” said Honea. “They’re not being reimbursed on time. Defense Health Agency has worked with me to have those bills paid as quickly as possible.”

Medical provider shortages in the military health care system isn’t unique, as it is affecting communities across the country. However, with little to limited control over their assignment locations and providers, service members and their families are dependent on the Military Health System and local care.

When that access to health care doesn’t happen, Honea said, “It’s going to have detrimental effects to our family readiness and possibly to our military readiness, especially if we end up having to spend military readiness dollars toward making that account whole.”

Health care access is a pressing issue across all of the service branches, leaders said Tuesday. For instance, some Marines are having to seek out mental health care from civilian providers because there aren’t enough mental health providers in military treatment facilities, Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps Carlos Ruiz told lawmakers. Because there are few providers and appointments available in the civilian community, they may have to wait 45 to 60 days to get the help they need, Ruiz said.

“I can’t solve that problem, so I’m looking for you to help us bring attention to it,” he said.",https://www.navycrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cropped-favicon-32x32.png,N,0.0,2025-04-09 04:56:23.727051

They changed service providers and dropped ALL DMEs. They still offer DME coverage, so I cant get my secondary insurance to cover anything. But I also can't get anything I need because in thousand mile radius of me, there is no DME stores who take tricare now.

I am needing cpap supplies (ASV machine), it's to the point I can't breathe using my machine now. I keep blacking out and hoping I'll wake up in the morning, then when I do wake. I spend hours trying to stay awake because my body is so oxygen deprived.

I was at the end of the process of getting a custom wheelchair. Same provider. But it was dropped.

I have kids who need their incontinence supplies. Instead we have mounds of laundry.

We can't afford to pay out of pocket. My husband is a disabled veteran and I am disabled from a bad car accident, bad genetics, and now I also have an auto immune disorder causing paralysis.

Hours and hours of dealing with tricare on the phone. Different departments... express scripts, because tricare made me call them because they said express scripts was incharge of DME.... old tricare, waste of over 3 hours of my life for a 5 minute conversation to be told it was new tricare issue...

No options being offered. Until today they told me to find one out of state that a friend or family member could ship to me. So basically scour the website...Zip code by zip code... in 150 mile radius....until I find a DME who takes my insurance, and hope they ship free or I pay out of pocket to get supplies....., I dont know of anyone outside of the states Inalready checked, and ehat about my custom wheelchair? Nope. Not something I can just click and ship..... Just stay in bed forever. I told them lady this is not an option making me find a place. They should actually have DMEs with coverage or let me use my secondary insurance.

Read the full editorial below:

Public-sector workers spent 87,000 hours screwing you — just at one agency, just in two years

By: The New York Post Editorial Board

Unionized workers at the Defense Health Agency, tasked with overseeing benefits for US troops, spent 87,000 hours (and $3.3 million) during fiscal 2023 and 2024 doing union work instead of their actual jobs.

You read that right: 87,000 hours.

That’s equivalent to 3,625 days, almost a full man-hour decade.

Burned up by staffers tending to their own interests, to the detriment of the troops they’re nominally charged with helping and the taxpayers they’re answerable to: They spent those hours doing things like contract renegotiation and fringe-benefit squeeze-outs.

This info comes in a bombshell new report unearthed by Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), a veteran and a fierce advocate for the troops as well as a staunch fighter against fraud and waste as head of the Senate DOGE caucus.

Good: The more sunlight into government spending, the better.

Otherwise, there’s no way to ever know which handouts serve to advance America’s national interest and which line the pockets of powerful fiefdoms and their lords.

But it points to a bigger problem, i.e., that public-sector unions are bad news for everyone.

In the private sector, unionized workers use their collective power to win concessions from business owners. If that gums up the works too much, the company suffers and its customers and investors go elsewhere.

Government doesn’t work that way: The dissatisfied can’t escape so easily, and it’s politicians and other officials with no personal skin in the game who make the concessions.

And unionized government workers put the squeeze directly on you.

Every benefit, every pay hike, every extra comes out of the taxpayer’s pocket.

And by shielding the incompetent and criminal, stifling innovation and generally gumming up the works, public-sector unions screw over the people most dependent on government services.

That is, the poor, the disabled and the otherwise marginalized.

Even, in this case, the armed forces.

So the next time National Education Association head Becky Pringle starts in on one of her semi-comprehensible tirades about justice and equity, or any other municipal, state or federal public-union muckamuck throws a weepy, righteous temper tantrum — remember.

The only thing they want is to shove their hand deeper into your pocket.

A QLE allows you and your eligible family members to change your TRICARE health plan outside of TRICARE Open Season.
If you’re thinking of switching or enrolling in a new TRICARE health plan, check out the TRICARE Plan Finder tool.","Are you moving to a new home? Is it more than a 30-minute drive from your primary care manager? If so, TRICARE is making it simpler to keep your TRICARE Prime coverage. Now, most families who live more than 30 minutes but less than 100 miles from their PCM can continue seeing them without taking action.

What's new?

In the past, if you moved more than 30 minutes from your PCM, you would’ve had to fill out a drive time waiver to keep your coverage. Without this form, you would’ve risked losing access to your preferred PCM.

The new policy “flips” this process. If you live more than 30 minutes but less than 100 miles from your PCM, you won’t need to take any action to keep your coverage. TRICARE will automatically apply the drive time waiver for you, making it easier to keep your current PCM.

“Our data shows more than half of beneficiaries who waived their drive time access to care standard due to address issues lived less than 100 miles from their military hospital or clinic,” said Shane Pham, management and program analyst, TRICARE Health Plan Policy & Programs Branch, at the Defense Health Agency. “This new approach will help prevent unnecessary coverage gaps and ensure families keep access to their PCMs.”

How will it work?

If your TRICARE regional contractor learns that you’ve moved more than 30 minutes from your PCM, based on information on file, they’ll:

Call you

Send you a text

Mail you a letter

Email you

They’ll contact all adults in your household. You’ll have 90 days from the notification date to decide what to do about your coverage.

What do you need to do?

Your next steps depend on how far you live from your PCM.

If you live more than 30 minutes, but less than 100 miles, away:

You don't need to do anything if you want to keep TRICARE Prime coverage. Your coverage will stay the same, and you’ll keep your same PCM.

You can switch health plans if you want to.

If you live more than 100 miles away, you must choose one of these options within 90 days being notified by your regional contractor:

Confirm your decision to keep your current TRICARE Prime coverage.

Switch to TRICARE Select.

Switch to the US Family Health Plan (if it’s available in your area).

Switching to TRICARE Select or the USFHP (where available) lets you choose your PCM regardless of distance from your home. TRICARE Select lets you manage your own health care and get care from any TRICARE-authorized provider without a referral (in most situations), as described in the TRICARE Choices in the United States Handbook.

If you live more than 100 miles away and don't choose one of these options within 90 days, you'll be disenrolled from TRICARE Prime and lose access to your PCM. You could then only get care at military hospitals and clinics if space is available. You’d need to wait until the next TRICARE Open Season to enroll in a plan.

Remember: Moving is a Qualifying Life Event. A QLE allows you and your eligible family members to change your TRICARE health plan outside of TRICARE Open Season. But if you don’t make a change within 90 days, you’ll need to wait until the next open season to enroll in a plan.

Update your information in DEERS

Are you planning to move soon? When you do, make sure to update your address in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. Check that your email address and phone number are current, too. This will help make sure you don’t miss any important communications from TRICARE, including messages about drive time waivers.

Zynex's Disappointing Fourth Quarter Results

ZYXI share price depression stems from its disastrous 4Q 2024 earnings release. The Englewood, Colorado-based firm reported fourth-quarter 2024 revenue of $46.0 million, a roughly 2% year-over-year decline, falling short of Wall Street's expectations. The company also swung to a net loss of $0.02 per share, a stark contrast to the $0.04 net income per share reported in the same period last year.

The disappointing results reportedly prompted RBC Capital Markets to downgrade Zynex to Sector Perform from Outperform. According to news outlets, in a report to its clients, RBC analyst Shagun Singh cited a ""lack of visibility"" into the company's operations and commercial outlook, particularly concerning its relationship with Tricare, the military health program that represents a significant portion of Zynex's revenue.

Singh reportedly noted that Tricare, Zynex's largest customer, has temporarily suspended payments amid an ongoing review of prior claims. Singh added that the company's decision to withhold 2025 guidance and implement a 15% workforce reduction further compounded investor concerns. Singh revised RBC's price target for Zynex shares to $5.50, down from $11.00, warning of a potential ""domino effect"" stemming from Tricare's payment suspension.

Zynex Securities Class Action

Adding to Zynex's woes, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the District Court of Colorado, alleging that the company made false and misleading statements regarding its revenue recognition practices and its relationship with Tricare. The suit, captioned Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., et al., seeks to represent investors who purchased Zynex securities between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

The complaint alleges that Zynex engaged in ""oversupplying"" customers with products, including electrodes, leading to inflated revenue figures. It further claims that this practice drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare, and that Zynex failed to disclose the potential for adverse consequences, such as removal from insurer networks and government penalties.

According to the complaint, revelations of Zynex's alleged practices surfaced with a June 4, 2024 report by medical journal STAAT detailing an ""oversupplying scheme"" involving excessive shipments of supplies and subsequent inflated billing. The report also indicated that insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

The truth allegedly emerged on March 11, 2025, when Zynex reported its dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The complaint highlights Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard's attributing the fourth-quarter revenue shortfall to ""slower than normal payments from certain payers"" and the Tricare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman's Investigation

Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. ""We are examining Zynex's financial reporting and business practices. We believe investors deserve a complete and transparent understanding of these events,"" said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Butler has dedicated his career to advancing battlefield trauma care and improving medical responses in both military and civilian settings. His journey began as a Navy SEAL, where he gained firsthand experience with the challenges faced in combat environments. In 1996, he pioneered the Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) program which has since become the standard for trauma care across the U.S. military and has influenced practices worldwide. During his tenure as Chair of the Department of Defense’s Committee on TCCC, Butler led a multidisciplinary team that significantly increased survival rates during conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. His innovations, including the implementation of tourniquets and hemostatic dressings, have transformed both military operations and civilian emergency medical responses.

Butler's contributions extend beyond the battlefield. As a member of the White House advisory team on civilian IED injuries and a founding member of the Hartford Consensus Working Group, he played an instrumental role in launching the national “STOP THE BLEED®” campaign, which empowers bystanders to act in emergencies involving severe bleeding. His numerous accolades highlight his commitment to excellence in trauma care, including the American College of Surgeons Distinguished Military Lifetime Achievement Award and the Military Health System Battlefield Medicine Innovation Award, among others. The Presidential Citizens Medal, one of the highest honors a civilian can receive, recognizes Butler’s extraordinary contributions to battlefield trauma care and his enduring impact on both military and civilian medicine.

The USU commencement ceremony is held annually on Armed Forces Day at the Daughters of the American Revolution Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C. This event incorporates the traditions and pomp of both military service and academia. More than 300 students will be conferred degrees, marking the culmination of years of education, training, leadership, and research for military and civilian members of the graduating class.

Singh revised RBC's price target for Zynex shares to $5.50, down from $11.00, warning of a potential ""domino effect"" stemming from Tricare's payment suspension.

Zynex Securities Class Action

Adding to Zynex's woes, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the District Court of Colorado, alleging that the company made false and misleading statements regarding its revenue recognition practices and its relationship with Tricare. The suit, captioned Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., et al., seeks to represent investors who purchased Zynex securities between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

The complaint alleges that Zynex engaged in ""oversupplying"" customers with products, including electrodes, leading to inflated revenue figures. It further claims that this practice drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare, and that Zynex failed to disclose the potential for adverse consequences, such as removal from insurer networks and government penalties.

According to the complaint, revelations of Zynex's alleged practices surfaced with a June 4, 2024 report by medical journal STAAT detailing an ""oversupplying scheme"" involving excessive shipments of supplies and subsequent inflated billing. The report also indicated that insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

The truth allegedly emerged on March 11, 2025, when Zynex reported its dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The complaint highlights Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard's attributing the fourth-quarter revenue shortfall to ""slower than normal payments from certain payers"" and the Tricare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman's Investigation

Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. ""We are examining Zynex's financial reporting and business practices. We believe investors deserve a complete and transparent understanding of these events,"" said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

“Lean is the reduction of waste in a process to improve the efficiency, speed, and flexibility of a process.
“They achieved remarkable results as first patient surgical suite in-room time compliance increased from 34% (Baseline) to 90% (post-intervention),” Bloomer said.
“Process Yield (process effectiveness) for compliant surgical suite in-room time increased from 34% to 90%, with a net increase of 164.71%.
“Familiarize yourself with the tools, techniques, and methods involved in Lean Six Sigma to make meaningful improvements in organizational processes.","TWENTYNINE PALMS, Calif. – Sailors stationed at Naval Hospital Twentynine Palms took a significant step toward operational excellence on February 28, 2025, by participating in the Lean Six Sigma (LSS) Green Belt course, a rigorous and data-driven training program aimed at enhancing efficiency and patient care across Navy Medicine.

Led by James Bloomer, the Naval Medical Forces Pacific (NMFP) Regional Master Black Belt for Navy Medicine Improvement Sciences, the weeklong course introduced participants to the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control (DMAIC) methodology. This five-step approach is the cornerstone of Lean Six Sigma and a vital part of Navy Medicine's ""Get Real, Get Better"" initiative, designed to elevate readiness, reduce variation, and eliminate waste in daily operations.

“Lean Six Sigma Green Belt Training (LSSGB) introduces the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control (DMAIC) performance improvement methodology used to identify and increase efficiency opportunities by breaking down potential variables in a process to their individual steps, work to reduce or eliminate errors and defects and reduce risk,” said Bloomer. “Utilizing the DMAIC process not only helps in improving processes, but also aligns with the Surgeon General’s task for units to utilize the DMAIC process towards Get Real Get Better (GRGB).”

Throughout the course, Sailors from across NMRTC Twentynine Palms were immersed in the fundamental principles of Lean and Six Sigma. These complementary methodologies empower professionals to drive measurable improvements in both clinical and administrative settings.

“The two methodologies taught throughout the week are Lean and Six Sigma,” Bloomer explained. “Lean is the reduction of waste in a process to improve the efficiency, speed, and flexibility of a process. Six Sigma is the reduction of variation in a process to improve the quality within the process.”

With a blend of classroom instruction and real-world examples, participants learned how to collect and interpret data, identify root causes of inefficiencies, and implement sustainable solutions to complex problems. These skills are essential not only to the daily operations of military treatment facilities but also to broader Navy and Marine Corps readiness goals.

“LSS helps reduce waste and improve processes leading to faster and more effective patient care, significantly enhancing patient safety by minimizing errors and improving overall care quality,” Bloomer said.

According to Bloomer, military medical facilities face a range of recurring challenges that Lean Six Sigma is uniquely equipped to address — including patient wait times, lab testing efficiency, and appointment no-show rates. By reducing waste and process variation, LSS allows healthcare providers to focus more time and resources on delivering high-quality care.

One example of LSS’s impact comes from a recent project focused on the Main Operating Room (MOR) of a Navy medical facility. This initiative aimed to improve compliance with the Department of Defense’s standard for first-patient, in-room surgical start times.

“Compliance with surgical suite in-room time of 0730 for the first patient of the day in the Main Operating Room (MOR) had been a problem resulting in decreased surgical suite utilization, patient safety, as well as patient, surgeon, and perioperative staff satisfaction,” Bloomer shared. “If this problem continued, the Main Operating Room would continue to be non-compliant with DHA surgical suite in-room time standards.”

Through targeted interventions guided by the DMAIC process, the facility saw dramatic improvements.

“They achieved remarkable results as first patient surgical suite in-room time compliance increased from 34% (Baseline) to 90% (post-intervention),” Bloomer said. “Process Yield (process effectiveness) for compliant surgical suite in-room time increased from 34% to 90%, with a net increase of 164.71%. Their Sigma Level increased from 0.588σ to 2.282σ (post-intervention), exceeding the goal of 1.5σ and significantly reducing process variance.”

Bloomer emphasized that the project had far-reaching effects beyond just metrics. “Successful implementation of improving first patient surgical suite in-room time compliance for the MOR resulted in increased surgical suite utilization, patient safety, and patient/preoperative staff satisfaction, as well as compliance.”

The LSS Green Belt course is part of a broader effort by Navy Medicine to equip leaders with tools to optimize care delivery and strengthen the military health system. By training its personnel in proven business and quality improvement practices, the Navy ensures that its facilities remain adaptable, responsive, and mission-ready.

“LSS projects have led to significant increases in individual, dental, and overall readiness with our warfighters,” said Bloomer.

Upon completion of the course, each participant is expected to lead two DMAIC projects within a year to achieve full Green Belt certification. Successful certification results in the awarding of a new Additional Qualification Designation (AQD) for officers and a new Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) for enlisted personnel.

“Each student is expected to complete two DMAIC projects within one year to achieve LSSGB Certification. Once the students receive their certification, Officers receive a new Additional Qualification Designation (AQD) and Enlisted receive a new Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC),” Bloomer said.

More than just a resume-builder, the training offers lifelong value — both inside and outside the Navy.

“LSS training aligns with Navy Medicine’s broader goals for operational excellence by enhancing process efficiency and quality,” he added. “It helps in reducing waste, improving workflow, and increasing operational effectiveness, which are essential for achieving operational excellence. By applying LSS methodologies, Navy Medicine can create greater alignment across its operations, ultimately delivering sustained value and improving overall performance.”

For Sailors and staff interested in continuing their journey in process improvement, Bloomer offers straightforward advice.

“Utilizing the DMAIC roadmap, medical professionals can incorporate LSS principles by defining requirements for patient needs and expectations, measuring performance to ensure they meet patient requirements, analyzing data to identify areas for improvement and quality issues, improve processes to enhance efficiency and reduce waste, and control processes to maintain improvements and monitor processes,” he said.

“Familiarize yourself with the tools, techniques, and methods involved in Lean Six Sigma to make meaningful improvements in organizational processes. Also, pursue certification — LSS is highly sought after in the civilian community, so whether someone stays in the Navy for a short term or 30 years they can use LSS on the outside.”

As the Sailors of Naval Hospital Twentynine Palms continue their training and begin implementing their own process improvement projects, the impact of this course is expected to ripple throughout Navy Medicine — enhancing not only patient outcomes and operational readiness but also cultivating a culture of continuous improvement.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2504/8960438/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-08 17:57:00.930908

The researchers’ analysis highlighted differences between breast and cervical cancer screening rates.
For breast cancer screening, they found higher screening rates for older, married, more senior women (ages 50-64).
For cervical cancer screening, they found higher screening rates for younger, unmarried, more junior women (ages 21-29).
Similar results were observed when looking at two-year screening rates vs. one-year screening rates.","An interdisciplinary team of researchers including Joel Segel, associate professor of health policy and administration at Penn State, recently analyzed 2007-2019 Military Health System (MHS) data of female patients to examine individual and location factors associated with one- and two-year breast and cervical cancer screening rates. For cervical cancer screening, they examined data from women ages 21-64. For breast cancer screening, they examined data from women ages 40-64. Their findings, published in Military Medicine, showed higher rates for cervical cancer screening where more health care is delivered from civilian care providers.

The researchers’ analysis highlighted differences between breast and cervical cancer screening rates. For breast cancer screening, they found higher screening rates for older, married, more senior women (ages 50-64). For cervical cancer screening, they found higher screening rates for younger, unmarried, more junior women (ages 21-29).

“These findings are consistent with the recommendations made by the US Preventive Services Task Force for breast and cervical cancer screening,” Segel said. “While these results did not come as a surprise, we were happy our results showed the MHS is following those health care standards.”

The researchers also found minimal differences in screening across demographic groups likely due to comprehensive coverage and broad access to care.

While the researchers looked at demographic data, they also estimated differences in screening rates based on the fraction of purchased care vs. direct care from a military provider, and average per capita spending in catchment areas – a 40-mile radius around a military medical facility.

In the military, there are two primary ways to receive health care. Individuals can go to a military medical facility on or near their base or, depending on location, can go to a hospital or facility in a civilian setting and purchase care. The researchers found higher rates for both breast and cervical cancer screening in catchment areas where more health care was delivered via purchased care in a civilian setting.

Women living in an area with a higher rate of purchased care had an increased probability of receiving a mammogram screening within one year. For every additional $1,000 in per capita spending, women had an even higher likelihood of receiving a mammogram screening within one year. Similar results were observed when looking at two-year screening rates vs. one-year screening rates.

According to Segel, these differences are likely due to a larger availability of purchased care and more options for individuals to seek care and treatment, making it easier to get appointments with health care providers.

While many of the findings may be attributed to differences in these cancer screening types, they emphasize the importance of continuing to provide timely breast and cervical cancer screening, which looks to be a success of the options afforded to military personnel through the MHS.

This work is part of a broader study Segel is working on to better understand geographic variations in health care within the MHS.

“We’ve been looking at this data more broadly to determine if differences in screening rates are partially due to placement factors in the military,” Segel said. “The Defense Health Agency is very concerned about variation. When the military relocates individuals, they want to ensure everyone has the same access to the same quality of care. We hope to ultimately have a better understanding of why certain areas are higher or lower in terms of screening rates, as well as broader patterns of variation in treatment and prevention.”

April 8th 2025) – Representatives Nancy Mace and Elise Stefanik reintroduced the Military Moms Act to support maternal healthcare quality and access for mothers serving in the military and dependents of service members. The bill allows pregnancy to be classified as a Qualifying Life Event (QLE) under TRICARE, enabling service members or their spouses to change their TRICARE plans to meet their maternal care needs.

“Our service members and their families make extraordinary sacrifices to protect our nation, and their healthcare needs don’t pause when they choose to start or grow their families,” said Rep. Nancy Mace. “Right now, pregnancy isn’t even considered a qualifying life event under TRICARE—it’s absurd. The Military Moms Act puts military families first by giving expectant service members and spouses the power to choose the healthcare plan best suited to their needs before, during, and after pregnancy. This pro-family, pro-women legislation delivers a common-sense solution to a problem long overdue for fixing.""

“As a mom and the Representative of Fort Drum, I am proud to reintroduce the Military Moms Act to support and expand access to healthcare for our pregnant service members or their spouses as their families grow. Our military families serve our nation selflessly and it is our duty to take care of them, their children, and their families so that they can focus on safeguarding our nation,” said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.

“Our brave service members and their families deserve a healthcare system that truly supports them—especially during life’s most critical moments,” said Congressman Rob Wittman (VA-01). “I’m proud to join my colleagues Reps. Mace and Stefanik in introducing the Military Moms Act to ensure pregnant service members or military spouses aren’t left navigating unnecessary red tape just to access the care they need. By recognizing pregnancy as a Qualifying Life Event under TRICARE, we are giving military families the flexibility and support they deserve. This legislation is a vital step in making sure our military moms can focus on their health and their growing families without added stress or delay.”

This bill is also supported by Americans United for Life.

Specifically, the Military Moms Act directs the Department of Defense to classify pregnancy and loss of pregnancy as qualifying life events under TRICARE, enabling women to change their plan to better meet their maternal care needs; requires the Pentagon to provide Congress with a comprehensive study on access to maternal healthcare within the Military Health System, mirroring provisions from the Improving Access to Maternal Health for Military and Dependent Moms Act; and calls for the publication of a dedicated webpage on the DoD-run Military One Source website with maternal and infant health resources, as well as information for new mothers and families.

Maintaining this strength requires both sufficient funding and a capable workforce. However, the nation's growing debt and fiscal challenges pose a significant risk to future prosperity and place increasing pressure on our ability to sustain a ready force.

Given this reality, ongoing budget scrutiny to find efficiencies is not only appropriate but necessary. As the current administration scrutinizes the budget and seeks to find these efficiencies, MOAA believes any actions taken must be thoughtfully and cautiously implemented to not come at the expense of effectiveness or at the expense of those whose service provides America's freedoms and prosperity.

On April 9, some of MOAA's 350,000 members – representing the shared interests of over 21 million current, former, and retired uniformed service personnel – will be meeting with the nation's legislators to discuss the importance of a strong all-volunteer force and the benefits earned through their service and sacrifices. They will seek support for specific solutions in multiple areas, from spouse unemployment to unaccompanied housing to health care access for retirees and military families (Full details are online at MOAA.org/AiA). But as we prepare for those meetings, there are larger issues so important to our members and our nation that should they be placed at risk, MOAA stands ready to use all available resources to:

• PROTECT the value of service-earned health benefits from new TRICARE fees, disproportionate TRICARE cost-share increases, or barriers to accessing care in the military health system or through the VA.

• PRESERVE the pay earned by those in uniform, to include scheduled pay increases, and established concurrent receipt provisions and eligibility.

• PREVENT burdensome delays in VA claims processing and/or reduction of earned VA benefits.

• DEFEND the veterans and military spouses who continue their service in the federal government — and other federal employees who serve veterans.

MOAA supports work toward an efficient, effective, and capable federal system, to include any reforms resulting in greater support for our all-volunteer force and veterans of all ages and disability levels. But without thoughtful review and implementation, our nation risks breaking promises and faith with the wider military and veteran community – a risk that weakens our national defense for generations.

We are grateful for the collective, bipartisan progress made on behalf of the uniformed services community in recent years to maintain earned benefits and improve the quality of life for those who serve and have served, along with their families and their survivors. We look forward to continuing our work with administration officials, lawmakers, and our MOAA members to ensure our unified voice remains heard.

About MOAA: The Military Officers Association of America (MOAA) is the nation's largest and most influential military service organization and one of the largest veterans service organizations. It is an independent, nonprofit, politically nonpartisan organization. With 350,000 members from every branch of service — including active duty, National Guard, Reserve, retired, and former officers and their families — MOAA is a powerful force speaking for a strong national defense and protecting earned pay and benefits.

Switch to the US Family Health Plan (if it’s available in your area).
TRICARE Select lets you manage your own health care and get care from any TRICARE-authorized provider without a referral (in most situations), as described in the TRICARE Choices in the United States Handbook.
A QLE allows you and your eligible family members to change your TRICARE health plan outside of TRICARE Open Season.
If you’re thinking of switching or enrolling in a new TRICARE health plan, check out the TRICARE Plan Finder tool.","Are you moving to a new home? Is it more than a 30-minute drive from your primary care manager? If so, TRICARE is making it simpler to keep your TRICARE Prime coverage. Now, most families who live more than 30 minutes but less than 100 miles from their PCM can continue seeing them without taking action.

What's new?

In the past, if you moved more than 30 minutes from your PCM, you would’ve had to fill out a drive time waiver to keep your coverage. Without this form, you would’ve risked losing access to your preferred PCM.

The new policy “flips” this process. If you live more than 30 minutes but less than 100 miles from your PCM, you won’t need to take any action to keep your coverage. TRICARE will automatically apply the drive time waiver for you, making it easier to keep your current PCM.

“Our data shows more than half of beneficiaries who waived their drive time access to care standard due to address issues lived less than 100 miles from their military hospital or clinic,” said Shane Pham, management and program analyst, TRICARE Health Plan Policy & Programs Branch, at the Defense Health Agency. “This new approach will help prevent unnecessary coverage gaps and ensure families keep access to their PCMs.”

How will it work?

If your TRICARE regional contractor learns that you’ve moved more than 30 minutes from your PCM, based on information on file, they’ll:

Call you

Send you a text

Mail you a letter

Email you

They’ll contact all adults in your household. You’ll have 90 days from the notification date to decide what to do about your coverage.

What do you need to do?

Your next steps depend on how far you live from your PCM.

If you live more than 30 minutes, but less than 100 miles, away:

You don't need to do anything if you want to keep TRICARE Prime coverage. Your coverage will stay the same, and you’ll keep your same PCM.

You can switch health plans if you want to.

If you live more than 100 miles away, you must choose one of these options within 90 days being notified by your regional contractor:

Confirm your decision to keep your current TRICARE Prime coverage.

Switch to TRICARE Select.

Switch to the US Family Health Plan (if it’s available in your area).

Switching to TRICARE Select or the USFHP (where available) lets you choose your PCM regardless of distance from your home. TRICARE Select lets you manage your own health care and get care from any TRICARE-authorized provider without a referral (in most situations), as described in the TRICARE Choices in the United States Handbook.

If you live more than 100 miles away and don't choose one of these options within 90 days, you'll be disenrolled from TRICARE Prime and lose access to your PCM. You could then only get care at military hospitals and clinics if space is available. You’d need to wait until the next TRICARE Open Season to enroll in a plan.

Remember: Moving is a Qualifying Life Event. A QLE allows you and your eligible family members to change your TRICARE health plan outside of TRICARE Open Season. But if you don’t make a change within 90 days, you’ll need to wait until the next open season to enroll in a plan.

Update your information in DEERS

Are you planning to move soon? When you do, make sure to update your address in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. Check that your email address and phone number are current, too. This will help make sure you don’t miss any important communications from TRICARE, including messages about drive time waivers.

You can update your information:

This include helping navigate the TriWest authorization waiver which has been extended through April 30, 2025, for TRICARE Prime beneficiaries with a referral from their military or civilian primary care manager to seek outpatient care for covered services without referral approval from TriWest.

April 30 is also the date for those who have not updated payment information with TriWest to do so to ensure continued access for important services and avoid disenrollment.

Naval Hospital Bremerton and other military treatment facilities will continue to submit referrals for specialty care, as usual. If a patient is wanting continuing care or requesting a specific private sector provider, the following information is needed:

Name of facility or provider

Address, phone, fax, and National Provider Identifier (NPI) if available.

Note: this information should always be provided when requesting continuity of care referrals or when requesting a specific provider.

What patients should know about their referral status:

• Specialty care will be provided at a military treatment facility such as Naval Hospital Bremerton, including Madigan Army Medical Center, when – and if - that specialty is available

• During this waiver period, NHB’s Referral Management Center will manually fax the referral, a provider letter and waiver letter to one specific private sector provider. The waiver serves as the authorization. No authorization will be accessible through the TriWest patient portal.

• Beneficiaries should access their electronic health record MHS GENESIS patient portal [ https://myaccess.dmdc.osd.mil/identitymanagement/app/login ] to determine where their referral has been sent.

• All eligible beneficiaries – active duty, retirees and dependents - can also call the Pacific Integrated Referral Management Center [PIRMAC] at 800-404-4506 for assistance to help navigate where their referral has been sent.

• If a beneficiary desires a different private sector provider, they can take the referral and waiver letter to the provider to schedule an appointment. If the beneficiary experiences any barriers or issues, they can contact NHB Health Benefits Advisor, 360-475-4768.

Other important information to provide to all beneficiaries:

• All beneficiaries should consider also setting up a portal with TriWest by accessing www.tricare-west.com. This will enable them to see their referrals and authorizations and will eventually allow them to change a provider without calling TriWest or NHB RMC.

• Beneficiaries can also contact TriWest, 1-888-874-9378.

Zynex, headquartered in Englewood, CO, is a medical device company that makes electrotherapy devices for pain management and rehabilitation.

According to the lawsuit, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of demand; (2) as a result, Zynex was able to inflate its revenue; (3) the Company's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; and (4) thus, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report titled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills,"" which claimed that Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of supplies, such as electrode pads and batteries, in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024.

A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. The lead plaintiff is usually the investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Communicating with any counsel is not necessary to participate or share in any recovery achieved in this case. Any member of the purported class may move the Court to serve as a lead plaintiff through counsel of his/her choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an inactive class member.

Currently, Island Health collects approximate $3.4M in funding from the district’s taxpayers, which is less than 3% of the hospital district’s total revenue.

The proposed new levy could bring in an additional $4 million dollars a year.

The levy would add 41 cents per $1,000 assessed valuation to the current levy of 34 cents for a total of 75 cents per $1,000 valuation. A separate bond levy of 27 cents per $1,000 for construction of the hospital in 2004 will die in 2028.

Island Health says the levy would provide funding for the equipment and facility improvements needed to increase access to critical healthcare services in our rural community, such as 24/7 emergency and intensive care, as well as expand access to specialized care such as cardiology, mental health, obstetrics, orthopedics, pulmonology, senior care and urology.",https://www.anacortesnow.com/images/stories/2025/2024-0407-island-health-1.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-07 20:56:16.802813

Zynex’s Disappointing Fourth Quarter Results

ZYXI share price depression stems from its disastrous 4Q 2024 earnings release. The Englewood, Colorado-based firm reported fourth-quarter 2024 revenue of $46.0 million, a roughly 2% year-over-year decline, falling short of Wall Street's expectations. The company also swung to a net loss of $0.02 per share, a stark contrast to the $0.04 net income per share reported in the same period last year.

The disappointing results reportedly prompted RBC Capital Markets to downgrade Zynex to Sector Perform from Outperform. According to news outlets, in a report to its clients, RBC analyst Shagun Singh cited a ""lack of visibility"" into the company's operations and commercial outlook, particularly concerning its relationship with Tricare, the military health program that represents a significant portion of Zynex's revenue.

Singh reportedly noted that Tricare, Zynex's largest customer, has temporarily suspended payments amid an ongoing review of prior claims. Singh added that the company's decision to withhold 2025 guidance and implement a 15% workforce reduction further compounded investor concerns. Singh revised RBC’s price target for Zynex shares to $5.50, down from $11.00, warning of a potential ""domino effect"" stemming from Tricare's payment suspension.

Zynex Securities Class Action

Adding to Zynex’s woes, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the District Court of Colorado, alleging that the company made false and misleading statements regarding its revenue recognition practices and its relationship with Tricare. The suit, captioned Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., et al., seeks to represent investors who purchased Zynex securities between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

The complaint alleges that Zynex engaged in “oversupplying” customers with products, including electrodes, leading to inflated revenue figures. It further claims that this practice drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare, and that Zynex failed to disclose the potential for adverse consequences, such as removal from insurer networks and government penalties.

According to the complaint, revelations of Zynex's alleged practices surfaced with a June 4, 2024 report by medical journal STAAT detailing an ""oversupplying scheme"" involving excessive shipments of supplies and subsequent inflated billing. The report also indicated that insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

The truth allegedly emerged on March 11, 2025, when Zynex reported its dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The complaint highlights Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard’s attributing the fourth-quarter revenue shortfall to ""slower than normal payments from certain payers"" and the Tricare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman’s Investigation

Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. “We are examining Zynex's financial reporting and business practices. We believe investors deserve a complete and transparent understanding of these events,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

DHA is the federal agency that oversees medical services for the military, currently headquartered in Falls Church, Virginia.
South Beach Project would consolidate some assets and thousands of workers currently scattered in facilities throughout the greater San Antonio area, a DHA spokesman said in 2023, and also allow the agency to manage selected skill sets and functions in one central location.
“Once completed, the DHA / South Beach renovation project will house over 1,000 DHA employees who will be dedicated to the mission of improving health and business readiness here at [Joint Base San Antonio] and the nation’s Joint Military Force.” Original plans date back to 2005, the document says, and a cost update for renovating a four-story building known as South Beach Pavilion is needed.
Also known as Fort Sam Houston Building 2371, the buildings were built in 1931 and converted into a hospital during World War II.","A years-long plan to bring Defense Health Agency (DHA) missions to San Antonio’s Fort Sam Houston, known as “South Beach Project,” is slowly coming into focus.

DHA is the federal agency that oversees medical services for the military, currently headquartered in Falls Church, Virginia.

Established in 2013, the agency manages all military hospitals and clinics and the TRICARE network, employs tens of thousands of civilians and military service members worldwide.

South Beach Project would consolidate some assets and thousands of workers currently scattered in facilities throughout the greater San Antonio area, a DHA spokesman said in 2023, and also allow the agency to manage selected skill sets and functions in one central location.

But San Antonio and Bexar County have long been engaged in an effort to turn the region into a military medical mecca — one that could potentially involve state economic development grants as well.

“We are Military City USA but we are also quickly becoming, if not already, Military Medicine City USA,” Commissioner Grant Moody (Pct. 3) said at a Commissioners Court meeting in December 2023. “With additional DHA employees coming to San Antonio, we’re going to continue to expand and bring additional resources and additional missions here to San Antonio, and I think there’s a lot of synergies that come with that.”

In perhaps the clearest signal yet of their plans, an agenda document from Tuesday’s Bexar County Commissioners Court meeting says the county is engaging an architect to put together plans for a building renovation for DHA at Fort Sam Houston.

“Once completed, the DHA / South Beach renovation project will house over 1,000 DHA employees who will be dedicated to the mission of improving health and business readiness here at [Joint Base San Antonio] and the nation’s Joint Military Force.”

Original plans date back to 2005, the document says, and a cost update for renovating a four-story building known as South Beach Pavilion is needed. The original $30 million plan was based on $10 million contributions from both the city and county, as well as $10,000 in state grants that haven’t yet been applied for.

Also known as Fort Sam Houston Building 2371, the buildings were built in 1931 and converted into a hospital during World War II.

“This project, with funding from three different entities, is intended to be both an economic impact project, as well as help the overall mission of JBSA.”

Zynex’s Disappointing Fourth Quarter Results

ZYXI share price depression stems from its disastrous 4Q 2024 earnings release. The Englewood, Colorado-based firm reported fourth-quarter 2024 revenue of $46.0 million, a roughly 2% year-over-year decline, falling short of Wall Street's expectations. The company also swung to a net loss of $0.02 per share, a stark contrast to the $0.04 net income per share reported in the same period last year.

The disappointing results reportedly prompted RBC Capital Markets to downgrade Zynex to Sector Perform from Outperform. According to news outlets, in a report to its clients, RBC analyst Shagun Singh cited a ""lack of visibility"" into the company's operations and commercial outlook, particularly concerning its relationship with Tricare, the military health program that represents a significant portion of Zynex's revenue.

Singh reportedly noted that Tricare, Zynex's largest customer, has temporarily suspended payments amid an ongoing review of prior claims. Singh added that the company's decision to withhold 2025 guidance and implement a 15% workforce reduction further compounded investor concerns. Singh revised RBC’s price target for Zynex shares to $5.50, down from $11.00, warning of a potential ""domino effect"" stemming from Tricare's payment suspension.

Zynex Securities Class Action

Adding to Zynex’s woes, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the District Court of Colorado, alleging that the company made false and misleading statements regarding its revenue recognition practices and its relationship with Tricare. The suit, captioned Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., et al., seeks to represent investors who purchased Zynex securities between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

The complaint alleges that Zynex engaged in “oversupplying” customers with products, including electrodes, leading to inflated revenue figures. It further claims that this practice drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare, and that Zynex failed to disclose the potential for adverse consequences, such as removal from insurer networks and government penalties.

According to the complaint, revelations of Zynex's alleged practices surfaced with a June 4, 2024 report by medical journal STAAT detailing an ""oversupplying scheme"" involving excessive shipments of supplies and subsequent inflated billing. The report also indicated that insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

The truth allegedly emerged on March 11, 2025, when Zynex reported its dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The complaint highlights Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard’s attributing the fourth-quarter revenue shortfall to ""slower than normal payments from certain payers"" and the Tricare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman’s Investigation

Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. “We are examining Zynex's financial reporting and business practices. We believe investors deserve a complete and transparent understanding of these events,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

You read that right: 87,000 hours.

That’s equivalent to 3,625 days, almost a full man-hour decade.

Burned up by staffers tending to their own interests, to the detriment of the troops they’re nominally charged with helping and the taxpayers they’re answerable to: They spent those hours doing things like contract renegotiation and fringe-benefit squeeze-outs.

This info comes in a bombshell new report unearthed by Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), a veteran and a fierce advocate for the troops as well as a staunch fighter against fraud and waste as head of the Senate DOGE caucus.

Good: The more sunlight into government spending, the better.

Otherwise, there’s no way to ever know which handouts serve to advance America’s national interest and which line the pockets of powerful fiefdoms and their lords.

But it points to a bigger problem, i.e., that public-sector unions are bad news for everyone.

In the private sector, unionized workers use their collective power to win concessions from business owners. If that gums up the works too much, the company suffers and its customers and investors go elsewhere.

Government doesn’t work that way: The dissatisfied can’t escape so easily, and it’s politicians and other officials with no personal skin in the game who make the concessions.

And unionized government workers put the squeeze directly on you.

Every benefit, every pay hike, every extra comes out of the taxpayer’s pocket.

And by shielding the incompetent and criminal, stifling innovation and generally gumming up the works, public-sector unions screw over the people most dependent on government services.

That is, the poor, the disabled and the otherwise marginalized.

Even, in this case, the armed forces.

So the next time National Education Association head Becky Pringle starts in on one of her semi-comprehensible tirades about justice and equity, or any other municipal, state or federal public-union muckamuck throws a weepy, righteous temper tantrum — remember.

The only thing they want is to shove their hand deeper into your pocket.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/general-view-pentagon-reported-billionaire-100854954.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,N,-1.0,2025-04-07 13:56:22.116681
