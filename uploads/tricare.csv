As awareness grows around conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, substance use disorders, and traumatic brain injury, a common and important question continues to surface: Do the US Armed Forces cover mental health treatment programs?

The short answer is yes. The US military provides coverage for a wide range of mental and behavioral health services through TRICARE, the health care program serving uniformed service members, retirees, and eligible dependents. Coverage includes outpatient therapy, inpatient treatment, substance use disorder care, and increasingly, technology-enabled behavioral health services. However, understanding how coverage works, which programs qualify, and how to access the right level of care can be complex. This is where program placement support and medical technology-driven navigation tools play an important role.

In this article, Medigy explores how military mental health coverage works, what types of treatment programs are available, how behavioral health programs for military members are evolving through medical technology, and how TriCareRehabs offers program placement support to help individuals and families make informed decisions.

Understanding TRICARE and Mental Health Coverage

TRICARE functions as a comprehensive health care system designed to meet the unique demands of military life. Mental and behavioral health services are considered a core benefit, not an optional add-on. This reflects a growing institutional recognition that psychological health is directly tied to operational effectiveness and long-term quality of life.

Coverage applies across several TRICARE plans, including TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, TRICARE Reserve Select, and TRICARE for Life. While plan details vary, all include benefits for mental health assessment, diagnosis, and treatment when care is deemed medically necessary.

Importantly, TRICARE does not restrict coverage only to combat-related conditions. Service members and beneficiaries can receive care for mood disorders, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, sleep disturbances, family and relationship stress, and other behavioral health concerns that affect daily functioning.

What Types of Mental Health Treatment Programs Are Covered?

TRICARE coverage extends across a continuum of care, allowing treatment to be matched to clinical need rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all approach. Outpatient therapy is often the first point of care and includes individual counseling, family therapy, and group therapy delivered by licensed professionals. Psychiatric services for medication management are also included.

For individuals requiring a higher level of support, intensive outpatient programs and partial hospitalization programs may be covered when clinically appropriate. These programs provide structured therapy while allowing individuals to maintain some aspects of daily life, an option that can be particularly important for active duty members balancing service obligations.

Inpatient mental health and residential treatment programs are covered when symptoms are severe, pose a safety risk, or have not responded to lower levels of care. Substance use disorder treatment, including medical detoxification and rehabilitation, is also included under TRICARE’s behavioral health benefits.

Coverage decisions are guided by clinical criteria rather than diagnosis alone. This emphasis on medical necessity aligns with evidence-based care standards and helps ensure that treatment intensity matches individual need.

Behavioral Health Programs for Military Members and Unique Care Considerations

Behavioral health programs for military members differ in meaningful ways from civilian programs. Military culture, exposure to trauma, frequent relocations, and the demands of service create distinct clinical and logistical challenges. Effective programs integrate an understanding of military identity, command structures, and confidentiality concerns into treatment planning.

Many military-focused programs incorporate trauma-informed care models designed to address combat stress, moral injury, and cumulative operational strain. Family systems are often included in treatment, recognizing the impact of military life on spouses and children.

Technology has become a critical tool in bridging access gaps for behavioral health programs for military members. Telebehavioral health platforms now allow service members in remote locations or on tight schedules to connect with licensed clinicians securely. These platforms often integrate symptom tracking, digital assessments, and care coordination features that enhance continuity of care.

Medical technology also supports outcomes measurement, enabling providers and payers to evaluate treatment effectiveness over time. This data-driven approach aligns with TRICARE’s focus on value-based care and continuous quality improvement.

How Authorization and Referrals Work Under TRICARE

While mental health coverage is broad, accessing care often requires navigating authorization and referral processes. Active duty service members typically need a referral from a primary care manager for specialty mental health services, except in emergencies. This process ensures coordination with command requirements and readiness considerations.

Family members and retirees generally have more flexibility to self-refer, depending on their TRICARE plan. However, certain higher levels of care, such as inpatient treatment, usually require prior authorization to confirm medical necessity and network eligibility.

This administrative layer can feel overwhelming, particularly during times of crisis. Understanding plan-specific requirements, documentation standards, and network rules is essential to avoiding delays in care. Program placement support services can help interpret these requirements and align treatment options with TRICARE coverage parameters.

The Role of Medical Technology in Accessing Care

Medical technology has reshaped how military-affiliated individuals access mental health treatment. Secure telehealth platforms have expanded reach to underserved areas, reduced wait times, and minimized stigma by allowing private, at-home sessions. For active-duty members, this flexibility can be crucial when in-person appointments conflict with training or deployment schedules.

Digital intake tools and electronic health records streamline information sharing between providers, improving care coordination and reducing redundant assessments. Some programs now use artificial intelligence-driven screening tools to identify risk patterns, support early intervention, and personalize treatment recommendations.

Wearable devices and mobile health applications are increasingly used to monitor sleep, stress, and physiological indicators associated with mental health conditions. While these tools do not replace clinical care, they provide valuable data that can inform treatment planning and relapse prevention strategies.

From a systems perspective, medical technology supports TRICARE’s goal of delivering consistent, high-quality behavioral health care across diverse geographic regions and care settings.

Why Program Placement Support Matters

Despite comprehensive coverage, finding the right mental health or substance use treatment program can be challenging. Not all facilities accept TRICARE, and not all programs are equally equipped to address military-specific needs. Matching clinical requirements, personal preferences, location constraints, and insurance eligibility requires specialized knowledge.

This is where TriCareRehabs offers program placement support as a navigation resource rather than a treatment provider. Placement support focuses on understanding an individual’s clinical needs, verifying TRICARE acceptance, and identifying appropriate levels of care within qualified programs.

For families unfamiliar with the behavioral health system, this guidance can reduce confusion and emotional burden during a vulnerable time. Program placement support also helps ensure that referrals align with evidence-based practices and continuity of care principles, increasing the likelihood of positive outcomes.

Common Questions About Military Mental Health Coverage

Many service members and families wonder whether seeking mental health treatment will negatively impact a military career. While certain conditions and treatments may require temporary duty limitations, the Department of Defense has made significant efforts to reduce stigma and encourage early care. Seeking help is increasingly recognized as a strength and a proactive step toward readiness.

Another frequent question involves confidentiality. Mental health care under TRICARE follows strict privacy standards, though specific disclosures may be required in limited circumstances related to safety or fitness for duty. Providers experienced in working with military populations can explain these boundaries clearly.

There is also concern about continuity of care during relocations. Medical technology, telehealth, and standardized electronic records have improved the ability to maintain treatment relationships or transition smoothly between providers when permanent change of station orders occur.

The Future of Behavioral Health Care for the Military

The landscape of military mental health care continues to evolve. Policy changes, research advancements, and technology innovations are driving more integrated, personalized, and accessible care models. Behavioral health programs for military members are increasingly blending in-person treatment with digital tools to support long-term recovery and resilience.

TRICARE’s ongoing investment in telebehavioral health, outcomes measurement, and provider network expansion reflects a broader shift toward proactive mental health management. Program placement support services are likely to become even more important as treatment options diversify and care pathways grow more complex.

In this environment, clarity and guidance matter. Understanding what is covered, how to access care, and which programs are best suited to individual needs empowers service members and families to seek help without unnecessary barriers.

A Clear Answer with Practical Context

So, do the US Armed Forces cover mental health treatment programs? Yes, they do, through a comprehensive TRICARE benefit that spans outpatient care, intensive treatment, inpatient services, and technology-enabled behavioral health solutions. Coverage is designed to meet clinical needs while supporting readiness and long-term well-being.

At the same time, navigating this system requires informed decision-making. Medical technology plays a growing role in expanding access and improving care coordination, while placement support services help translate coverage into real-world treatment options. When TriCareRehabs offers program placement support, it reflects a broader effort to ensure that coverage leads to timely, appropriate, and effective care.",https://medigy.com/news/contributed-content/b7041c94-6584-55c5-9e20-8f29cd0481f5-featuredImage.jpeg,N,0.0,2025-12-16 12:57:01.436838

The move of the Defense Health Agency from Falls Church, Virginia, could bring as many 3,300 jobs to San Antonio, according to the daily. However, it’s still unclear which parts of the mission may relocate and how many people ultimately might relocate.

The Express-News based its reporting on a letter from members of the city’s congressional delegation to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth along with “recent moves at City Hall.”

The city’s attempts to woo the Defense Health Agency comes as Hegseth has begun pulling two military commands out of San Antonio, including some 1,100 staffers, the Express-News reports.

The Sanford Heisler Sharp McKnight law firm says it filed these new complaints against the Department of Defense, U.S. Army, and Defense Health Agency on behalf of seven Jane Does.

Christine Dunn talks on McGraw complaints filed

The complaint says these women are victims of McGraw who were sexually abused or non-consensually videotaped by McGraw during appointments at the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center (CRDAMC) in Fort Hood and the Tripler Medical Center in Hawaii.

Six of the Jane Does in the complaint were treated at the CRDAMC and one was treated during McGraw's time at Tripler Medical Center in Hawaii.

In the release, the administrative complaints filed on Monday allege that the Army is liable for McGraw's actions under the FTCA because, ""it was negligent in hiring, supervising, and retianing McGraw. They also allege that the Army lacked adequate protocols to keep patients safe from sexual abuse.""

The complaints allege McGraw sexually violated the women by video recording them without consent and performing unnecessary medical exams that involved groping their genitals or breasts.

The alleged abuse occurred while the women were in vulnerable states, including while pregnant, after giving birth or in the ICU.

The complaints also claim McGraw frequently ignored standard medical guidelines, such as conducting exams without a medical chaperone present and refusing to allow patients to undress for exams in privacy.

""My clients went to this doctor expecting to be well cared for. They thought they could trust a U.S. Army doctor, but we now understand that the doctor abused that trust in the most egregious way,"" said Christine Dunn, the law firm's DC Co-Managing Partner.

The FTCA allows individuals to bring legal claims against federal agencies for wrongdoing by their employees. Before filing a lawsuit in court, individuals must first file administrative complaints with the agency, which then has at least six months to investigate.

The complaints allege the Army is liable for McGraw's actions because it was negligent in hiring, supervising and retaining him. They also claim the Army lacked adequate protocols to protect patients from sexual abuse.

""The Army had a duty to take reasonable measures to protect patients in its care. To the extent that Dr. McGraw was able to abuse so many patients, it is compelling evidence that the Army was negligent in supervising him,"" Dunn said.

Attorneys at Sanford Heisler Sharp McKnight would like to have the opportunity to help you.","FORT HOOD, Texas, Dec. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Attorneys at Sanford Heisler Sharp McKnight (""Sanford Heisler”) today filed Federal Tort Claims Act (""FTCA”) administrative complaints against the United States Department of the Army, the Defense Health Agency, and the Department of Defense (collectively ""the Army”) on behalf of seven Jane Does (Jane Does 1-7), all of whom were sexually abused or non-consensually videotaped by Army doctor Blaine McGraw during medical appointments at the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center (""Darnall Medical Center”) in Fort Hood, Texas and Tripler Army Medical Center in Honolulu, Hawaii (""Tripler Medical Center”). McGraw is currently facing numerous criminal charges for secretly recording dozens of female patients.

All Jane Does are represented in the matter by Christine Dunn, Sanford Heisler’s DC Co-Managing Partner and Co-Chair of the firm’s Sexual Violence, Title IX, and Victims’ Rights Practice Group, as well as Jillian Seymour, Associate, and Alison Hagani, Litigation Fellow.

The FTCA is a federal statute that permits individuals to bring legal claims against federal agencies for torts committed by their employees. Prior to filing an FTCA complaint in court, the individual must first file an administrative complaint with the agency at fault. The agency is then afforded at least six months to investigate the claim. After that, the individual may file a lawsuit against the agency in federal court.

Today, Sanford Heisler took the first step in the FTCA legal process by filing administrative complaints against the Army on behalf of Jane Does 1-7. All seven women are former patients of McGraw, who treated Jane Does 1-6 at Darnall Medical Center and Jane Doe 7 at Tripler Medical Center. The complaints allege that McGraw, an Army OBGYN, sexually violated Jane Does 1-7 by video recording them without their consent and/or performing unnecessary medical exams that involved McGraw groping their genitals or breasts. The complaints further allege that McGraw committed this sexual misconduct while the Jane Does were in especially vulnerable states, including while they were pregnant, had just given birth, or were in the ICU. The complaints also assert that McGraw frequently flouted standard medical guidelines, such as conducting exams without a medical chaperone present and refusing to allow the Jane Does to undress for exams in privacy. Although McGraw committed this sexual misconduct under the guise of medical necessity, the complaints allege that there was no medical need for him to have engaged in this behavior.

The administrative complaints filed today allege that the Army is liable for McGraw’s actions under the FTCA because it was negligent in hiring, supervising, and retaining McGraw. They also allege that the Army lacked adequate protocols to keep patients safe from sexual abuse.

On December 9, Army military prosecutors announced numerous criminal charges against McGraw, including 54 counts of indecent visual recording and five counts of conduct unbecoming an officer. The Army has previously stated in an official statement that Army leaders suspended McGraw and opened an investigation of him ""within hours” after a patient complaint was reported in October 2025. However, news reports have reported allegations that at least one patient had complained about McGraw at Tripler Medical Center, where he was stationed prior to his Fort Hood assignment until 2023. This week, in response to growing concerns that the Army was aware of McGraw’s misconduct prior to October 2025, over 50 United States congressmembers have sent a letter to the Pentagon’s Office of Inspector General to investigate reports that Army leaders refused to investigate complaints against McGraw, including during his employment at Tripler Medical Center.

""My clients went to this doctor expecting to be well cared for. They thought they could trust a U.S. Army doctor, but we now understand that the doctor abused that trust in the most egregious way,” said Dunn. ""The Army had a duty to take reasonable measures to protect patients in its care. To the extent that Dr. McGraw was able to abuse so many patients, it is compelling evidence that the Army was negligent in supervising him. Our servicemembers and their families deserve better and the Army must be held accountable.”

Sanford Heisler has extensive experience representing victims of sexual misconduct against the military. Attorney Christine Dunn currently represents 45 victims of Major Michael Stockin, a former Army doctor who was recently convicted of sexually abusing dozens of patients during medical exams at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Tacoma, Washington. The firm has filed FTCA complaints on behalf of these victims in an attempt to hold the Army accountable for negligently supervising Dr. Stockin. Attorney Dunn also represents more than two dozen former cadets in their FTCA claims against the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. The firm’s work on behalf of these former cadets is the first known collective action against a United States service academy involving claims of sexual abuse.

Auditors highlighted several shortcomings, including wait times for medical appointments that exceed the federal and Defense Department guidelines, the IG said.
Medical personnel told the team that clinics were not always fully staffed, particularly with nurses, who receive and prioritize messages that patients send to providers.
Moreover, the agency did not have a process to identify why some civilian medical personnel left for other employment, auditors said.
Though DHA agreed with the recommendations, auditors said they were still awaiting specific actions on how the agency plans to make a comprehensive review of staffing at overseas military treatment facilities.","The average wait for urgent medical appointments at U.S. military bases outside the continental United States was as long as three weeks in some locations and even longer for routine appointments in 2024, a Pentagon watchdog agency said in a new report.

Treatment delays that service members and their families face while stationed outside the United States increased the risk for negative outcomes and preventable complications and decreased patient satisfaction, according to a Defense Department Office of Inspector General audit published last week.

The report also found that personnel working in military medical clinics and hospitals overseas experienced burnout and low morale and were at risk of decreased readiness.

The agency reviewed 15 out of 79 military treatment facilities in overseas locations as well as Hawaii and Alaska, looking at 2024 data and conducting employee interviews.

The evaluation sought to assess how effectively the Defense Health Agency was managing care for its overseas patients, following the agency’s transition in 2022 to assuming full control of the Pentagon’s health care system.

Auditors highlighted several shortcomings, including wait times for medical appointments that exceed the federal and Defense Department guidelines, the IG said.

Between February and July 2024, service members and their families faced delays in access to care ranging on average from 1.2 days to 21.1 days for urgent appointments and from 7.2 days to 36.8 days for future routine appointments, the report said.

Federal and DOD guidance requires the military health care system to see patients within 24 hours for urgent appointments and seven days for routine care, according to the inspector general report.

While the guidelines allow for patients to be referred to a Tricare-approved civilian provider within the allotted time frame, finding care outside the military network overseas can be challenging due to language barriers, cultural differences and denial of U.S. health insurance claims, the report said.

DHA’s management of staffing at overseas locations is one area that needs to be improved to reduce appointment delays, the audit team determined.

Medical personnel told the team that clinics were not always fully staffed, particularly with nurses, who receive and prioritize messages that patients send to providers.

They also said that they had difficulty managing the volume of messages received from the online patient portal and that sometimes messages could be missed, putting patient safety at risk.

At one clinic, for example, providers did not see a prescription refill message and the patient did not follow up with another request. As a result, the patient did not take prescribed antidepressant medication for two to three weeks, according to the report.

At another military treatment facility, personnel said shortages in medical technicians led to canceled ultrasound appointments, delaying follow-on medical care and leading to an increased risk of preventable complications, according to the report.

Staffing data also showed shortages in personnel, according to the report. In September 2024, for example, one facility had only 27 of the 36 civilian personnel and 27 of the 37 contractors that it was authorized.

Another facility lost more than half its primary care clinic active-duty doctors between 2019 and 2024 and saw a 20% decrease in active-duty technicians, medics and licensed nurses, while patient workload remained steady, according to the report.

Hiring civilian staff, meanwhile, isn’t always an option due to funding and lengthy hiring timelines, personnel told auditors.

In 2024, DHA left some civilian vacancies unfilled because of budgetary constraints, and the average total days to hire in some locations ranged from 155 to 213 days, the report said.

Moreover, the agency did not have a process to identify why some civilian medical personnel left for other employment, auditors said.

To address staffing issues, the inspector general team recommended that the DHA director track data on why personnel are leaving military treatment facilities, review authorized staffing at its overseas locations, track support staff availability and better balance its workforce.

All counties are affected.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

The Defense Health Agency provides health services to 9.5 million beneficiaries, including uniformed service members, military retirees, and their families. The DHA operates one of the nation’s largest health plans, the TRICARE Health Plan, and manages a global network of more than 700 military hospitals, clinics, and dental facilities.

Q3 2025 Results Reveal Profound Erosion The company's third-quarter 2025 financial report laid bare the depth of its difficulties.","The medical technology firm Zynex is confronting a severe financial crisis, with its shares plummeting to a mere $0.74. This represents a staggering decline of more than 90% over the past twelve months, signaling challenges that extend beyond operations to threaten the company's very survival.

In response to the escalating situation, Zynex has engaged the services of investment bank Province, LLC to evaluate strategic alternatives. A special committee of independent directors, chaired by restructuring specialist Paul Aronzon, is now tasked with assessing options for raising capital and executing a comprehensive corporate turnaround.

The most pressing immediate concern is a persistent payment suspension from Tricare, Zynex's primary health insurance client. Despite an appeal filed in April 2025, the suspension remains in effect, continuing to severely pressure revenue streams with no clear resolution in sight.

Compounding these issues, the company has entered a critical phase regarding its debt obligations. Zynex missed a $1.5 million interest payment on convertible notes, triggering a 30-day grace period. Management is currently in negotiations with noteholders to restructure these obligations.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Zynex?

Q3 2025 Results Reveal Profound Erosion

The company's third-quarter 2025 financial report laid bare the depth of its difficulties. Net revenue collapsed by 73% year-over-year to just $13.4 million. This drastic drop contributed to a substantial net loss of $42.9 million for the quarter. Furthermore, Zynex recorded a significant $30.7 million impairment charge related to goodwill and fixed assets. As of the end of September, the company's cash and equivalents stood at $13.3 million.

Analyst Sentiment Remains Cautious

Market experts maintain a guarded stance on the equity. The consensus rating among analysts currently sits at ""Hold."" The average price target from four covering firms is $4.90, with estimates ranging from $3.00 to $8.00 per share. These projections, however, appear at odds with full-year 2025 forecasts, which anticipate a net loss of approximately $40.6 million.

KEY QUOTES: “People who are struggling with mental health can’t wait years to see if something might help through trial and error.
We believe this work can meaningfully expand access to effective mental health care.” Reva Nohria, Partner at General Catalyst “In research, we’ve proven that these powerful treatments work.
We’re taking what we know from years of clinical research and turning it into care that any patient can access.
Radial is focused on the care patients have long deserved.”","Radial has launched with $50 million in venture funding to expand access to advanced mental health treatments, including neuromodulation such as accelerated transcranial magnetic stimulation and rapid-acting medications such as Spravato. General Catalyst led the Series A round, with additional backing from Solari Capital, JSL Health Capital, Founder Collective, BoxGroup, Scrub Capital, and Diede van Lamoen.

The company is positioning itself around a shift in psychiatry toward interventional, brain-based care that can deliver results in days to weeks rather than prolonged trial and error. Radial cited evidence that newer approaches can produce significantly improved outcomes for patients with mental health conditions, including published findings showing remission rates as high as 78% in some studies, while emphasizing that the broader healthcare delivery model has not been built to support episodic interventional care at scale.

Radial’s strategy is to build the clinical and operational infrastructure that enables these treatments to be delivered consistently, measured rigorously, and reimbursed reliably. The company said it is developing reimbursement tools and decision support designed around modern brain medicine, aiming to help clinicians focus on care delivery while giving payers more precise outcomes data to support coverage decisions. Radial also plans to address what it described as gaps in clinical decision support and operational tooling that can slow adoption of advanced treatments across everyday practice.

A core component of the rollout is a national clinic network that accepts most major insurance plans. Radial said its clinics are set up to accept Medicare, Tricare, VA CCN, Aetna, Cigna, United, and many Blue plans, to make high-impact treatment combinations available beyond cash-pay models and limited specialty access. The company framed this approach as a benefit to patients seeking faster symptom relief, providers seeking more practical workflows, and payers seeking better outcomes and lower long-term costs for complex cases.

Radial currently operates seven clinics across six states, supported by a proprietary software platform. The company said the new funding will support national expansion in 2026, including growth of both its clinic footprint and technology partnerships as it scales its model for interventional mental health care.

KEY QUOTES:

“People who are struggling with mental health can’t wait years to see if something might help through trial and error. New rapid-acting treatments work in days or weeks instead of years. We’re seeing remission rates for depression of 50-60% and as high as 78% in some studies our team has co-authored. The healthcare system hasn’t caught up. Radial is here to change that. When we have tools for the right clinical workflows and insurance pathways, people can access therapies that help them get better far sooner. It’s a dramatic difference for individuals, for families, and for the health system that ends up carrying the cost when care drags on without results.”

John Capecelatro, CEO and Co-Founder of Radial

“Psychiatry is undergoing a transformation, but most of that progress hasn’t reached patients. The science is there, yet the infrastructure to deliver modern, brain-based treatments at scale is still missing. Radial understands both the clinical evidence and the operational complexity required to close that gap. We believe this work can meaningfully expand access to effective mental health care.”

Reva Nohria, Partner at General Catalyst

“In research, we’ve proven that these powerful treatments work. They change lives. The hard part has always been bringing them into everyday clinical practice. Radial was built to close that gap. We’re taking what we know from years of clinical research and turning it into care that any patient can access. Radial is focused on the care patients have long deserved.”",https://cdn.pulse2.com/cdn/2025/12/Radial-Logo.jpeg,N,0.0,2025-12-14 14:56:33.586000

We had our first in June this year and the hospital was in network, obviously my OBGYN was too. We only had to pay a total of $275 for a $55,000 delivery.

We have prime and didn't pay to deliver on base. Do you have the option to deliver on base or are you in an area with no medical center or have a high risk baby?

We can't afford Select with our medical kids. Consider all your options.

As long as your doctor takes your tricare you’re good. I delivered vaginally, stayed two days, had an epidural, and my bill was $45. ETA: my OBs had me fill out all of my paperwork in advance for the hospital, so I just went in and had the babies. You’ll likely know ahead of time if there are any issues.

I had my daughter when we were at Elgin. I switched to select to have her at the birth center, which I don't think is open anymore..?? I had to pay the $250 and they charged another $1,000 fee because Tricare doesn't pay them enough. But it was worth it to avoid the base hospital.

I delivered in Austin while stationed at fort hood with select in 2023. I paid $65 for my failed induction turned c section that racked up a $70,000 bill. We didn't pay anything for the baby's pediatric bill from the hospital. Just make sure that your hospital is an in-network provider, if it's out of network your copay (after met deductible) might be slightly higher.",,N,-1.0,2025-12-14 10:56:42.077495

Yes. I use the VA for everything. I get great quality of care in my continuity of cares several decades now.
