,,2025-09-25 13:36:42+00:00,Military Health System,Researchers push forward in breakthrough brain health study,"Derik Crotts, MHS Communications",,,,,https://health.mil/News/Dvids-Articles/2025/09/25/news549171,"The goal: identify early warning signs to help protect brain health for years to come.
“This work builds on years of progress,” said Ms. Kathy Lee, director of Warfighter Brain Health Policy, Office of the Secretary of War for Health Affairs.
“This research could reshape how doctors, coaches, and commanders think about brain health,” added Lee.
Instead, it’s about spotting the earliest, most subtle signs of brain change — well before disease takes hold – and promoting resilience and long-range brain health.
“This is one of the most powerful opportunities we’ve ever had to understand brain health across the lifespan,” concluded Lee.","After more than a decade of impactful work, and with the most robust and well-characterized concussion cohort ever collected, researchers in the NCAA-Department of Defense (now Department of War) Concussion Assessment, Research and Education, known as CARE, Service Academy Longitudinal mTBI Outcomes Study Integrated (CSI) Study are entering an exciting new phase — studying long-term brain health in service members and athletes. The goal: identify early warning signs to help protect brain health for years to come.

The study is testing biomarkers, or measurable signals in blood and/or imaging, that may reveal how the brain responds to concussions, repeated head impacts, and other health risk factors. These include advanced scans like MRI and PET (positron emission tomography), as well as blood-based markers that show inflammation or damage long before symptoms appear.

“This is about detecting the earliest signals — clues that may predict who is at greater risk for long-term problems, and who is more resilient,” explained Dr. Michael McCrea, co-principal investigator of the CSI Study and professor of neurosurgery at the Medical College of Wisconsin. “If we can detect changes early, we can take action early.”

The overarching goal is to combine brain scans, blood tests, genetics, and cognitive assessments into a single risk scale. A current prototype that this risk scale could be modeled from — called the Alzheimer’s Disease Relative-Risk and Resilience Scale — could identify individuals at higher risk of brain-related condition like Alzheimer’s disease, even decades before they show signs of memory loss.

To build this model, the team is analyzing imaging studies and blood samples from 500 military service members and former collegiate student athletes. Their analysis will look at more than 100 markers of various pathological processes associated with brain function and disease. Early results are expected in October 2025.

“This work builds on years of progress,” said Ms. Kathy Lee, director of Warfighter Brain Health Policy, Office of the Secretary of War for Health Affairs. “In the first phase, the CARE Consortium focused on acute injuries — studying what happens in the hours, days, and months after a concussion. Those efforts helped shape a new international framework for classifying traumatic brain injury.”

In 2025, CSI is breaking new ground by asking: What happens multiple months or years later? Can blood biomarkers, MRI scans, or genetic testing give us insights as to who may face long-term challenges?

Early results are promising. Some markers remain elevated long after an injury — suggesting they could play a role in tracking recovery and predicting outcomes.

“This research could reshape how doctors, coaches, and commanders think about brain health,” added Lee. “For service members, it may guide policies that protect and enhance readiness across a career of blast exposures and concussion. For the medical community, it could open the door to targeted treatments and prevention strategies and closer clinical follow up for those who may be at greater risk for long-term issues.”

Researchers stress that this is not about diagnosing Alzhemier’s disease in 20 year olds. Instead, it’s about spotting the earliest, most subtle signs of brain change — well before disease takes hold – and promoting resilience and long-range brain health.

“This is careful, detailed work,” added McCrea. “We’re not swinging a hammer — it’s more like we’re using tweezers. But the potential is enormous.”

With the addition and support of new partners such as Cure Alzheimer’s Fund and Bright Focus Foundation, and the backing of the DOW and the NCAA, CSI has access to a comprehensive dataset ever assembled on brain health in young adults.

“This is one of the most powerful opportunities we’ve ever had to understand brain health across the lifespan,” concluded Lee. “The findings could change the way we predict, prevent, and treat brain disease — not just in the military and athletic populations, but for society as a whole.”",https://health.mil/-/media/Images/MHS/Photos/Biomarkers.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-25 11:56:28.639506

While the award proves success, it also highlights the weight carried by medical professionals operating at such a high pace.","VANDENBERG SPACE FORCE BASE, Calif. – The 30th Medical Group was recently awarded the Defense Health Agency’s Gold Medal for primary care productivity, a recognition that highlights the unit’s dedication to patient care and operational readiness.

The award, ranking medical groups across the Department of Defense on performance in primary care, signifies the 30th MDG’s ability to exceed demanding benchmarks. The team reached 146 percent of its productivity target, placing them at the top among their peers.

“It’s a tremendous honor and validation of our entire team’s dedication to providing exceptional care for our patients,” said Col. Joi Dozier, 30th Medical Group commander. “It shows that we’re going in the right direction, and it’s gratifying for our people to know that their hard work is being recognized.”

Lt. Col. Christine Morris, chief administrator and group practice manager, explained that the recognition is not only about numbers, but also about resilience and teamwork.

“Despite deployments, turnover, and new providers adjusting to military medicine, our team continues to find ways to keep patient care moving forward,” Morris said. “We don’t aim for the minimum — we push for the maximum, and we’ve been able to do that because of the all-in mentality across our clinics.”

Much of the healthcare demand stems from Vandenberg’s unique mission supporting West Coast rocket and test launch activities. Requiring one of the largest Security Forces squadrons in the Department of the Air Force, the installation provides extensive medical processing for deployments, readiness checks, and day-to-day care.

While the award proves success, it also highlights the weight carried by medical professionals operating at such a high pace.

According to the U.S. Surgeon General, health workers facing excessive workloads, limited rest, and administrative burdens are at increased risk for burnout — a condition that can erode morale and well-being. (hhs.gov)

Support data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that in 2022, 45.6% of health workers reported feeling burned out often or very often, compared to 32% in 2018 — underscoring how rising demands strain even the most dedicated teams. (cdc.gov)

Dozier acknowledged this challenge directly, noting that the group’s achievements were made while many providers carried workloads significantly above standard levels.

“With more providers, we could increase patient access and relieve some of the pressure on our current staff,” she said. “Our people are committed, but they need time to recharge, too. At the end of the day, burnout isn’t just about the provider — it can affect patient safety and the overall experience.”

Despite these challenges, both Dozier and Morris see the recognition as proof that the 30th MDG is moving in the right direction.

“This award tells us that our efforts are being validated, but it also motivates us to keep improving,” said Dozier. “Whether it’s exploring more virtual care options, optimizing workflows, or listening to patient feedback, we’re committed to finding ways to better serve Airmen, Guardians, and their families.”

Morris echoed the sentiment, “We’re patients here, too. Our families get care here. We understand how important it is, and that’s why we push ourselves every day to provide the best care possible.”

The 30th Medical Group’s gold medal recognition reflects not only their current success, but also their ongoing commitment to advancing patient care in the face of evolving challenges.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2509/9338243/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-24 23:56:21.199976

Abstract

Purpose

The COVID-19 pandemic had far-reaching impacts on the delivery of preventive health care to pediatric patients worldwide, including outpatient vaccination. Our study assessed the repercussions of the pandemic on the delivery of adolescent vaccines.

Methods

We utilized the TRICARE Management Activity's Military Health System (MHS) Data Repository to measure the delivery of Human Papillomavirus (HPV), Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis (Tdap), Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine (MCV4), seasonal influenza (flu), and Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B (MenB) vaccines to adolescent children of United States (U.S.) military members during the prepandemic (March 2018–February 2020) and COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020–February 2022) periods, as well as the delivery of COVID-19 vaccine after it became available. We included those patients aged 11–21 years and eligible for TRICARE health care during these periods and indirectly measured vaccine delivery using the number of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT)-coded vaccinations administered per month to eligible adolescents.

Results

We found that the monthly rates of Human Papillomavirus, Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis, and seasonal influenza vaccination declined during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to the prepandemic period. In contrast, the monthly rates of MCV4 rose during the second year of the pandemic, and MenB vaccination increased over both years. When COVID-19 vaccination was available, dependent adolescents living outside the continental United States had >2-fold higher COVID-19 vaccination rate than those living in the continental US. We also identified broadly higher vaccination rates among the adolescent children of officers as compared to the adolescent children of junior enlisted members, despite universal insurance coverage to preventive health-care services within the Military Health System.

Discussion

Adolescent vaccination rates in military dependents declined during COVID-19, especially among junior enlisted families and western regions, with slow recovery except for meningococcal vaccines.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused far-reaching disruption to the delivery of health-care services worldwide, including within the United States (U.S.) Military Health System (MHS), a complex health-care network that provides both direct care and private sector care to approximately 9.6 million TRICARE insurance beneficiaries globally. COVID-19 mitigation efforts meant to reduce the spread of the pandemic and the resource limitations created by the pandemic resulted in a decline in routine health-care visits and preventive services [1]. For pediatric patients, this meant a significant decline in well-child visits and vaccination rates [2,3]. Prior to the pandemic, military dependent children received their routine childhood vaccines at rates that approached community goals, with 74.4% completing the recommended series and only 36.2% experiencing delays in series completion [4]. However, previous research has demonstrated a significant downtrend in well-child visits and routine vaccination among US military children under 2 years of age that occurred during the pandemic [5]. Analysis from early months of the pandemic showed that the decline in U.S. vaccination rates was highest among adolescents as compared to children of 0–6 years of age [3,6], which raises concern for a similar trend among adolescent military dependent children.

In December 2019, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released a policy statement emphasizing adolescence, defined as age 11–21 years, as a critical developmental period during which a young person undergoes physical, social, emotional, and cognitive growth toward adulthood [7]. They advocate that adolescents should have a patient-centered medical home responsible for providing longitudinal preventive health-care services including developmental screening, growth and metabolic screening, counseling regarding risk-taking behaviors, and vaccination. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a periodicity schedule of annual well-visits throughout adolescence [8], which includes the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) schedule for the Human Papillomavirus (HPV), Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis (Tdap), and Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine (MCV4) series [9]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention further recommends seasonal influenza (flu) vaccination annually, and prior to 2025, at least one lifetime dose of COVID-19 vaccine was recommended. Other vaccines, such as Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B vaccine (MenB), are recommended to adolescent patients based on specific risk factors or shared clinical decision-making.

The continuation of annual well-child visits and preventive care through adolescence is imperative for healthy transition into adulthood, as unmet health needs in adolescence predict poor health outcomes later in life [10]. Despite this, adherence to the preventive services schedule is known to be poor during the adolescent years [11]. Teenage patients are much more likely to attend acute visits than well-child visits, and many of their acute concerns or injuries could have been avoided with appropriate preventive screening or counseling [10,11]. Adolescents are also more susceptible to several vaccine-preventable diseases based on age-related factors including social behaviors, such as intimate interpersonal relationships and large-scale social gatherings, increased risk-taking behavior, such as unprotected sexual encounters and illicit substance use, and the waning immunity of early childhood vaccines [12]. Consequently, poor adherence to or disruption of the adolescent immunization schedule can result in significant morbidity and mortality [13].

The existence of health-care disparities related to vaccination has been well-established prior to the COVID-19 pandemic [14–16]. Geography, socioeconomic status, race and ethnicity, parental levels of education, and health insurance inequality are all variables that can affect access to routine immunization [15–17]. In the MHS, dependent beneficiaries have universal health-care coverage through a wide-reaching network of both military and civilian health-care settings. Despite this, similar disparities in vaccination exist among the dependent children of US military members [18]. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescent vaccination rates within the MHS during both the first and second years of the pandemic and to assess disparities in vaccination among unique demographic groups within the US military in order to guide targeted interventions for the groups most affected.

Methods

We performed a retrospective monthly repeated cross-sectional study using data from the MHS database of TRICARE beneficiaries. TRICARE is a health-care program of the U.S. Department of Defense MHS that provides health benefits for the US Armed Forces military members, retirees, and their dependents. The MHS records TRICARE billing data from civilian and military treatment facilities within and outside of the United States. All TRICARE-enrolled military dependents aged 11–21 years from March 2018 to February 2022 were eligible for inclusion in our study, and the number enrolled fluctuated with eligibility per given month. Patients outside of this age range were excluded. Vaccinations were queried monthly using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes corresponding to a given vaccine. We indirectly measured vaccine delivery by dividing the number of Current Procedural Terminology-coded vaccinations administered per month by the number of total patients eligible in that same month to calculate the monthly vaccination rates.

Demographic subgroups for our study included sex, age, geographic location, and military sponsor rank. Sponsor rank was categorized as junior enlisted (E1-E4), senior enlisted (E5-E9), or officer rank (O1-O10). Military rank is a useful proxy for educational attainment and socioeconomic status, with junior enlisted rank generally indicating a lower income and lower level of educational attainment [19,20]. Officers, in contrast, must have a college degree and earn a significantly higher base salary. Geographic regions were defined based on TRICARE's classification of North, South, West, and outside of the continental United States (OCONUS) at the time of the study period. The study time periods were defined as pre–COVID-19 (March 2018–February 2020), first COVID-19 pandemic year (March 2020–February 2021), and second COVID-19 pandemic year (March 2021–February 2022). We compared median monthly vaccination rates across prepandemic and COVID-19 pandemic time periods, as well as between demographic groups. We then used adjusted Poisson regression to create rate ratios for vaccination rates according to age, sex, sponsor rank, and geographic location.

Results

A total of 1,497,173 unique adolescent patients were enrolled in this study with a median monthly enrollment of 967,933 (Table 1). The median age at first month of inclusion was 15 [interquartile range (IQR) 11–18], 53.9% were female, 13.9% were dependents of junior enlisted service members (E1–E4), 63.0% of senior enlisted (E5–E9), and 23.1% of officers (O1–O10). Geographic breakdowns resulted in 31.5% residing in the North, 34.1% in the South, and 28.9% in the West, and 5.6% OCONUS. Among the routine adolescent vaccine series, 244,297 patients received HPV, 124,970 received Tdap, and 299,328 received MCV4. MenB was administered to 57,257 patients. The study period included four iterations of the seasonal influenza vaccine, with patients receiving 461,580 total flu vaccines. For the COVID-19 vaccine, which was not authorized for use in adolescents aged 12–17 years until January of 2022, study patients received 103,854 vaccines throughout the months they were eligible.

The first year of the pandemic saw a decline in the vaccination rate for all routine adolescent vaccine series and MenB, with the steepest decline occurring at the beginning of the pandemic (Figure 1). For HPV and Tdap, the monthly vaccination rates were, respectively, 19% and 21% lower during the first year of the pandemic as compared to the prepandemic period and then began to recover during the second pandemic year but did not return to prepandemic levels (Figure 1). Monthly vaccination rates with MCV4 saw a similar decline of 12% during the first pandemic year but then recovered during the second pandemic year to a rate of 4% higher than prepandemic. Over the four iterations of seasonal flu vaccination encompassed in the study, there was a sustained downtrend in the peak monthly flu vaccination rate for each flu season (Figure 1). In contrast, monthly vaccination with MenB did not decline during the first year of the pandemic, and it increased by 12% during the second pandemic year (Figure 1).

Examining the demographic groups, males were significantly less likely to receive the HPV, seasonal flu, and MenB vaccines but more likely to receive the MCV4 and COVID-19 vaccines (Tables 2 and 3). The adolescent dependents of officers and senior enlisted members were significantly more likely to receive all of the vaccines studied except Tdap. Notably, the dependents of officers were over four times more likely to receive MenB than the dependents of junior enlisted members. Geographically, TRICARE's North region had the highest vaccination rates for HPV, MCV4, and MenB. The OCONUS region had the highest rates for Tdap, flu, and COVID-19 vaccines, and OCONUS dependents were over twice as likely to receive the COVID-19 vaccine compared to their continental peers.

Discussion

This study analyzed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on vaccination rates for adolescent patients within the MHS and identified a significant decline in vaccination rates for several routine vaccine series, as well as the seasonal flu vaccine. The steepest decline occurred during March–April 2020, coinciding with the initial mandated lockdowns and social distancing efforts. Despite health-care systems slowly returning to normal capabilities over the following years, for the majority of the vaccines we studied, vaccination rates did not recover to prepandemic rates. We also identified significant disparities in vaccination rates affecting the junior enlisted population and western TRICARE region.

Considering the social, economic, and geopolitical disruption that occurred over the first year of the pandemic, the initial decline followed by the slow recovery of vaccination rates during this year is not unexpected. However, the failure of the rates of HPV and Tdap vaccination to recover by the end of the second pandemic year is concerning, especially considering the broad “reopening” that had occurred by the end of our study period. Prior to the pandemic, school vaccination requirements at the state and local levels were an effective tool for maximizing vaccination rates [21]. In 2019, Tdap was required for later grade school entry in all 50 states, MCV4 was required in 30 states, and HPV was required in three states [22,23]. This is applicable to US military dependents, as military duty stations are present within all 50 states, and 77% of military dependent children are enrolled in local public or private schools K-12 [24]. The Department of Defense Education Activity, the U.S. military-affiliated school system that enrolls military children worldwide, requires vaccination with Tdap, MCV4, and seasonal flu [25]. The transition to remote school modalities may have contributed significantly to the slow recovery in rates during our study period, though it remains unclear why the trends were not consistent among the three routine vaccine series.

A rise in vaccine hesitancy during the pandemic also could have affected the uptake of several of the vaccines we studied. Prior to the pandemic, HPV was the adolescent vaccine series with the most associated hesitancy due to concerns that it caused infertility, autoimmune conditions, or promoted sexual promiscuity in adolescent girls [26]. Historically, it had lower rates of uptake as compared to other routine vaccines [26]. During the pandemic, the roll out of the novel COVID-19 vaccine was met with widespread concerns about safety and efficacy [27]. There was an associated increase in hesitancy regarding vaccination in general [27], which may have contributed to the decreased rates of Tdap and worsened the already lower comparative rates of HPV vaccination. The progressive decline in peak seasonal flu vaccination may also be reflective of growing vaccine hesitancy; though with social distancing efforts in place and low rates of influenza circulating in the community [28], there was also less incentive to be immunized. In the wake of the pandemic, vaccine hesitancy has persisted, and the topic of vaccination has become increasingly political [29], compounding the global health debt incurred during the pandemic and worsening the risk of vaccine-preventable illness outbreaks.

Despite the barriers to vaccination detailed above, both meningitis vaccines surpassed their prepandemic delivery rates during our study period. It is remarkable that MenB administration rose during the first year of the pandemic, as this was not observed for any of the routine vaccine series or the flu vaccine. One likely contributor to the recovery of MCV4 and the sustained rise in MenB rates is that colleges commonly require these for enrollment or on-campus housing. Currently, there are 22 state university systems that require meningococcal vaccination in order to live in campus housing [30]. In contrast, Tdap is only required by university systems in 13 states, and HPV is not required by higher education in any state. Though MenB is not universally recommended for all adolescents, a series of meningitis B outbreaks between 2013 and 2019 [31] has spurred an increase in the number of universities requiring or recommending MenB [32]. If college requirements buoyed meningococcal vaccination during the pandemic, it is noteworthy that the adolescent dependents of officers were four times more likely to receive MenB than the dependents of junior enlisted members, suggesting a higher rate of college enrollment. This is also consistent with previous observations that military rank is a reliable surrogate for income and educational attainment [19,20].

The military is a diverse institution whose members reflect the demographics of the United States [33], but our study population is unique in that all active duty service members and their dependents have access to the same health-care system through TRICARE. Despite universal insurance coverage, recent research demonstrated that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the largest declines in vaccination rates for children under 24 months of age occurred among the dependents of junior enlisted parents and those living in the western United States or outside the continental United States [5]. We found similar disparities in our adolescent cohort. Dependents of officers and senior enlisted members were more likely to get all of the vaccines we studied, with the exception of Tdap. Potential explanations may be due to educational gaps between these groups or differences in where these groups obtain their health information. Junior enlisted rank typically denotes younger age, and they are therefore less likely to have adolescent-aged children, so the children of officers and senior enlisted members comprised a larger percentage of beneficiaries studied.

Our study also saw regional variations in vaccine delivery, which may be tied to regional policies regarding social distancing and reopening. Notably, dependents living in the north were more likely to receive their routine vaccine series than those living in the south or west. Western regions also were less likely to receive influenza, MenB, and COVID-19 than northern regions. The generally lower rates of vaccination in the west may be related to the longer and more rigorously enforced social distancing mandates in western states. The OCONUS region saw notably higher rates of COVID-19 and flu vaccination, which is likely because health policies are more enforceable for military dependents living overseas than within the continental United States. The dependents of military members transferring OCONUS undergo an Overseas Suitability Screening to ensure that their medical, dental, and developmental health needs can be met by the assigned duty station, which includes a review of immunization status. Military dependents living at most OCONUS duty stations are also subjected to host nation entry requirements and health policies.

A significant strength of our study is the large population, which was geographically widespread with racial and income diversity reflective of the US population. Our population was also universally insured with access to medical treatment facilities, which mitigates the effect of insurance bias on vaccination rates but also limits the generalizability. Our methodology using Current Procedural Terminology coding yields reliable indirect measurements of vaccination rates but does not capture any vaccinations that were not billed under TRICARE insurance. It is possible that military children were immunized using secondary insurance of a nonmilitary family member, or through public health vaccine initiatives, which our study does not capture. We were also unable to assess vaccination rates at an individual level, including the completion of the vaccination series by a given dependent. We did not assess the age of the dependents as related to sponsor rank, so there is room for misinterpretation of vaccination rates by rank as mentioned above. Lastly, some of the patients in our cohort may have received their HPV vaccine at age of 9 or 10 years, in accordance with the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations [34], and therefore would not have been captured in our study. However, this recommendation for earlier administration was released in 2016, prior to our study, and we would not expect a significant change in rates of 9-year-old and 10-year-old patients vaccinated to change over the time of our study. Therefore, it is unlikely to have significantly impacted our observed HPV delivery rates.

Conclusion

Vaccination rates for adolescent US military children decreased substantially in the first months of the pandemic, with the exception of meningococcal vaccines that did not recover to prepandemic rates over the next 2 years. Decreases in vaccination were especially notable in dependents of junior enlisted members and those living in the western TRICARE region. Therefore, it is imperative to explore ways of removing barriers to vaccination, including attitudes toward vaccine safety and efficacy, financial and educational gaps, geographic differences in health policy, and any other factors that could compromise the delivery of preventative care to our military pediatric population.

You can find an in-network specialist using the West Region Provider Directory.","TRICARE Prime beneficiaries in the West Region who are receiving specialty care through a referral waiver process will need new referrals to continue that care as of Oct. 1.

The end of the waiver process is the latest milestone in the transfer of the West Region to TriWest Healthcare Alliance, which took over the contract Jan. 1 as part of the new T-5 agreement. The transition was not without its challenges; some of the millions of users who switched contractors (or regions) reported a range of access problems to MOAA and other outlets.

[FROM TRICARE.MIL: West Region Waiver Deadline Details]

A MOAA-supported passage in the House version of the FY 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) would require an evaluation of the T-5 transition process, with special focus on the impact the changeover had (and continues to have) on patient care.

While this report would provide actionable information to help protect earned benefits during future contract transitions, beneficiaries in the West Region using the existing waiver process have more immediate steps to take, or they could lose access to specialist care.

(Note: Waiver rules apply to West Region TRICARE Prime beneficiaries only. They do not apply to those under TRICARE Select or TRICARE For Life, to East Region beneficiaries, or to overseas beneficiaries.)

Maintaining Access to Care

If you are in the West Region and your care referral was issued before Jan. 1, 2025, or was issued after Jan. 1 via the referral approval waiver process, you must have a new referral in order to receive specialist care after Sept. 30. Contact your primary care manager to secure a referral, and allow time for TriWest to process it.

If you are receiving care from a non-network specialist, you have until Oct. 1 to change to an in-network specialist or you may face point-of-service fees. You can find an in-network specialist using the West Region Provider Directory.

If you do not obtain a new referral, you may face out-of-pocket costs when accessing care from a specialist.

The CDMRP funds basic, translational and clinical research to improve cancer screening and detection for everyone. This research also supports military readiness of Warfighters living with cancer diagnosis by enabling timely treatment, reducing disease- and treatment-related activity restrictions, and increasing the likelihood of a full return to duty.

In 2023, medical professionals within the Military Health System saw 7,745 active-duty members of the U.S. Armed Forces for more than 50,500 cancer-related appointments or visits. According to a 2019 report, the financial impact of cancer treatment costs in the MHS likely exceeds the most recent available estimate from 2002 of more than $1 billion annually. Each year, Department of Veterans Affairs health care providers diagnose over 43,000 Veterans with cancer and provide cancer care to over 450,000 Veterans at a VA hospital or clinic.

Service Members may experience unavoidable environmental or occupational exposures to radiation, chemicals and pollutants that increase cancer risk. In 2025, the VA acknowledged esophageal, ovarian and prostate cancers, among others, as presumptive cancers related to burn pit exposure.

Improving Early Detection of Esophageal Cancer

Most patients with esophageal cancer receive their diagnoses at a late stage with poor prognosis. Untreated gastroesophageal reflux disease, also known as GERD or chronic heartburn, can lead to Barrett’s esophagus, an alteration in the lining of the esophagus, which increases the risk for esophageal cancer. Upper endoscopy, a procedure used to diagnose Barrett’s esophagus and esophageal cancer, collects tissue samples through a tube-like instrument inserted through the mouth or nose. Endoscopy requires general anesthesia and scheduling with a specialist to perform the procedure and may cause discomfort for patients.

In fiscal year 2020, the Peer Reviewed Cancer Research Program funded an Impact Award, led by Katarina Greer, M.D., at the Louis Stokes Cleveland Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, to test a non-endoscopic sampling device, EsoCheck, and a DNA-based screening assay, EsoGuard, in Veterans who presented with risk factors for Barrett’s esophagus, including obesity and history of smoking. EsoCheck is a vitamin-sized device attached to a thin retrieval cord. Once swallowed by the patient, EsoCheck inflates to collect samples from the esophagus, then deflates for retrieval with the collected sample, all within five minutes at a typical doctor’s office visit. Technicians then perform the EsoGuard screening assay and provide results, often within three weeks.

Greer and her team found EsoCheck and EsoGuard accurately diagnosed Barrett’s esophagus, as confirmed by endoscopy, and also received positive feedback from patients. Based on these findings, the Peer Reviewed Cancer Research Program funded another Impact Award in fiscal year 2023 supporting continued clinical evaluation of EsoCheck and EsoGuard. The pilot clinical trial, led by Greer, will evaluate EsoCheck and EsoGuard screening in lower risk populations receiving care within the VA, including those with no history of GERD or Barrett’s esophagus.

If successful, findings from this trial will validate a minimally-invasive screening method for Barrett’s esophagus and enable earlier detection for esophageal cancer.

A Portable Imaging Device for Early Ovarian Cancer Detection

More than 70 percent of ovarian cancer diagnoses occur after the cancer spreads to regions outside the ovary. At early stages of ovarian cancer, patients may experience no symptoms or nonspecific symptoms, and small tumors on the ovary remain undetectable by routine pelvic exams or ultrasound imaging, making diagnosis difficult.

In fiscal year 2017, the Ovarian Cancer Research Program funded a Clinical Development Award, led by Jennifer Barton, Ph.D., at the University of Arizona, to conduct a pilot clinical trial evaluating a new device, called a falloposcope or a fallopian tube endoscope, for advanced imaging of the fallopian tubes and adjacent ovary surface, where ovarian cancer often starts.

The falloposcope is a small hand-held imaging device connected to a portable computer workstation, allowing medical professionals to examine fallopian tube and ovary tissue in real-time and move the system between examination rooms, as needed. Falloposcopy does not require surgical incision or general anesthesia, making the procedure minimally invasive under local anesthesia.

In the pilot clinical trial, Barton and her team tested the falloposcope in women undergoing fallopian tube removal for complications other than cancer diagnosis. The device captured clear images of the entire length of fallopian tubes and ovaries without causing tissue damage.

Taking into account iterative feedback from surgeons and clinical staff as they performed falloposcopy on patients, the team refined the prototype to meet the requirements of an operating room environment, improve ease of use and portability, and enhance image quality.

With additional clinical testing, the falloposcope, now patented, could become a routine screening tool for improved detection of pre-cancerous and cancerous cells, potentially saving lives through earlier interventions for ovarian cancer.

Improving Detection and Diagnostic Performance in Prostate Cancer

Up to 40 percent of patients with prostate cancer experience recurrence, a return of cancer after initial treatment.

One method of screening for prostate cancer recurrence measures levels of prostate-specific antigen, a protein produced by the prostate gland, in blood. For patients with prostate cancer who complete an initial treatment regimen, increasing PSA levels can signal cancer recurrence. Subsequent imaging aims to determine whether the recurrence remains localized to the prostate or spread to other sites in the body for appropriate treatment planning. However, blood PSA levels can increase months-to-years before conventional imaging can detect small tumors, complicating disease management.

In fiscal year 2015, the Prostate Cancer Research Program funded an Impact Award, led by Andrei Iagaru, Ph.D., at Stanford University, to conduct a phase 2/3 clinical trial evaluating a new imaging method, 68Ga-RM2 PET-MRI, in 100 men living with recurring prostate cancer.

The team’s imaging approach combines magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, with positron emission tomography, or PET, using a radioactive label specific for gastrin releasing peptide receptor, a protein found in high levels in several types of cancer, including prostate cancer. The 68Ga-RM2 radiolabel binds to prostate cancer cells, allowing clinicians to identify the location of cancerous tissue in the PET-MRI scans.

Compared to MRI alone, 68Ga-RM2 PET-MRI identified recurrence in 72 percent more patients and located 49 percent more tumors overall.

The results of this study demonstrate the potential for targeted imaging for earlier diagnosis of recurrent prostate cancer, which could lead to improved disease management and better patient survival.

Ensuring Impacts for Cancer Patients

The CDMRP cancer research programs maintain patient-centric focuses, tailoring their funding opportunities to address research of greatest need and strongest impact for each specific patient community, including Service Members and Veterans.

“In every cancer breakthrough and triumph, I see echoes of the countless lives touched by the Peer Reviewed Cancer Research Program,” U.S. Army Veteran Brandi Benson, fiscal year 2024 PRCRP Programmatic Panel member, said. “It’s a reminder of the incredible impact we can make when we come together with a shared sense of purpose. With every beat of my heart, I am honored to be a part of this extraordinary journey, where hope shines brightest in the face of adversity, and miracles happen.”

Minister of State for Defence, Bello Matawalle, disclosed this on Tuesday while speaking in Abuja during the 20th anniversary celebration of the Ministry of Defence Health Implementation Programme’s partnership with the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research Africa.

Matawalle expressed that the initiative would strengthen Nigeria’s defence health system and guarantee that soldiers and their families enjoy the same health safeguards as other citizens under the NHIA.

“We must shape the next 20 years with national security and the National Health Insurance Authority, ensuring that our forces are covered by national health and well-being safeguards for service members, their families, and eligible civilians—extending across postings and into retirement,” he said.

The minister further explained that the health of the military was directly tied to national security, noting that preventive healthcare and insurance coverage would ensure operational readiness.

“The health of our armed forces is preserved for the security of our nation. When illness is prevented, protection and unity remain operational missions,” he added.

Citing the impact of the defence health partnership, Matawalle explained that it has already benefitted over half a million Nigerians, including military and civilians, saving lives, strengthening infrastructure, and boosting confidence in military-led healthcare.

Matawalle emphasised that integrating the armed forces into health insurance would not only sustain care but also safeguard long-term national security.

“As we mark this anniversary, we renew our collective resolve to keep the health of our armed forces at the heart of national defence,” he said.

Chief of Defence Staff, General Christopher Musa, described the NHIA integration as a crucial step toward ensuring soldiers remain fit to defend the nation.

He hailed the two-decade partnership with Walter Reed as a model of international collaboration, which has transformed Nigeria’s military health system, strengthened 32 health facilities nationwide, and supported civilian communities during health crises, including HIV prevention and COVID-19 response.

Musa cited the Defence Reference Laboratory in Abuja, which was accredited by the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation, describing it as a landmark facility that enhanced Nigeria’s capacity to respond to future health threats.

Also at the event, the United States Ambassador to Nigeria, Richard Mills Jr., commended the partnership as a demonstration of trust and respect between Nigeria and the U.S., while Major General Paula Lodi, Commanding General of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command, said the collaboration had saved countless lives, built local capacity, and influenced health policy beyond Nigeria.

Since its inception, the programme has recorded significant milestones. A total of 1,628,414 clients have been tested and counselled for HIV, out of which 110,097 tested positive. About 69,447 adults and children have been newly initiated on Antiretroviral Therapy (ART), with 40,702 currently on treatment. In all, 77,162 adults and children have ever been enrolled on ART.

In addition, 277,975 pregnant women now know their HIV status, 15,098 of them tested positive, and 13,377 received ART to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the disease.

Matawalle said the figures are a testament to the importance of integrating military personnel into health insurance coverage, which would guarantee not only the sustainability of care but also long-term operational effectiveness.

“As we mark this anniversary, we renew our collective resolve to keep the health of our armed forces at the heart of national defence. The force that guarantees peace is resilience and mission orientation.

About LUKE LUKE is a trusted leader in healthcare staffing for the U.S. Government.","NASHVILLE, Tenn., Sept. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As the American Association of Christian Counselors (AACC) World Conference in Nashville opens, LUKE Holdings, Inc. (“LUKE”), a trusted leader in healthcare staffing for the U.S. Government, is extending an invitation to churches, ministries, and community organizations across the country to join in a shared effort to strengthen care for America’s heroes.

Our nation is blessed with veterans, warfighters, and first responders who protect our communities and keep us safe. Yet today, many of these heroes and their families are carrying heavy burdens. Every day, 17 veterans die by suicide. In 2023 alone, 523 warfighters took their own lives. More law enforcement officers and firefighters now die from suicide than in the line of duty. That is a tragedy we cannot accept, and it is why we must bring hope before despair takes hold.

“For more than twenty years, LUKE has served alongside the federal government to deliver healthcare for those who protect our nation,” said John Sanders, CEO of LUKE. “We know that true flourishing requires more than clinical services alone. It takes professional care working in concert with the trusted networks that we know people turn to first, including churches and community organizations. When we build structured partnerships, we surround our heroes with strength, restore resilience, and create sustainable support systems that ensure they are never left to carry their burdens in silence.”

When people are struggling, the first place most turn is their place of worship. That trust is powerful. Faith and community support have already been shown to lower suicide, reduce hospital stays, and bring real hope and healing. The scale of the crisis demands a broader response, one that draws on both professional care and trusted community networks. Veterans, warfighters, and first responders deserve care that is personal, trusted, and close to home, delivered through sustainable systems that are built to last.

“This is a defining moment,” Sanders added. “When organizations and communities unite around a mission bigger than themselves, we not only honor sacrifice but also deliver real-world solutions that restore strength and rebuild lives.”

In conjunction with the event, LUKE has launched a Human Flourishing page on its website, offering a starting point for churches and organizations ready to engage in this effort: https://lukestaffing.com/humanflourishing/.

Eisenhower VA Medical Center to Fort Leavenworth, Sept. 17.

The purpose of the meeting was to explore partnership opportunities aimed at enhancing healthcare delivery for military personnel and veterans, and training opportunities for Munson Soldiers in medical career fields. The meeting fostered open dialogue and planning, modeled upon existing partnerships within the Defense Health Agency and Department of Veterans Affairs.

The visit underscored the commitment between Munson and the VA to leverage resources and expertise to better serve their respective patient populations.

“Discussions centered on identifying areas where we have the opportunity to collaborate and what the process will be to get us there,” said Lt. Col. Scott Reynoldson, Munson Army Health Center, deputy commander for Administration. ""By working together, we can leverage the strengths of both the Munson and our local VA systems to address the unique healthcare needs of our beneficiaries, enhance overall readiness, and ensure our military providers are able to expand their skill sets.""

Munson and VA staff also looked at specialized services, equipment, and facilities that could be shared to reduce redundancy and optimize resource utilization across both organizations.

The opportunity for military providers at Munson to conduct rotations at the VA would allow the Soldiers to see more complex and higher acuity patients.

The VA delegation expressed interest in helping service members with a seamless transition to civilian life and accessing VA healthcare.

""We are committed to building strong partnerships with our DOD counterparts and ultimately provide a more integrated and comprehensive healthcare experience for our veterans,"" said Dominique Henderson, assistant director, VA Eastern Kansas Health Care System

Following the initial meeting, Munson and VA leadership plan to establish working groups to further explore specific partnership opportunities and develop the way forward.

At Kemah Palms Recovery, we’re proud to be an in-network provider, so you can focus on healing instead of paperwork. This guide explains how your Tricare plan supports outpatient treatment, what services are included, and how to verify benefits before you begin.

Understand Tricare coverage

Covered treatment options

Tricare offers comprehensive coverage for addiction treatment, from detoxification through ongoing outpatient care. According to TricareRehabs, you can expect benefits for services such as detox, inpatient rehab, intensive outpatient programs, therapy sessions, and long-term recovery support [1].

Service Description Coverage highlights Detoxification Medically supervised withdrawal from drugs or alcohol Inpatient and outpatient detox covered Inpatient rehabilitation 24/7 care in a residential setting Full or partial coverage depending on plan Intensive outpatient program (IOP) Structured therapy several times per week Covered if medically necessary Partial hospitalization program (PHP) Day treatment with group and individual therapy Coverage varies by medical necessity and plan limits Therapy and counseling Individual, group, and family sessions Covered under mental health benefits Long-term outpatient support Aftercare groups and relapse prevention Covered when prescribed by a provider

Coverage exclusions and limits

Tricare only covers services that are medically or psychologically necessary for diagnosis or treatment of a covered condition. Services deemed custodial care or non-skilled (for example, basic exercise without skilled oversight) are excluded [2]. Additionally, some programs may have special rules or limits, so always confirm with your plan administrator.

Check your benefits

Identify your Tricare plan

Your coverage depends on whether you have Tricare Prime, Tricare Select, or another Tricare option. Prime often requires a referral from your primary care manager (PCM) but has lower out-of-pocket costs. Select gives you more flexibility in choosing providers but may involve higher copayments and deductibles.

Review plan details

Locate your benefits handbook or log in to the TRICARE East or West portal to see specific outpatient rehab coverage. If you’re in the East region, check alcohol detox details at alcohol detox tricare east coverage. If you’re in the West region, see drug detox options at drug detox tricare west coverage. Always verify your plan’s criteria for inpatient and outpatient services.

Confirm outpatient services

Intensive outpatient programs

An intensive outpatient program (IOP) provides several hours of therapy per day while you live at home. Tricare covers IOPs when a provider documents medical necessity. These programs often include group therapy, individual counseling, and educational sessions.

Partial hospitalization programs

Partial hospitalization programs (PHPs) offer daylong treatment without an overnight stay. PHPs blend clinical structure with community support, and Tricare may cover this level of care if less restrictive options are insufficient.

Therapy and support groups

Tricare covers individual, group, and family counseling for substance use and co-occurring mental health issues. These sessions help you develop coping skills and build a relapse prevention plan.

Navigate authorization process

Obtain preauthorization

Most outpatient services require preauthorization from your regional contractor—Humana Military in the East, TriWest in the West. Your provider will submit a treatment plan and request approval. Authorization ensures that your care is covered and that you avoid unexpected bills.

Gather necessary documentation

To speed up approval, have the following ready:

Referral or prescription from your PCM

Clinical assessment or intake evaluation

Provider’s treatment plan detailing frequency and duration

Manage out-of-pocket costs

Copayments and deductibles

Your share of cost varies by plan. Under Tricare Prime, you may pay minimal copays for outpatient visits. Under Tricare Select, expect a deductible plus a percentage of the allowable charge. In-network providers keep your expenses predictable with negotiated rates.

In-network vs out-of-network

Choosing an in-network facility like Kemah Palms Recovery minimizes your costs. Out-of-network care may still be covered but often at a lower benefit rate, leaving you responsible for a larger portion of the bill.

Access support services

Individual and group therapy

Counseling is a cornerstone of lasting recovery. Tricare covers behavioral therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, and family counseling when they are part of your prescribed treatment plan.

Home health care

For those who need support at home, Tricare may cover home health visits and pharmacy home delivery services to ensure continuity of care [3]. These resources help you maintain stability as you transition back to daily life.

Next steps and resources

Reach out to Kemah Palms Recovery’s admissions team to verify your coverage, initiate preauthorization, and schedule your first appointment. We handle insurance verification so you can focus on your recovery.

Janelle Marra finds herself at the center of an unfolding controversy that has drawn national attention after her removal from leadership positions and an ongoing investigation concerning her LinkedIn profile. Unbeknownst to her family, this development follows an orchestrated online campaign aimed at ousting her, rooted in hostility toward her advocacy for LGBTQ+ healthcare.

Marra, a doctor with extensive experience at Camp Pendleton and the Naval Medical Center San Diego, has been recognized for her contributions, particularly in women’s and LGBTQ+ health. Her role as the medical services director for Expeditionary Medical Facility 150 Bravo placed her in a pivotal position, and she was even nominated by Navy Surgeon General D.K. Via to serve as the deputy medical director of the Defense Health Agency’s Transgender Health Center. Despite concerted efforts to provide care, her work persisted during a tumultuous political climate where a transgender military ban was enacted under the Trump administration.

The situation escalated when podcaster Chase Spears shared a screenshot of Marra’s LinkedIn page on social media, highlighting her emphasis on LGBTQ+ and transgender healthcare. This post caught the attention of the controversial account Libs of Tik Tok, which frequently spreads anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric. Following the account’s amplification of Spears’ post, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth responded with a caustic remark, which further fueled the backlash against Marra.

As a result of this online exposure, Marra and her family began receiving a surge of threatening messages, some of which included violent comments suggesting execution by firing squad. With the threats escalating in severity, local law enforcement was involved to ensure the family’s safety, highlighting the real-world ramifications of online harassment campaigns.

Cassandra Marra, Janelle’s wife and a community college professor, expressed the distress this has caused their family, including their two children, one of whom is diagnosed with autism. The couple are currently grappling with anxiety and depression due to the situation, along with concerns about their financial stability, should the investigation lead to Janelle’s termination.

Communicating the emotional toll the harassment has taken, Cassandra stated that the consequences of the online attack are significantly more draining than the accusations themselves. She fears not just for their safety but also for their livelihood, as the loss of Janelle’s position would jeopardize their health insurance and pension accrued over her 17-year career.

Two weeks after the Libs of Tik Tok post, it amassed nearly 11 million views, spurring discussions about the impact of social media on professional lives. Cassandra emphasized that Janelle’s situation, while currently unique in its visibility, is not isolated, as others have faced similar fates without the intense scrutiny.

Highlighting the broader implications, she underscored the need for public discourse on the consequences of allowing such campaigns to succeed, stressing that silence could set a dangerous precedent for military personnel and the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Navy-Doctor-Targeted-by-Online-Harassment-Campaign-Over-LinkedIn-Profile.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-24 02:56:20.372679

""We encourage patients to complete the survey; their feedback is invaluable,” he said.","JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO, Texas – Patients have ranked 18 Defense Health Network Central clinics, providers and support staff as the ""best of the best"" in the Military Health System for patient experience and customer care, according to a recent Joint Outpatient Experience Survey, or JOES, quarterly report.

""Through quarterly ‘Best of the Best’ reports – informed by JOES data and beneficiary feedback – we recognize our clinics and personnel for delivering outstanding patient experiences, fostering a culture of exceptional care across the Military Health System,"" said Air Force Maj. Gen. Thomas Harrell, DHN Central director and Medical Readiness Command Alpha commander. “The dedication of these teams to providing outstanding care is truly inspiring, and I am incredibly proud of their commitment to our beneficiaries and their relentless pursuit of excellence.”

Each quarter, the Military Health System uses JOES data, which measures patient experience and satisfaction during outpatient appointments, to generate a ""best of the best"" report. The survey requests feedback on multiple aspects of the visit, including appointment timeliness, the helpfulness of front desk personnel, provider trust and communication, medical history, access to care, and overall satisfaction with the visit.

The report highlights the enterprise's top-performing military medical clinics, providers, and clerical staff in both primary and specialty care. Notably, Brooke Army Medical Center’s Peripheral Vascular Surgery Clinic took the No. 1 ranking in the specialty care category, while Fairchild Air Force Base’s Pediatric Clinic achieved the top spot in primary care.

“As nurses, high reliability is at the core of everything we do to bring care to military families.
“The way we reach high reliability may look different across teams or specialties.
That shared focus helps us deliver the safest, highest-quality care for every patient.” DHA’s journey toward high reliability is deeply connected to its leadership.","Becoming a high-reliability organization, or HRO, is a major goal for complex health systems. Achieving this goal means focusing on safety and minimizing errors across all Defense Health Agency military hospitals and clinics. It also requires strong, active leadership.

“Our strong focus on high reliability is more than just a clinical aim; it’s a critical mission,” said Deputy Assistant Director for Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer of DHA Dr. Paul Cordts. “It starts and ends with our leaders. We must show our commitment to zero preventable harm and build a culture where safety is everyone’s personal duty.”

How leaders build a culture of high reliability

In HROs, leaders make safety a top priority. They support continuous learning and push for innovation and growth. They create a shared vision for safer care, and they take personal responsibility for shaping the work culture. So, what does this look like in practice?

“As nurses, high reliability is at the core of everything we do to bring care to military families. Strong, caring leadership builds trust and contributes to a culture of safety. It gives our front-line staff the confidence to speak up and make changes that can save lives,” DHA Chief Nursing Officer Dr. Kristen Atterbury explained.

Leaders foster this kind of culture through clear and consistent actions. They follow key habits and values, including:

Modeling principles: Demonstrate ready, reliable care principles in how you approach your daily work.

Integrating safety and quality: Make safety and quality part of every task and goal.

Fostering trust: Build trust by being open, listening closely, and giving honest feedback.

Championing a just culture: Support a fair system where people are held accountable in a balanced way.

Leveraging expertise: Use everyone’s skills and knowledge, no matter their role or rank.

Ensuring psychological safety: Make sure staff know they can speak up about risks without fear of punishment.

Empowering through resources: Give people the tools and training they need to improve how they work.

Celebrating progress: Set up ways to thank staff and celebrate their success.

Fostering a supportive environment: Create a workplace where people grow, and teams do their best work.

These habits help turn big ideas into daily actions. That’s essential for any organization working to become a true HRO. “The way we reach high reliability may look different across teams or specialties. That’s OK,” said DHA Chief Dental Officer Air Force Col. (Dr.) Donald Sheets. “What matters is that we share one vision — from our top leaders to our newest staff. That shared focus helps us deliver the safest, highest-quality care for every patient.”

DHA’s journey toward high reliability is deeply connected to its leadership. By following the ready, reliable care principles, building trust, empowering teams, and keeping safety at the center, leaders help turn goals into real, lasting change. And that work leads us closer to one clear, critical goal: zero preventable harm across all care settings.",https://www.dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9322051.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-24 09:56:29.720817

This partnership aims to accelerate modernization research and development efforts across military medicine.

This strategic partnership, led by DHA’s Research and Engineering Directorate, positions VelocityTX as a trusted operational hub for translational science, agile infrastructure deployment, and cross-sector collaboration. The agreement consolidates existing independent research and development efforts — including those with the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research and the 59th Medical Wing — under a unified, mission-aligned framework.

Structured under the Federal Technology Transfer Act, the agreement sets forth three primary assurances:

• Intellectual property safeguards: robust protections for all parties, while preserving government purpose rights

• Modular collaboration pathways: scalable sub-agreements enable adaptive deployments across regions

• HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)-compliant integration: ethical and secure frameworks for future research operations

“This agreement transforms how military medicine innovates,” said Dr. Diana del Mónaco, DHA’s Regional Research Support Center project lead. “It unlocks the governance, intellectual property safeguards, and translational agility needed to drive mission-focused results at scale.”

San Antonio: A strategic nexus for military medicine

Known as “Military City, USA,” San Antonio is home to Joint Base San Antonio — comprised of Lackland Air Force Base, Fort Sam Houston, and Randolph Air Force Base — and Brooke Army Medical Center, the Department of Defense’s only Level I trauma center. VelocityTX’s proximity to these institutions enables seamless collaboration between military and civilian research ecosystems.

""San Antonio has long been at the forefront of military medical research, with an unmatched concentration of expertise, infrastructure, and mission-driven collaboration,"" said Rene Dominguez, chief executive officer of VelocityTX. ""This agreement builds on that legacy by connecting our city’s world-class military medical assets with cutting-edge private sector innovation to address critical capability gaps. Together with DHA, we are creating a pathway to rapidly translate new discoveries into solutions that strengthen warfighter readiness and improve care for military families and civilians alike.""

Enhancing partnerships, accelerating innovation

In May 2025, the two agencies hosted the second annual Promoting Professional Engagement Among Military Medical Laboratories, or ProPEL, at the VelocityTX campus. They also worked together on the AIM Health R&D Summit, which convenes military, academic, and industry leaders from across the country to share research and explore opportunities for collaboration.

“Events like ProPEL and AIM enhance research collaborations and synergy between the public and private sectors,” said del Mónaco. “By leveraging the scientific ecosystems VelocityTX is building in the Innovation District of San Antonio, military medical researchers are able to drive advancements and health care solutions aligned with DHA priorities with the ultimate goal of enabling warfighter and military family readiness, catalyze dual-use innovations, and reinforce DHA’s commitment to real-time, real-world readiness.”

The DHA Research and Engineering Directorate leads the discovery of innovative medical solutions responsive to the needs of combatant commands, the military services, and the Military Health System.

“There’s no rhyme or reason for any of this, other than just straight up hate,” Cassandra Marra said.
Janelle Marra also came to specialize in women’s and LGBTQ+ healthcare, and was nominated by Navy Surgeon General D.K.
“I’m sure that there are people trying to ensure that we don’t have our kids anymore,” Cassandra Marra said.
She has been removed from all her leadership roles and is still seeing patients while under investigation for violating social media rules.","When U.S. Navy Cmdr. Janelle Marra was removed from her Navy leadership roles and put under investigation for her LinkedIn page, her family did not know she was already the target of an online campaign to get her fired.

When Janelle Marra called her wife, community college biology professor Cassandra Marra, with the news, they were confused. Was everyone’s LinkedIn pages being surveilled or just hers?

“There’s no rhyme or reason for any of this, other than just straight up hate,” Cassandra Marra said. Janelle Marra could not speak to the press while under investigation.

The anatomy of an online harassment campaign

Janelle Marra, a doctor, has worked at Camp Pendleton clinics and the Naval Medical Center San Diego in Balboa Park on and off since 2008. She became medical services director of Expeditionary Medical Facility 150 Bravo, a Navy unit in San Diego trained to provide medical care to support military operations, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune.

Janelle Marra also came to specialize in women’s and LGBTQ+ healthcare, and was nominated by Navy Surgeon General D.K. Via to serve as deputy medical director of the short-lived Defense Health Agency (DHA) Transgender Health Center (TGHC). Via praised her as a great asset to both DHA and Navy medicine in a nomination letter shared with Times of San Diego.

As she began attending meetings and taking virtual patients, Janelle Marra’s LinkedIn page reflected her role.

The Trump administration enacted a transgender military ban to start the year, but never formally dissolved the center.

“She did the job for a year and a half,” Cassandra Marra said. “She did that job. They never got around to giving her a formal recognition of the job, because it fairly quickly became the turnaround between presidents and they also never told her to not do the job. So she was in this position where she was like, ‘Okay, I’m just going to keep doing this job that they told me that I needed to do.’”

That came to the attention of podcaster Chase Spears, who posted a screenshot of Janelle Marra’s LinkedIn page to X on Sept. 4 with the caption, “DEI isn’t fully dead yet.” He highlighted her focus on LGBTQ+ and transgender healthcare, and the fact she filled out the pronouns field on the social media site. In her profile picture, she is in uniform, and her cover photo is of a Pride flag.

Popular right-wing account Libs of Tik Tok picked up the post, tagging Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The Libs of Tik Tok account regularly posts anti-LGBTQ+ messages, and frequently share the social media handles, name and identifying information of LGBTQ+ people who then face threats and harassment from the account’s followers.

Within the day, Hegseth reposted the Libs of Tik Tok post, with the quip, “Pronouns UPDATED: She/Her/Fired.”

Online threats spill over into real world

Soon, death threats started rolling in. Among them, the 17-year active duty Navy doctor was told she should be executed by firing squad. The threats were credible enough the military insisted the family report them to the county sheriff to get extra patrols on their street.

Family photos surfaced with their two children. The gay parents were accused of being groomers and pedophiles.

“I’m sure that there are people trying to ensure that we don’t have our kids anymore,” Cassandra Marra said. “That’s one of my greatest fears; my children are my everything.”

The couple has experienced anxiety and depression in the two weeks since the post and leadership change. They have trouble sleeping amid the death threats. Their 7-year-old son is upset about the situation despite not being able to fully comprehend it.

Janelle Marra has not been fired yet. She has been removed from all her leadership roles and is still seeing patients while under investigation for violating social media rules.

Cassandra Marra said she long ago learned to ignore homophobia, but the family would be in financial trouble if her wife is fired. They would lose health insurance for their children, who are diagnosed with autism, and possibly the pension her wife has earned during her 17-year career.

“The real world consequences are definitely much more draining on you than the people accusing you of something,” Cassandra Marra said,

Two weeks later, the Libs of Tik Tok post has nearly 11 million views, thousands of likes and reposts, and hundreds of comments.

“She’s not the first person that this was done to,” Cassandra Marra said “She’s just the first person that has had it so public and so loud. There have been other people removed from their positions.”

She fears the implications if the public tolerates a Naval officer being fired over a social media campaign.

“I love my country and I want better for it,” Cassandra Marra said. “And if nobody speaks out, if nobody says this is wrong, then we’re never going to go in the direction that we need to go.”",https://i0.wp.com/timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Naval-Medical-Center-San-Diego.jpg?fit=720%2C540&ssl=1,N,0.0,2025-09-23 11:56:23.372238

Omnicare filed more than 3.3 million false claims between 2010 and 2018, in violation of the False Claims Act, according to court documents.
The Chapter 11 agreement is for $110 million in debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing.

A federal judge in July determined that Omnicare had illegally charged the U.S. government for prescription drugs and ordered it to pay more than $948 million in damages and penalties. Omnicare filed more than 3.3 million false claims between 2010 and 2018, in violation of the False Claims Act, according to court documents.

The original lawsuit had been filed by a former Omnicare pharmacist, who had accused the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) of improperly billing Medicare, Medicaid and the Tricare military program for more than $135 million in drugs that weren’t covered.

The Chapter 11 agreement is for $110 million in debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing. Once the court gives the go-ahead, the company expects the financing to provide enough liquidity for it to meet its ongoing business obligations during the process.

Omnicare said it will use the Chapter 11 process to address other financial challenges facing the long-term care pharmacy industry and will potentially mull restructuring options. That could include anything from standalone restructuring to outright sale.

The company said it will seek authorization from the court to continue its operations during the Chapter 11 proceedings. To that end, it said it would meet its commitment to stakeholders, including continuing to pay for employee wages and benefits.

Omnicare said it also expects to pay vendors and suppliers in full, under normal terms, for goods and services.",http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/hfn/files/2025-09/lawsuit_legal_lawyers_judge_fraud_Pichsakul%20Promrungsee_%20EyeEm_Getty%20Images_5_0.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-23 11:56:34.263589

The business is entering into Ch. 11 bankruptcy proceedings in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas.

Omnicare is estimated to have between 200 and 999 creditors.

Omnicare has arranged $110 million of debtor-in-possession financing, which the company’s leaders expect will provide “sufficient liquidity” to stay in business, according to a press release. Omnicare has also asked the court to continue operations throughout its bankruptcy process, including paying employee wages and benefits.

“During the court-supervised process, Omnicare is continuing to provide safe and reliable pharmacy services to long-term care facilities. Omnicare customers and patients can expect to continue to access pharmacy and clinical services without disruption,” a representative for Omnicare said in a statement to Senior Housing News Monday.

Omnicare declined to comment on how many customers it has.

The company’s chapter 11 filing is linked to recent litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

In April, Omnicare was found liable for improperly billing the United States government, resulting in $135 million in damages in “one of the largest damages verdicts rendered by a jury in a False Claims Act case,” according to the U.S. Dept. of Justice.

Omnicare was found to have distributed drugs that were not supported by valid prescriptions under state law between 2010 and 2018 and billed Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE. In July, a judge ordered Omnicare to pay $948.8 million in penalties and damages.

David Azzolina, president of Omnicare, said the district court imposed “an extreme and … unconstitutional penalty.”

“Omnicare has been engaged in a civil lawsuit alleging technical violations of pharmacy law based on practices the government knew about and approved,” Azzolina said. “There were no allegations of harm to any Omnicare patients nor did the government allege that any patient got anything other than the medicine they needed when they needed it.”

The chapter 11 bankruptcy filing and related cases are just the latest setbacks for the long-term care pharmacy. In 2022, CVS noted that its long-term care services business line “was no longer a strategic asset” and the company explored selling it. But the company halted its sale exploration in 2023 after determining the pharmacy’s value to CVS exceeded what the company would get in a sale.",https://seniorhousingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/SHN-Facebook-Share-Size.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-23 13:56:19.323575

“As nurses, high reliability is at the core of everything we do to bring care to military families.
“The way we reach high reliability may look different across teams or specialties.
That shared focus helps us deliver the safest, highest-quality care for every patient.” DHA’s journey toward high reliability is deeply connected to its leadership.","Becoming a high-reliability organization, or HRO, is a major goal for complex health systems. Achieving this goal means focusing on safety and minimizing errors across all Defense Health Agency military hospitals and clinics. It also requires strong, active leadership.

“Our strong focus on high reliability is more than just a clinical aim; it’s a critical mission,” said Deputy Assistant Director for Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer of DHA Dr. Paul Cordts. “It starts and ends with our leaders. We must show our commitment to zero preventable harm and build a culture where safety is everyone’s personal duty.”

How leaders build a culture of high reliability

In HROs, leaders make safety a top priority. They support continuous learning and push for innovation and growth. They create a shared vision for safer care, and they take personal responsibility for shaping the work culture. So, what does this look like in practice?

“As nurses, high reliability is at the core of everything we do to bring care to military families. Strong, caring leadership builds trust and contributes to a culture of safety. It gives our front-line staff the confidence to speak up and make changes that can save lives,” DHA Chief Nursing Officer Dr. Kristen Atterbury explained.

Leaders foster this kind of culture through clear and consistent actions. They follow key habits and values, including:

• Modeling principles: Demonstrate ready, reliable care principles in how you approach your daily work.

• Integrating safety and quality: Make safety and quality part of every task and goal.

• Fostering trust: Build trust by being open, listening closely, and giving honest feedback.

• Championing a just culture: Support a fair system where people are held accountable in a balanced way.

• Leveraging expertise: Use everyone’s skills and knowledge, no matter their role or rank.

• Ensuring psychological safety: Make sure staff know they can speak up about risks without fear of punishment.

• Empowering through resources: Give people the tools and training they need to improve how they work.

• Celebrating progress: Set up ways to thank staff and celebrate their success.

• Fostering a supportive environment: Create a workplace where people grow, and teams do their best work.

These habits help turn big ideas into daily actions. That’s essential for any organization working to become a true HRO.

“The way we reach high reliability may look different across teams or specialties. That’s OK,” said DHA Chief Dental Officer Air Force Col. (Dr.) Donald Sheets. “What matters is that we share one vision — from our top leaders to our newest staff. That shared focus helps us deliver the safest, highest-quality care for every patient.”

DHA’s journey toward high reliability is deeply connected to its leadership. By following the ready, reliable care principles, building trust, empowering teams, and keeping safety at the center, leaders help turn goals into real, lasting change. And that work leads us closer to one clear, critical goal: zero preventable harm across all care settings.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2509/9322051/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-22 16:56:18.431532

The delegation included TAMC Commander, Col. William Bimson, U.S. Army; U.S. Indo-Pacific Command Surgeon Capt. Peter Roberts, U.S. Navy; and Surgeon Vice Adm. Arti Sarin, Indian Navy; along with other staff members.

The tour provided a comprehensive overview of the hospital’s medical training programs, showcasing the full spectrum of medical education and operational capabilities at TAMC. The engagement aims to foster interoperability and build a stronger foundation for future U.S.-India collaboration in military healthcare.

The tour began with a historical overview of TAMC, featuring photographs of its construction and development. The delegation then visited the Ruth Andrews Simulation Center, where staff showcased the facility and discussed the medical competency assessment program and general medical education capstone requirements. These programs effectively train soldiers and prepare them for deployment by emphasizing realistic scenario-based training, advanced medical techniques, and a focus on adaptability in deployed environments.

Discussions also highlighted the challenges and successes of transitioning a peacetime healthcare system to a wartime footing. As explained by U.S. Army Col. Mitchell Hamele, Deputy Director of Academics, Research, and Training, and U.S. Army Lt. Col. Zachary Bevis, Program Director of the Tripler Family Medicine Residency, “We were able to share both challenges and areas of success in preparing a peacetime healthcare system to be able to rapidly transition to wartime footing with medical personnel trained to operate above their peacetime skill set in resource-limited environments.”

The delegation also toured the Brace Shop (Orthotics and Prosthetic Services), learning about the care provided to Soldiers and their families. They received an overview of the Interdisciplinary Pain Management Center (IPMC) and its innovative approach to managing pain and care techniques.

During lunch, the delegation discussed the Certified Nurse Transition Program (CNTP) and its contribution to Army readiness. Further discussion centered on TAMC’s role as a key medical asset supporting joint operations in the Indo-Pacific region, and TAMC’s integration within the Defense Health Agency’s standardized systems for medical care, resource management, and ultimately, strengthening the Military Health System.

The visit to TAMC concluded a comprehensive, multi-site engagement for the Indian delegation, offering a broad overview of U.S. military medical capabilities. The delegation’s tour encompassed key installations across the Indo-Pacific region and the continental United States. Further engagements in Washington, D.C., included visits to Health Affairs, Defense Health Agency, Uniformed Services University, and Walter Reed Institute of Research.

The comprehensive tour provided a holistic view of U.S. military medical capabilities, fostering valuable discussions on best practices, interoperability, and opportunities for strengthened collaboration between the two nations’ medical forces.

TAMC serves as the Department of Defense’s premier medical center in the Pacific Basin, providing comprehensive tertiary care to a diverse and geographically dispersed population.

Matter of: Defense Health Agency—Payment of Conference Costs under a Continuing Resolution

File: B-336934

Date: September 22, 2025

DIGEST

A certifying officer asks whether the Defense Health Agency (DHA) could use amounts appropriated to its Operations and Maintenance (O&M) appropriations account under a continuing resolution to cover the registration costs of a training event held after the continuing resolution’s end date. The continuing resolution contained standard provisions that meant the funds appropriated by the continuing resolution to DHA’s O&M appropriations account were available for fiscal year (FY) 2025.

The bona fide needs statute provides that a fixed-period appropriation is only available to fulfill a genuine need of the appropriation’s period of availability. The training at issue was a legitimate agency need of FY 2025. During the pendency of the continuing resolution, DHA’s O&M appropriations were available for all of its FY 2025 needs, not only the needs of the time period of the continuing resolution. Therefore, DHA would comply with the bona fide needs statute for incurring obligations for the costs of this training during the continuing resolution, even though the training took place after the continuing resolution ended.

DECISION

A Defense Health Agency (DHA) certifying officer requests our decision under 31 U.S.C. § 3529 on whether DHA could obligate amounts appropriated under a continuing resolution for the registration costs of a training held after the resolution expired.[1]

In accordance with our regular practice, we contacted DHA to seek additional facts and its legal position on this matter.[2] DHA responded with information and its views on this matter.[3]

BACKGROUND

Continuing Resolution

On September 26, 2024, Congress enacted a continuing resolution, which provided appropriations to DHA.[4] The continuing resolution incorporated several standard provisions, three of which are relevant here.[5]

Section 101 of the continuing resolution appropriated fiscal year (FY) 2025 amounts at a “rate for operations” and under the authority and conditions as provided in FY 2024 appropriations acts.[6] Section 103 of the continuing resolution made amounts appropriated by section 101 available “to the extent and in the manner” provided by the pertinent FY 2024 appropriations acts.[7] Section 106 of the continuing resolution directed that all appropriations and authorities provided by the continuing resolution shall be available until the first of three events occurs: the enactment of an appropriation for any project or activity provided for in the continuing resolution; the enactment of an FY 2025 appropriation that does not provide funding for a project or activity provided for in the continuing resolution; or December 20, 2024.[8]

At issue here are amounts appropriated by section 101 of the continuing resolution to DHA’s Operations and Maintenance (O&M) appropriations account.[9] The FY 2024 Appropriations Act provided $36.6 billion in FY 2024 funds to this account, with not to exceed one percent of that amount remaining available through FY 2025.[10] In other words, the act provided funds to DHA for the current fiscal year, and made available for obligation a small portion of those funds for an additional fiscal year.

Training for Medical Professionals

In November 2024, DHA staff sought to process training authorization forms for personnel to attend training for certain medical professionals. The event at issue here was scheduled for March 2025 (March training), and the purpose of it was to strengthen warfighter healthcare operations.[11] Attendees could earn 27 continuing medical education credit hours for attending the training.[12]

According to DHA, the deadline to secure a discounted rate for the March training was November 15, 2024, and DHA would charge the cost to its O&M appropriations account.[13] On November 18, 2024, a DHA component said it could not process the registrations under the continuing resolution.[14]

DISCUSSION

At issue here is whether DHA could obligate funds appropriated by section 101 of the continuing resolution to its O&M appropriations account to cover the registration costs of the March meeting.

Period of Availability of Appropriations Provided by the Continuing Resolution

First, we address the period of availability of appropriations provided to DHA’s O&M appropriations account by the continuing resolution. As explained below, appropriations provided by section 101 of the continuing resolution retain their period of availability from the prior year’s appropriations act only while the continuing resolution is in effect, unless otherwise specified.

As a general matter, continuing resolutions are temporary stop-gap measures intended to keep existing federal programs functioning after the prior year’s appropriations act expires and regular appropriations are not yet in place.[15] Relatedly, continuing resolutions have a limited duration. To this end, continuing resolutions have an end date.[16] After that date passes, if the continuing resolution has not been extended or a full-year appropriations act is not enacted, the funds provided by the continuing resolution are no longer available to incur new obligations.[17]

In addition, continuing resolutions include standard provisions that, when read together, continue the appropriations and authorities of the prior year’s appropriations act. Relevant here, one standard provision—section 101 of the continuing resolution—appropriates “[s]uch amounts as may be necessary, at a rate for operations as provided in the applicable appropriations Acts for fiscal year 2024 and under the authority and conditions provided in such Acts, for continuing projects or activities (including the costs of direct loans and loan guarantees) that are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Act, that were conducted in fiscal year 2024. . . .”[18] In general, this provision appropriates amounts at the levels provided in the FY 2024 Appropriations Act.[19]

Another standard provision of the continuing resolution provides that “appropriations made by section 101 shall be available to the extent and in the manner that would be provided by the pertinent appropriations Act.”[20] When read in conjunction, these provisions provide that appropriations made by section 101 of the continuing resolution are provided at the same amount and for the same period of availability as funds that were provided in the FY 2024 Appropriations Act. Therefore, the continuing resolution, which expired on December 20, 2024, provided $36.6 billion in FY 2025 funds to DHA’s O&M appropriations account, with one percent of such amount available for FYs 2025 and 2026.

Bona Fide Needs Statute

The bona fide needs statute provides that a time-limited appropriation is only available to meet a genuine, or bona fide, need arising during the appropriation’s period of availability.[21] An agency may not use an appropriation for obligations incurred after the appropriation expires, unless otherwise provided.[22]

As explained above, amounts made available to DHA’s O&M appropriations account by the continuing resolution were available for FY 2025, with a small portion available through 2026. Therefore, these amounts were available for the bona fide needs of the entirety of FY 2025, with a small portion also available for FY 2026 needs during the period the continuing resolution was in effect.

In previous decisions, we have held that training is generally a bona fide need of the fiscal year in which it is delivered.[23] Here, the March meeting took place in March 2025, which is in FY 2025. Because the training was delivered in FY 2025, it was a bona fide need of FY 2025 and should be charged to DHA appropriations available for such FY. In addition, registration occurred in November 2024, also in FY 2025, so the timing of the registration raises no bona fide need concerns, even though registration occurred during the period the continuing resolution was in effect. Therefore, DHA could validly incur and record an obligation for the March meeting in November 2024.

For these reasons, DHA would not violate the bona fide needs statute by incurring an obligation during the continuing resolution period against appropriations made by the continuing resolution to its O&M appropriations account.[24]

Antideficiency Act

We next consider whether DHA’s proposed obligation of funds would violate the Antideficiency Act. The Antideficiency Act, in pertinent part, prohibits government officials or employees from obligating or expending in excess or in advance of an appropriation unless otherwise authorized by law.[25]

Were DHA to have incurred the obligation at issue here before the continuing resolution expired, DHA would have used its O&M appropriations, which were available for FY 2025 needs. To the extent DHA had sufficient O&M appropriations available to cover the March meeting’s costs, this obligation would not be in excess or in advance of an appropriation, which the Antideficiency Act prohibits.

In the Request Letter, the certifying officer raised concerns that the registration fees do not satisfy “current CR exceptions not limited to life, health, and/or safety. . . .”[26] Assuming DHA had available funds in its O&M appropriations account to cover the registration costs at issue here, we need not consider whether DHA would have properly complied with the Antideficiency Act’s emergency exception, to determine whether DHA would have complied with the Antideficiency Act had it covered these costs.

CONCLUSION

DHA could obligate appropriations provided to its O&M appropriations account by the continuing resolution, with a termination date of December 20, 2024, in November 2024 for the registration costs of a meeting held in March 2025.",https://www.gao.gov/themes/custom/gao_uswds/dist/gao-img/gao-gov-icon-800-mod.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-22 12:56:24.490707

The good news? The TRICARE Dental Program covers emergency dental care, as noted in the TRICARE Dental Program Handbook. You’ll pay no cost-share for emergency dental services, no matter your pay grade or location.

“In any emergency, it’s important to act quickly,” said Douglas Elsesser, a program analyst with the Dental Program Branch of the TRICARE Health Plan at the Defense Health Agency. “With a bit of preparation and knowledge, you can do your best to keep any damage to a minimum”

Keep reading to learn how to prepare for dental emergencies and what to do when they happen.

What is a dental emergency?

A dental emergency requires immediate attention. You need emergency care if you have:

• Bleeding that won’t stop

• Pain that doesn’t get better with medication

• Broken facial bones

• Painful swelling in or around your mouth

• Gum infection with pain or swelling

• Knocked out or broken tooth

How to prepare

Keep your dentist’s contact information with you at all times. Many dentists have emergency numbers you can call after business hours.

Build a dental emergency kit with these items:

• Cotton balls and swabs

• Dental floss

• Dental mirror

• Latex or vinyl gloves

• Salt

• Cold compress

What to do

Call your dentist first. This is the most important step in any dental emergency. If you don’t have a dentist, use the Find a Dentist tool or go to an urgent care center or emergency room.

For severe tooth pain

1. Rinse your mouth with warm water.

2. Use dental floss to remove any stuck food.

3. Apply a cold compress to the outside of your mouth if you have swelling.

4. Take over-the-counter pain relievers.

For a cracked or broken tooth

1. Save any broken pieces and rinse them.

2. Rinse your mouth with warm water.

3. Apply gauze to bleeding areas for 10 minutes.

4. Use a cold compress on the outside of your mouth to reduce pain and swelling.

For a knocked-out tooth

1. Find the tooth and hold it by the crown.

2. Rinse the root gently with water.

3. Try to put the tooth back in its socket if possible.

4. If you can’t put it back, place it in a small container of milk or salt water.

5. See your dentist within one hour for the best chance of saving the tooth.

For mouth bleeding

1. Rinse with mild salt water.

2. Press a damp gauze on the bleeding spot for 15-20 minutes.

3. Hold a cold compress on the outside of your mouth for 5-10 minutes.

4. If bleeding persists, go to the emergency room immediately.

When it’s not an emergency

Some dental problems can wait for a regular appointment:

• Mild toothache

• Small chip or crack

• Broken braces (unless bleeding)

• Something stuck between teeth

• Minor cuts or sores

If you seek emergency dental care, but your dentist determines it’s not an emergency, you’ll pay the cost-shares for the care you receive.

For these issues, call your dentist to schedule an appointment during normal hours.

Emergency room or dentist?

For most dental emergencies like broken or knocked-out teeth, your dentist will treat you in his/her office. Go to the emergency room for serious injuries like broken facial bones.

Emergency rooms can give you pain medication and antibiotics, but they don’t do dental work like fillings or crowns. You’ll still need to see your dentist as soon as possible.

Dental emergencies need quick action. The faster you get help, the better your chances of saving your teeth and avoiding additional problems later. Remember:

1. Call your dentist.

2. Follow first aid steps until you can get professional care.

3. Don’t wait, prompt treatment prevents infection and tooth loss.
