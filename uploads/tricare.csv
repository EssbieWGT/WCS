“Although there are reports that predate these incidents, the media originally called these phenomena Havana Syndrome, as they were the first to garner public attention.
“The Department of Defense has begun reviewing applications by DoD personnel for payments pursuant to the Helping American Victims Afflicted by Neurological Attacks Act of 2021 (HAVANA Act),” chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement Friday.
The Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service (DCPAS) is responsible for administering the HAVANA Act-related payment program for the Pentagon.
“DCPAS will collect and review applications that have been submitted, using the DD Form 3220, ‘Eligibility Questionnaire for HAVANA Act Payments,’ claim form, to the HAVANA Act email address (dodhra.mc-alex.dcpas.mbx.dod-havana-act@mail.mil).","The Defense Department has started reviewing applications from personnel seeking financial compensation for brain health issues associated with the phenomenon known as Havana Syndrome, according to the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson.

The term Havana Syndrome was coined after people working at the U.S. Embassy in Cuba’s capital city in 2016 reported a sudden onset of symptoms that had no obvious cause, including vertigo, imbalance, blurry vision, tinnitus, headache, hearing loss, nausea and cognitive dysfunction.

“Although there are reports that predate these incidents, the media originally called these phenomena Havana Syndrome, as they were the first to garner public attention. Such events have affected U.S. government employees, military servicemembers, and their families in countries around the world, and are now referred to as anomalous health incidents (AHI) by the U.S. government,” the Government Accountability Office explained in a July 2024 report, which also highlighted challenges that sufferers faced in accessing the Military Health System.

Congress several years ago passed legislation that authorized federal agencies to compensate affected employees, former employees and dependents for qualifying brain injuries.

“The Department of Defense has begun reviewing applications by DoD personnel for payments pursuant to the Helping American Victims Afflicted by Neurological Attacks Act of 2021 (HAVANA Act),” chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement Friday.

“Under the HAVANA Act, DoD employees and their covered dependents who suffered qualifying brain injuries on or after January 1, 2016, in connection with certain Anomalous Health Incidents (AHI), are eligible for a one-time payment. The Department is committed to helping DoD personnel affected by AHIs,” he added.

A House Intelligence subcommittee report issued last December noted that Havana Syndrome incidents have also been reported in Austria, China, Colombia, Georgia, Germany, India, Poland, Russia and Vietnam, as well as the United States.

Estimates vary as to the number of individuals affected by the problem, GAO noted in last year’s report. As of January 2024, 334 people had qualified for care in the Military Health System, according to the government watchdog.

Some observers believe that incidents of Havana Syndrome may have been intentionally caused by adversaries using pulsed radio-frequency energy or focused ultrasound devices, but others are skeptical.

“Various government agencies and medical researchers have conducted studies on aspects of AHIs, but none have isolated a cause,” the GAO report stated.

A study by a panel of U.S. intelligence community experts — whose findings were declassified in 2022 — found that “known medical and environmental conditions, including psychosocial factors, could not explain some AHI cases with abrupt-onset, location dependent, audio-vestibular phenomena. It concluded that various forms of pulsed radiofrequency energy, as well as focused ultrasound in close access scenarios, were plausible explanations for these cases, though information gaps existed,” according to the GAO report, which noted that the experts “did not address the question of attribution to an actor, including the question of whether a foreign actor may be involved.”

Another IC assessment, released in March 2023, concluded it was “very unlikely” that a foreign adversary was responsible for the reported incidents, and that deliberate causal mechanisms were “very unlikely” to have produced the sensory phenomena and symptoms associated with them — although confidence levels in those conclusions varied among the IC agencies, per the GAO report.

Leadership of a GOP-led House Intelligence subcommittee criticized the 2023 IC assessment, saying it “lacked analytic integrity.”

“It appears increasingly likely and the Chairman is convinced that a foreign adversary is behind some AHIs,” officials wrote in a subcommittee report released in December 2024.

A former U.S. Army officer who led an official investigation told journalists from the show 60 Minutes that he believed Russia was behind attacks that caused Havana Syndrome symptoms, according to CBS News.

The Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service (DCPAS) is responsible for administering the HAVANA Act-related payment program for the Pentagon.

“DCPAS will collect and review applications that have been submitted, using the DD Form 3220, ‘Eligibility Questionnaire for HAVANA Act Payments,’ claim form, to the HAVANA Act email address (dodhra.mc-alex.dcpas.mbx.dod-havana-act@mail.mil). Individuals applying on behalf of a covered employee or covered dependent must provide documentation demonstrating the individual is authorized to act on behalf of the applicant,” Jules Hurst III, acting undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, wrote in a June 20 memo, which provides details about the adjudication, payment and appeals processes.

“DCPAS may consult with offices within the Office of the Secretary of Defense to determine whether the incident causing the injury was in connection with war, insurgency, hostile act, or terrorist activity. For applications involving incidents that have been designated by DoD as ‘other incidents’ … DCPAS will request that the applicant or Director, Defense Health Agency, provide a designation letter … to validate that an incident at a particular location has been reported and the covered employee or covered dependent is authorized to receive medical care from DoD in relation to the incident,” Hurst wrote in the memo.",https://defensescoop.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2020/06/6192861.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-14 15:56:25.587524

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: The TRICARE referral and authorization waiver for the West Region expired on June 30. Providers must now follow standard TRICARE requirements for all new outpatient services.

The U.S. Defense Health Agency has confirmed that the temporary waiver of referral and authorization requirements for TRICARE Prime beneficiaries in the West Region ended on June 30, 2025. As of July 1, 2025, all outpatient services for TRICARE Prime patients once again require appropriate referrals and authorizations in accordance with standard TRICARE guidelines.

The waiver was initially enacted to ease administrative burdens during the transition of managed care responsibilities to TriWest Healthcare Alliance (TriWest), which assumed management of TRICARE West Region services on January 1, 2025. Under the waiver, providers did not need to submit referral or authorization requests for TRICARE Prime patients seeking TRICARE-covered outpatient services, with some exceptions.

Referrals for care that extend beyond June 30, 2025, will need to follow the prior established TRICARE referral and authorization requirements and obtain approval to continue care after June 30. Referrals issued after June 30, 2025, will be subject to normal TRICARE referral and authorization requirements.

Providers are strongly encouraged to review the TriWest TRICARE Provider Handbook and referral protocols to avoid disruptions in care or reimbursement issues effective July 1.

I’m proud to help lead this effort, and I thank the Problem Solvers Caucus for endorsing this bipartisan solution.
The Problem Solvers Caucus gladly endorses this bill, and we’ll keep working across the aisle to help military families in whatever way we can,” said Problem Solvers Caucus Co-Chair Congressman Tom Suozzi (NY-03).
(link is external) ### The Problem Solvers Caucus is a group of Members of Congress — split between Republicans and Democrats — committed to advancing common-sense solutions to key issues facing our nation.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the Problem Solvers Caucus announced its endorsement of the TRICARE OB-GYN Treatment and Access without Lags in Care (TOTAL Care) Act, bipartisan legislation to make it easier for women enrolled in TRICARE Prime to access OB-GYN services.

Under current TRICARE Prime rules, beneficiaries must obtain a referral before visiting an OB-GYN, even for routine care like annual exams or prenatal appointments. This requirement often leads to delays and unnecessary administrative burdens for military families who already frequently face gaps in healthcare access due to relocations and deployments.

The TOTAL Care Act would remove outdated referral requirements for OB-GYN care under TRICARE Prime to ensure timely access to essential reproductive and maternal health services. Specifically, the bill would:

Allow TRICARE Prime beneficiaries to access OB-GYN care without a referral

Permit patients to designate an OB-GYN as a primary care provider

Allow OB-GYNs to directly order related services without extra approvals

The bipartisan legislation was introduced by Representatives Steven Horsford (NV-04), Maria Salazar (FL-27), and Chrissy Houlahan (PA-06) and has 12 additional cosponsors, four of whom are Members of the Problem Solvers Caucus. The bill was brought forward for Caucus endorsement by Representatives Horsford and Salazar.

“Ensuring military personnel and their loved ones have the best care available isn’t partisan politics – it’s common sense,” said Congressman Steven Horsford (NV-04). “I’m proud to partner with Rep. Salazar on the TOTAL Care Act, and I’m grateful for the Problem Solvers Caucus’ endorsement. Our legislation cuts through red tape to ensure servicemembers have access to the same, high-quality care that every other American has.”

""Our women in uniform risk their lives to defend this country, yet they’re forced to navigate unnecessary bureaucracy just to see an OB-GYN. That’s unacceptable,"" said Congresswoman María Salazar (FL-27). ""The TOTAL Care Act fixes that. I’m proud to help lead this effort, and I thank the Problem Solvers Caucus for endorsing this bipartisan solution. This is not a partisan issue, it’s about basic dignity, respect, and doing right by the servicewomen who fight for us. Together, we’re cutting the red tape and delivering the care they’ve earned.""

""OB-GYN care is primary care,” said Congresswoman Chrissy Houlahan (PA-06). “As a veteran, I am proud to stand with my colleagues to introduce this long overdue legislation to ensure our servicemembers and their families receive care in line with their civilian counterparts and without additional referrals or barriers. Servicemembers and their families should not be unfairly burdened simply because they raised their right hands in service. This bipartisan effort eliminates redundancy and delays and ensures access to critical women's healthcare.""

“Cutting down red tape to allow service members and their families easier access to critical care is a common sense fix. The Affordable Care Act got rid of the need for referrals for this kind of coverage years ago — leaving out members of our military is legislative oversight. The Problem Solvers Caucus gladly endorses this bill, and we’ll keep working across the aisle to help military families in whatever way we can,” said Problem Solvers Caucus Co-Chair Congressman Tom Suozzi (NY-03).

“The TOTAL Care Act is a smart, bipartisan fix that removes an outdated barrier to care and restores direct OB-GYN access for military families under TRICARE. It reflects exactly the kind of commonsense, patient-first reform I’ve long championed—cutting bureaucracy, improving care delivery, and ensuring our servicemembers and their families get the support they’ve earned,” said Problem Solvers Caucus Co-Chair Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01). “The Problem Solvers are proud to support this effort—and we’ll continue championing bipartisan solutions that ensure our military families receive the care, respect, and commitment their service has earned.”

Have you actually signed up for TRS through milconnect and been paying the premiums? It's not like Active Duty Tricare where you automatically get it, you have to sign up and pay the (very small) monthly premium to get coverage.

First figure out if you're in the West or East region.

Find a doctor in the West region

Find a doctor in the East region

You don't need a referral from a military doc, just find an in-network urologist in your region, call and make an appointment. Your health insurance card is your CAC and/or your SSN.

That said, you really need to go to the doctor more, at least to get an annual physical done. You might feel healthy now but you never know what a physical might catch, a lot of medical issues show no symptoms until they're severe, but easily treated if caught early. The copays are absurdly cheap and in my experience most clinics accept TRS.

You haven't been to the doctor and gotten an annual physical / check up? Or even gone to urgent care? If nothing else, I would highly recommend finding a primary family care doctor. Please get in the habit of preventative care.

Practically - you can go to your Tricare provider's website (mine is Triwest) and look up in network doctors. Or. start with the Tricare website and go from there. From there you can work out which hospitals / clinics / specialties are covered. I don't know if you need a referral for a urologist, but once you find out if they are in network you can call their office and find out.

But part of finding out who is in network will also let you know which urgent care / emergency room is in network so you don't need to stress about where you can go / who covers you when you actually need care in the moment.",,N,0.0,2025-07-14 16:56:16.176866

Charles Rhyee has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors that highlight Talkspace’s promising growth trajectory. The company is expected to achieve significant payor revenue growth, particularly with a 35% year-over-year increase, as it expands its Medicare and TRICARE contributions through 2025. Management has indicated that TRICARE is performing better than anticipated, benefiting from efficient marketing strategies and lower competition, which supports a positive outlook.

Furthermore, Talkspace’s strategic focus on enhancing utilization in the Payor segment is anticipated to yield returns on marketing investments in the latter half of 2025. The company has reaffirmed its revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance, with expectations of a stronger performance in the fourth quarter. This strategic positioning, along with the potential for revenue reacceleration, underpins Rhyee’s confidence in Talkspace’s future prospects, justifying the Buy rating.

This is a catch-all term so you might hear it used by providers to describe services, but it is also often used to describe state-run programs. Early Intervention is available in every US state and territory. These publicly funded programs provide services for free or at reduced cost for any child who is eligible.

Everyone is eligible to apply for early intervention services. The state-run program will perform an evaluation of your child’s skills and abilities to see what services they qualify for.

If you, your child’s doctor, or other care provider is concerned about your child’s development, ask to be connected with the local brand of your state’s early intervention program to find out if your child can get services to help. If your doctor is not able to connect you, you can reach out yourself. A doctor’s referral is not necessary.

Unfortunately, this process might take a while. You should expect to have to wait for the evaluation (possibly several weeks). Many early intervention programs have a waitlist because they don’t have enough staff to meet demand for services. However, if your child does qualify, you’ll be assigned a case manager who should help you navigate the program. This case manager will help you get started with services as soon as possible.

Janey Macey and Associates, a pediatric therapy clinic in Bossier City, faces serious operational challenges due to significant TRICARE payment delays. The clinic, which has provided services to military families for over twenty years, is at risk as they have not received payments for the first four months of 2025. Medical providers across Shreveport report similar issues, resulting in financial strain. Meanwhile, a federal grand jury has charged individuals in a bank fraud scheme, highlighting ongoing challenges for military families in the region.

Bossier City, Louisiana – A local pediatric therapy clinic, Janey Macey and Associates, is facing significant challenges due to delayed insurance payments from TRICARE. The clinic has served military families for over twenty years, specializing in behavioral therapy for children with autism. However, TRICARE has not processed any payments to the clinic in the first four months of 2025, putting its operations at risk.

Previously, Janey Macey and Associates could expect payments from TRICARE within two to three days after claims submission. The disruption in payments is attributed to Louisiana’s transition from the TRICARE East region to TRICARE West, which is managed by the TriWest Healthcare Alliance. Providers across Shreveport and the surrounding areas are reporting similar issues, with some clinics forced to close down or lay off staff due to the financial strain.

TriWest Healthcare Alliance has acknowledged the ongoing issues and has committed to processing outstanding claims. In an effort to improve operations, they are increasing staffing at their customer service center. The reaction from the clinics has been mixed, but after being featured in a KTBS interview regarding the payment delays, Janey Macey received its first payment of the year from TRICARE.

Aside from the complications faced by the pediatric therapy clinic, a separate legal issue has arisen in the Bossier City area. A federal grand jury in the Western District of Louisiana has charged twenty-one individuals in a bank fraud scheme targeting major institutions like USAA Bank, Chase Bank, and Navy Federal. The alleged conspiracy resulted in nearly $7 million being stolen through fraudulent activities from January 2021 to October 2022.

The scheme involved acquiring personal account information from employees of a call center and producing counterfeit checks. Co-conspirators primarily targeted older bank customers, who were less likely to monitor their accounts regularly. The fraudulent activities came to light due to numerous checks bouncing, prompting an investigation that involved multiple law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and the Secret Service.

The U.S. Attorney for the district highlighted the importance of safeguarding personal information to combat instances of fraud. As these investigations unfold, awareness of protection against identity theft is increasingly relevant, especially for vulnerable populations.

Additionally, a legislative change affecting military personnel has led to confusion regarding the financing of Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP) insurance. A recent interpretation of the Military Lending Act has prohibited the financing of GAP insurance, a product that can be beneficial to service members. This change poses new financial challenges for military families who total their vehicles, as they are still able to purchase this coverage outright but cannot finance it alongside their car loans.

These developments underscore the complexities and challenges facing military families in the region, both in terms of healthcare access and financial products. The pediatric therapy clinic’s situation reveals the critical need for reliable insurance processing, while the bank fraud case highlights ongoing issues of consumer protection and financial security.

In conclusion, the Bossier City pediatric therapy clinic and military families face significant hurdles as TRICARE payment delays threaten essential services. Meanwhile, a high-profile bank fraud case adds further strain to the community. Addressing these challenges will require concerted efforts from various stakeholders, including healthcare providers, insurance administrators, lawmakers, and community organizations.

The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine protects against measles as well as mumps and rubella.","JULY 12, 2025 – You may have heard about the ongoing measles outbreak in the U.S. As of July 8, there have been 1,288 confirmed cases in 2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While most of these cases are in Texas, cases have been rising across the country.

Anyone who isn’t protected against measles can get the illness—and children are especially at risk of getting seriously sick. You may be wondering how to keep your family safe.

“Measles is more than just a rash; it can lead to severe illness, and it’s extremely contagious—you can catch it just from being in the same room as an infected person,” explained Dr. Eric Deussing, Public Health Emergency Officer for the Defense Health Agency. “So, it’s important to take steps to keep you and your loved ones protected and learn how to recognize potential symptoms. Two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine provide the best protection against measles.”

Here’s what you need to know.

What is measles?

Measles is a highly contagious illness that can cause serious complications. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes—sometimes, this happens up to four days before they’re even showing symptoms.

People of any age can get serious cases of measles. But the following groups are at increased risk for complications:

Children younger than age 5

Adults older than age 20

Pregnant women

People with weakened immune systems

Recognizing measles signs and symptoms

Measles symptoms usually appear between seven and 14 days after infection.

Initial symptoms typically include:

High fever (sometimes above 104 degrees)

Cough

Runny nose

Red, watery eyes

Two to three days after the start of symptoms, you may see tiny white spots (Koplik spots) in your mouth.

In three to five days, you may develop the measles rash—flat red spots that usually start on the face, and then spread down the body towards the feet.

Common complications of measles are ear infections and diarrhea. More severe complications can include pneumonia, swelling of the brain, and other conditions that can lead to hospitalization.

Are you or a family member showing signs of measles? Call the Military Health System Nurse Advice Line at 800-TRICARE (874-2273). Describe your symptoms to a registered nurse, who can advise you on what to do next.

Preventing measles

Your best defense against measles is getting vaccinated. Most people who got their vaccination have protection against measles for life, as described by the CDC.

The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine protects against measles as well as mumps and rubella. This vaccine is available to those older than 12 months old.

The measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella, or MMRV, vaccine protects against these illnesses as well as chickenpox. This vaccine is only available to children 12 months old through 12 years old.

Both the MMR and MMRV vaccines are administered in two doses. Children under age 12 should get the first dose between 12 and 15 months old, and the second between 4 and 6 years old. (Children may also get the MMRV second dose three months after the first dose.)

Older children, teenagers, and adults should get one or two doses of the MMR vaccine if they don’t have evidence of immunity. (Note: You’re considered immune if you were born before 1957, since it’s likely you were infected naturally.) Doses should be given at least 28 days apart.

TRICARE covers age-appropriate doses of these vaccines, as recommended by the CDC. You don’t need a referral or other approval to get these vaccines. As described in the TRICARE Pharmacy Program Handbook, you can get these vaccines at no cost, as long as you:

Go to a military hospital or clinic

Go to a TRICARE retail network pharmacy. Make sure the person who gives you the vaccine is a pharmacist. If another type of provider gives you a vaccine at a retail pharmacy, you may have out-of-pocket costs.

See a TRICARE-authorized civilian provider. However, if you get other services at the same time, you may have to pay copayments or cost-shares. These costs vary based on your health plan.

If you live overseas, you can get vaccinated at your local military hospital or clinic or by a TRICARE-authorized civilian provider.

Do you have more questions about the measles or getting an MMR or MMRV vaccine for yourself or your child? Talk to your healthcare provider or contact the MHS Nurse Advice Line.",https://www.militaryspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/TRICARE-measles.png,N,,2025-07-12 02:56:12.676356

REF F IS THE DOD IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE FOR MANAGING BRAIN HEALTH RISKS FOR

BLAST OVERPRESSURE//

RMKS/1. The Department of the Navy (DON) remains committed to the health and

safety of our Sailors and Marines. Decades of combat operations have taught

us that some injuries particularly to the brain may not be immediately

apparent and repeated exposure to certain conditions can have cumulative

effects. The science surrounding these exposures continues to evolve, and we

recognize a strong relationship between Blast Overpressure (BOP) and the

Warfighter Brain Health (WBH).

2. As discussed in reference (a), the WBH Initiative addresses concussions

and other forms of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). Brain injuries may result

from direct impacts, exposure to blasts or low-level blasts or operation of

certain weapons systems. BOP encompasses exposure to events that release

energy through multiple pathways (impulse noise, pressure waves, body

acceleration, and vibration), potentially causing injury. These exposures

may occur in combat, operational evolutions and training environments.

3. Managing risks related to BOP and WBH spans across operations, training,

safety, medical and information communities. Reference (b) establishes four

pounds per square inch (psi) as the action threshold for BOP exposure.

Per reference (c), the four psi action threshold is consistently reached or

exceeded by operators of shoulder- fired weapons. Other activities, such as

training involving detonations, have the potential to exceed four psi and may

amplify or prolong exposures of any level. Therefore, DON categorizes such

personnel as high risk based on the definition below, and these personnel

must complete a Cognitive Monitoring Program (CMP) baseline assessment by

September 30, 2025 as required by reference (b). The Department of Defense

(DoD) tool to complete a CMP baseline is the Automated Neuropsychological

Assessment Metrics.

a. High-risk is defined as all Active Component personnel assigned to

units where they will or are likely to engage in training or operational

activities that place them in the proximity of weapons systems recognized or

suspected to produce hazardous BOP exposures often within a 12-month period.

The term ""often"" means a more frequent or regular exposure, such as daily or

multiple times per week, with little variability. The term ""high-risk"" would

traditionally include those assigned to ""warfighter"" and training units.

4. All other DON active-duty military members must be baselined by September

30, 2027. These efforts are directly tied to overall force readiness.

5. CMP baseline assessments have been a longstanding pre- deployment

requirement per references (d) and (e), though previously, shipboard

personnel were exempt. Reference (b) rescinds that exemption. Currently,

baseline assessment capabilities exist at several locations, including Camp

Lejeune, Camp Pendleton and Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine

Palms. A complete list of all CMP testing sites can be found at:

https://esportal.med.navy.mil/bumed/rh/m3/M33/Pages/TBI.aspx.

As there are many additional sites being created across the DoD, this list

will be updated regularly.

6. Chief of Naval Operations and Commandant of the Marine Corps will:

a. Designate a Navy and a Marine Corps BOP Management Action Lead at the

O-7 level or above to be responsible and accountable for implementing BOP and

WBH requirements including those listed in the references. Notify Assistant

Secretary of the Navy for Energy, Installations, and Environment (ASN (EI&E))

via Memorandum of the BOP Management Action Lead designations no later than

July 24, 2025. ASN

(EI&E) will coordinate with the BOP Management Action Leads to ensure

implementation of all requirements.

7. The Management Action Leads for the Navy and the Marine Corps will ensure

that Commanders and Commanding Officers:

a. Leverage existing capabilities at installations conducting live-fire

activities to facilitate baseline cognitive assessments for personnel who are

deemed high-risk based on the guidance above.

b. Utilize remaining capabilities to assess personnel who are deemed

increased-risk based on the guidance above, followed by all remaining

personnel if resources are available.

c. Support the establishment of additional testing locations, including

but not limited to, providing physical space for testing sites (when

necessary) and identifying personnel who can serve as proctors for testing.

d. Direct exposed personnel to existing training sites as capacity

becomes available.

8. All DON personnel will:

a. Be vigilant for symptoms which may be attributable to exposure to BOP

in oneself and others. An excellent resource created by the Defense Health

Agency Traumatic Brain Injury Center of Excellence is the following:

https://health.mil/Reference-Center/Fact-Sheets/2024/10/16/Low-Level-BlastService-Members-Fact-Sheet

b. Promptly report suspected brain injuries to the cognizant medical

department and chain of command.

9. Every member of the DON is responsible for minimizing the risk of brain

injury. Through vigilance and proactive behavior, we strengthen our

collective ability to protect our mission and our people.

10. Our success depends on the commitment of every Sailor, Marine, civilian,

and contractor. Together, we will maintain a secure environment that

protects both mission accomplishment and the safety of our force.

11. Released by the Honorable John C. Phelan, Secretary of the Navy.//

Abbott’s TriClip G5 device, the only FDA-approved T-TEER device, will now be covered by Medicare, ensuring long-term, predictable access to a minimally invasive treatment option for eligible Medicare and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. This important decision marks a pivotal development in expanding access to a potentially lifesaving treatment for the approximately 1.6 million people in the U.S. with moderate or severe TR who currently have limited options.

For many patients who are not candidates for open-heart surgery, TriClip offers a path to significantly improved quality of life and a reduction in heart failure hospitalizations.

These plans serve active duty service members, National Guard and Reserve members, military retirees, and family members living overseas.

“Getting care while living overseas doesn’t have to be difficult,” said Michelle Donnelly, health system specialist, TRICARE Area Office – Latin America and Canada, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “It’s important to know which health plan options you’re eligible for, so you can ensure a smooth process for getting care.”

Here’s what you should know about getting and using TRICARE health plans overseas.

Plan options

TRICARE Prime plans for active duty families

There are two TRICARE Prime health plans for ADSMs and their command-sponsored family members overseas:

TRICARE Prime Overseas

TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas (only in overseas areas remote from a military hospital or clinic)

These plans work like health maintenance organizations in the U.S. You receive most of your health care from your primary care manager. For those enrolled in TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas, the overseas contractor, International SOS, serves as your PCM. Key features include:

No enrollment fees

No out-of-pocket costs when you visit your PCM

Possible additional costs if you see providers outside the TRICARE network

But there are different requirements for ADSMs and active duty family members:

ADSMs stationed overseas must use TRICARE Prime Overseas or TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas, as described in the TRICARE Overseas Program Handbook.

Eligible command-sponsored ADFMs can enroll in TRICARE Prime Overseas, TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas (based on your location), or TRICARE Select Overseas.

Families can split their coverage when some family members live in the U.S. and others live overseas. This allows each family member to have the most appropriate plan for their needs and location.

TRICARE Select plans

TRICARE Select Overseas is available to:

ADFMs

Retired service members and their family members

National Guard and Reserve members and their family members

Survivors of deceased service members

Medal of Honor recipients and their family members

Some former spouses who qualify for benefits

TRICARE Select plans typically allow you to visit health care providers of your choice. However, you should know that:

You need to pay for care at the time you receive it.

You must file claims for reimbursement.

Some countries have rules that might limit provider choice.

You don’t need referrals for most medical care with a TRICARE Select plan. However, some treatments and procedures need approval before you receive care. You might also have the option to get care at a military hospital or clinic if space is available.

Other TRICARE plan options

You or your family members may qualify for other TRICARE plans overseas. These other health coverage options include:

TRICARE For Life: For beneficiaries who have Medicare Part A and Part B

TRICARE Young Adult: For qualified adult children who have aged out of TRICARE

TRICARE Reserve Select: For Selected Reserve members and their family members

TRICARE Retired Reserve: For Retired Reserve members and their family members

National Guard and Reserve members can enroll in these plans at any time during the year. If you’re activated for more than 30 days, you automatically receive active duty health benefits.

How care overseas differs from care in the U.S.

Getting medical care overseas differs in several important ways from care in the U.S.:

You have three years to file claims for care received overseas, compared to one year in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and U.S. territories. Check out the TRICARE Newsroom to learn more about overseas claims and how TRICARE has improved overseas claims processing. Filing claims online through the TRICARE Overseas Program Beneficiary Secure Claims Portal gives you the fastest service.

Providers can charge more than the rates TRICARE has established as allowable. You’re must pay any costs above the TRICARE allowable charge.

Some services may need pre-authorization before you receive them.

If you live overseas, you may have access to some additional tools to help you get care. These include:

Beneficiary Support Center: The Beneficiary Support Center is available 24/7. They’ll connect you with telephonic language assistance, answer questions about enrollment, claims, and more. Call the TRICARE Overseas Program Regional Call Center to contact the BSC.

MyCare OverseasTM Beneficiary App: The MyCare OverseasTM app helps you access information about your health plan. You can explore your options for overseas providers, appointments, referrals, claims, and more. You can download the mobile app for free. Visit the International SOS website to learn more.

Near Patient Program: If you have TRICARE Prime Overseas or TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas, the NPP can help facilitate your health care in ten overseas locations. The program uses teams of in-country medical professionals who speak the local language to help you navigate your local health care system. If you aren’t in an NPP location, the TOP Regional Call Center can provide support. Visit the International SOS website to learn more.

Preparing to move overseas

If you receive orders overseas:

Complete a thorough health screening before your departure.

Update your personal address in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System after you’ve arrived at your overseas address.

Get recommended vaccinations.

Bring enough medication to last throughout your move and initial weeks.

Take care of routine health needs before moving overseas.

When you complete your permanent change of station overseas, you have 90 days to change your TRICARE health plan, as this counts as a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event. Update your personal address in DEERS after you’ve arrived at your overseas address.

Note: You need to see a certified or preferred provider if you live or travel in the Philippines. Use the Philippine Provider Search Tool to locate a provider near you.
