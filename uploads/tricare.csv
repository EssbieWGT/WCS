The settlement requires Bethany Medical Center, which operates 15 locations across the Triad, and founder Lenin Peters, M.D., to pay $8,828,890 to resolve allegations that they violated state and federal False Claims Acts by knowingly billing Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE for urine drug tests that were not medically necessary, according to the attorney general’s office.

The document outlines three lines of effort — combat support, care reattraction and enterprise services optimization.
The first line of effort — “preparing for war daily” — is aimed at ensuring medical teams can support troops in combat.
“Warfighter readiness is at the heart of DHA’s mission as a Combat Support Agency.
Reattracting beneficiaries with more complex medical conditions will increase the volume and the complexity of our health care services in our hospitals and clinics.","In fiscal 2026, the Defense Health Agency looks to strengthen its combat support role as well as bring more patients back into its military treatment facilities.

Acting Director David Smith outlined the plan in a message sent to the agency’s workforce in December, calling it a “mission-focused directive.”

“Our mission at the Defense Health Agency is to improve the health and readiness of the warfighters and support the Joint Staff, combatant commands and the military departments. This is our core purpose. In September, I shared that our headquarters leadership teams are focused on identifying opportunities to enhance value starting in fiscal year 2026. We have now developed a unified path forward to achieve this: the FY26 Mission Focused Directive,” Smith said.

The document outlines three lines of effort — combat support, care reattraction and enterprise services optimization.

A DHA official told Federal News Network the new framework is designed to reinforce the agency’s combat support mission, bring more patients back into military health facilities, which will improve its providers’ skills, and streamline the agency’s systems and processes.

The first line of effort — “preparing for war daily” — is aimed at ensuring medical teams can support troops in combat.

“Warfighter readiness is at the heart of DHA’s mission as a Combat Support Agency. It is the sacred responsibility of our medics to provide lifesaving care on and off the battlefield. Our strategic focus this year is driven by the need to provide unified, effective, and agile health services to enhance the operational readiness of the Joint Force, so we are prepared for war,” the DHA official said.

As part of that effort, the agency is focusing on improving how it manages critical blood supply assets, streamlining logistics for medical products and services and applying lessons learned from the battlefield through the Joint Trauma System.

The second line of effort — care reattraction — seeks to draw patients back into its military treatment facilities (MTFs) after years of shifting care to the private sector. The Defense Department’s ability to care for patients in its own medical facilities has declined sharply over the past two decades.

“DHA aims to re-attract and retain our beneficiaries in the Direct Care system (care delivered at our military medical treatment facilities), to include our beneficiaries over 65 years of age, as well as veteran patients, through high-quality, accessible care. Reattracting beneficiaries with more complex medical conditions will increase the volume and the complexity of our health care services in our hospitals and clinics. The work to support our older beneficiaries ensures our military providers maintain their skills and expertise to better serve all beneficiaries here in the U.S., overseas and in combat. These efforts will also allow us to provide high acuity care at maximum volume and capacity to enhance core operations at our readiness generating and patient reception facilities,” the DHA official said.

The third line of effort — enterprise services optimization — seeks to “streamline processes and leverage technology to improve efficiency and workforce effectiveness,” according to Smith.

The DHA official said the agency will work on reducing administrative burdens by “leveraging business intelligence, technology and innovation.”

“As we refine our governance structure to ensure data-driven decisions, agile resource allocation, and transparent accountability, we will be best positioned to achieve our mission,” the DHA official said.

As part of that push, the agency is developing a data strategy to transform data into a “trusted, mission-enabling strategic asset.” DHA is also creating a framework for the responsible and secure use of generative artificial intelligence.

The agency will also work with the Department of Veterans Affairs to help improve provider skills and fill care gaps.

The successful execution of the fiscal 2026 plan, the DHA official said, will ultimately depend “on the unity of effort across DHA to achieve our sacred responsibility as health care providers to deliver lifesaving care on and off the battlefield.”

“As we innovate, test, and adapt to new challenges, employees will have opportunities to enhance their skills and competencies, paving the way for career advancement. The biggest takeaway for DHA employees is that their individual contributions are not only valued but are essential to creating extraordinary healthcare experiences every day. By embracing this framework, employees can expect a supportive environment that fosters their growth while fulfilling our mission together,” the DHA official said.

Recently I turned 70 and am retiring effective Jan. 1. I have enrolled in a Medicare Supplement Plan G and Part D prescription drug plan that also begin January 1.

Now my Medicare stress has started, because I have received a notice from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) saying they do not have a record of me having prescription drug coverage that “met Medicare’s minimum standards” from March 1, 2019, when I turned 65, to Jan. 1, 2026, when I retired, and I may receive a Part D Late Enrollment Penalty (LEP).

I thought applying for Part B with the form from my employer kept me from this Part D penalty. Can you please advise me what to do to keep from making a mistake? Thank you, Toni. — Zach from Houston, Texas

Hi Zach: Many Americans retiring after 65 and leaving their employer health insurance plan are discovering that they have to prove they had “creditable drug coverage” when enrolling in their new Medicare Part D prescription drug plan.

Zach, enrolling properly in Medicare Part B does not prove that your employer’s group prescription drug plan was creditable. The 2026 Medicare & You handbook states on page 84 under “There are 3 ways to avoid paying a penalty:”

Get Medicare drug coverage (Part D) when you’re first eligible for it. “Even if you don’t take drugs now…consider joining a separate Medicare drug plan or a Medicare Advantage Plan with drug coverage to avoid a penalty.”

Add Medicare drug coverage (Part D) if you lose other creditable coverage. “Creditable prescription drug coverage could include drug coverage from a current or former employer or union, TRICARE, Indian Health Service, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Your plan must tell you each year if your non-Medicare drug coverage is creditable coverage. If you go 63 days or more in a row without Medicare drug coverage or other creditable prescription drug coverage, you may have to pay a penalty if you sign up for Medicare drug coverage later.”

Keep records showing when you had other creditable prescription drug coverage and tell your plan when they ask about it. “If you don’t tell your Part D plan about your previous creditable prescription drug coverage, you may have to pay a penalty for as long as you have Medicare drug coverage.”

Creditable drug coverage should “meet or exceed” Medicare’s Part D plan minimum. The minimum deductible for 2026 should not exceed $615. or less. The benefit amount should be unlimited, so if your plan has a coverage limit or cap, it is not creditable.

Discount prescription drug programs from Walmart, Kroger, GoodRx, Amazon pharmacy or your local pharmacy that offer low-cost generics do not count as creditable coverage.

Medicare can impose the Late Enrollment Penalty (LEP):

Your company prescription drug benefits are not considered creditable, as determined by Medicare.

You fail to call and confirm that your company prescription drug benefits were creditable, if requested via correspondence from your Part D plan. Zach, this is your Part D situation Don’t fail to confirm!

You had no creditable coverage and never enrolled in Medicare Part D when you were first eligible.

If you wait longer than 63 days without creditable prescription drug coverage when leaving company benefits and are older than 65 years and 90 days old, you may receive a late enrollment penalty. For 2026 the penalty is 1 percent of the national Part D average or $.39 for each month back to the month your Part A began, not from when your Part B begins.

The Patient Advocate Assistance Reporting Tool (PAART) is a standardized system to manage feedback reported to patient advocates. It replaces inconsistent legacy methods and gives patient advocates a new platform to collect, track, and resolve patient concerns.

Patient advocates are representatives who help patients with concerns or questions about services at military hospitals and clinics. The patient advocate office may be called Patient Relations or Customer Service at some military treatment facilities (MTFs).

""It's standardized and consistent,"" said Cmdr. Gabrielle Crane, USN, chief of the patient experience branch at the Defense Health Agency (DHA), in a Jan. 23 article regarding the launch. ""The old process was fragmented within each MTF, and patient advocates had differing processes for how they managed feedback. The new system is exciting because now it will be streamlined and provide transparency enterprise-wide.""

MOAA appreciates that PAART will improve consistency in data collection from patient advocates, but it is only a partial solution. We continue to urge Congress to expand digital problem reporting down to the patient level to ensure unfiltered patient feedback on access-to-care challenges.

[TAKE ACTION: Ask Your Lawmakers to Address MTF Access Problems]

Last year, MOAA’s efforts led to the introduction of the Military Care Access, Reporting, and Evaluation (CARE) Act (H.R. 6796), a bill that requires the Pentagon to provide a system that:

Establishes a standardized, user-friendly digital platform for beneficiaries to file and track complaints.

Requires real-time transmission of complaints to patient advocates for resolution.

Mandates quarterly aggregation of data to DHA and annual reports to Congress.

Creates transparency into systemic access issues such as specialty care delays, pediatric appointment shortages, and administrative burdens.

The Military CARE Act’s patient-level digital reporting platform will complement patient advocate data collected by PAART. Working together, the systems will provide insights across the MHS to ensure data-driven access-to-care improvements at military hospitals and clinics.",https://www.moaa.org/contentassets/0224e4f9f4764b9bb48d3d816732e13d/patient-advocates-h.jpg,N,0.0,2026-01-28 22:56:35.237893

MINNETONKA, Minn., Jan. 28, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Monteris Medical, the leader in minimally invasive neurosurgical technology with its NeuroBlate® System, proudly announces that TRICARE, the uniformed services healthcare program, now provides coverage for laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) for U.S. military members and their families. This milestone ensures TRICARE members have access to a proven, minimally invasive surgical option for those facing complex brain conditions, including primary and metastatic brain tumors, radiation necrosis and drug-resistant epilepsy.

This achievement follows a comprehensive advocacy effort led by Monteris Medical in collaboration with a consortium of more than 30 military and veteran service organizations representing over nine million members. Together, these efforts urged the Defense Health Agency to align TRICARE policy with Medicare and leading commercial insurers and highlighted the clinical evidence-based benefits and cost-effectiveness of LITT.

U.S. Representative Gen. Jack Berger (R-MI), who championed the coverage policy change, praised the collaboration.

""Military members, veterans and their families place their trust in the healthcare system during some of the most difficult moments of their lives – and they deserve access to leading-edge medical technology when they need it the most,"" said Rep. Bergman. ""Our military families deserve the best care available, and that includes access to minimally invasive brain surgery. This decision is a win for military medicine and a testament to what we can achieve when we put those serving our country first.""

LITT is a state-of-the-art, magnetic resonance (MR)-guided procedure that uses laser energy to ablate abnormal brain tissue through a small incision. Monteris Medical's NeuroBlate System is the only LITT system with a robotic platform and next-level surgical visualization of brain lesions, offering neurosurgeons exceptional precision and control. NeuroBlate evidence shows patient benefits include short hospitalization and quick recovery, low complications and outcomes equivalent to traditional resection – without the invasiveness and associated risks of open surgery.

""Laser ablation with NeuroBlate is a transformative option for patients with serious neurological conditions,"" said Martin J. Emerson, president and chief executive officer of Monteris Medical. ""We are honored to have worked alongside the military advocacy community and U.S. policymakers to ensure our nation's military and their families have access to this life-changing technology. This decision reflects a shared commitment to advancing care and honoring our service members.""

For those under TRICARE East, Humana plays a significant role, particularly in managing the network and providing essential services. It's not just about having insurance; it's about knowing how to access the care you need, when you need it.

Option Care Health, for instance, highlights its specialized infusion services for military active duty and their families. This points to a broader ecosystem of providers working within the TRICARE framework to offer targeted treatments, from IV antibiotics to oncology therapies. The emphasis is always on patient care, aiming to simplify the process and ensure comprehensive support for individuals and their doctors.

For those on TRICARE East, Humana Military is the entity that often comes to mind. They manage the network and provide resources to help beneficiaries navigate their benefits. Think about the TRICARE East app, which, as described, is designed to be a central hub for managing your health information. It allows you to check claims, view referrals and authorizations, and even access your Explanation of Benefits (EOB). This kind of digital tool is invaluable for staying on top of your healthcare details, from eligibility and Primary Care Manager (PCM) information to deductibles and payment history. It’s about putting control right into your hands.

Beyond the app, the process of finding authorized providers is crucial. Whether you're looking for routine care or specialized medical equipment, TRICARE has specific authorization standards. The reference material touches on how to find and evaluate these suppliers, emphasizing due diligence beyond just price. This involves looking at compliance, quality assurance, and reliability – especially important when sourcing medical equipment that needs to meet stringent military and Department of Defense requirements. Regions like Guangdong in China, or states like California in the U.S., are noted for their manufacturing capabilities and adherence to these standards, offering a range of options from diagnostic tools to patient monitoring systems.

Ultimately, whether you're utilizing a dedicated app, seeking specialized infusion services, or ensuring your medical equipment suppliers are TRICARE-authorized, the goal is seamless healthcare access. Humana's role within TRICARE East is to facilitate this, connecting beneficiaries with the necessary services and information to manage their health effectively. It’s a partnership aimed at providing peace of mind and robust care for those who serve.",https://www.oreateai.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a6p7qra6p7qra6p7.png,N,0.0,2026-01-28 10:56:47.992324

Forum participants ranged from commanders and leaders of fixed military medical facilities and operational medical units to senior representatives of the Defense Health Agency (DHA), Program Executive Office, Defense Healthcare Management Systems (PEO DHMS), and Geographic Combatant Commands. The three-day event aimed to operationalize data for medical organizations operating in, and supporting, the USEUCOM and USAFRICOM areas of responsibility.

The gathering of more than 100 senior U.S. military medical leaders engaged in a series of lengthy discussions designed to identify and explore gaps and barriers in medical data and information systems across the spectrum from fixed medical facilities at home station to the furthest point of injury on the battlefield. The forum focused on identifying gaps in data and information systems that support development of the medical layer of a common operating picture and informed military medical leader decision making during competition, crisis, and conflict environments. More importantly, the participants identified potential solutions to gaps and barriers and drafted a collaborative way ahead to address these issues.

“This year’s forum served as Phase 1 of a longer-term exercise we are calling Exercise Decisive Care,” said U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Roger Giraud, Commander of Medical Readiness Command, Europe and Director of Defense Health Network Europe. “We are losing the data war – full stop. However, by fostering this type of collaboration and communication, we have identified issues, developed potential solutions and have established a collaborative way ahead to regain momentum.”

The participation of Pat Flanders, Chief Information Officer (CIO) & Program Executive Officer for Medical Systems (PEO MS), DHA, and representatives from PEO DHMS were a key part of the discussion during the forum. Brig. Gen. Giraud conveyed his appreciation to Flanders and the PEO DHMS representatives for their support in developing concrete solutions to the gaps and issues identified during the forum.

“We are thankful to have the right people in the room to come together, share insights, and devise solutions to the challenges we face with respect to data and information management systems in the military medical enterprise,” added Giraud.

During his opening remarks, Giraud shared his vision and leadership philosophy with the assembled leaders and emphasized the importance of developing a shared understanding through teamwork and collaboration.

“My intent is that we continue to effectively plan, prepare, and execute our missions – on a continuum - for competition, crisis, and conflict,” said Giraud. “We will continue to provide high-quality healthcare in competition while maintaining readiness to immediately transition through crisis into conflict.”

Throughout the three-day forum, participants engaged in a series of lengthy discussions and presentations focusing on various aspects of the military medical enterprise to include improving the understanding of how data and analytics support timely, more informed decision making and capturing clear, actionable insights and sharing them across the larger military medical enterprise.

According to event planners, this forum will serve as a catalyst for long-term, positive change for medical data and information systems across the military medical infrastructure.

“The collaborative spirit fostered during these discussions underscores a shared commitment to excellence, ensuring that our servicemembers and their families receive the highest quality medical care regardless of where, and in what environment, they serve,” Giraud added. “The bottom line is this – we will win the data war. We have identified issues and drafted potential solutions and established effective partnerships with stakeholders at all levels. These conditions posture us to quickly achieve positive change. We refer to ourselves as Strong Medicine for a reason and we will continue to set the pace as we enable warfighting and care for our people.”

Event planners indicated that this forum will be followed by Phase 2 of Exercise Decisive Care this Spring where Team MED EUR-AF will take what was developed here and test the insights in an exercise environment.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2601/9489276/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2026-01-28 08:56:22.547870

Instead of reactive, episodic support, Foley realized mothers need preventative, wraparound care, meaning support before challenges escalate as well as continuous help once they are postpartum.
She says for military families, though, birthing and raising children away from family is not new; it is a long-standing way of life.
In response to the question, If postpartum support services were available, which would you find most beneficial?, “postpartum doula or caregiver support” topped the list.
It is a decision that could have significant implications for the postpartum care of military families.","After having her second child, Stephiney Foley didn’t recognize she was in the grips of postpartum depression until it all came to a head. Living in Seattle, away from her family, she struggled silently, even experiencing suicidal thoughts.

“I thought, ‘Oh, this is just motherhood.’ I think I just accepted the status quo of the difficulty of it,” said Foley, who served active duty in the Army from 2009 to 2016. “I didn’t even realize I needed help until it was too late.”

That experience reshaped her view of postpartum care. Instead of reactive, episodic support, Foley realized mothers need preventative, wraparound care, meaning support before challenges escalate as well as continuous help once they are postpartum.

She launched Yuzi Care in 2024, which began as a postnatal retreat near Seattle, a specialized getaway with continuous support from care professionals and a way to promote a restorative environment for healing in the weeks and months after birth.

‘Modern-day village’ — by algorithm

In an attempt to serve families on a larger scale, Foley’s venture has now pivoted from postnatal retreat to perinatal care platform. Yuzi Care now functions as a place where expecting parents enter their due date, location, budget and goals, and the platform’s algorithm generates a personalized care plan and connects them to vetted, certified providers. From doulas and lactation consultants to newborn care specialists and night nannies, Foley refers to this network of support as a “modern-day village,” a response to the growing reality that many parents are raising children far from their familial communities.

She says for military families, though, birthing and raising children away from family is not new; it is a long-standing way of life.

“We’re displaced from our natural support village,” Foley noted of military families.

To understand how this demographic of the population specifically fares in this landscape, Foley surveyed nearly 250 service members and their families about their postpartum-support needs. She received responses from enlisted and officer ranks from almost all military branches represented, along with military spouses. The data revealed systemic stress points.

“I think reading [the survey responses] made me realize that this problem requires really our policymakers and others really advocating for this and our military families to really stand up and ask for this type of care,” Foley said.

In response to the question, If postpartum support services were available, which would you find most beneficial?, “postpartum doula or caregiver support” topped the list.

Yet for many military families, access remains difficult, even with recent policy changes under TRICARE. Under the Childbirth and Breastfeeding Support Demonstration (CBSD), TRICARE covers some lactation specialists and birth doulas, but specific certification requirements must be met.

Foley and other military families argue that the coverage remains limited in scope and reach. Certified providers can be hard to find in some regions, and services are only covered when birth occurs outside a military hospital or clinic, which excludes many who deliver on installations.

For Amber Ortiz, an Army officer and mother of two, that gap was keenly felt. Her second child was delivered at a military installation hospital in a rural part of the country.

“I would have loved to have a nurse come to my house, to see my baby, to make sure we’re doing all the right things,” said Ortiz. “I see that those are benefits that civilian [insurance companies] pay for. I truly believe TRICARE can give us those benefits.”

Yuzi Care expansion

The CBSD runs through the end of 2026, at which time TRICARE will ultimately decide the future of these services. It is a decision that could have significant implications for the postpartum care of military families. In the meantime, Yuzi Care continues to grow. It is currently available in Washington state and soon expanding to Texas, a state with a sizable military population and notable maternal health needs.

Foley hopes that as Yuzi Care scales, it will not only directly support more expecting parents but also push policy and health systems to align around the wraparound care military families need and deserve.",https://militaryfamilies.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Yuzi-Postnatal-Retreat-Care-Team-with-Baby-Photo-Credit_-Anna-Nodolf.jpg-scaled.jpg,N,0.0,2026-01-28 08:56:26.713437

Effective Feb. 28, 2026, you’ll no longer pay a copayment when filling covered prescriptions. This copayment wavier applies to both retail network pharmacies and TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery. (Note: Active duty service members, including those with TPR, don’t pay copayments for covered drugs.)

“Now, active duty family members living far from a military hospital or clinic and enrolled in TPR won’t pay copayments for covered drugs,” said U.S. Public Health Service Cmdr. Teisha Robertson, Chief, Pharmacy Integration Branch at the Defense Health Agency. “This change will help military families without access to military pharmacies keep their pharmacy costs down.”

You don’t need to do anything for this change to take effect. You also won’t need to file your own claims for reimbursement. Starting Feb. 28, when you fill a covered drug at a retail network pharmacy or through home delivery, your copayment will automatically be $0. Are you searching for a retail network pharmacy near you? Check out the Find a Pharmacy Tool.

(Note: This copayment waiver doesn’t apply if you live overseas. Active duty family members enrolled in TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas will still pay the pharmacy copayment for the pharmacy option they use.)

All covered prescriptions are included in this copayment waiver. This includes:

Generic drugs

Brand-name drugs

Non-formulary drugs

Are you filling a non-formulary drug? You’ll need to get a medical necessity approval from Express Scripts. If you don’t get this medical necessity approval, you’ll need to fill the prescription at a retail pharmacy. You’ll be responsible for the full cost of the drug.

Do you take certain maintenance drugs? You’re still required to refill them through home delivery. (You can fill these prescriptions at a retail network pharmacy twice. But the third time, you’ll be responsible for 100% of the drug’s cost, as detailed in the TRICARE Pharmacy Program Handbook.)

Note: If you fill a non-covered drug, you’re responsible for the full cost. Other pharmacy rules, such as prior authorization requirements and medical necessity requirements, remain in place.

“TRICARE offers several ways to fill your prescriptions,” said Lt Col. Leighcraft Shakes, Deputy Chief, Pharmacy Benefit Integration Branch. “These options give you flexibility and allow you to pick what works best for you.”

Here’s what to expect when using your pharmacy benefit in 2026.

Pharmacy copayments are changing for most TRICARE beneficiaries in 2026.

What you pay depends on: • Your beneficiary category • What drug you need • Which pharmacy option you use.

Pick the best pharmacy option for you TRICARE offers four ways to fill your prescriptions. Each has different costs and benefits. Note that some prescription drugs may not be available at every pharmacy option. Some restrictions may apply when using home delivery or retail pharmacies overseas.

At military pharmacies, you can get up to a 90-day supply of most medications at no cost. Most take prescriptions from both civilian and military providers.

TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery is a good option for medications you take regularly. With free shipping and convenient ordering options—online, by phone, or by mail—managing your prescriptions is simple. You’ll receive order updates and refill reminders when you use home delivery. The service can even help renew expired prescriptions. TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery ships to any U.S. address. It also ships to U.S. territories, and APO/FPO addresses. You might not be able to use home delivery if you have other health insurance with drug coverage.

If Express Scripts also manages your OHI’s pharmacy home delivery, Express Scripts will coordinate your home delivery benefit.

You can fill prescriptions at TRICARE retail network pharmacies. Use the Find a Pharmacy Tool to find a nearby network pharmacy. Check out Pharmacy Costs to compare what you’ll pay at other pharmacies.

You may also fill prescriptions at TRICARE non-network pharmacies. If you use a non-network pharmacy, you’ll have to pay full price for your drug up front. Then you can file a claim. Reimbursements are subject to applicable deductibles, cost-shares, and copayments.

Take steps to safeguard your growing family Marriage is a major life milestone—and it’s also a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event.
Within 90 days from your date of marriage, add your spouse in DEERS and make any necessary changes to your TRICARE plan.","Getting married is an exciting milestone in your life! It’s also a time when many changes come along, including changes to your health coverage. Whether you’re a service member, a retiree, or marrying someone who is, it’s important to understand how marriage can affect your TRICARE eligibility and coverage.

“There is sometimes a misconception that TRICARE benefits will update automatically after you get married, but that’s not the case,” said Shane Pham, an analyst with TRICARE Policy and Programs at the Defense Health Agency. “If you don’t add your spouse to the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS), they won’t be able to use TRICARE. A small step makes a big difference.”

Marriage is a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event, meaning that you have 90 days from the date of marriage to make any changes to your TRICARE health plan. Spouses of service members are eligible for coverage, including active-duty spouses, retiree spouses, and National Guard and Reserve spouses.

Stepchildren are also eligible for TRICARE if the parent of the child and the sponsor are married. The sponsor doesn’t need to adopt the stepchildren. But if the sponsor does adopt stepchildren, they may be eligible to keep their TRICARE coverage even if their parent divorces the sponsor.

Update DEERS

After getting married, one of the most important steps is to update your information in DEERS in person. DEERS is a database that TRICARE uses to determine eligibility. You must update DEERS within 90 days of your marriage to make changes to your TRICARE plan.

Although there are many changes you can make online in DEERS, you must add your spouse in person. You can visit any Uniformed Services ID card office to add your spouse and any stepchildren to DEERS. Make sure that you bring your:

Marriage certificate

Spouse's birth certificate

Spouse's Social Security card

Spouse's photo ID

Choosing the right health plan for your family

Once you’ve added your spouse and any stepchildren to DEERS, you can enroll them in a TRICARE plan. The options available depend on your status and where you live. Options include:

TRICARE Prime

TRICARE Select

US Family Health Plan

TRICARE Prime Demo (available only in Atlanta, Georgia and Tampa, Florida areas)

TRICARE Select Overseas

TRICARE For Life (Note: Enrollment isn’t required for TFL. Your coverage is automatic if you have Medicare Part A and Part B and you’re eligible for TRICARE.)

For active-duty families, other options may include:

TRICARE Prime Remote

TRICARE Prime Overseas

TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas

If you and your spouse are both active-duty service members, you’ll each have your own DEERS profile. If you and your partner have children, you’ll need to choose one parent to be their sponsor in DEERS.

Dental coverage

Your spouse is also eligible for dental coverage. This isn’t automatically covered in TRICARE medical plans. As described in the TRICARE Dental Program Brochure, the TRICARE Dental Program is available for family members of active-duty service members (ADSMs), National Guard, and Reserve members. In some cases, retirees and their family members may be eligible for dental insurance through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP).

Vision options

Eligible beneficiaries who are enrolled in a TRICARE health plan can also enroll in a vision plan through FEDVIP. Eligible beneficiaries include:

Active-duty family members

National Guard and Reserve members and their family members

Retirees and their family members

When marriage may mean loss of coverage

In some cases, getting married may mean that you’ll lose TRICARE eligibility. In the following situations, getting married causes your eligibility to end:

A surviving (widowed) spouse remarries

A former spouse remarries

An adult child using TRICARE Young Adult gets married (unless they marry a service member)

If any of these applies to you or a family member, it’s important to plan ahead. Losing TRICARE eligibility means you’ll need to explore other health coverage options to avoid a gap in care.

Take steps to safeguard your growing family

Marriage is a major life milestone—and it’s also a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event. Within 90 days from your date of marriage, add your spouse in DEERS and make any necessary changes to your TRICARE plan. For more information, check out Marriage.

All counties are affected.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/find-pharmacy.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/notices/weather/2026-jan-22/state-emergency-alert-severe-weather-south-carolina for updates.

Contact: comms@ncdoj.gov

RALEIGH – Today, Attorney General Jeff Jackson announced Bethany Medical Center, P.A., a medical group with several locations in North Carolina, and its founder, Lenin Peters, M.D. have paid $8,828,890 to resolve allegations that they violated the North Carolina and Federal False Claims Acts by knowingly billing Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE for medically unnecessary urine drug tests.

This settlement resolves allegations that Bethany Medical Center’s founder, Lenin Peters, implemented and enforced the practice at Bethany to order monthly urine drug testing for opioid therapy patients regardless of individual need. The United States and North Carolina further allege that in the period from January 1, 2018, through July 31, 2023, Bethany billed government health care programs for urine drug testing for patients prescribed an opioid to treat chronic pain, disregarding individual patient needs for less frequent testing and failing to use the results of the tests to treat the patients.

“Patients deserve treatment that is tailored to their needs,” said Attorney General Jeff Jackson. “When providers ignore those needs and misuse taxpayer dollars, we will take action to hold them accountable.”

The settlement resolves allegations brought by a former employee of Bethany under the qui tam or whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act.

This settlement was obtained in collaboration with the United States Attorney’s Office Western District of North Carolina, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Defense Criminal Investigative Service.

The claims resolved by the settlement are allegations only. There has been no determination of liability.

About the Medicaid Investigations Division (MID)

The Attorney General’s MID investigates fraud and abuse by health care companies and providers, as well as patient abuse and neglect in facilities that are funded by Medicaid. Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that helps provide medical care for people with limited income. To date, the MID has recovered more than $1 billion in restitution and penalties for North Carolina.

MID receives 75 percent of its funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under a grant award totaling $8,535,748 for Federal fiscal year (FY) 2024. The remaining 25 percent, totaling $2,845,248, is funded by the State of North Carolina.

The trio of culinary experts will represent the state through food festivals and other community-driven events to highlight South Carolina’s deep culinary traditions, agricultural heritage and undiscovered places.

""I want both visitors and residents to understand that when they dine in South Carolina, they're not just enjoying a meal. They're experiencing a living heritage,” said Chef Guichard Ulysse.

The chefs are appointed by the governor, and the program is run through a collaborative effort between the South Carolina Department of Parks, Recreation & Tourism (SCPRT) and the South Carolina Department of Agriculture (SCDA).

The following three chefs were chosen to serve as ambassadors for 2026:

Jordan Heyd, owner and executive chef of Lekker Eats in Myrtle Beach

James London, owner and chef of Chubby Fish and Seahorse in Charleston

Guichard Ulysse, chef and owner of House 509 Bistro & Wine Bar in Greer

Veterans and survivors, through accounts supporting the VA.

Military construction, including facilities that support readiness and quality of life across military installations.

The Department of Commerce, which includes the NOAA Commissioned Corps.

[TAKE ACTION: Protect Servicemember Pay During Any Future Shutdown]

Communities Still Operating Under Temporary Funding

Other major parts of the uniformed services community are still operating under a continuing resolution (CR) because their FY 2026 appropriations bills have not been enacted.

These include:

The Department of War, which includes active duty military servicemembers, the National Guard and Reserve, and the civilian workforce responsible for supporting their readiness, training, and operations.

The Coast Guard, including pay, operations, and mission execution for Coast Guard personnel (operating under the Department of Homeland Security).

The U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS), whose commissioned officers support public health readiness and federal response missions (Operating under the Department of Health and Human Services).

MOAA’s Position and Mission

While continuing resolutions keep agencies operating in the short term, they do not provide the certainty or flexibility of full-year appropriations. Delays in completing the FY 2026 budget extend uncertainty for servicemembers, veterans, families, and the civilian workforce that supports the all-volunteer force — even as missions and commitments continue uninterrupted.

That is why legislation like the Shutdown Fairness Act is vital for protecting service-earned pay and benefits. It will ensure that members of the armed services, to include the reserve component, are paid during any future lapse in appropriations. Unfortunately, as written, the bill does not explicitly include members of the USPHS Commissioned Corps or the NOAA Commissioned Corps; MOAA is advocating for their addition before the bill moves to a vote.

TRICARE Pharmacy copays are outlined in federal statute. Congress provided the authority to reduce copays for TRICARE Prime Remote in the FY 2025 National Defense Authorization Act – the intent is to provide military families stationed remotely with zero-cost prescription medications similar to what is available to active duty families with access to a military treatment facility pharmacy.

TRICARE Prime Remote beneficiaries are still subject to TRICARE Pharmacy Program coverage policies. The Jan. 27 announcement included reminders about other steps eligible beneficiaries may need to take to avoid out-of-pocket costs for prescription medications:

Those using non-formulary drugs must secure approval from Express Scripts before filling the prescription. Otherwise, the beneficiary will be responsible for the full cost of the medication.

Those taking certain maintenance drugs must secure refills via home delivery to avoid paying full price for the medication. TRICARE will pay for only two refills obtained at a retail pharmacy.

Medical necessity and prior authorization requirements remain in place for TRICARE to cover any prescription costs.

OPMED’s Warfighter Protection and Acute Care Project Management team, in partnership with stakeholders across the Department of War and development industry, have worked to increase commercial availability of FDP during the past several years to fill critical capability gaps for frontline medical providers as they prepare for future conflicts in remote, austere environments like the Indo-Pacific and Arctic regions of the globe. As part of DHA, OPMED partners with stakeholders across the Joint Force to develop, acquire, and field medical devices, treatments, and frontline care solutions for military medical providers to fill capability gaps with the speed of relevance.

The battlefield of tomorrow demands medical innovations today, and within the Defense Health Agency, the Warfighter Protection and Acute Care project management office is at the forefront of this critical mission. Part of the Operational Medical Systems Program Management Office, WPAC is laser-focused on delivering medical solutions that empower warfighters to operate with confidence, even in the most austere and high-risk environments.

A significant thrust of WPAC’s efforts centers on delivering blood products to fill existing capability gaps for frontline providers across the Department of War. Recognizing that early transfusions of blood and blood components dramatically improve survival rates, WPAC is championing the development of easily deployable and shelf-stable blood treatments.

Freeze-Dried Plasma is a prime example. Plasma, blood’s liquid component, carries proteins that aid in blood clotting. It is vital to controlling and treating both external and internal blood loss caused by combat trauma. While lifesaving treatments for use at the front lines have increased survival rates exponentially since WWII, uncontrolled blood loss is the greatest determining factor when time and distance impede evacuation to higher levels of care.

FDP is a shelf-stable plasma designed for use in far-forward environments, potentially saving lives during future conflicts by enabling quicker access to this vital resource while simultaneously easing the logistical burden of transporting traditional blood products.

While FDP was initially developed as a U.S. Army program, the WPAC team has broadened the scope of its work to support the Joint Force. Following the realignment of OPMED under the Defense Health Agency in 2024, WPAC has been collaborating with stakeholders across the DoW to better meet the needs of each military branch and Combatant Command. Blood products remain at the top of the list of urgently needed solutions as warfighters continue to prepare for conflicts across the world, according to Lindsey Garver, Ph.D., WPAC’s deputy project manager.

“This process involved several big strategic meetings with key stakeholders to plan a concept of operations and determine quantities to meet the current and future needs of the service branches, Special Forces, and Combatant Commands,” said Garver.

In 2024, WPAC’s commercial partner, Octapharma USA, received U.S. Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization for its octaplasLG powder for use when no other blood replacement therapy is available during military operations. In addition to developing this interim solution, Garver noted, the WPAC team provided direct support to its military stakeholders over the past year to refine processes and strengthen lines of communication.

“To my knowledge, [FDP] is the first OPMED program requiring this level of coordination across so many organizations,” Garver said. “The validation of FDP as a solution to meet the needs of the Joint Force while partnering closely with end-user commands is really a testament to the importance of WPAC and OPMED as a force-enabler for frontline warfighters.”

FDP is a cost-effective, efficient, expeditionary solution to mitigate the challenges of time and distance found in places like the Indo-Pacific and Arctic regions of the globe, according to Andy Atkinson, the FDP product manager with WPAC.

“Blood products are a critical and urgent need across the [Department of War] and the service branches, and FDP is a game-changer to fill capability gaps at the front line,” said Atkinson. “Our focus has always been to enhance warfighter readiness and to provide a solution for military medical providers that works across the spectrum of conflict.

“FDP, because it is so user-friendly, portable, cost-effective, and shelf stable, is form-fitted for use by both conventional and special forces literally anywhere in the world,” he added. “[Blood products like FDP] are both urgently needed and in line with what our Joint Force partners need to save lives during future conflicts.”

The fix would eliminate the patient responsibility for a network facility fee copay in addition to the copay for an outpatient office visit. After the transition to a new TRICARE claims processor on Jan. 1, 2025, some beneficiaries were mistakenly charged both copays.

Thanks to beneficiaries who shared their explanation of benefits (EOB) documents with MOAA, we were able to verify this claims processing issue and escalate it to the TRICARE contractors for resolution. Inaccurate claims are being reprocessed to reflect $0 patient responsibility for the network facility fee in conjunction with a network outpatient visit.

Hospitals are allowed to charge patients a facility fee (on top of the charges for medical services) to help cover the high cost of running a hospital. Patients sometimes encounter facility fees when they receive outpatient care from a provider office attached to a hospital or medical center.

As hospitals buy up physician practices, urgent care centers, walk-in clinics, and standalone surgery centers, patients are more likely to encounter a facility fee even when they receive care outside the hospital setting.

The TRICARE copay construct, implemented in January 2018, rolled facility fees into the copay calculation for network outpatient visits. When a beneficiary has an outpatient visit, and both the provider and facility are in-network, the patient is responsible for only one copay for the office visit – there should be no copay for the facility fee.

Families with recurring medical appointments noticed the change – for specialty visits that include facility fees, Group A retiree families on TRICARE Select saw their out-of-pocket costs increase from $51 per visit to $102 with the addition of the facility fee copay.

Impacted claims are being reprocessed, and beneficiaries should expect to receive new EOBs for those visits that indicate $0 patient responsibility for the facility fee charge.

Please note that if the provider is non-network or the facility is non-network, the patient is responsible for a copay for the network portion of the visit and a percent cost share for the non-network portion of the visit.

Once TRICARE reprocesses claims, medical provider billing offices may proactively apply an account credit or send a refund if the patient already paid the mistaken facility fee copay. Alternatively, impacted patients can contact the provider’s billing office to request a refund – be sure to provide a copy of the revised EOB that shows the $0 patient responsibility for the facility fee.

“Now, active duty family members living far from a military hospital or clinic and enrolled in TPR won’t pay copayments for covered drugs,” said U.S. Public Health Service Cmdr. Teisha Robertson, Chief, Pharmacy Integration Branch at the Defense Health Agency. “This change will help military families without access to military pharmacies keep their pharmacy costs down.”

Non-formulary drugs

Are you filling a non-formulary drug? You’ll need to get a medical necessity approval from Express Scripts. If you don’t get this medical necessity approval, you’ll need to fill the prescription at a retail pharmacy. You’ll be responsible for the full cost of the drug.

Do you take certain maintenance drugs? You’re still required to refill them through home delivery. (You can fill these prescriptions at a retail network pharmacy twice. But the third time, you’ll be responsible for 100% of the drug’s cost, as detailed in the TRICARE Pharmacy Program Handbook.)

FALLS CHURCH, Virginia – The Defense Health Agency announced that TRICARE beneficiaries in New York may receive emergency prescription refills now through Feb. 2, due to severe weather.

All counties are affected.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/find-pharmacy.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/notices/weather/2026-jan-23/state-emergency-alert-severe-weather-kentucky page for updates.

The Defense Health Agency provides health services to 9.5 million beneficiaries, including uniformed service members, military retirees, and their families.

Healthy pregnancy, labor and delivery, basic baby care, breastfeeding, and sleep issues are some of the classes available for all Tricare beneficiaries, who live within 40 miles of Maxwell.

“We support the military community,” Pasko said. “If people are dealing with family challenges, have questions and concerns, such as a spouse feeling isolated, I can help. I’ve been able to help parents learn how to take care of themselves, their babies, their families and provide the support they need.”

There were 80 families from Maxwell participating in the program in 2025 and more than 6,711 in the entire Air Force.

For those interested, NPSP is available Monday through Friday 07:30-16:30. Participants can visit the office, attend classes, or also have nurse home visits for those living within 40 miles from base.",https://media.defense.gov/2026/Jan/26/2003866329/2000/2000/0/260112-F-XI916-1004.JPG,N,1.0,2026-01-27 11:56:52.812306

The Joint Commission is the nation’s oldest and largest accrediting body, evaluating health care organizations to promote continuous improvement and patient safety.
“Joint Commission standards provide the foundation for a proactive approach to patient safety,” Hall said.
“The principles behind Joint Commission accreditation emphasize leadership engagement, continuous improvement, and a strong culture of safety,” Hall said.
“Earning Joint Commission accreditation again shows that we care — about our patients, our staff, and our community,” Moore said.","FORT POLK, La. — Bayne-Jones Army Community Hospital has once again earned The Joint Commission’s Gold Seal of Approval®, reaffirming the hospital’s commitment to delivering safe, high-quality care to Soldiers, Families, and the Fort Polk community.

The Gold Seal of Approval is a nationally and internationally recognized symbol of quality that reflects a health care organization’s compliance with The Joint Commission’s rigorous performance standards. BJACH underwent a comprehensive on-site evaluation that examined patient care, clinical processes, safety practices, and organizational performance.

The Joint Commission is the nation’s oldest and largest accrediting body, evaluating health care organizations to promote continuous improvement and patient safety.

“This accreditation is an objective evaluation of our hospital’s performance,” said Ria Moore, a registered nurse and The Joint Commission coordinator for BJACH. “It demonstrates our unwavering commitment to providing safe, high-quality care to every patient. More importantly, it shows that quality and safety are not something we focus on only during a survey — they are part of what we do every day.”

BJACH is surveyed every three years; however, hospital leaders emphasize that quality and patient safety are sustained year-round. Accreditation standards are embedded into daily operations across inpatient, outpatient, ancillary, and administrative departments.

“To ensure continuous improvement, we’ve moved away from infrequent, paper-based exercises and toward a more automated, user-friendly approach,” Moore said. “We conduct regular patient-care reviews that follow care processes across departments, review data consistently, and address any breakdowns in care as they occur. This creates a culture where quality is everyone’s responsibility.”

Stacy Hall, a registered nurse and chief of clinical quality management for BJACH, said Joint Commission accreditation strengthens patient safety and risk management by reinforcing evidence-based practices throughout the hospital.

“Joint Commission standards provide the foundation for a proactive approach to patient safety,” Hall said. “They guide how we implement clinical practice guidelines, measure performance, and improve outcomes. By adhering to these standards, we promote consistent, high-quality care, stronger teamwork, and a safer environment for both patients and staff.”

Hall added that accreditation aligns with the Defense Health Agency’s focus on high-reliability health care and supports BJACH’s mission.

“The principles behind Joint Commission accreditation emphasize leadership engagement, continuous improvement, and a strong culture of safety,” Hall said. “Those principles guide how we care for our patients and support our staff every day.”

Col. Patrick W. Miller, hospital commander, said the achievement reflects BJACH’s values and the culture the team works to uphold every day.

“This accreditation is a testament to the professionalism and teamwork of our BJACH staff,” Miller said. “It reflects a culture rooted in caring for our patients, supporting one another, and remaining committed to providing safe, high-quality care for the Soldiers, Families, and community we serve.”

For patients and Families, the Gold Seal of Approval offers reassurance.

“When patients see the Gold Seal, they can be confident that BJACH has voluntarily undergone a rigorous evaluation and met the highest standards of care,” Moore said. “It reflects our promise to continually improve and to provide the best possible care to those who trust us with their health.”

Hospital leaders emphasized that accreditation is not simply about passing an inspection, but about accountability, transparency, and sustained excellence.

“Earning Joint Commission accreditation again shows that we care — about our patients, our staff, and our community,” Moore said. “We want to be better tomorrow than we were today.”",,N,0.0,2026-01-27 11:56:57.538471

Earlier this month, House Republicans launched an investigation into Omar’s finances.

The probe, first reported by the New York Post, is about how Omar’s household assets increased by a large amount during her time in office.

The Post said the lawyers are looking into on how Omar and her husband Tim Mynett ""went from nearly broke to being worth up to $30 million in just a year,"" citing disclosure documents from 2024.

Last month, Omar denied reports that she was a millionaire.

The department’s move follows the Pentagon’s decision to discontinue a Defense Health Agency contract for consulting services from Accenture, Deloitte, Booz Allen and other firms.
“Booz Allen has zero tolerance for violations of the law and operates under the highest ethical and professional guidelines.
When Littlejohn’s criminal conduct occurred more than five years ago, it was on government systems, not Booz Allen systems.
“Booz Allen fully supported the U.S. government in its investigation, and the government expressed gratitude for our assistance, which led to Littlejohn’s prosecution.","The Treasury Department on Monday said it would cancel 31 contracts with Booz Allen Hamilton, citing its failure to ” implement adequate safeguards” after a past employee leaked tax data, including President Trump’s returns, to media outlets.

The decision to cut ties with the company was due in part to the misconduct of Charles Edward Littlejohn, who stole and leaked the confidential tax returns of some of the country’s wealthiest people, ultimately impacting 406,000 taxpayers, the Treasury Department said in a release announcing the cancellations.

Littlejohn is a former IRS contractor who provided data to The New York Times and ProPublica from 2018-20, after figuring out how to extract tax data without raising internal flags. He was sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty to leaking tax information.

“Booz Allen failed to implement adequate safeguards to protect sensitive data, including the confidential taxpayer information it had access to through its contracts with the Internal Revenue Service,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in the statement.

Littlejohn disclosed more than a decade of tax returns for thousands of people, including Trump, whom the outlets said paid $750 in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017.

In total, the Booz Allen contracts were valued in $4.8 million in annual spending and $21 million in obligations, according to the Treasury.

The department’s move follows the Pentagon’s decision to discontinue a Defense Health Agency contract for consulting services from Accenture, Deloitte, Booz Allen and other firms.

Still, the company said it was “surprised” by the Treasury’s announcement to cancel all of its contracts.

“Booz Allen has zero tolerance for violations of the law and operates under the highest ethical and professional guidelines. When Littlejohn’s criminal conduct occurred more than five years ago, it was on government systems, not Booz Allen systems. Booz Allen stores no taxpayer data on its systems and has no ability to monitor activity on government networks,” a company spokesperson told The Hill.

“Booz Allen fully supported the U.S. government in its investigation, and the government expressed gratitude for our assistance, which led to Littlejohn’s prosecution. We were surprised by this announcement and look forward to discussing this matter with Treasury,” they added.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/AP24183698459537-e1748050878799.jpg?w=1280,N,0.0,2026-01-27 11:57:00.618273

The Patient Advocate Assistance Reporting Tool, or PAART, is the ""new standardized, enterprise-wide system that will manage all patient feedback that is received by the patient advocates at all of our military medical treatment facilities,"" said Cmdr.
The system was developed to replace inconsistent legacy methods and give patient advocates a new platform to efficiently collect, track, and resolve patient concerns.
Capturing the patient experience PAART is a web-based secure portal designed to collect a wide range of patient interactions, including concerns, complaints, and compliments.
The tool will be used by all patient advocates at the unit, facility, and network levels.","The Defense Health Agency implemented a new system for patient advocates to track and manage patient feedback across the Military Health System.

The Patient Advocate Assistance Reporting Tool, or PAART, is the ""new standardized, enterprise-wide system that will manage all patient feedback that is received by the patient advocates at all of our military medical treatment facilities,"" said Cmdr. Gabrielle Crane, chief of the patient experience branch at DHA.

The primary goal of PAART is to use patient feedback provided to drive improvements within military hospitals and clinics, Crane said. The system was developed to replace inconsistent legacy methods and give patient advocates a new platform to efficiently collect, track, and resolve patient concerns.

""It's standardized and consistent,"" she explained. ""The old process was fragmented within each MTF, and patient advocates had differing processes for how they managed feedback. The new system is exciting because now it will be streamlined and provide transparency enterprise-wide.""

For military hospital and clinic leadership, PAART will provide data across the MHS and make better decisions to ensure data-driven improvements — ultimately enhancing the overall patient experience and safety.

At the core of the new platform are the patient advocates who help patients navigate the MHS.

“An advocate is the shipmate, the battle buddy, and the wingman,"" said Crane. “PAART enables an advocate to document interactions and ensure warm handoffs and transfers to the appropriate person who can provide service recovery.""

Capturing the patient experience

PAART is a web-based secure portal designed to collect a wide range of patient interactions, including concerns, complaints, and compliments. Advocates can select preestablished fields including case date, type, location, and patient category.

The system categorizes cases by severity, which dictates the timeline for resolution:

Emergent cases, posing an immediate threat to life or safety, are flagged for immediate action.

Urgent cases, with a significant impact on health, have a 24-hour response time.

Routine cases are to be completed within 10 business days.

Crane noted PAART’s technology will flag cases to ensure meeting those windows, giving leaders ""at each level an awareness of those timelines and where we are in meeting them.""

The tool will be used by all patient advocates at the unit, facility, and network levels. Using the PAART system is mandatory for patient advocates — and a vital measure of effectiveness. PAART data can be used to analyze patient feedback and identify common trends, which ultimately assist in developing solutions as well as inform training programs for military hospital and clinic staff. The portal enables advocates to inform supervisors or military hospital and clinic leadership of concerns expressed by patients in their local area.

""It will allow us to see how we're doing across the entire system,"" Crane said. ""We will be able to identify which areas we can work on or which areas we can leverage and are doing well. We can learn best practices and incorporate those best practices across our system.""

Improving patient experience through PAART

Crane said the new system ""allows transparency at all levels: at the MTF level, at the network level, and at headquarters.”

Through centralizing feedback, the DHA aims to foster a ""culture of continuous improvement,"" Crane said. She noted the system strengthens trust by showing patients that the DHA created it with them in mind: When feedback goes into a system where it can be tracked, trended, and escalated, it counters the feeling that a complaint ""goes nowhere.""

""This was designed with the patient at the center of everything we're doing,"" she added, “we want to make sure that our patients’ voices are being heard and that they're being provided with the appropriate service recovery. That is what’s necessary to ensure the patient journey and experience is where it needs to be.”

Safeguards are in place to protect patient confidentiality. All users of PAART must complete Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act training, and patients can choose not to provide certain demographic information if they feel uncomfortable.

Looking ahead, Crane envisions technology will always evolve and that ""we are here to ensure that our patient advocates at the MTFs have the tools, resources, and training that they need to successfully complete their job and be the advocate our beneficiaries deserve.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9463019.jpg,N,1.0,2026-01-26 13:56:28.667597

His insights into the program’s funding mechanisms and his understanding of the demographics associated with the current and future participants in this critical senior program were the origin of Association’s position, resulting in the AMAC Social Security Guarantee.

The Social Security Guarantee (SSG) has undergone several iterations since its 2014 creation, each time adjusting the components to accommodate evolving conditions. Most recently, AMAC convened a dedicated working group to evaluate Social Security’s worsening financial trajectory and recommend changes to the SSG that would lead to its preservation and its modernization to meet the challenges of 21st Century economics. This process examined many proposed solutions presented in recent Trustees Reports and selected the alternatives felt to be best suited to save Social Security’s retirement trust fund. These proposals have been combined with our own research to achieve what we believe to be the best path to long-term trust fund solvency without the necessity of tax increases.

A summary of the current AMAC Social Security Guarantee can be viewed on the AMAC.us website. The full SSG research paper and recommendations can be downloaded from that site.

In 2013, AMAC—The Association of Mature American Citizens—took a big step with the creation of the AMAC Foundation, Inc., a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit entity designed to serve Americans. The Foundation’s mission is to help protect and ensure the financial security, health, and social lives of current and future mature Americans, and to help Americans navigate the bewildering array of decisions they need to make.

The Foundation’s projects and plans include providing factual information that improves understanding of the positive value of Social Security and Medicare and the current and long-term challenges these programs face, as well as providing interpretations by Certified Social Security Advisors through AMAC publications, workshops, webinars, podcasts, and telephone support.

In addition, the Foundation serves all Americans in a variety of capacities, including provision of a source of education on the principles of American Free Enterprise, long-term retirement financial planning, and preparing for life—and potential employment—after retirement.
