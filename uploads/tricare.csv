I thought id be getting out today but turns out that its going to be longer. At least Mon, but they arent sure. Im here because of some complications that put me at risk of a preterm labor, and the fact they found a shorten cervix. A couple of the issues have been resolved I think, but one is still being monitored. My cervix has shortened more within less than 24 hours.

My question is how much can tricare help pay for this? I run a huge risk of leaving too early because if I cramp and get contractions again I can't take the steroids that helped this time for another weeks or two ( Im sorry I can't remember how long. Im really overwhelmed). I need to know how much I could potentially be paying out of pocket if I stay until Monday or even for as long as they need.

The visit underscored a shared commitment to advancing medical services for beneficiaries and elevating standards of care.

Although USNH Rota operates as a Defense Health Agency facility, its medical and operational support is driven mainly by the Sailors and staff of Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command (NMRTC) Rota. The partnership benefits the hospital by ensuring it is staffed with highly trained, mission-ready Navy medical personnel who bring operational expertise and adaptability to patient care. For NMRTC Rota, it provides critical clinical opportunities that sustain medical proficiency and force readiness. Together, this collaboration ensures continuity of care for beneficiaries—even during real-world contingencies—while supporting the dual mission of healthcare delivery and operational preparedness.

HLA Hospital Jerez Puerta del Sur has long been a crucial partner with the Navy, serving as a key pillar in the extended healthcare network that benefits service members, their families, and other U.S. beneficiaries stationed in the region. The hospital's state-of-the-art facilities and commitment to excellence in medical care have played a significant role in filling gaps and providing seamless healthcare solutions.

During the visit, discussions centered around the hospital's latest advancements in technology, specialized medical services, and infrastructure developments. Both teams emphasized the importance of sharing knowledge and collaborating on best practices to ensure the highest quality care for patients. This partnership reflects a dedication to fostering a healthcare environment that is proactive, inclusive, and responsive to the needs of the community.

Dr. Antonio Amaya, chief executive officer of HLA Hospital Jerez Puerta del Sur, expressed his gratitude for the collaboration, noting that such partnerships are instrumental in achieving healthcare goals that transcend institutional boundaries. ""Our shared vision of patient-centric care strengthens the bond between our organizations, and we remain committed to delivering excellence together,"" said Amaya.

USNH Rota leadership echoed that sentiment, emphasizing the vital role HLA Hospital Jerez Puerta del Sur plays in maintaining continuity of care and reinforcing a trusted network of support. Hospital Director, and NMRTC Commanding Officer Capt. Michael Mercado highlighted the importance of this enduring alliance, “Collaborations with trusted partners like HLA Hospital Jerez Puerta del Sur are vital to maintaining operational readiness and ensuring our warfighters and their families receive the highest level of care. We value the shared dedication to excellence and the continued strength of this relationship.”

This engagement marks another step forward in optimizing healthcare delivery and sustaining a resilient, responsive network for U.S. beneficiaries abroad. Both institutions remain committed to innovation, excellence, and a shared mission of delivering world-class medical care. At the same time, NMRTC Rota remains focused on maintaining an operational medical force capable of supporting missions wherever and whenever needed.

NMRTC Rota serves as a force multiplier in Navy Medicine’s strategic global medical support mission throughout Europe, Africa, and the Middle East while also supporting operational readiness and maintaining a strategic repository of expertise at the Naval Hospital Rota Military Training Facility within the Iberian Peninsula.

I had twins (boy and girl) at the beginning of April. My husband enrolled the twins in deers mid May and we had anticipated meeting our annual cap because they both ended up having to go to a different hospital’s nicu in separate ambulances (but they’re doing great now!). But come yesterday I get a notification from our hospital that we owed $18k just from her birth/newborn care prior to going to the other nicu. I look up the claim and it says “nonappealable ineligible due to beneficiary is direct care.”

I’m terrified that something similar may happen with her ambulance ride and nicu stay at the other hospital and put us into serious (although wrong) medical debt since my husband is PCSing in August/September so we’re trying to buy a house next month.

As a critical enabler of force health protection and mission assurance, the NDC plays a vital role in sustaining a medically ready force and a ready medical force.","BETHESDA, Md. (June 11, 2025) – The Naval Dosimetry Center (NDC) marked a major milestone in its enduring mission to protect the health and operational readiness of Sailors and Marines with the official opening of its new, state-of-the-art facility at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on June 11, 2025.

The ribbon-cutting ceremony, attended by senior Navy leaders, commemorated the completion of a multi-year transition to modernize NDC’s capabilities and reinforce its strategic role in supporting Fleet and force health protection.

The newly constructed facility provides a permanent, purpose-built home for the Navy’s centralized hub for radiation dosimetry processing, oversight, and consultation. The NDC’s mission spans the full spectrum of naval operations—delivering precision radiation monitoring for commands operating nuclear-powered platforms, supporting medical departments utilizing diagnostic and therapeutic radiation, and maintaining safety for industrial applications like radiographic inspection and nuclear weapons security. With a comprehensive registry of ionizing radiation exposure records dating back to 1947—now covering over 600,000 individuals—the center plays a foundational role in protecting the long-term health of Navy and Marine Corps personnel.

“This new facility is a testament to the relentless hard work and dedication of the entire NDC team,” said Cmdr. Jeff Delzer, Officer in Charge of the Naval Dosimetry Center. “We are the stewards of radiation safety across the Fleet, and this modernized center ensures we can continue that mission with the highest level of accuracy, efficiency, and accountability. It represents not just a new building, but a renewed commitment to our operational partners and the warfighters we serve.”

The facility was constructed to meet the stringent performance and environmental control standards required by the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP), which provides internationally recognized accreditation for the precision and reliability of dosimetry measurements.

“Maintaining NVLAP accreditation is fundamental to everything we do,” said Lt. Cmdr. Jessica Saunders, Science and Research Officer. “It guarantees to the Fleet and our joint partners that our results are accurate, legally defensible, and mission ready. This facility was engineered from the ground up to support quality, safety, and scientific excellence—hallmarks of Navy Medicine’s operational commitment.”

The center’s seamless transition into the new space was made possible through careful coordination with Defense Health Agency planners and key contract partners.

“Mission continuity was non-negotiable,” said Master Chief Hospital Corpsman Casey Potvin, Senior Enlisted Leader. “We executed each phase of this relocation with precision to ensure no interruption in support to the Fleet. Every service member relying on our monitoring continued to receive uninterrupted coverage—a direct result of our team’s professionalism and foresight.”

With roots tracing back to 1947 and centralized processing established in 1968 at Naval Hospital Bethesda, the Naval Dosimetry Center has long been a quiet but critical enabler of Fleet safety and survivability. The current relocation was driven by requirements under the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure legislation and the Walter Reed Medical Center Addition/Alteration project. While temporarily operating from an interim facility during construction, the NDC continued delivering uninterrupted support to operational forces, setting the stage for this long-awaited milestone.

Now fully operational in its new home, the Naval Dosimetry Center is better positioned than ever to uphold its legacy of excellence and ensure the radiation readiness and safety of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps for generations to come.

The Naval Dosimetry Center (NDC), located at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, serves as the U.S. Navy’s premier facility for radiation exposure monitoring, dosimetry processing, and radiological consultation. Established as a centralized capability in 1968, the NDC supports the health and operational readiness of Sailors and Marines across the full spectrum of naval missions—including nuclear propulsion, medical diagnostics and therapy, industrial applications, and weapons systems. The center maintains the Navy’s comprehensive ionizing radiation exposure registry, with records dating back to 1947, and holds accreditation from the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) for the highest standards in dosimetry precision and quality.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Thirty-five graduating resident physicians participated this month this year’s Trauma Capstone held at the Medical Simulation Training Center, Schofield Barracks.

The four-day exercise, undergone by graduating resident physicians, tests various tactical and medical skills in a simulated combat environment, ultimately providing graduates with valuable hands-on experience in a field setting to prepare them for operations in austere environments.

“The GME Trauma Capstone was developed to emphasize Tactical Combat Casualty Care, TC3 principles to graduating residents before their first duty stations,” said Maj. Zachary McRae, Family Medicine Physician. “The capstone helps residents understand Military physicians have dual roles; providing medical care in non-combat environments and caring for soldiers in combat or austere environments with limited resources.”

The capstone event includes realistic immersive training scenarios, such as realistic simulated combat injuries allowing participants to practice their skills in a high-stress environment. The participants learn by doing, working through various trauma scenarios that mirror real-world situations. This type of training emphasizes clear and effective communication between different medical professionals, including medics, surgeons, and other healthcare providers.

“The goal of the GME Capstone is to prepare medical providers for deployment and combat readiness as they transition to their units, including force comm,” said Staff Sgt. Robert Fulcher, trauma capstone NCOIC.

U.S. Army Capt. Ceyda Sablak, a pediatrics resident, said that the exercise is beneficial for understanding the work of medics and paramedics as well as improving collaboration between physicians and field teams.

“This type of training fosters camaraderie, enhances teamwork and provides hands-on skills for real-life scenarios. The training is a valuable opportunity for building skills, teamwork, and understanding the needs of medics, which will aid her in her role as a pediatric physician and field surgeon” Sablak said.

The Public News Service Thursday afternoon update.

I'm Mike Clifford.

First from the BBC, Israel's defense minister says Iran's supreme leader can no longer be allowed to exist after the Seroka Hospital was hit during an Iranian missile attack.

Iranian state media reports the missile strike targeted a military site next to the hospital in southern Israel, not the facility itself.

Dozens of people were reported injured across Israel after Iran fired a barrage of missiles overnight.

The BBC reports in Iran, Israel's military says it targeted sites including the inactive Arak heavy water reactor.

There have been no reports of radiation threats or injuries overnight.

The attacks come at a critical time as President Trump considers the possibility of direct U.S. involvement in Israel's campaign.

Meantime, as Republican lawmakers waive billions of dollars in potential Medicaid cuts, a new report warns the move could affect health coverage for Mississippi's military families.

The analysis finds more than 850,000 people enrolled in Medicaid list TRICARE, the military's health insurance, as their primary coverage.

One in 10 children of service members with TRICARE is also enrolled in Medicaid.

In Mississippi, retired Army General Augustus Collins says the cuts would hit the youngest and lowest paid service members the hardest.

The one thing you don't want is to deploy a service member somewhere around the globe and he's worried about his family, whether or not they've got proper food to eat or whether they've got proper health care.

It's hard to focus on the mission.

And when you can't focus on the mission, you put yourself as well as those around you in danger.

The report was released jointly by the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families and the nonprofit Mission Readiness.

I'm Trumel Gomes.

Next June is World Oceans Month.

Advocates are warning that industrial shipping pollution hurts both our oceans and port communities.

At least 31 million people live within three miles of a port, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

That includes thousands of New Jerseyans.

Industrial shipping frequently relies on heavy fuel oil, which releases carbon dioxide, sulfur oxides and black carbon into the atmosphere, causing harm to marine ecosystems and port communities.

Altarice Frazier with Pacific Environment says if the global shipping industry was its own country, it would be one of the largest polluters in the world.

Industrial shipping burns some of the dirtiest fossil fuels like heavy oil, producing toxic air pollutions and greenhouse gases.

I'm Simone Perez.

Out of Connecticut, where farmers could face significant impacts from the U.S.

Department of Agriculture defunding of programs aimed at combating climate change, Kaitlin Kimball is co-owner of Sunset Farms.

Her farm has flooded and been hit by a late frost in the last two years.

So when we lose that income, that impacts us the following year as well, because we go into the winter with less money, which means we can purchase less supplies or we have to take out more credit.

While farms generally have liability insurance, she notes not all have crop insurance.

This is Public News Service.

Next to Ohio, where child welfare advocates are urging lawmakers to restore more than $60 million in funding to address the state's ongoing foster care placement crisis.

Governor Mike DeWine and state House leaders included funding in the budget to expand the state child protective allocation and create new child wellness campuses.

But the Ohio Senate removed both investments.

Scott Britton, assistant director of the Public Children's Services Association of Ohio, says counties can't manage this crisis alone.

Children deserve a safe place to sleep that meets their behavioral health and their well-being needs.

The cost of foster care placements is outpacing inflation. 68 percent or $158 million more today than just five years ago.

And federal reimbursement is declining.

The Senate cut $61 million from the House budget, $31 million from county child protection funds and $30 million from proposed wellness campuses.

Conference committee members are working to finalize the budget by June 30.

Farah Siddiqui reporting.

And community college programs in Maine are helping the state meet its ambitious climate goals while creating good-paying jobs.

Governor Janet Mills wants 30,000 clean energy workers in the state by 2030, including those trained in home heat pump installation.

Kim Wilson-Roy, dean of workforce and professional solutions at Eastern Maine Community College, says students can earn their heat pump certification in just 40 hours, often through more accommodating evening courses.

In general, these kinds of programs are offering great job prospects.

And most students that are coming through that program are landing jobs well before they graduate.

She says some participants are already working as technicians and are looking to upgrade their skills or earn better pay.

State officials are aiming for an additional 175,000 home heat pumps to be installed by 2027 to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

I'm Catherine Carley.

Finally, the U.S. Senate's answer to the House Republicans' One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes proposals that advocates for public lands say would decimate the National Park Service and those that rely on it, including some towns in Montana.

The reconciliation bill proposes dropping nearly $270 million earmarked for the National Park Service in the Inflation Reduction Act.

That comes in the wake of a 17 percent reduction in collective park staff since 2023.

Michelle Yubaraga with the National Parks Conservation Association says stress is high in her Yellowstone-centric town.

Little rural gateway communities like ours not only are really dependent upon Yellowstone for our economy, but our friends and neighbors are employed in the parks on public lands.

So yeah, people are really concerned and upset.

In a letter to the Montana Congressional Delegation, the Gardner Chamber of Commerce noted that tourism brought in more than $260 million in non-resident spending to Park County in 2023.

This group establishes unified, high-quality standards for perioperative services across all hospitals and clinics within the Military Health System. By creating the same rules and processes for all operating rooms, the DHA ORESC helps the MHS deliver safe and high-quality care to beneficiaries.

What Is the DHA ORESC?

The DHA ORESC is a team of surgeons, nurses, and anesthesiologists from all nine defense health networks. Their job is to equip ORs with the resourcing and guidance to meet the needs of patients.

“As a nurse nominee, being part of the ORESC ensures that the voices of the nursing staff are heard in key decisions,” said Natalee Day, chief nurse of William Beaumont Army Medical Center - Fort Bliss. “I have the opportunity to advocate for processes that directly impact our team and patient care.”

How the DHA ORESC Works

The DHA ORESC acts as a central decision-making body to standardize processes across the MHS. Members from every DHN share ideas and challenges from their military hospitals and clinics. This teamwork helps create standards that work for most military hospitals and clinics and advance the larger goals of the MHS.

The DHA ORESC also focuses on accountability. U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Robert McGill, orthopaedic arthroplasty surgeon and DHA’s Surgical Clinical Management Team chief serving as the acting DHA ORESC chair said the committee:

• Hears concerns

• Shares successes

• Leads policy decision making

Every DHN receives one vote for decision making. These decisions improve patient safety and quality of care while also enhancing military medical readiness and resource use.

“By centralizing decision making and standardizing processes, the DHA ORESC ensures that every facility within the MHS knows the steps to operate at the highest level of efficiency and safety,” McGill explained.

Why the DHA ORESC is Important

The DHA ORESC’s work has big benefits:

• Safer surgeries: By creating perioperative best practices, the DHA ORESC makes sure all patients get safe, high-quality care.

• Faster decisions: The group’s clear structure helps solve problems quickly while keeping everyone accountable.

• Better use of resources: Consistent processes and good planning help military hospitals and clinics meet patient needs and keep service members ready.

“The ORESC’s initiatives not only improve surgical care, but also strengthen the overall readiness of our military health care system,” said Dr. Adrienne Cummings, deputy chair of the department of anesthesia at Brooke Army Medical Center. “It’s a win for patients, providers, and the mission.”

The DHA ORESC Impact

The DHA ORESC’s work supports the DHA’s goal of quality care to patients and service member readiness. By improving how military hospitals and clinics run, the DHA ORESC helps keep the military health care system strong and dependable.

“The ORESC has been an invaluable platform for sharing challenges and solutions across networks,” said U.S. Navy Capt. James Solomon, pediatric anesthesiologist, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, “We all face similar obstacles and are at different stages in developing our network-level OR committees. By collaborating, we ensure that all networks move in the same direction toward optimizing OR operations.”

What’s Next

The DHA ORESC is committed to making surgeries safer, more efficient, and better for everyone. As the team keeps working together, its goal is for surgical care to be top-notch for both patients and providers.

— Monique Whitney

PHOENIX, AZ, UNITED STATES, June 20, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Pharmacists United for Truth and Transparency (PUTT) today announced the launch of its ""Audit TRICARE"" campaign (AuditTRICARE.org), a critical initiative designed to bring transparency to questionable pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) pricing practices that may be costing taxpayers millions while affecting healthcare access for military families.

Using real-time pricing examples and state-based infographics, the campaign aims to start a national conversation about the stark price differences between common generic medications purchased without insurance and the prices charged to the federal government by TRICARE's PBM, Express Scripts. PUTT members whose families are on TRICARE or TRICARE for Life, sourced drug pricing information through TRICARE’s prescription drug pricing portal, comparing the cost of generic medications on Tricare versus without insurance at pharmacies like Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drugs, Blueberry Pharmacy and DiRx, who provide their medication cash price online.

Exposing Hidden Healthcare Costs

PUTT's preliminary research revealed significant disparities in generic medication pricing that demand immediate attention:

- Amlodipine, a commonly prescribed generic blood pressure medication, costs $213.60 on TRICARE but less than $6 for the same medication (dose and quantity) at Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drugs

- Fluoxetine, the generic version of Prozac®, costs $235.32 on TRICARE but $7.74 for the same medication at Blueberry Pharmacy

- Omeprazole, a commonly prescribed acid reflux medication, costs $665.58 on TRICARE but $14.06 at DiRx

“While civilians can often purchase common generic medications at competitive cash prices, the federal government—through TRICARE—appears to be paying substantially more for identical medications through Express Scripts' managed formulary system,” said PUTT Executive Director Monique Whitney, whose family members’ military service includes the Marines and the Navy. ""This creates a troubling situation where the government serves as both the plan sponsor funding these purchases and the entity responsible for oversight yet lacks transparency mechanisms to ensure fair pricing. We urge the Department of Defense to conduct an independent audit of TRICARE’s prescription drug program to understand why our military’s prescription medications are so expensive.”

Campaign Objectives

Through the ""Audit TRICARE"" campaign, PUTT aims to:

- Demand Transparency: Call for clear, public reporting on the factors contributing to the prescription drug pricing within the TRICARE system, including detailed breakdowns of PBM fees, rebates, and administrative costs

- Encourage Oversight: Advocate for federal agencies to regularly and independently audit PBM pricing practices to ensure competitive, fair pricing for generic medications

- Protect Military Families: Ensure healthcare decisions - including the patient’s choice of pharmacy - are based on the patient’s best interest, not profit margins or self-dealing business arrangements

- Safeguard Taxpayer Dollars: At a time when the federal government is seeking greater fiscal responsibility, ensure government healthcare contractors are acting as fiduciaries, using fair pricing practices and preserving access for service members, veterans and their families

The Stakes for Military Healthcare

The prescription drug pricing disparities highlighted by the campaign have far-reaching implications:

- Military families may pay significantly more for common generic medications as a way to offset somewhat lower brand medication prices on TRICARE

- Taxpayers fund potentially inflated prescription costs without visibility into pricing rationale

- Healthcare resources that could serve more military families may be diverted to pay for excessive PBM administrative costs

""Our military families deserve healthcare transparency, and American taxpayers deserve to know how their dollars are being spent on prescription medications,"" said PUTT’s President Deborah Keaveny, whose daughter is currently on active duty in the Middle East. ""When PBMs operate with limited oversight and zero pricing transparency, everyone loses except the middleman. There is no excuse for charging our service men and women and their families hundreds of times more for generic medications than they could purchase without TRICARE at a local pharmacy. This shouldn’t be how we say ‘thank you for your service and your sacrifices’.”

A Call for Accountability

The ""Audit TRICARE"" campaign is intended to represent more than policy advocacy. PUTT’s goal is to call for the transparency and accountability military families have earned through their service, Ms. Whitney said. PUTT invites healthcare advocates, military families, veterans, and concerned citizens to join this critical conversation.

""Transparency in healthcare pricing isn't a partisan issue—it's an American issue,"" said Brandi Chane, a pharmacy owner based in Weatherford, Texas and PUTT Board member whose mother is on TRICARE for Life. ""When we ensure fair, competitive pricing for military healthcare, we strengthen both our commitment to those who serve and our responsibility to ourselves as taxpayers. It’s the taxpayers who are funding these vital services.”

I submitted the claim with all the documents I had other than “itemized bill” because they don’t have it/give it out here. Like when you go to the ER here they have a huge sign on the wall saying how much the cost of the visit will be..free for the resident of Canada and about 800CAD for foreigner. The receipt that I got for 790CAD that I payed also has that info on it as the clerk wrote down doctors fee 440$ and visit itself is 350$. Anyway, they kept coming back for itemized bill in the messaging centre. I went to the hospital and talked to patient records and showed them what tricare wants. They gave me everything they had which was 2 documents- papers showing the name of a hospital, my info and the same stuff I mentioned above. And they said that if my insurance needs more stuff that they need to call the hospital. I also went to the hospital’s cashier and she printed me out official documents of my visit and payment. A number that tricare can contact and that photo of the ER sign saying how much you pay and the bank statment. I submitted everything I was able to provide. I wrote several times in the messaging centre that this is all that I was given and that there is no itemized bill document here, they do stuff differently. Like there’s a big sign at the ER saying what you will pay. They didn’t even acknowledge it and asked for itemized bill again. I called many times saying that I can’t come up with something that is not given out here and the last tricare dude was like I understand, In understand but that they will deny it if there is no such document and that HE KNOWS theres a way to get it even in Canada…he just didn’t say how to go about it..🫠

So, yes my claim was denied because of a document that doesnt exist. We submitted a grievance. But I want to go big about it. Should I contact the senator or a whole bunch of them? Should I go to the news with it? Like I am not looking to go through Tricare with it they are not helpful I want to go above them in every way that’s possible.",,N,-1.0,2025-06-20 17:56:26.949295

Your individual deductible applies to both the family deductible, as well as the cap total.
The family deductible amount is more noticeable the more dependents you have.
You as an individual cannot contribute more than your individual deductible towards the family total.
There are individual and family caps listed separately, however they are the same amount, and almost invariably the family cap is met first.","For the sake of example, I will be changing the amounts:

Individual deductible: $150

Family deductible: $300

Individual cap: $1000

Family cap: $1000

Following these numbers -- you as an individual must meet your $150 individual deductible out of pocket before ""normal"" benefits, such as copays and cost-shares, fully kick in, and before TRICARE begins paying for many services. Once your individual deductible is met, you should only owe copays/cost-shares until you reach the catastrophic cap. Your individual deductible applies to both the family deductible, as well as the cap total.

The family deductible amount is more noticeable the more dependents you have. Let's say you have 4 members. 2 of you can meet your $150 amounts, added together gives us $300. As this meets the family amount, the deductible is now considered met for the other 2 dependents, despite not accumulating any of their own deductibles. Following, if each of you meet $75 of your individual deductibles, technically nobody has met their individual amounts, however $75 x 4 = $300 to meet the family deductible. Despite nobody meeting the individual, the family total is met, so the deductible is considered met for everyone.

You as an individual cannot contribute more than your individual deductible towards the family total.

The catastrophic cap is also called the maximum out of pocket. This is a limit on your out of pocket expenses in a given plan cycle. Once the cap is met, your care should be covered at 100%. There are individual and family caps listed separately, however they are the same amount, and almost invariably the family cap is met first. Some plans also include monthly premiums in the cap, but not all. The deductible, any copays/cost-shares, and pharmacy costs should be included into the cap for any applicable plans.

A lot of us are in-network but for some reason the new system “glitched” somehow & “switched” us to out of network. I had to file numerous “tickets” to get that fixed (took months) & still no payments(I’m owed well over 40k & I’m a small provider) . My TriCare claims show approved & paid in their Humana system but the payment comes thru PGBA now which apparently is the problem. But good luck getting ahold of or any answers calling PGBA.

After 60-120 days of no payment from any insurance company, many providers systems automatically send the bill out to the patient. Given these unusual circumstances & it being TriCare no one really knows what to do.

Providers from every state have reached out to their state & federal government representatives for help, emailed congressional staffers & some are starting a class action lawsuit against Humana & PGBA.

I am hoping that since the problems are now causing issues for active duty military patients someone will listen. TriCare has lost over 20% of their providers & many are no longer accepting new patients until it is fixed or requiring patients to pay upfront & send a super bill to TriCare for self reimbursement.

I live in a town surrounded by 5 military bases/fields so probably 70% if not more of our population are active duty & retired military. There are ABA clinics, small PCM clinics, specialty doctors & several others who are closing or have closed due to the nonpayment, resulting in the inability to cover business costs.

The Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System, or DEERS, database contains information for each uniformed service member (active duty, retired, or a member of a reserve component), U.S.-sponsored foreign military, DOD and uniformed services civilians, other personnel as directed by the DOD (including the patient population serviced through the Military Health Services System), and their eligible family members. DEERS registration is required for TRICARE eligibility and enrollment.

You are responsible for keeping your information current on your record. Active Duty and retired service members are automatically registered in DEERS, but they must take action to register their family members and ensure they are correctly entered into the database. Once registered in DEERS it is important to keep your DEERS records updated when personal eligibility information changes. This includes addresses and family status (marriage, divorce, birth, adoption, etc.). Mistakes in the DEERS database can cause problems with TRICARE claims, so it is critical to maintain your DEERS information. Retail network pharmacies check TRICARE eligibility through DEERS. Prescriptions will be filled only for beneficiaries who are listed as eligible in DEERS.

I have been covered under TRICARE Reserve Select for over 4+ years now. Just me. I have been to the doc 5x now since January. Every time I’m hit with a $25ish copay, whatever that’s fine. I continually keep getting billed $100+ per visit, every single time from my doctors office. I have paid over $500 PLUS copays for simple PCP medication appointments.

I thought, maybe it’s the office. Let me switch PCPs. So I found a new PCP, ON TRICARES WEBSITE to make sure the doctor is within network (even though I found my previous one on here as well). I have my appointment tomorrow and was emailed a “check-in”. I just clicked on it. Tell me why in the hell they want to charge me $250 for a PCP ESTABLISHMENT appointment tomorrow. On the bill, it says I haven’t met my deductible. BUT IM PRETTY SURE I HAVE ?????

The annual graduation celebrates the more than 200 military medical graduates completing internships, residencies, and fellowships. In addition to Walter Reed, the NCC includes the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Malcolm Grow Medical Clinics and Surgery Center at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, and Alexander T. Augusta Military Medical Center at Fort Belvoir, Virginia.

U.S. Navy Capt. (Dr.) Melissa Austin, director of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC), congratulated the graduates for their achievements, adding that current world events reinforce the need for a “strong, ready military medical force.” She added that the graduates’ training prepares them to answer the call for duty downrange and at home, providing the best health care for service members and their families.

Journalist and author Lee Woodruff served as guest speaker, stating that her husband, journalist Bob Woodruff, would not be alive had it not been for military medicine and its providers.

“His recovery was nothing short of amazing,” stated Woodruff, who described military medical care as “phenomenal.”

Woodruff added the graduates chose “a noble profession on two fronts” – medicine and service to their country in uniform. “This takes a very special person.”

The NCC, created in 1995, is the largest sponsor of the graduate medical education program in the Military Health System. Its graduates complete training in various disciplines lasting from one to seven years, with a first-time board pass rate of more than 95 percent. One of the highest in the nation among GME programs.
