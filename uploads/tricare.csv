He discusses how today’s military families are negatively affected by the Trump/Republican shutdown of the federal government, which is currently the second-longest in U.S. history (the longest being the Trump/Republican government shutdown in 2017). Stephen is a Missouri UOCAVA voter, resident of the United Kingdom, and member of the Democrats Abroad Global Veterans and Military Families Caucus.

As a Marine veteran and military spouse living overseas, I’ve seen how Washington’s dysfunction doesn’t just stay in Washington. With Republicans controlling the House, the Senate, and the White House, the blame for the government shutdown now disrupting the lives of military families around the world lies squarely on their shoulders.

For many military and retiree families stationed or residing abroad, access to health care is through TRICARE Overseas — a Department of Defense-operated system where some families often must pay out of pocket for care and then wait for the U.S. government to reimburse them. During the current shutdown, that reimbursement process has come to a halt for many. Families are being left to shoulder the full cost of doctor visits, prescriptions, and urgent care, with no clear timeline for when the government will reopen and TRICARE’s contractor will again be authorized to resume reimbursement.

Our government promises our military recruits world-class health care coverage upon entering the service, but under this Administration and the current 119th Congress, they’ve been getting, well, outright scammed. To be clear, TRICARE beneficiaries are Americans who have already served and sacrificed, and are now forced to absorb the financial burden of Washington’s failure.

Instead of governing responsibly, Republicans have once again chosen to inflict serious harm on the country rather than demonstrate basic competence. The bottom line is that military families are fiercely patriotic and understand the need to put country over party when it comes to the well-being of our nation and our service members, and they deserve better. They shouldn’t have to question whether their health care coverage depends on the next manufactured crisis. Members of Congress continue to receive paychecks despite the House of Representatives having no plan for returning to session. While military families check for change under the couch cushions to help pay skyrocketing medical bills, it is outrageous that Republican lawmakers continue to kick the legislative can down the road on reopening the government. It’s time for all elected leaders to put the country over chaos and stop using those who serve or have served as collateral in their political battles.

U.S. citizens living abroad, both civilian and military, are highly encouraged to check your voter registration status and request your ballot for any upcoming elections in your home voting state that you are eligible to vote in.

Finding the best health insurance plan as a freelancer can be challenging, but there are several options and strategies that many freelancers have found useful. Here are some of the most recommended plans and tips based on Redditor experiences:

ACA Marketplace Plans

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace is a popular choice for freelancers because it offers comprehensive coverage and potential subsidies.

Coverage and Costs: Many freelancers find the ACA plans affordable, especially with subsidies. One Redditor mentioned, ""I get ACA through the marketplace.""

Enrollment: You can only enroll during the open enrollment period in November or if you have a qualifying life event. ""You can only sign up during open enrollment in November, or if you have a qualifying life event.""

Beware of High Costs: Some freelancers have experienced significant premium increases. ""We bought through the marketplace. What a depressing and defeated feeling. Re upped this year. premiums doubled.""

Health Savings Account (HSA) Plans

High-deductible health plans (HDHPs) paired with a Health Savings Account (HSA) can be a cost-effective option for those who are healthy and can afford to pay out-of-pocket for some expenses.

Lower Premiums: HDHPs typically have lower monthly premiums compared to other plans. ""Mine is only $30/mo for a HDHP plan with an HSA.""

Tax Benefits: Contributions to an HSA are tax-deductible, and the funds can grow tax-free if used for qualified medical expenses. ""Kinda tempted to save on premiums and stash cash in an HSA.""

Potential Drawbacks: You need to be comfortable with higher deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. ""I’m nervous about getting slammed with surprise bills.""

Group and Professional Plans

Some freelancers have found coverage through group or professional organizations.

Union-Style Plans: These can offer comprehensive coverage at a lower cost. ""Group-ish plans"": I stumbled on some ""research associate"" or ""union-style"" plans that hook you up with PPO networks for $400–600/month.""

Industry-Specific Plans: If you work in a specific industry, there might be specialized plans available. ""Motion Picture Industry Pension & Health Plans.""

Private Insurance

For those who don't qualify for ACA subsidies or prefer different coverage options, private insurance can be a viable alternative.

Customizable Plans: Private insurance can offer more flexibility in terms of coverage and network. ""For my family of 3 now on a United Healthcare PPO with no deductible and a $3,000 max out of pocket we pay $750 now.""

Potential Drawbacks: These plans can be more expensive and might not cover pre-existing conditions. ""The catch with these plans is you can’t have major health conditions to get approved for the plan or they’ll decline you.""

Other Tips

Consult a Broker: A good broker can help you navigate the complexities of health insurance. ""Your state's ACA marketplace should have a feature to find a licensed broker near you.""

Consider Health Share Plans: These can be a more affordable alternative to traditional insurance, but they might not cover all types of care. ""We paid for a healthshare plan that cost about $500/month for our family (a few years ago) and covered most general care.""

Weigh the Trade-Offs: Balance between lower premiums and comprehensive coverage. ""None of it's 'decent,' but I have a blue cross silver plan for about $400mo.""

In 1942, a California newspaper published a cartoon implying Halloween pranks were in favor of the Axis powers.
As sugar rations were also put in place, treats were replaced with games or snacks that were more readily available, like popcorn or peanuts.
Later, after the end of the war and Halloween restrictions ended, the holiday became far more focused on kids.
This has led to popular events, like battalion-wide Halloween events or trunk-or-treats, where people bring their cars to a location, decorate them with a theme, and hand out candy.","Today, Halloween is one of the biggest sugar-filled days of the year, filled with costumes and treats. But to get that candy in the first place, there’s something kids must say first: “Trick or Treat.” And it’s only in recent decades that we’ve leaned in to treats. Prior to that, it was all about the tricks.

Before knocking on doors became commonplace, seemingly giving folks the option to opt out of their trick, pranks or other destructive behavior was simply part of Halloween. According to Nicholas Rodgers, author of “Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night,” this practice began as early as 1911, with traditions from other countries blending into American culture. By the mid-30s, kids in costumes saying “treats or tricks” had become popular.

Related: 4 Revolutionary War ghosts that refuse to die

However, older kids would take to their own pastimes. Notably, teenage boys would go out into the night to wreak havoc in their neighborhoods. Gates were left open, fences broken or torn down, tires were deflated, and doorbells rang at all hours.

World War II put that all to an end. In 1942, a California newspaper published a cartoon implying Halloween pranks were in favor of the Axis powers. The picture includes a teenage boy who receives a message from Emperor Hirohito, Adolph Hitler, and Benito Mussolini, “Do something destructive this Halloween… you’ll be helping us.”

Suddenly, the idea of pranks had become anti-American. Additional text explained that pranks would be considered unlawful and would come with corresponding consequences. Further stories were published about pranks performed by sleeping spies, the pranks serving as signs. Others told stories of raid bells causing chaos, all of which was blamed on Halloween. Not only did teenagers have cause to pause, but their parents suddenly had motivation to make sure they behaved, especially on a night meant for mischief.

In addition, towns were observing “dim out” rules to conserve power, meaning it was less likely for kids to go door-to-door after dark. Effectively, this kept most everyone at home for Halloween of 1942, a sentiment that carried into the following year. For some towns, this meant canceled parties and celebrations, even in the daylight. Others created events that were pro-American, like bringing in scrap metal.

In many ways, modern children’s parties can be traced to these early predecessors, who wanted them held in the daylight and to prove that nothing nefarious was taking place.

As sugar rations were also put in place, treats were replaced with games or snacks that were more readily available, like popcorn or peanuts. Later, after the end of the war and Halloween restrictions ended, the holiday became far more focused on kids. This is likely due to those who remembered missing out on their own trick-or-treating days.

In the early 1950s, Disney re-popularized the idea of asking for treats with cartoons like Donald Duck showing how to trick-or-treat. Peanuts did the same, revamping the idea of going door-to-door.

In more modern wars, the U.S. has changed its security measures locally, perhaps altering who can access a military base and what they can do there. This has led to popular events, like battalion-wide Halloween events or trunk-or-treats, where people bring their cars to a location, decorate them with a theme, and hand out candy. This creates a more secure environment while still allowing fun—and sugar—for all involved.

We invite all to attend with us and have some fun. This is a fundraiser for our post which helps us support veterans’ needs and our building fund. I don’t have the menu for this date, although I will let you know next week.

Our next breakfast will be Sunday November 16. We will be serving a full pancake breakfast from 8 a.m. to noon. We will also pick the three winners of our annual veterans day raffle with the first prize of $750. You will be able to pick up tickets at the breakfast also. Hope to see everyone.

Unless you have been unaware, we have a government shutdown. Although all benefits to veterans have not been held up there are some problems regarding our armed forces that are still serving.

The Veterans of Foreign Wars joined Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, along with fellow organizations that serve the military and veteran communities, at a press conference calling on Congress to end the government shutdown and pass H.R.5401, Pay Our Troops Act of 2026.

VFW National Legislative Associate Director Joy Craig reminded lawmakers, “This shutdown is not just a debate in Washington, it’s a kitchen-table crisis for military and veteran families across the country.”

She cautioned that while current paychecks are being covered through temporary funding shifts, future pay is not guaranteed. Craig added, “No one who has sworn an oath to this nation should have to wonder if their paycheck will come.”

Senate Advances Defense Bill Strengthening Transition & Quality of Life: The Senate united to pass its $925 billion National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026, marking a bipartisan breakthrough despite the ongoing government shutdown.

The bill includes several provisions long championed by the VFW, including enhanced TRICARE benefits supporting women and family health, increased funding for the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, and the creation of a senior DOD official to oversee military-to-civilian transition policy.

It also directs DOD to pilot a new housing allowance model to improve affordability and accuracy. Senate and House Armed Services Committee leaders will now negotiate a final version for passage before the end of the year.

The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency announced no identifications or burial updates this week. This week I would like to highlight the service of John Basiloni. Giovanni (John) was born to a large and loud Italian-American family with roots in Buffalo, New York, and Raritan, New Jersey.

The ten children in this Catholic family would not have been unusual in the early 1900s. John was the sixth child born to Salvatore, who emigrated from Italy, and Theadora, who grew up in New Jersey.

Theadora's parents had also emigrated from Italy. In classic fashion, Sal and Theadora met at a church gathering and they married three years later. John was born on November 4, 1916, at home in Buffalo.

After John Basilone turned 18 years old, he enlisted, in July 1934. As an infantry grunt, Basilone completed basic training and after stateside training, his first overseas assignment was to the Philippines.

Basilone’s tour in the islands would have been exotic for a New Jersey boy with little risk of engagement. He enjoyed the food, temperature, women, and comradery of his Army buddies.

When he left the Army and returned stateside, he often thought about how to get back to Manila. He drove a truck for three years in Raritan, but the tropical breezes of Manila were always on his mind.

The coldest month on average in Manila was 78 degrees and with no snow. John had to feel it was much better than Buffalo, New York, or New Jersey. Good duty if you can get it. John thought about getting back to that good duty and felt his best opportunity to get back to Manila was with the Marines.

He did this initial training like all Marines, although he was older and more experienced based on the Army stint. He was sent to Guantanamo, Cuba, as his first overseas assignment with the Marines. The next assignment would not be as idyllic.

On August 7, 1942, America mounted its first major amphibious landing of World War II at Guadalcanal, using an innovative landing craft built by Higgins Industries in New Orleans.

The goal was to capture a strategic airfield site on the island (later named Henderson Field for a US pilot lost in the Battle of Midway). This island was the farthest south the Rising Sun Empire had captured.

To halt Japanese efforts to disrupt supply routes to Australia and New Zealand victory was paramount but uncertain. The invasion ignited a ferocious struggle marked by seven major naval battles, numerous clashes ashore, and almost continuous air combat over eight months.

After ferrying Marines to Guadalcanal, the U.S. Coast Guardsmen (Coasties) under the command of the Navy, stayed on the island in August 1942. Coasties also served as signalmen from the shore to the ships. Douglas A. Munro set up blinkers to signal the ship at night until he returned to his ship.

As in a long battle, ammunition became critically low. Basilone fought through the hostile ground to resupply his heavy-machine gunners with urgently needed supplies.

Basilone moved an extra gun into position and maintained continual fire against the incoming Japanese forces. He then repaired and manned another machine gun, holding the defensive line until relief arrived.

When the last of the ammunition ran out shortly before dawn on the second day, Basilone, using his pistol and a machete, held off the Japanese soldiers attacking his position.

By the end of the engagement, Japanese forces opposite the Marines' lines had been virtually annihilated. In the Battle of Bloody Ridge, a few Marines - and most notably John Basilone - held the high ground above Henderson Field.

Following the decisive Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, the Japanese abandoned their attempts to retake Henderson Field, though fighting would continue for a few more months.

For his own critical role in the Battle of Bloody Ridge, Sergeant John Basilone was awarded the Medal of Honor. He was sent stateside and performed hundreds of war bond tours and rallies

Manila John asked to go back to the war front, but the Marine Corps denied his request and told him he needed more on the home front. He was offered an officer commission, which he turned down, and was later offered an assignment as an instructor, but refused this as well.

Finally, his request to return to the fighting was approved. This time he did additional training on the west coast at Camp Pendleton. While at Pendleton, Basilone met and married Lena Mae Riggi, a sergeant in the Marine Women's Reserve serving as a field cook. They married in July 1944.

Returning to the fleet, Basilone was assigned to ""C"" Company, 1st Battalion, 27th Marine Regiment, 5th Marine Division. On February 19, 1945, the first day of the invasion of Iwo Jima, he was serving as a machine gun section leader.

While the landing at Guadalcanal was uneventful and even surprised the Japanese, that was not the case on Iwo Jima. While the Marines landed, the Japanese concentrated their fire on the incoming Marines from heavily fortified blockhouses staged throughout the island.

Units were pinned down everywhere. Basilone flanked the side of the Japanese positions until he was directly on top of the blockhouse. He then attacked with grenades and demolitions, single-handedly destroying the entire strong point and its defending garrison.

He then fought his way toward Airfield Number 1 and aided a Marine tank that was trapped in an enemy minefield under intense mortar and artillery barrages. He guided the heavy vehicle over the hazardous terrain to safety, despite heavy weapons fire from the Japanese.

As he moved along the edge of the airfield, he was killed by Japanese mortar shrapnel or small arms fire. Basilone was posthumously awarded the Marine Corps' second-highest decoration for valor, the Navy Cross, for extraordinary heroism during the Battle of Iwo Jim.

John's wife, Lena, originally from Oregon, remained in California after John's death and never remarried. John Basilone died while doing his duty to his utmost.

On his left arm was a tattoo that read ""Death before Dishonor."" John lived by that motto. To this day, ""Manila John"" Basilone is one of Marine's unbelievable stories of heroism.

All who served our nation, served with honor and dedication. Let us remember all who gave the ultimate sacrifice for our country. God bless them all. Remember all those serving our country today and keep them in your thoughts and prayers. God Bless America.

The answer is yes, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a covered benefit under TRICARE for eligible beneficiaries who meet specific clinical criteria.

TRICARE began covering TMS as part of its basic benefit package in 2016, recognizing it as an effective treatment option for patients with treatment-resistant Major Depressive Disorder. This coverage applies to active duty service members, military retirees, eligible family members, including spouses and children, and National Guard and Reserve members.

Because TMS is considered a limited benefit under TRICARE, prior authorization is required before beginning treatment using military insurance. While TRICARE covers TMS for Major Depressive Disorder, it does not currently cover the therapy for other conditions, such as PTSD, anxiety disorders, or concussion symptoms when these occur independently. However, coverage may apply when these conditions are present alongside MDD.

Who Qualifies for TRICARE-Covered TMS Therapy?

To qualify for TRICARE coverage of TMS therapy, veterans and active duty military insurance policyholders must meet all of the following criteria:

Medical Requirements:

Be diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder by a psychiatrist

Have attempted at least four different antidepressant medications that did not work

Be 18 years of age or older

Eligible Beneficiaries:

TRICARE coverage extends to:

Active duty service members – all branches of the military

Military retirees – those who have completed their service and retired from the military

Family members – spouses and children of active duty or retired service members

National Guard and Reserve members – and their eligible family members

Administrative Requirement:

Prior authorization is required before beginning TMS treatment, as it is considered a limited benefit under TRICARE.

Which TRICARE Plans Include Mental Health Coverage for TMS Therapy?

All major TRICARE plans cover TMS therapy as part of their mental health benefits. Here’s the breakdown by plan:

TRICARE Plans That Cover TMS:

TRICARE Prime

A managed-care option where Military Treatment Facilities are the principal source of health care

Requires a referral from your Primary Care Manager for specialty mental health services

Typically has the lowest out-of-pocket costs

TRICARE Select

A fee-for-service option that offers more flexibility in choosing providers

Does not require a referral to see specialists, including for TMS therapy

Higher copayments compared to TRICARE Prime

TRICARE For Life

Provides supplementary health-care coverage for TRICARE beneficiaries 65 years old and older who are entitled to Medicare Part A and enrolled in Medicare Part B

Offers coverage for mental health services, including TMS therapy

TRICARE Reserve Select

Available to certain members of the National Guard and Reserve

Includes mental health coverage for TMS therapy

The cost patients pay depends on the TRICARE plan, whether their sponsor enlisted before or after January 1, 2018, and their status as active duty, retired, or family member. All TRICARE insurance plans for mental health include a variety of treatment options, such as inpatient care, outpatient therapy, prescription medications, and both group and family therapy, with TMS being part of the outpatient mental health benefit.

Is TMS Covered by TRICARE for Veterans and Active-Duty Members?

TRICARE covers TMS therapy for active-duty members and military retirees who meet specific eligibility requirements. Active-duty members across all branches of the military can access TMS therapy as an outpatient treatment for Major Depressive Disorder when a psychiatrist has diagnosed them and has demonstrated treatment resistance by trying at least four different antidepressant medications without success.

Military retirees with TRICARE eligibility, whether through TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, or TRICARE For Life, also have access to this coverage under the same clinical criteria. The treatment is available as part of TRICARE’s mental health benefits package.

TRICARE coverage applies specifically to military retirees and active-duty personnel, not all veterans. Veterans who separated from military service without retiring typically receive their healthcare through the Department of Veterans Affairs system rather than TRICARE. VA coverage policies for TMS may differ from TRICARE’s guidelines.

How Does TMS Compare to Other TRICARE Mental Health Treatments?

TMS therapy stands apart from other TRICARE-covered mental health treatments in several significant ways. Unlike traditional antidepressant medications, TMS is a non-invasive, drug-free therapy that uses magnetic fields to stimulate specific nerve cells in the brain associated with mood regulation. This makes it particularly valuable for military members and their families who may wish to avoid medication side effects or reduce their dependence on pharmaceuticals.

TMS requires no anesthesia and does not necessitate hospitalization, with treatment sessions typically lasting only 20-30 minutes and allowing patients to resume normal activities immediately afterward. While conventional psychotherapy and medications remain the first-line treatments covered by TRICARE for depression, TMS is specifically reserved for patients with treatment-resistant Major Depressive Disorder.

The positioning of TMS within TRICARE’s mental health treatment hierarchy reflects its role as an advanced intervention for complex cases. TRICARE covers a comprehensive range of mental health services, including individual and group therapy, psychiatric consultations, inpatient hospitalization, and various medications as standard treatments. However, TMS is designated as a limited benefit requiring prior authorization, signaling that it is a specialized option after traditional approaches have proven insufficient.",https://momentofclarity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/does-tricare-cover-tms-therapy.jpg,N,0.0,2025-10-24 18:00:02.623275

Washington, DCMany veterans and their families fall outside the VA health system because of VA eligibility restrictions, geographic barriers or other administrative challenges. Even those with VA coverage may depend on some combination of VA coverage, Medicare and Medicaid, particularly as they age and health needs increase.

Medicaid helps close the gaps, especially for those who are low-income, have disabilities or are ineligible for other health coverage.

But the Medicaid cuts included in H.R.1, the so-called “One Big, Beautiful Bill” Act, may threaten those services. Without Medicaid, veterans and their families may find that mental health, substance abuse, preventive care, chronic disease management and in-home services are simply unaffordable or unavailable.

Medicaid cuts

The cuts roll out slowly, cutting federal funding for Medicaid by 15 percent, or $1 trillion, over 10 years. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that these cuts will ultimately result in:

11.8 million individuals directly losing their health insurance coverage under Medicaid;

an additional 3.1 million losing Medicaid coverage under ACA marketplace plans;

another 4.2 million covered under marketplace plans would become uninsured with the expiration later in 2025 of the expanded premium tax credits for purchasing the plans. The plans will simply become unaffordable.

According to the American Psychological Association (APA), the fallout from this last requirement represents the largest component of the cuts, totaling $325.8 billion over 10 years.

Five basic facts about the impact of the cuts – what the numbers say

Medicaid provides health care coverage to 1 in 10 veterans (1.6 million people). For some, it is their only source of coverage, especially if they do not qualify for VA health care or TRICARE. A recent study by KFF provides statistical support for five important, and perhaps underappreciated, facts about veterans and Medicaid:

First, the percentage of veterans who depend on Medicaid, either in whole or in part, has increased over the past decade. As the veteran population changes, so too have the pathways to coverage. The Affordable Care Act created a new avenue for veterans who might otherwise have been uninsured. It expands Medicaid eligibility to nearly all adults with incomes up to 138 percent of the Federal Poverty Level ($21,597 for an individual in 2025). Forty-one states, including DC, have adopted Medicaid expansion, and nearly seven in ten veterans ages 19 and older who have Medicaid coverage live in a state that has expanded Medicaid.

Second, Medicaid often supplements coverage for older vets. Many of today’s veterans served during the Vietnam and Gulf Wars. Medicaid often supplements other types of insurance by covering services that other payers may not, such as long-term care. For veterans who are enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid, Medicaid can help cover premiums and cost- sharing responsibilities, reducing out-of-pocket costs for services like doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescription drugs.

Third, veterans with disabilities are more likely to rely on Medicaid than those who do not have disabilities. Age and disability often go hand-in hand. For vets from 50 to 64, slightly more than half of Medicaid enrollees report having a disability. Veterans 65 and older who have Medicaid coverage report a disability rate of 55 percent.

Fourth, Medicaid supports regular access to care for veterans who have high rates of chronic conditions and complex health needs.

In insurance-speak, “chronic conditions” means long-lasting illnesses or injuries like arthritis, diabetes or certain respiratory diseases. In the same strange legal language, “complex health needs” might mean PTSD, traumatic brain injuries, and chronic pain, as well as respiratory conditions, cancers, and other illnesses linked to burn pits, Agent Orange, and other hazards.

All veterans have high rates of chronic conditions and many, including older vets, have complex and layered health needs. Among veterans covered by Medicaid, 41 percent received mental health or substance use treatment in the past year.

Finally, nearly seven in ten veterans under 65 with Medicaid are working, but work varies by age, disability, and parental status:

the share of veterans who are working declines with age, falling to 59 percent of those ages 50 to 64. The share of veterans with a disability drops to 51 percent.

parents are more likely to be in the workforce than veterans without dependent children, which likely reflects their younger age and lower rates of disability.

Beginning in January 2027, most Medicaid recipients will need to meet work requirements of 80 hours per month through employment, training, or volunteer activities to maintain their coverage. According to the APA, the fallout from this requirement represents the largest component of the cuts, totaling $325.8 billion over ten years.

What’s next?

Because the cuts roll out slowly, Congress may still intervene to lessen the blow to veterans. But, at present, the situation does not look rosy for elderly and disabled veterans, who are among the most vulnerable.

The student, between 16 and 17 years old, confided in a professor, providing detailed testimony and recordings that substantiated the claims.

Swift Action Taken Following Report of Sexual Assault

On October 14, the Walton County Sheriff’s Office said campus police alerted deputies after receiving the professor’s report. Investigators identified 45-year-old Charles Marcello Buono as the suspect and located him at his home.

Confession and Arrest of FL Bus Driver

Initially, Buono denied any wrongdoing, but officials stated he later admitted to being the man in one of the videos submitted as evidence and confirmed the nature of the acts described. He was arrested without incident and booked into the Walton County Jail on charges of lewd and lascivious molestation by an offender 24 years or older on a victim aged 16 or 17.

Sheriff Condemns the Crime

Sheriff Michael Adkinson described the case as deeply disturbing, stating, “What happened here is nothing short of evil. Crimes like this shake our sense of humanity, and we will not rest until justice is served.”

Bus Driver Suspended and Investigation Expands

Buono, a bus driver for the Walton County School District, was immediately suspended following his arrest. District officials confirmed he would be recommended for termination at the next board meeting. He was also employed as a contractor with the Defense Health Agency.

The sheriff’s office clarified that the charges do not stem from Buono’s job as a driver and do not involve students on his bus route. However, investigators said they are reviewing all available information and have not ruled out additional victims.

Victim Praised for Courage

Authorities commended the young victim for her bravery and expressed gratitude to the college staff for responding swiftly and responsibly. To protect the victim’s identity, specific details about the case remain confidential.

Ongoing Investigation After Teen Sexually Abused by Bus Driver

Officials confirmed that the investigation is still active, and additional charges could follow as evidence continues to develop.

Legal Pathways for Families After Bus Driver Abuse Cases

When accusations of abuse involve a trusted school employee, families often face confusion about where to turn next. In this interview, Florida abuse lawyer Michael Haggard discusses the rights of victims and their families, how civil action can run alongside criminal proceedings, and what steps can be taken to hold responsible parties accountable.

Laurence Banville, Esq.: When a situation like this involves a school district employee, what legal steps can families take?

Michael Haggard, Esq.: Families can pursue a civil claim not only against the individual offender but potentially against the school district if there’s evidence of negligence—such as inadequate background checks, poor supervision, or failure to respond to warning signs. These cases aren’t only about compensation but also accountability and change.

Banville: How soon should families reach out for legal help?

Haggard: Immediately. Preserving evidence and witness statements is time-sensitive. An attorney can guide the family on reporting requirements and help ensure their rights are protected throughout the process.

Banville: What would you say to families struggling to decide whether to take action?

Haggard: No one should face this alone. Seeking legal representation helps ensure the system holds those responsible to account and that victims receive support for recovery. Legal action can also drive improvements in safety within schools and transportation programs.

Military beneficiaries in Atlanta can now choose CareSource for help, health",Ellen Eldridge,,,,,https://www.gpb.org/news/2025/10/24/for-us-and-by-us-military-beneficiaries-in-atlanta-can-now-choose-caresource-for,"But, until now, he had no choice about who managed his health care plan.
Eligible beneficiaries of Tricare Prime include active duty, military retirees and their families, families of activated National Guard Reservists and Gold Star families.
During open enrollment from Nov. 10 to Dec. 9, eligible beneficiaries who choose Tricare Prime will now see CareSource as another organization that will manage their health plans.
""So, they have a choice (concerning who manages their health plan),"" Martin said.
Martin compared the health plan to buying an automobile that puts military families in the driver's seat.","Jarrad Turner chose to serve his country as an Army medic, even after serious injuries. But, until now, he had no choice about who managed his health care plan. That forced him to obtain referrals for specialists and change providers when he didn't want to.

A year into his second deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2006, Turner was nearly killed by a rocket-propelled grenade.

""As a result of getting injured, I had to have four shoulder surgeries, two elbow surgeries, two surgeries on my jaw, and I got filleted with a piece of shrapnel,"" Turner said.

The Army treated his physical wounds, but Turner didn't realize the toll his mental health took until he was stationed at Fort Sam in Houston, Texas, as a trainer for medics.

""Unfortunately, that's when traumatic brain injury kind of reared its ugly head,"" and post-traumatic stress disorder took over, he said.

While driving during a thunderstorm, a fallen tree branch in the road stopped Turner's truck.

""I knew it was a branch,"" he said. ""I literally had to get out of my truck and literally touch the branch because I had so much fear that it was going to blow up because I was so accustomed to IEDs and daisy-chained improvised bombs.""

Turner moved to Atlanta when medically retired in 2010 and started Tricare, the military health insurance program.

""People don't answer the phone call,"" he said. ""You might get somebody to respond in a week. And unfortunately, people did not understand who I was or understand what the rest of my brothers and sisters had gone through.""

Eligible beneficiaries of Tricare Prime include active duty, military retirees and their families, families of activated National Guard Reservists and Gold Star families.

Tricare Prime service areas were built around Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) sites.

""We lost Fort McPherson, we lost Fort Gillum, but we have so many military retirees here,"" Turner said.

The health plan is managed by the Defense Health Agency and the Department of Defense, but CareSource Miliary & Veterans’ managed care model is intended to increase access to care, while providing personalized support and engagement, to improve health outcomes and quality of life, Care Source Military and Veterans Associate Vice President Selene Martin, said.

During open enrollment from Nov. 10 to Dec. 9, eligible beneficiaries who choose Tricare Prime will now see CareSource as another organization that will manage their health plans.

""So, they have a choice (concerning who manages their health plan),"" Martin said. ""Atlanta-area beneficiaries have only had a choice one other time in the past five years.""

Martin compared the health plan to buying an automobile that puts military families in the driver's seat.

Tricare Prime is the base of the model of car, she said.

""So, with the pilot, you get the base models, but the enhanced benefits that you get include no network referrals,"" Martin said. ""We know that is a barrier and pain point for our military families.""

Anyone who chooses to see a specialist within the network can go see them, which Turner is excited about because he does not want to lose the mental health providers that he counts on.

""There is anxiety about starting all over again,"" he said. ""How many times do we have to tell the story? I don't want to go to another mental health provider, a physical health provider to retell the story.""

""Finally, we got something that is for us and by us,"" Turner said, adding that the CareSource team reflects what the military community is.

""It's a very diverse team of passionate individuals that live by, clearly live by, our ethos.""",https://www.gpb.org/sites/default/files/styles/three_two_702x468/public/2025-10/jarrad_turner_veteran_caresource.jpg?h=9c4c0580&itok=Kb8av7nk,N,0.0,2025-10-24 11:20:28.460623
