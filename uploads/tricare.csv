NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Tuesday announced that COVID-19 vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women.

In a 58-second video posted on the social media site X, Kennedy said he removed COVID-19 shots from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendations for those groups. No one from the CDC was in the video, and CDC officials referred questions about the announcement to Kennedy and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

U.S. health officials, following recommendations by infectious disease experts, have been urging annual COVID-19 boosters for all Americans ages 6 months and older.

A CDC advisory panel is set to meets in June to make recommendations about the fall shots. Among its options are suggesting shots for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice to get vaccinated.

But Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine advocate before becoming health secretary, decided not to wait. He said that annual COVID-19 booster shots have been recommended for kids “despite the lack of any clinical data” to support that decision.

Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary and Dr. Jay Battacharya, head of the National Institutes of Health, appeared in the video with Kennedy.

Kennedy and other Trump administration appointees have been moving to narrow COVID-19 vaccine recommendations and added restrictions to a recent vaccine approval. Last week, the FDA announced routine COVID-19 vaccine approvals will be limited to seniors and younger people with underlying medical risks, pending new research for healthy adults and children.

HHS officials did not immediately respond to questions about why Kennedy decided to take the step now or release additional information about what went into the decision.

In fiscal year 2023, Tricare contractors paid a total of $183 million for items or services that didn’t have a defined reimbursement rate.
State prevailing rates are established by taking all the billed charges for a service or item in the previous year and separating them by state.
The state prevailing rate is then set at the 80th percentile of the charges for that service or item in each state.
A Tricare spokesperson did not respond to an emailed question about how soon beneficiaries might see a change in costs.","Tricare, the federal health-insurance program for military service members and their families, and the Defense Health Agency that governs it, put beneficiaries at risk of paying much higher costs due to a lack of internal controls, according to an audit conducted by the Department of Justice.

The audit by the Inspector General reviewed financial records across both Tricare’s East and West regions (which includes all 50 states) from November 2023 to February 2025, found that policy did not require federal officials or the company to ensure that rates for services or equipment that don’t already have a defined reimbursement rate were “reasonable or consistent with other states,” and contractors did not have guidance on how to create new rates.

This caused a contractor in Illinois to pay $11,500 for custom sleep apnea mouth guards, a price 283% higher than the cost in neighboring Iowa, according to the audit report. The DHA also allowed rental costs for medical items to far exceed the cost of purchasing, resulting in a contractor paying Tricare $5,000 per month to rent one of two compression devices while the same product was available to rent for $675 per month and another supplier was selling one for $409.50.

Virginia is among the states with higher rental rates than purchasing costs. For a particular compression device, the rental cost per month in Virginia was $4,680 compared to $3,450 to buy it, a 35.7% difference. Connecticut had the highest difference at 100.2%, according to the audit.

In fiscal year 2023, Tricare contractors paid a total of $183 million for items or services that didn’t have a defined reimbursement rate. It’s unclear how much of that total is considered “unreasonable” and how much additional financial burden was passed on to beneficiaries.

“Because the DHA did not determine that the state prevailing rates were reasonable, the DoD is at risk of wasteful spending and increasing DoD beneficiaries’ risk of unreasonable cost-shares for health care services and items that are paid with state prevailing rates,” the audit concludes.

State prevailing rates are established by taking all the billed charges for a service or item in the previous year and separating them by state. The state prevailing rate is then set at the 80th percentile of the charges for that service or item in each state.

The amount the DHA has reimbursed providers for all health care services and items has decreased by 16% since fiscal year 2021 as a result of measures taken in response to prior DOD reviews, according to the audit.

The federal agency issued a policy in July that allows contractors to set payment thresholds to “prevent reimbursement substantially in excess of customary or reasonable charges.”

The Inspector General recommends that the DHA reassess and revise the state prevailing rates in Tricare’s policy to ensure rates are “reasonable,” develop and issue guidance to require an independent party to review the state prevailing rates annually, and implement an oversight mechanism.

DHA has hired a company to monitor the accuracy of payments made by Tricare contractors. In 2022 and 2023, this company found that Tricare had a quarterly error rate of 0.31% or less and 0.4% or less, respectively, across both the East and West regions. These error rates are lower than Tricare’s own maximum allowable error rate of 1.75%.

Once you reach FRA, you can earn unlimited income without reducing your Social Security.","May 27, 2025 — Washington, D.C. | On Memorial Day 2025, Marine Corps veteran and Social Security expert Ed Weir hosted a special live Q&A to answer key questions facing U.S. veterans today. His heartfelt session covered everything from retirement filing and SSDI rules to Medicare pitfalls and surviving spouse benefits, with a powerful reminder to honor those who gave their lives in service.

This article offers a comprehensive breakdown of the key takeaways for veterans and their families.

Do Military Veterans Get Extra Social Security?

Yes—but the extra amount is modest and depends on the years of service:

1940–1956: An additional $160 per month added to past earnings.

1957–1977: $300 per quarter added to earnings (approx. $100/month).

1978–2001: Similar credits continue, but automatically added if SSA verifies military service.

After 2001: No special military wage credits—automatic reporting applies.

Important: If you served in the military and apply online or over the phone, you must report your service dates. If unsure, call the SSA and ask if your DD214 is on file.

Can You Receive Both VA Disability and Social Security Disability?

Yes. You can receive VA disability and SSDI simultaneously—but they are completely separate programs.

VA Disability: Based on service connection; allows you to work.

SSDI (Social Security Disability Insurance): Based on inability to engage in “substantial gainful activity.”

Receiving VA benefits does not guarantee SSDI approval. However, veterans with a 100% permanent and total VA rating or those in the Wounded Warrior program may qualify for expedited processing.

Medicare vs VA Health Care: Should Veterans Pay for Part B?

Many veterans rely solely on VA healthcare, but skipping Medicare Part B can lead to lifetime penalties:

Part B costs $185/month in 2025 (income-based adjustments apply).

If you delay enrollment and lose VA access later, you may:

Wait until the General Enrollment Period (Jan–Mar).

Pay a 10% penalty for each 12-month delay.

Tip: Consider a Medicare Advantage “Give-Back” Plan

Some plans (like Honor or Patriot plans) reduce or pay back part of your Part B premium and allow dual coverage with the VA. Not all include drug coverage—but you can still use the VA pharmacy, which offers excellent low-cost medications.

What If You Have TRICARE for Life?

If you retired from the military, you likely qualify for TRICARE for Life, which acts as your Medicare supplement:

Must enroll in Medicare Part A and B at age 65.

No need for a separate Medicare supplement or Advantage plan.

Just present your TRICARE card + Medicare card at appointments.

Veterans often ask if Advantage plans offer extra benefits. Dr. Ed advises: TRICARE + Original Medicare is sufficient for most.

Survivor & Family Benefits: What Veterans’ Families Should Know

Spouses, widows, and dependent children may be eligible for benefits based on the veteran’s earnings and service history.

Widows aged 60+ can receive reduced survivor benefits (71.5% of PIA).

Disabled widows may apply as early as age 50.

Grandchildren: Only qualify if adopted by the veteran or if both parents are deceased or disabled.

You must apply separately for these benefits through SSA.

Can Working While Receiving Social Security Reduce Benefits?

It depends on your age:

If you start benefits before full retirement age (FRA) and earn over the limit ($23,400 in 2025), SSA may withhold $1 for every $2 over the cap.

Once you reach FRA, you can earn unlimited income without reducing your Social Security.

Even if SSA withholds early checks, you can recover lost value once you reach FRA—your benefit will be recalculated

As Dr. Ed put it:

Free and confidential mental health services

Service members’ ability to regulate emotions in healthy ways plays a crucial part in their ability to cope with challenges. Military OneSource and Military and Family Life Counselors are examples of free and confidential mental health counseling programs that offer military members and their families counseling to address short-term, non-medical concerns. Counselors within these programs are equipped to help service members improve healthy stress management, time management, and decision-making strategies and tools, including the ability to problem solve, manage conflict, build coping skills, and adapt to change. In addition, these programs foster health, resiliency, and readiness.

Military OneSource

Military OneSource is a U.S. Department of Defense program that provides free, short-term, solution-focused, confidential, non-medical counseling services for a wide range of issues, including relationship conflicts, stress management, parenting issues, coping with grief and loss, and managing deployments.

For youth ages 13 to 17, a parent or caregiver must be available to give consent at the start of each counseling session.

For diagnosable conditions and concerns that are best suited for long-term care services not provided through Military OneSource, additional support and treatment options are available through military medical treatment facilities, embedded behavioral health clinics, and Tricare network providers.

According to Military OneSource, the following issues are not appropriate or suitable for its counseling services:

Active suicidal or homicidal thoughts

Military and Family Life Counseling

The Military and Family Life Counseling Program provides free, confidential counseling to service members, their families, and survivors on or near installations. Counselors are licensed to practice independently in the location where they are providing services and are trained to deliver valuable counseling services, briefings, and presentations to the military community. The MFLC program was designed to deploy counselors rapidly for short- and long-term assignments based on each military branch’s specific need.

The MFLC Program provides non-medical counseling for issues requiring short-term attention, including everyday stressors, deployment and reintegration concerns, parenting, grief and loss, and marital issues. MFLCs conduct consultation and outreach services to more than 200 military installations or nearby civilian communities located in most of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories and commonwealths, and over 25 foreign countries including areas considered hazardous duty/danger zones. MFLCs provide support to individuals, couples, families and groups for a range of issues including, but not limited to, deployment stress, reintegration, relocation adjustment, separation, anger management, conflict resolution, parenting, parent-child communication, relationship and family issues, coping skills, homesickness, grief and loss, isolation from extended family members, children coping with the absence of a parent, child education, and spousal employment.

Additionally, there are Child and Youth Behavioral Military and Family Life Counselor programs that specifically provide support to military children and families on topics including, but not limited to, identifying feelings, bullying, conflict resolution, self-esteem, anger management, family concerns, problem-solving, coping with deployment and reunification, transition and moving, sibling and parental relationships, time management, and divorce.

Confidential mental health resources

Confidential counseling provides service members and their loved ones with resources and support to address a variety of issues and build important skills to tackle life's challenges.

Confidential counseling is crucial for the military because it allows service members to seek support openly and discuss personal concerns when needed without fear of repercussions on their career or unit standing. With confidential services, a service member’s personal information is not provided to their military chain of command, shared with family or friends, or released to other agencies. Although services are confidential, one caveat is that counselors are required by law to report illegal activities or situations where there could be danger to the service member or to others. These include suspected domestic violence and child or elder abuse or neglect.

Other benefits of confidential military counseling:

Reduces stigma - By ensuring privacy, it removes the stigma associated with seeking mental health support, making it more likely for service members to access necessary care.

Improves unit cohesion - Addressing personal issues through confidential counseling can help service members better manage their emotions and perform effectively within their unit.

Builds resilience - Open communication with a counselor allows service members to develop coping mechanisms and build resilience against the unique stressors of military life.

Supports family well-being - Confidential counseling is also available for military families, helping them navigate challenges related to deployments, frequent moves, and other stressors.

Provided access to specialized support - Military counseling programs often provide specialized support tailored to military experiences, such as combat trauma or deployment-related issues.

In addition to mental health counseling services, there are apps that promote healthy techniques for managing stress, seeking help with life challenges, addressing health problems, and implementing safety measures against harmful behaviors.

A coverup: Zamora-Quezada dropped any patients who questioned his diagnoses and hired employees he could manipulate over their immigration status. He fabricated records, sometimes took ultrasounds of employees he used as documentation for insurer audits. He hid patient records in a dilapidated barn in the Rio Grande Valley; they were found covered with feces, urine, rodents, and termites.

In total, his scheme involved $118 million in false claims, defrauding $28 million from insurance companies.

Videos by Suggest

According to a press release issued by the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Public Affairs, Zamora-Quezada was found guilty of one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud, seven counts of healthcare fraud, and one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice.

Zamora-Quezada managed to defraud a multitude of insurance companies by falsely diagnosing his patients with rheumatoid arthritis. These include Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and Blue Cross Blue Shield.

He would administer “toxic medications” and make his patients believe they had the disease, which lasts for life and is incurable. That way, his patients were treated continuously at his offices.

To further expand his fraudulent scheme, Zamora-Quezada fabricated medical records. That way, he could effectively lie to his patients’ insurers by claiming they were sick with the aforementioned disease. As previously stated, he managed to secure $118 million in false claims and defrauded $28 million from insurance companies.

‘Unnecessary Treatments’

Following his faux diagnoses, Zamora-Quezada administered “unnecessary treatments” and even ordered equally unnecessary testing. These tests, which included x-rays, MRIs, infusions, and injections, can be fatal due to their potential side effects.

The effects of his reckless and illegal behavior were made evident. Some of his patients suffered serious side effects. These include, but are not limited to, strokes, jawbone necrosis, and liver damage.

“Constantly being in bed and being unable to get up from bed alone, and being pumped with medication, I didn’t feel like my life had any meaning,” one patient testified in court.

Furthermore, Zamora-Quezada also intimidated and manipulated his employees, referring to himself as “eminencia,” or “eminence” in English. He would intentionally hire employees on J-1 visas to have further control over them, threatening their legal status.

“Dr. Zamora-Quezada funded his luxurious lifestyle for two decades by traumatizing his patients, abusing his employees, lying to insurers, and stealing taxpayer money,” Matthew R. Galeotti, Head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, said. “His depraved conduct represents a profound betrayal of trust toward vulnerable patients who depend on care and integrity from their doctors.”",https://www.suggest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Jorge-Zamora-Quezada.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-25 19:56:19.838197

ABA therapy can last for a few months to a few years.
Here's our complete guide to everything you need to know about ABA therapy.","Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is a therapy rooted in the science of learning and behavior. Using principles of ABA, children and adults can learn to improve their communication skills, social skills, and daily living skills while also addressing problematic or challenging behaviors. The primary goal of ABA therapy is to teach helpful skills that promote independence and reduce harmful behaviors. Here's our complete guide to everything you need to know about ABA therapy.

It's a big decision to make for your family! Applied behavior analysis (ABA) seeks to improve communication skills, introduce productive habits, and reduce harmful behaviors. Watch out for ABA providers who look to ""cure"" autism.

High quality ABA therapy does exist where the goal is not to “fix” children, make them appear “less autistic”, or change who they are. The goal is to help people learn all that they can so they can live to their potential while embracing their unique, individual personality traits. Here's our complete guide to start and end ABA therapy.

ABA looks different from other therapy settings. Typically, ABA therapy occurs multiple times a week and can take place in the home, community, or in a clinic setting. Depending on your child's needs, you might need to commit up to 40 hours a week.

ABA therapy can last for a few months to a few years. During that time, children and their families are committed to training and learning together. Therapy ideally ends when children meet their goals. Check out our complete guide for how to start and end ABA therapy.

ABA is usually covered by insurance if you have an autism diagnosis. Autism is typically the only diagnosis insurance will authorize for ABA services since its benefits have been researched extensively.

Always check with your specific insurance plan to confirm that ABA is covered for your child’s diagnoses and that the provider you are seeking care at is in-network.

Become a Daily Caller Patriot today.","Readers,

Instead of sucking up to the political and corporate powers that dominate America, The Daily Caller is fighting for you — our readers. We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.

Now that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate media and joining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes to marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; senators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want to limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our independence.

We don't complain -- we can't stand complainers -- but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our hands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.

We're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates them -- because we won’t bend the knee to political correctness.

One reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of our being, and we think she's worth saving from today’s craziness.

Help us save her.

A second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train. We have trained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political spectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There’s a good chance they were trained at Daily Caller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, Newsmax, Daily Wire and many others.

Simply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a fair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.

Since 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. And we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible to ignore.

We can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can’t do it unless you — the everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment — have our back.

Please consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, corporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new generation of news reporters who will actually tell the truth. And help us remind Americans everywhere that there are millions of us who remain clear-eyed about our country's greatness.

In return for membership, Daily Caller Patriots will be able to read The Daily Caller without any of the ads that we have long used to support our mission. We know the ads drive you crazy. They drive us crazy too. But we need revenue to keep the fight going. If you join us, we will cut out the ads for you and put every Lincoln-headed cent we earn into amplifying our voice, training even more solid reporters, and giving you the ad-free experience and lightning fast website you deserve.

Patriots will also be eligible for Patriots Only content, newsletters, chats and live events with our reporters and editors. It's simple: welcome us into your lives, and we'll welcome you into ours.

We can save America together.

I have both and use VA almost exclusively as they take care of me far more thoroughly than private practices. I use tricare only for things that need to happen within weeks.

Ultimately its your decision based off your circumstances but myth of ""If I go to VA they will take my rating"" needs to die.

I am 100% PT left in 2005 have always used VA. No issues but I know many people who can’t find Tricare providers.. I don’t accept it myself at my practice as it pays less than I pay my clinicians.. but I see almost anyone I want with the VA. I often get sent to community care when requesting a specific clinician based upon my medical needs

VA medical is through the VHA. Our ratings come from the VBA. There is no automatic reporting from one to the other. Ratings get changed due to audits (due to mistakes/errors) or because someone files for an increase and they determine that a change (either increase or decrease is necessary). Going to the VA for medical won’t get you reduced.

I thought the same thing. I was never gonna go to the VA after I got my 100%. But, the VA near me is very good and has a lot of availability, plus getting meds shipped to home is a big plus for me. I've also seen my primary care thru Tricare and it was just as seamless. Whenever I need an issue addressed I just see whichever one has availability first and go there.

The 3 times a week is a lot of times to keep people healing because they don’t do the exercises at home.

I'm going to be no real help here. Yes, the $51 copay is ridiculous. I surprised your spouse gets a lesser copay on Retired Select. Mine does not. I spent a lot of time in PT last year and my husband between late last year and now this year.

I'm not sure why Tricare buckets PT visits within the ""specialist"" fee. It should not be. At a minimum, it should be the rate you'd pay for a routine GP visit.

Unfortunately, it is our Congress that sets the terms of Tricare and I've often though I needed to write a letter to my representative about this but then I forget. Your post has reminded me, and you should do the same. It won't fix things today, but maybe down the road.

That said, the other poster had a good idea of trying out an out-of-network provider. My costs always seem lower when I go that route, though I haven't tried it for PT becuase they all seem to be providers in my area.

Once retired, the costs are the same, so you don't cost more than your spouse. Are either of you employed with a company that has a healthcare FSA? I fund mine and the full amount is available January 1, but the money is taken from my paychecks throughout the year, so it ends up being a tax free /interest free loan. Sounds like you will hit the catastrophic max each year, so know that will be a relief at some point.

At Sober First Recovery, we offer virtual care designed specifically for veterans, recognizing that life doesn’t pause for recovery. Using secure telehealth platforms, veterans can connect with therapists, join group sessions, and access essential recovery tools from the comfort and privacy of home. This model helps remove common obstacles such as long travel distances, lack of local providers, and demanding personal schedules while making room for consistent, accessible support that fits into real life.

What Is Virtual Addiction Treatment?

Virtual addiction treatment, sometimes referred to as online rehab or telehealth, uses video conferencing technology to deliver therapy and counseling services remotely. Sober First Recovery provides a full spectrum of care online, including intensive outpatient programming (IOP), mental health support, individual counseling, group therapy, and family support. All services are facilitated by licensed clinicians who are experienced in working with military populations and understand the unique issues veterans often carry into recovery.

Whether you’re newly sober or continuing care after inpatient treatment, our online programs deliver structure and accountability without requiring you to step into a facility.

Built for Veterans, Wherever They Are

Veterans face unique mental health and substance use challenges. PTSD, depression, chronic pain, and isolation can all contribute to a cycle of alcohol or drug misuse. But accessing the right kind of help isn’t always easy. VA waitlists can be long. Local resources may be scarce. And not every therapist truly understands the psychological weight of military service.

That’s where our virtual program makes a difference. Every aspect is created with veterans in mind. From the group topics we explore to our clinical techniques, the care is relevant, respectful, and grounded in an understanding of military life.

What to Expect from Virtual Addiction Treatment

Virtual addiction treatment at Sober First Recovery offers the same level of clinical care and structure as our in-person services. The main difference is that you log in from your home instead of driving to a facility.

Here’s what our online program includes:

Intensive Outpatient Programming (IOP)

Our virtual IOP runs three to five days per week and provides a blend of individual therapy, group counseling, and mental health services. Sessions are scheduled to work around your job, caregiving, or time zone, making it easier to stick with treatment. The program is ideal for veterans who need consistent support but also want to maintain their responsibilities at home or work.

Individual Therapy

These one-on-one sessions focus on the specific factors fueling your substance use. Whether it’s combat trauma, moral injury, grief, or unresolved family issues, your therapist will work with you to identify patterns and develop healthier ways to cope. These conversations are private and centered on helping you move forward at a pace that works for you.

Group Therapy

Group sessions offer a chance to connect with other veterans who’ve walked similar paths. Topics often include post-traumatic stress, anxiety, guilt, reintegration after service, and relapse prevention. The shared experience creates a sense of solidarity that many veterans say is hard to find elsewhere.

Family Counseling

Substance use affects more than just the person struggling—it ripples through families and relationships. Our virtual program includes optional family sessions to help rebuild trust, open up communication, and address the impact of addiction on loved ones.

Privacy and Security

We use secure, HIPAA-compliant video conferencing tools that protect your health information and provide a safe, private space to engage in therapy. All you need is a device with a camera and internet access. Our support team will walk you through the setup and answer any tech questions you may have.

Who Benefits from Virtual Care?

While anyone seeking recovery can benefit from online treatment, there are certain circumstances where virtual care is especially helpful:

Living in a rural or remote location without easy access to in-person services

Juggling work or family obligations that make it difficult to attend scheduled on-site sessions

Recovering from physical injuries or disabilities that limit mobility

Feeling more comfortable receiving care in a familiar environment

Needing continued support for addiction recovery or mental health after completing residential or partial hospitalization treatment

Veterans who prefer more privacy or who are hesitant about group settings often find that virtual care offers a less intimidating way to begin the recovery process. It’s also a good fit for those who value structure but need more control over their schedule.

A Clinical Approach to Military-Focused Care

Sober First Recovery’s virtual care team includes licensed professionals who bring experience in trauma-informed treatment and military cultural competence. They know that healing from addiction often means addressing the invisible wounds of service—memories that don’t fade, habits that were once survival tools but no longer serve you, and the internal battles that follow even after discharge.

Our clinicians aren’t just generalists applying standard techniques. They are trained to help veterans process trauma, regulate emotions, and build resilience using therapeutic models that include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), EMDR, and others.

A Bridge Between VA Services and Civilian Care

We understand that many veterans have already engaged with VA healthcare or received VA benefits. Our virtual program can complement your VA services or act as a bridge if you’re on a waitlist or looking for more immediate care.

When appropriate and with your consent, our team can coordinate with your primary care providers or VA caseworkers to share treatment progress, avoid gaps in support, and contribute to a broader picture of your health and recovery.

Healing Without Barriers

One of the biggest advantages of virtual addiction and mental health treatment is the ability to stay engaged in recovery without putting your life on hold. You don’t have to quit your job, arrange childcare, or relocate to attend a facility. You don’t even need to leave your living room.

This accessibility matters. Because addiction doesn’t wait for the “perfect” time to get better, it doesn’t accommodate your calendar. But with the right support system in place, you can start making progress today—even if your circumstances are less than ideal.

Getting Started Is Easy

We know reaching out for help is hard. It requires honesty, vulnerability, and a willingness to imagine something different. But we’ve made the rest as simple as possible.

All it takes is a phone call or online inquiry to get started. Our admissions team will guide you through the process, verify your insurance coverage, and help you decide whether virtual treatment is the right fit. There’s no pressure, judgment, or hoops to jump through.

Once enrolled, we’ll set you up with the necessary links, provide a short orientation, and match you with a care team that will support you every step of the way.
