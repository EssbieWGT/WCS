(NASDAQ: GRAL) has emerged as a pivotal player in the race to revolutionize cancer diagnostics through its liquid biopsy technology.
Analyst Price Target: A Calculated Bet on Future Potential The $40.50 price target, led by Kyle Mikson of Canaccord Genuity ($43.00), hinges on several factors: 1.

(NASDAQ: GRAL) has emerged as a pivotal player in the race to revolutionize cancer diagnostics through its liquid biopsy technology. The company's recent financial results and strategic advancements have not only validated its mission but also spurred a surge in investor confidence, reflected in a revised price target of $40.50—a 23.4% upside from its current trading price. This analysis explores how GRAIL's progress in early cancer detection is reshaping the industry and whether the optimism is justified.

Financial Performance: Growth Amidst Strategic Restructuring

GRAIL's Q2 2025 earnings report underscored a mix of resilience and transformation. Total revenue rose 11% year-over-year to $35.5 million, driven by a 22% increase in Galleri test revenue to $34.4 million. The U.S. market accounted for $34.2 million of this growth, with test sales surging 29% year-over-year to over 45,000 units. These figures highlight the growing adoption of GRAIL's flagship product, which detects multiple cancers from a single blood draw.

However, the company's path to profitability remains challenging. A net loss of $114 million in Q2 2025, while a 93% improvement from the $1.52 billion loss in Q2 2024, still reflects the heavy costs of R&D and commercialization. The impairment of Illumina acquisition-related intangible assets ($28 million) and a gross loss of $17.8 million further illustrate the financial hurdles. Yet, GRAIL's cash reserves—$606.1 million as of June 30, 2025—provide a buffer, with updated cash burn guidance of $310 million for 2025. This suggests a disciplined approach to capital allocation, critical for sustaining long-term innovation.

Clinical and Commercial Momentum: The Catalyst for Optimism

GRAIL's recent clinical updates have been a game-changer. The PATHFINDER 2 study, analyzing 25,578 participants, reported a significant jump in positive predictive value (PPV)—a key metric for diagnostic accuracy—without compromising specificity or cancer signal origin (CSO) accuracy. These results, coupled with positive outcomes from the NHS-Galleri trial, position GRAIL to submit data to the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2025 Congress. Such validation is crucial for gaining regulatory and payer trust.

Commercially, the company has expanded access through partnerships like the one with Everlywell, enabling direct-to-consumer sales via prescription, and with Quest Diagnostics, integrating Galleri into a national testing network. Additionally, TRICARE's decision to cover the Galleri test for high-risk adults over 50 has broadened its addressable market. These moves address a critical bottleneck: reimbursement. With payers increasingly recognizing the value of early detection, GRAIL's revenue trajectory appears poised for acceleration.

Analyst Price Target: A Calculated Bet on Future Potential

The $40.50 price target, led by Kyle Mikson of Canaccord Genuity ($43.00), hinges on several factors:

1. Scientific Validation: PATHFINDER 2 results and NHS-Galleri data strengthen GRAIL's case for FDA approval and broader adoption.

2. Operational Efficiency: A 93% reduction in net losses and improved cash burn guidance signal better cost management.

3. Market Expansion: Partnerships and TRICARE coverage are unlocking new revenue streams.

4. Investor Sentiment: The stock's 108.4% year-to-date gain in 2025 reflects growing confidence in GRAIL's ability to disrupt traditional cancer screening.

Analysts project GRAIL could reach $217 million in revenue by 2028, assuming 18.4% annual growth. While ambitious, this forecast assumes continued progress in payer negotiations and regulatory milestones. The $40.50 target also implies a valuation that accounts for the company's leadership in a high-growth sector, despite current losses.

Risks and Realities

Investors must weigh GRAIL's potential against risks. The company remains unprofitable, and reimbursement challenges persist. Regulatory delays or clinical setbacks could derail momentum. Additionally, competition from rivals like Exact Sciences (maker of Cologuard) and emerging startups could fragment market share.

Investment Thesis: A High-Risk, High-Reward Play

GRAIL's progress in liquid biopsy technology is undeniably transformative. The Galleri test's ability to detect over 50 cancers with a single blood draw addresses a critical unmet need in oncology. For investors with a long-term horizon, the company's strong cash position, clinical validation, and strategic partnerships justify the optimism. However, the path to profitability is not without potholes.

The $40.50 price target reflects a belief in GRAIL's ability to scale its commercial model and secure broader reimbursement. While the stock's current valuation incorporates significant upside, it also demands patience. Investors should monitor key metrics: test adoption rates, payer coverage expansions, and regulatory updates.

Conclusion

GRAIL, Inc. is at a pivotal juncture. Its liquid biopsy technology has the potential to redefine cancer diagnostics, but success depends on navigating financial, regulatory, and competitive challenges. The recent price target increase to $40.50 is a vote of confidence in the company's vision and execution. For investors willing to bet on innovation, GRAIL offers a compelling, albeit speculative, opportunity. However, prudence is advised: this is a high-stakes game where the rewards are tied to the company's ability to turn scientific promise into commercial reality.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,0.0,2025-08-16 10:56:13.081679

The stock ranked 496th in market activity, reflecting heightened investor interest. This momentum followed the company’s engagement at the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium (MHSRS), where it advanced discussions with U.S. government agencies on deploying Entolimod as a radiation countermeasure for military personnel. Key meetings included representatives from BARDA, AFRRI, and the MCDC, all aligned with the Department of Defense’s focus on CBRN defense solutions.

Tivic’s leadership emphasized the strategic value of these discussions, highlighting Entolimod’s potential to protect warfighters from radiation exposure. The product, currently in late-stage development with Fast Track designation, has drawn attention for its role in addressing unmet medical needs in military contexts. The MHSRS symposium provided direct access to funding bodies and decision-makers, reinforcing the company’s position in a niche but critical therapeutic area. Executives noted the importance of these collaborations in accelerating regulatory and commercial pathways for Entolimod.

Investor optimism appears tied to the perceived progress in military partnerships, despite Tivic’s broader financial challenges. The company’s dual-platform approach—combining biopharmaceuticals and bioelectronics—remains centered on Entolimod’s development, while its ncVNS device is in early-stage trials. However, the stock’s recent performance underscores market speculation around potential contracts, even as structural risks such as regulatory hurdles and funding dependencies persist.

The strategy of buying the top 500 stocks by daily trading volume and holding them for one day from 2022 to 2025 delivered moderate returns.

Balance billing occurs when a provider bills a TRICARE beneficiary for any amount more than the TRICARE-allowable charge after TRICARE has processed the claim.

TRICARE prohibits the practice of balance billing. Balance billing requirements apply to both network and non-network providers who treat TRICARE beneficiaries, and noncompliance can impact your TRICARE and/or Medicare status. TRICARE encourages both network and non-network providers to explore all available options to resolve claims issues without involving a debt collection agency.

Moonlighting

Moonlighting is the practice of healthcare professionals providing services outside of their position under TRICARE.

There are limited circumstances where moonlighting providers are permitted to treat TRICARE beneficiaries, such as providing emergency services.

Some providers employed full-time by the DOD may receive permission to moonlight, or work in the civilian sector as a second job, if they have Commander approval. Only active duty military providers and General Schedule (GS) civil service providers are eligible for moonlighting. These providers may not treat TRICARE beneficiaries and bill for such services while moonlighting. This restriction includes civilian health care entities who employ moonlighting providers and knowingly bill TRICARE for beneficiaries seen by active duty military or GS civil service providers.

Hold Harmless

If a beneficiary received any excluded or excludable services from a network provider, that provider must not require payment (i.e., the beneficiary will be held harmless) with the following exceptions:

If the beneficiary did not inform the provider that they are a TRICARE beneficiary, the provider may bill the beneficiary for services provided.

The patient is advised in writing that TRICARE does not cover the non-covered procedure, and the patient accepts financial liability. An agreement to pay must be reflected in the written records such as:

Provider notes written prior to receipt of the services

Statement or letter written by the beneficiary before receipt of the services

Statements written by both the beneficiary and provider following receipt of the services

Network pharmacies are not subject to Hold Harmless provisions; the beneficiary may appeal such a denial.

General agreements to pay, such as those signed by the beneficiary at the time of admission, are not evidence that the beneficiary knew specific services were excluded or excludable.

In their participation agreements with TRICARE, certified marriage and family therapists agree to hold eligible beneficiaries harmless for non-covered care.",https://tricare.triwest.com/Static/tricare-favicon.ico,N,0.0,2025-08-16 02:56:15.657865

“You can lower your health care costs when you see Medicare participating providers who accept the Medicare-approved amount as full payment,” said Anne Breslin, TRICARE For Life Program Manager at the Defense Health Agency. “Always prepare to show your Medicare card along with your Military ID card at any medical appointment.”

How do I find the right provider?

TFL is Medicare-wraparound coverage for TRICARE beneficiaries who have Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B. You can see three types of providers. This is described in the TRICARE For Life Handbook.

Medicare participating providers. They accept the Medicare-approved amount as full payment. Seeing these providers will result in the lowest costs.

Medicare nonparticipating providers. They don’t accept the Medicare amount as full payment. They can charge up to 15% more than Medicare allows. TRICARE covers this extra cost.

Opt-out providers. They don’t work with Medicare at all. You’ll pay much more when you see these providers. Medicare won’t pay anything. TRICARE only pays what it normally would. This is about 20% of the TRICARE-allowable charge. You pay the rest.

How do Medicare and TRICARE pay?

Medicare is generally your primary payer. Are you seeing a Medicare participating or Medicare nonparticipating provider? If so, then you have no out-of-pocket costs for services covered by both Medicare and TFL. Most health care services fall into this category. Medicare pays its portion of the claim, TRICARE pays the remaining amount, and you pay nothing.

Sometimes, TRICARE is your primary insurance. In this case, you must see TRICARE-authorized providers. This occurs when:

Medicare doesn’t cover the service.

You’re in overseas locations.

Can I get Department of Defense care?

You can get care at military hospitals and clinics if space is available.

How does Department of Veterans Affairs care work?

VA providers can’t bill Medicare. If you see a VA provider for care that isn’t related to a service-connected condition, you’ll pay about 80% of the bill. TRICARE only pays up to 20%. Want to see a VA provider? Call the TFL contractor, WPS Military and Veterans Health, at 866-773-0404 to check your coverage before you go.

What about care overseas?

Do you live overseas? You can usually see any civilian provider. You’ll need to pay up front and file your own claim. In the Philippines, you must see certified providers.

For emergencies overseas, try military hospitals first. If none are available, go to the nearest emergency care facility. Call the TRICARE Overseas regional call center within 24 hours if you’re admitted.

How do I get emergency and urgent care?

When getting emergency or urgent care, always show your Medicare card along with your Military ID card.

Do you need emergency care? Emergency care means care for an illness or injury that threatens your life, limb, sight, or safety. If you reasonably believe you have an emergency, always call 911 or your international emergency number. Or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Do you need urgent care? Urgent care treats conditions that need attention within 24 hours but aren’t life-threatening. Examples include sprains or rising fevers.

Are virtual health care visits covered?

You can get virtual health care via phone or video appointments. Medicare covers these visits when your provider accepts Medicare. TRICARE pays first if Medicare doesn’t cover the virtual health service.

Is mental health care covered?

Medicare covers visits with these mental health providers:

Psychiatrists and other doctors

Clinical psychologists

Clinical social workers

Clinical nurse specialists

Nurse practitioners

Physician assistants

What about services that need pre-authorization?

Some services need pre-authorization before you get care. These include:

Dental care for medical conditions

Home health care

Hospice care

Organ transplants

Some prescription drugs

Contact WPS if you have questions about pre-authorization requirements.

Remember! Seeing Medicare participating providers gives you the lowest out-of-pocket costs.

(Nasdaq: TIVC), a diversified therapeutics company, is proud to announce it advanced discussions with key US Government agencies through its participation in the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium (MHSRS), held August 4-7, 2025, in Kissimmee, Florida. The MHSRS is the Department of Defense’s premier scientific meeting that brings together military, academic, and industry experts to discuss medical research and innovation in support of warfighter health and readiness.

Direct Access to DoD Decision-Makers and Researchers

MHSRS provides direct access to organizations seeking military partnerships and connects companies with key funding organizations. Tivic’s President of Biopharma and Chief Operating Officer, Michael Handley, met with key members of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI) and the Medical CBRN Defense Consortium (MCDC) to discuss potential pathways to deploy Entolimod as a military countermeasure.

BARDA’s mission is to develop medical countermeasures that address the public health and medical consequences of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) accidents, incidents and attacks, pandemic influenza, and emerging infectious diseases. AFRRI’s mission is to defend the Nation from nuclear and radiological threats through research, leadership, training, and education. The MCDC was formed in response to the US Government’s expressed interest to engage and fund advanced development efforts to support the Department of Defense’s (DoD) medical pharmaceutical and diagnostic requirements as related to enhancing the mission effectiveness of military personnel.

“It was an honor to contribute to the vital conversations that were focused generally on radiation medical countermeasures, and specifically on our lead clinical product candidate, Entolimod, which has the potential to protect the warfighter in the instance that they are exposed to radiation,” said Handley.

Representatives from Tivic joined global thought leaders, military leaders and researchers to share insights, explore collaborative opportunities, and present ongoing research intended to improve health outcomes for warfighters exposed to radiation in the field.

About MHSRS

MHSRS serves as a dynamic platform for the exchange of research findings across multiple disciplines, including combat casualty care, medical countermeasures, infectious disease, and mental health. The symposium fosters collaboration among business leaders, scientists, clinicians, and policymakers, ensuring innovations reach those who serve as quickly and effectively as possible.

About Tivic

Tivic’s dual platform utilizes the body’s biopharmaceutical and bioelectronic systems to treat unmet medical needs through targeting the immune system.

Tivic’s biologics compounds activate an innate immune pathway to prevent cell death in the bone marrow and epithelial tissues across systems impacted by radiation and age. The company's lead drug candidate, Entolimod™ for acute radiation syndrome, is a novel TLR5 agonist that has been granted Fast Track designation and is in late stage development.

Tivic’s bioelectronic program is developing a novel, non-invasive medical device designed to target the neural pathways implicated in many prevalent and debilitating diseases. Early trials show promising signals that Tivic’s approach may regulate specific biologic responses, and the company believes its early-stage vagus nerve stimulation device has the potential to deliver clinical outcomes similar to or better than those of surgically implanted devices.

• TIVC surges 15% intraday to $4.025, rebounding from a $3.80 low to a $5.60 high.

• Turnover skyrockets to 37.6M shares, 3,476% above average.

• Company announces military radiation defense talks at MHSRS, sparking strategic optimism.

Tivic Health (TIVC) has ignited a dramatic 15% rally amid a volatile trading session, driven by a mix of regulatory engagement and biopharma pipeline updates. The stock’s sharp rebound from a $3.80 intraday low to a $5.60 high reflects investor speculation around its Entolimod program’s military applications. With turnover surging to 37.6M shares and a 52-week range of $2.43–$15.64, the move underscores a critical juncture for the biotech firm as it pivots toward biopharma.

Military Health Symposium Sparks Strategic Optimism

TIVC’s 15% intraday surge is directly tied to its participation in the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium (MHSRS), where it advanced discussions with the DoD, BARDA, and AFRRI on Entolimod’s potential as a radiation countermeasure. The company’s leadership highlighted Entolimod’s Fast Track designation and its alignment with military health priorities, fueling speculation about future contracts or funding. Additionally, the stock’s rebound follows a Q2 earnings call announcement, which investors interpreted as a transparency boost. While the ClearUP product line’s revenue decline remains a drag, the biopharma pivot has rekindled speculative interest.

Biotechnology Sector Mixed as AMGN Leads

The biotech sector showed mixed momentum, with Amgen (AMGN) rising 1.18% as a sector leader. TIVC’s 15% rally outperformed peers like Biomerica (BMRA, -11.68%) and Trinity Biotech (TRIB, -19.37%), reflecting its unique focus on military biopharma. However, the broader sector’s cautious tone, driven by regulatory risks and R&D setbacks, limits TIVC’s upside unless Entolimod’s pipeline gains concrete validation.

Technical Divergence and ETF Correlation Analysis

• 200-day average: $2.355 (well below current price)

• RSI: 32.62 (oversold territory)

• MACD: -0.152 (bearish signal)

• Bollinger Bands: Price at $4.025 near lower band ($2.866)

TIVC’s technicals present a paradox: the RSI suggests oversold conditions, while the MACD and 200-day average indicate a long-term downtrend. A short-term bounce above the $4.48 upper Bollinger Band could trigger a 5–7% rally, but the 200-day MA at $2.355 remains a critical support level. Given the absence of leveraged ETFs and a void in options liquidity, traders should focus on swing trading setups. A breakout above $4.48 could validate bullish momentum, while a retest of the $3.675 middle Bollinger Band offers a risk-managed entry. The lack of options data precludes precise contract recommendations, but a 5% upside scenario (targeting $4.226) suggests limited upside potential for hypothetical calls.

Backtest Tivic Health Stock Performance

The 15% intraday surge in TIVC has historically led to mixed short-to-medium-term performance. While the win rates for 3 to 10 days following the surge are relatively high, indicating a higher probability of positive returns in the immediate aftermath, the overall returns over 30 days and the maximum return during this period suggest that the surge may not always translate into sustained long-term gains.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,0.0,2025-08-15 12:56:19.767510

The symposium is a premier scientific event organized by the Department of Defense, focusing on medical research and innovations to support warfighter health and readiness.

Tivic Health's President of Biopharma and Chief Operating Officer, Michael Handley, engaged with major entities such as the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI), and the Medical CBRN Defense Consortium (MCDC). These discussions center on deploying Entolimod as a military countermeasure against radiation exposure. BARDA focuses on developing medical responses to CBRN threats, AFRRI is tasked with defending the nation from nuclear threats, and MCDC supports advanced development efforts for DoD’s medical needs.

Entolimod is a TLR5 agonist designed to activate innate immune pathways and prevent cell death from radiation exposure. Currently, in late-stage development, it has been granted Fast Track designation. The symposium provided a dynamic platform for sharing insights and exploring collaborative opportunities aimed at improving health outcomes for military personnel exposed to radiation in combat scenarios.

The MHSRS is the Department of Defense’s premier scientific meeting that brings together military, academic, and industry experts to discuss medical research and innovation in support of warfighter health and readiness.

Direct Access to DoD Decision-Makers and Researchers

MHSRS provides direct access to organizations seeking military partnerships and connects companies with key funding organizations. Tivic’s President of Biopharma and Chief Operating Officer, Michael Handley, met with key members of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI) and the Medical CBRN Defense Consortium (MCDC) to discuss potential pathways to deploy Entolimod as a military countermeasure.

BARDA’s mission is to develop medical countermeasures that address the public health and medical consequences of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) accidents, incidents and attacks, pandemic influenza, and emerging infectious diseases. AFRRI’s mission is to defend the Nation from nuclear and radiological threats through research, leadership, training, and education. The MCDC was formed in response to the US Government’s expressed interest to engage and fund advanced development efforts to support the Department of Defense’s (DoD) medical pharmaceutical and diagnostic requirements as related to enhancing the mission effectiveness of military personnel.

“It was an honor to contribute to the vital conversations that were focused generally on radiation medical countermeasures, and specifically on our lead clinical product candidate, Entolimod, which has the potential to protect the warfighter in the instance that they are exposed to radiation,” said Handley.

Representatives from Tivic joined global thought leaders, military leaders and researchers to share insights, explore collaborative opportunities, and present ongoing research intended to improve health outcomes for warfighters exposed to radiation in the field.

About MHSRS

MHSRS serves as a dynamic platform for the exchange of research findings across multiple disciplines, including combat casualty care, medical countermeasures, infectious disease, and mental health. The symposium fosters collaboration among business leaders, scientists, clinicians, and policymakers, ensuring innovations reach those who serve as quickly and effectively as possible.

About Tivic

Tivic’s dual platform utilizes the body’s biopharmaceutical and bioelectronic systems to treat unmet medical needs through targeting the immune system.

Tivic’s biologics compounds activate an innate immune pathway to prevent cell death in the bone marrow and epithelial tissues across systems impacted by radiation and age. The company's lead drug candidate, Entolimod™ for acute radiation syndrome, is a novel TLR5 agonist that has been granted Fast Track designation and is in late stage development.

Tivic’s bioelectronic program is developing a novel, non-invasive medical device designed to target the neural pathways implicated in many prevalent and debilitating diseases. Early trials show promising signals that Tivic’s approach may regulate specific biologic responses, and the company believes its early-stage vagus nerve stimulation device has the potential to deliver clinical outcomes similar to or better than those of surgically implanted devices.

​LOS ANGELES, Aug. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Portnoy Law Firm advises Zynex, Inc. (“Zynex” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ:ZYXI) investors that the firm has initiated an investigation into possible securities fraud and may file a class action on behalf of investors. Zynex investors that lost money on their investment are encouraged to contact Lesley Portnoy, Esq.

Investors are encouraged to contact attorney Lesley F. Portnoy, by phone 310-692-8883 or email: info@portnoylaw.com, to discuss their legal rights, or click here to join the case. The Portnoy Law Firm can provide a complimentary case evaluation and discuss investors’ options for pursuing claims to recover their losses.

The complaint alleges that the Individual Defendants artificially inflated Zynex’s stock price by issuing, or causing to be issued, false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s financial performance, operational practices, and compliance with insurance reimbursement policies. In particular, Defendants concealed a systemic “oversupplying scheme” under which Zynex shipped excessive quantities of supplies, including electrode pads and batteries, to patients and billed insurers for amounts far exceeding what was necessary. These undisclosed practices drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare—the federal health insurer for the military—which accounted for approximately 20% to 25% of Zynex’s annual revenue.

The truth began to emerge on March 11, 2025, when Zynex issued a press release announcing its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results, disclosing a significant revenue shortfall attributed to “slower than normal payments from certain payers” and revealing that “Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.” The disclosure that Tricare—representing a substantial portion of the Company’s revenue—was scrutinizing prior claims threatened Zynex’s financial stability.

On March 12, 2025, Zynex’s stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share, erasing significant shareholder value and reflecting the market’s reaction to the Company’s previously undisclosed regulatory and financial risks.

The Portnoy Law Firm can provide a complimentary case evaluation and discuss investors’ options for pursuing claims to recover their losses.

The complaint alleges that the Individual Defendants artificially inflated Zynex’s stock price by issuing, or causing to be issued, false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s financial performance, operational practices, and compliance with insurance reimbursement policies. In particular, Defendants concealed a systemic “oversupplying scheme” under which Zynex shipped excessive quantities of supplies, including electrode pads and batteries, to patients and billed insurers for amounts far exceeding what was necessary. These undisclosed practices drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare—the federal health insurer for the military—which accounted for approximately 20% to 25% of Zynex’s annual revenue.

The truth began to emerge on March 11, 2025, when Zynex issued a press release announcing its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results, disclosing a significant revenue shortfall attributed to “slower than normal payments from certain payers” and revealing that “Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.” The disclosure that Tricare—representing a substantial portion of the Company’s revenue—was scrutinizing prior claims threatened Zynex’s financial stability.

On March 12, 2025, Zynex’s stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share, erasing significant shareholder value and reflecting the market’s reaction to the Company’s previously undisclosed regulatory and financial risks.

Currently, the RMTK suite does not address blast overpressure exposure mitigation.
Such applications promise to improve the DOD’s understanding of blast overpressure exposure effects.","FORT DETRICK, Md. — The Blast Overpressure Tool, an application developed by the DOD Blast Injury Research Coordinating Office to help minimize warfighters’ exposure to the shock waves created by the firing of heavy weapons, now incorporates data on the DOD’s highest-priority weapons systems and is ready for use in training activities. This marks a key milestone in the evolution of the tool for providing safe and effective weapons training that protects warfighters from blast-related injury – thereby improving their readiness, resilience and effectiveness on the battlefield.

The BOP Tool’s library now includes blast exposure profiles for all fifteen weapons systems designated as “Tier 1” by the Defense Health Agency in its landmark 2023 medical study of the health effects of blast exposure on service members. This category consists of the shoulder mounted and .50 caliber weapons, indirect fire systems, and breachers used most regularly by the armed services.

“This is an important milestone, because now the BOP Tool is available to inform critical military training decisions,” says Dr. Raj Gupta, BIRCO’s deputy director. “This accomplishment would not have been possible without the collaborative efforts of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, the Uniformed Services University’s Combat and Training Queryable Exposure/Event Repository project, and our other partners.”

BIRCO director Col. Matthew Scherer and Gupta co-moderated a breakout session on “Blast Overpressure Exposure and Blast Induced TBI Mechanism, Prevention, and Treatment” at the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium in Kissimmee, Florida Aug. 4-7. The session featured updates on research from across the DOD on protecting brain health from the effects of the shock waves caused by the firing of heavy weapons. Gupta and his BIRCO colleagues also presented several posters on the BOP Tool and the health risks associated with blast exposure during MHSRS. They were among over 200 DHA R&D-MRDC experts in military infectious diseases, combat casualty care, military operational medicine, chemical biological defense, and clinical and rehabilitative medicine who attended the annual event, the DOD's premier medical science research and development meeting. To see photos of DHA R&D-MRDC’s participation in this year’s MHSRS, visit the event’s Flickr album.

An emerging body of evidence suggests that repeated exposure to shock waves from the firing of heavy weapons, called blast overpressure, contributes to impaired cognitive, sensory, and motor performance, degraded reaction time and decision-making ability, and other adverse health effects. To help address this concern, in 2017 Congress instructed the Secretary of Defense to undertake a medical study of blast overpressure exposure on service members. BIRCO supported the effort by collecting and analyzing available information and emerging research on the health and performance effects of blast overpressure resulting from the firing of heavy weapons and explosions. The analysis identified a gap in how information about blast overpressure exposure is communicated to service members.

The BOP Tool provides training range managers, range safety officers, and instructors with easy-to-understand guidance on how to position personnel to minimize their exposure to blast overpressure from shoulder-mounted assault weapons, indirect fire systems, rifles, machine guns, and breaching charges. Users can place computer models of the shock wave patterns of individual weapons into a model of the training environment to see how the shock waves will interact with terrain and obstacles, allowing them to identify the safety risks associated with various locations around the weapon.

The BOP Tool traces its origins back to 2018, when the National Defense Authorization Act instructed the Secretary of Defense to conduct an extensive medical study of the physical effects of exposure to blast overpressure caused by certain weapon systems. BIRCO partnered with DHA's Traumatic Brain Injury Center of Excellence, the Army's Combat Capabilities Development Command, the Defense Centers for Public Health - Aberdeen and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs to conduct the study.

BIRCO adapted computer models of blast exposures originally developed for a prototype software application that standardized the descriptions of blast wave exposure zones. These models were refined with blast overpressure exposure data collected by WRAIR from wearable sensors and pressure probes during live fire training. The result was a set of accurate 3D simulations of blast exposures on human bodies as well as 2D maps of the blast radius at various pressures.

BIRCO is also collaborating with the Army and Marine Corps to integrate the BOP Tool into the Range Management Toolkit, a suite of advanced geospatial applications that is used to plan safe range exercises – for example, by reducing the threat of injury from projectile fragmentation. Currently, the RMTK suite does not address blast overpressure exposure mitigation.

“The integration of the BOP Tool into the RMTK will enhance safety management by enabling commanders and range managers to plan training exercises more effectively,” explains Gupta. “It allows the operational community to model and assess predicted blast overpressure exposure to inform deliberate adjustments to firing locations, personal positions, firing sequence, and training plans to minimize blast effects and protect their cognitive and physical health.”

Scherer says the functionalities of the BOP Tool address critical gaps identified by the operational community. “From our conversations with the operational end users, we understand that line leaders require objective data to inform their risk management decisions around BOP exposure,” says Scherer. “The BOP Tool helps guide unit leadership as they balance the priority of sustaining unit lethality through routine heavy weapons training with the potential for compromising readiness through overexposure to blast overpressure.”

The BOP Tool will enable the operational community to increase their awareness of blast overpressure exposure effects, and to reinforce the safety warnings warfighters first learned during their initial training. It will also inform range modernization and future weapon design by providing information about predicted exposures in training environment. The BOP Tool’s blast exposure predictions can also be used to inform health and performance assessments and clinical decision-making. Such applications promise to improve the DOD’s understanding of blast overpressure exposure effects.

“The next step is to roll out the BOP Tool to warfighters, instructors, and range managers to start using it, which is expected to happen soon,” says Gupta. “We have demonstrated the BOP Tool to the Marine Corps’ Range and Training Programs Division and the Army’s Training and Doctrine Command, and we are in discussions with Army Combat Capabilities Development Command to establish an agreement to transfer the BOP Tool to end users. We are also providing access to the tool to the DEVCOM’s Armaments Center and Soldier Lethality office to enhance the BOP Tool with their existing weapon data. The addition of this high-quality data will further ensure the BOP Tool is as effective as it can be in mitigating unnecessary blast overpressure exposure effects on our warfighters.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9256548.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-14 18:56:18.317658

CACREP’s Gold Standard or Legal Overreach?

The Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP) has become the gatekeeper to licensure and top counseling jobs. A CACREP-accredited degree is now required to work with the Department of Veterans Affairs, the U.S. Army, and the Tricare health system. In 27 states, CACREP is either the preferred or mandated route to becoming a licensed counselor. Its status is so dominant that non-accredited programs often claim to be “aligned with CACREP standards,” as a mark of legitimacy.

But as CACREP’s influence grows, so do the legal questions. Its recent push to limit the Counseling Compact—a multi-state agreement allowing counselors to practice across state lines—could violate federal antitrust laws. In this series, we’ll examine whether CACREP has crossed legal lines, what it means for the profession, and how the public could be paying the price.

A Letter Disappears

In September 2023, CACREP published a six-page open letter to the American Counseling Association (ACA), chastising it for characterizing CACREP’s efforts to limit the scope of who can work under the Counseling Compact as demanding and relentless. Within weeks of that letter being cited in my article at Minding the Campus, the document quietly vanished from CACREP’s website.

Initially, I assumed this was damage control. But as I dug deeper into the legal limitations on nonprofit organizations—and the red flags raised under the Sherman Antitrust Act—I began to reconsider. The more I learned, the more the letter read like a roadmap for monopolization.

Fortunately, I saved a copy, and shared it.

From Standard-Setter to Gatekeeper

Originally established to promote educational quality, CACREP has grown into the most powerful entity in the counseling field. Today, it accredits 983 programs across 473 institutions. Its standards influence who gets licensed, who gets hired, and—critically—who gets excluded.

In its own words, CACREP sees its mission as “promoting professional competence … through the development of preparation standards.” But those standards have become increasingly ideological, and exclusively required for licensure and employment. The requirement for 60 graduate credit hours—more than many master’s programs in medicine or engineering—is one such barrier. So is the insistence on a rigid “Professional Counselor” identity, narrowly defined by CACREP itself.

These standards aren’t just academic—they’re political. CACREP’s own standard and the resulting required textbooks reflect a specific Critical Social Justice, DEI orientation, including an explicit requirement for multiculturalism as foundational to counselor identity. Not all counselors or counseling programs agree with this direction, and some have declined CACREP accreditation as a result. Yet CACREP continues to lobby—though it avoids that word—for its definition to become the only acceptable one.

The Open Letter’s Demands

The 2023 letter laid out CACREP’s position clearly:

Those granted the Privilege to Practice in the Counseling Compact should be licensed as Professional Counselors and not in other professions.

It referenced a 2010 report produced through collaboration with CACREP, the ACA, the National Board for Certified Counselors (NBCC), American Association of State Counseling Boards (AASCB), the Association for Counselor Education and Supervision (ACES), and other organizations. That report reiterated the ideological foundations of counseling, and called for the formation of a “Professional Counselor identity”—a concept CACREP developed and implemented into its standard, including in curriculum and philosophical priorities.

The letter further insisted that states should reserve Compact privileges for those who mirror CACREP’s standards, even while claiming to “respect each state’s prerogative” to set licensure rules. This doublespeak—publicly endorsing state control while privately urging uniform exclusion of anything short of the CACREP standard—raises concerns not just of ethical overreach, but of legal misconduct.

The Risk to Competition

Why does this matter? Because under federal law, especially the Sherman Antitrust Act, group efforts to restrain trade or dominate a market can be illegal. Section 1 prohibits collusion between organizations to exclude competitors. Section 2 forbids monopolization or attempts to monopolize a market.

CACREP is not a government agency. It is a private nonprofit—one whose decisions can determine how much a degree costs, who will be recruited, who can teach, what’s in the curriculum, and what loans are available to pay tuition.

Its coordination with licensing bodies, credentialing boards, professional organizations and educators creates a closed loop that increasingly shuts out competition, not on the basis of quality, but conformity.

Its swift removal of the open letter suggests CACREP knows the risks. The questions now are: Has it gone too far? And who pays the price?

What’s at Stake

When a single accreditor dominates a profession, it limits not just career mobility but public access to care. Counselors who train through other reputable programs—some with different theoretical orientations or less ideological coursework—find themselves locked out of licensure, jobs, and now even interstate practice.

Meanwhile, clients face fewer choices in a time of unprecedented demand for mental health services.

In Part Two, we’ll explore how CACREP’s dominance may violate antitrust laws—and why it’s time for lawmakers and professional organizations to take a closer look at who sets the standards, and why.

Here’s what you need to know about finding different types of Medicare providers.
“You can lower your health care costs when you see Medicare participating providers who accept the Medicare-approved amount as full payment,” said Anne Breslin, TRICARE For Life Program Manager.
Medicare pays its portion of the claim, TRICARE pays the remaining amount, and you pay nothing.
Emergency care means care for an illness or injury that threatens your life, limb, sight, or safety.","If you have TRICARE For Life, you’ll get health care from Medicare providers. Here’s what you need to know about finding different types of Medicare providers.

“You can lower your health care costs when you see Medicare participating providers who accept the Medicare-approved amount as full payment,” said Anne Breslin, TRICARE For Life Program Manager. “Always prepare to show your Medicare card along with your Military Identification Card at any medical appointment.”

How do I find the right provider?

TFL is Medicare-wraparound coverage for TRICARE beneficiaries who have Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B. You can see three types of providers. This is described in the TRICARE For Life Handbook.

• Medicare participating providers. They accept the Medicare-approved amount as full payment. Seeing these providers will result in the lowest costs.

• Medicare non-participating providers. They don’t accept the Medicare amount as full payment. They can charge up to 15% more than Medicare allows. TRICARE covers this extra cost.

• Opt-out providers. They don’t work with Medicare at all. You’ll pay much more when you see these providers. Medicare won’t pay anything. TRICARE only pays what it normally would. This is about 20% of the TRICARE-allowable charge. You pay the rest.

How do Medicare and TRICARE pay?

Medicare is generally your primary payer. Are you seeing a Medicare participating or Medicare non-participating provider? If so, then you have no out-of-pocket costs for services covered by both Medicare and TFL. Most healthcare services fall into this category. Medicare pays its portion of the claim, TRICARE pays the remaining amount, and you pay nothing.

Sometimes, TRICARE is your primary insurance. In this case, you must see TRICARE-authorized providers. This occurs when:

• Medicare doesn’t cover the service.

• You’re in overseas locations.

Can I get Department of Defense care?

You can get care at military hospitals and clinics if space is available.

How does Department of Veterans Affairs care work?

VA providers can’t bill Medicare. If you see a VA provider for care that isn’t related to a service-connected condition, you’ll pay about 80% of the bill. TRICARE only pays up to 20%. Want to see a VA provider? Call the TFL contractor, WPS Military and Veterans Health, at 866-773-0404 to check your coverage before you go.

What about care Overseas?

Do you live overseas? You can usually see any civilian provider. You’ll need to pay up front and file your own claim. In the Philippines, you must see certified providers.

For emergencies overseas, try military hospitals first. If none are available, go to the nearest emergency care facility. Call the TRICARE Overseas regional call center within 24 hours if you’re admitted.

How do I get emergency and urgent care?

When getting emergency or urgent care, always show your Medicare card along with your Military ID card.

Do you need emergency care? Emergency care means care for an illness or injury that threatens your life, limb, sight, or safety. If you reasonably believe you have an emergency, always call 911 or your international emergency number. Or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Do you need urgent care? Urgent care treats conditions that need attention within 24 hours but aren’t life-threatening. Examples include sprains or rising fevers.

Are virtual health care visits covered?

You can get virtual health care via phone or video appointments. Medicare covers these visits when your provider accepts Medicare. TRICARE pays first if Medicare doesn’t cover the virtual health service.

Is mental health care covered?

Medicare covers visits with these mental health providers:

• Psychiatrists and other doctors

• Clinical psychologists

• Clinical social workers

• Clinical nurse specialists

• Nurse practitioners

• Physician assistants

What about services that need pre-authorization?

Some services need pre-authorization before you get care. These include:

• Dental care for medical conditions

• Home health care

• Hospice care

• Organ transplants

• Some prescription drugs

Contact WPS if you have questions about pre-authorization requirements.

Remember! Seeing Medicare participating providers gives you the lowest out-of-pocket costs.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2508/9257080/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-14 15:56:15.116526

The analysis identified a gap in how information about blast overpressure exposure is communicated to Service Members.
Currently, the RMTK suite does not address blast overpressure exposure mitigation.
Such applications promise to improve the DOD’s understanding of blast overpressure exposure effects.","FORT DETRICK, Md. – The Blast Overpressure Tool, an application developed by the DOD Blast Injury Research Coordinating Office to help minimize Warfighters’ exposure to the shock waves created by the firing of heavy weapons, now incorporates data on the DOD’s highest-priority weapons systems and is ready for use in training activities. This marks a key milestone in the evolution of the tool for providing safe and effective weapons training that protects Warfighters from blast-related injury – thereby improving their readiness, resilience and effectiveness on the battlefield.

The BOP Tool’s library now includes blast exposure profiles for all fifteen weapons systems designated as “Tier 1” by the Defense Health Agency in its landmark 2023 medical study of the health effects of blast exposure on Service Members. This category consists of the shoulder mounted and .50 caliber weapons, indirect fire systems, and breachers used most regularly by the armed services.

“This is an important milestone, because now the BOP Tool is available to inform critical military training decisions,” says Dr. Raj Gupta, BIRCO’s deputy director. “This accomplishment would not have been possible without the collaborative efforts of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, the Uniformed Services University’s Combat and Training Queryable Exposure/Event Repository project, and our other partners.”

BIRCO director Col. Matthew Scherer and Gupta co-moderated a breakout session on “Blast Overpressure Exposure and Blast Induced TBI Mechanism, Prevention, and Treatment” at the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium in Kissimmee, Florida Aug. 4-7. The session featured updates on research from across the DOD on protecting brain health from the effects of the shock waves caused by the firing of heavy weapons. Gupta and his BIRCO colleagues also presented several posters on the BOP Tool and the health risks associated with blast exposure during MHSRS. They were among over 200 DHA R&D-MRDC experts in military infectious diseases, combat casualty care, military operational medicine, chemical biological defense, and clinical and rehabilitative medicine who attended the annual event, the DOD's premier medical science research and development meeting. To see photos of DHA R&D-MRDC’s participation in this year’s MHSRS, visit the event’s Flickr album.

An emerging body of evidence suggests that repeated exposure to shock waves from the firing of heavy weapons, called blast overpressure, contributes to impaired cognitive, sensory, and motor performance, degraded reaction time and decision-making ability, and other adverse health effects. To help address this concern, in 2017 Congress instructed the Secretary of Defense to undertake a medical study of blast overpressure exposure on Service Members. BIRCO supported the effort by collecting and analyzing available information and emerging research on the health and performance effects of blast overpressure resulting from the firing of heavy weapons and explosions. The analysis identified a gap in how information about blast overpressure exposure is communicated to Service Members.

The BOP Tool provides training range managers, range safety officers, and instructors with easy-to-understand guidance on how to position personnel to minimize their exposure to blast overpressure from shoulder-mounted assault weapons, indirect fire systems, rifles, machine guns, and breaching charges. Users can place computer models of the shock wave patterns of individual weapons into a model of the training environment to see how the shock waves will interact with terrain and obstacles, allowing them to identify the safety risks associated with various locations around the weapon.

The BOP Tool traces its origins back to 2018, when the National Defense Authorization Act instructed the Secretary of Defense to conduct an extensive medical study of the physical effects of exposure to blast overpressure caused by certain weapon systems. BIRCO partnered with DHA's Traumatic Brain Injury Center of Excellence, the Army's Combat Capabilities Development Command, the Defense Centers for Public Health - Aberdeen and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs to conduct the study.

BIRCO adapted computer models of blast exposures originally developed for a prototype software application that standardized the descriptions of blast wave exposure zones. These models were refined with blast overpressure exposure data collected by WRAIR from wearable sensors and pressure probes during live fire training. The result was a set of accurate 3D simulations of blast exposures on human bodies as well as 2D maps of the blast radius at various pressures.

BIRCO is also collaborating with the Army and Marine Corps to integrate the BOP Tool into the Range Management Toolkit, a suite of advanced geospatial applications that is used to plan safe range exercises – for example, by reducing the threat of injury from projectile fragmentation. Currently, the RMTK suite does not address blast overpressure exposure mitigation.

“The integration of the BOP Tool into the RMTK will enhance safety management by enabling commanders and range managers to plan training exercises more effectively,” explains Gupta. “It allows the operational community to model and assess predicted blast overpressure exposure to inform deliberate adjustments to firing locations, personal positions, firing sequence, and training plans to minimize blast effects and protect their cognitive and physical health.”

Scherer says the functionalities of the BOP Tool address critical gaps identified by the operational community.

“From our conversations with the operational end users, we understand that line leaders require objective data to inform their risk management decisions around BOP exposure,” says Scherer. “The BOP Tool helps guide unit leadership as they balance the priority of sustaining unit lethality through routine heavy weapons training with the potential for compromising readiness through overexposure to blast overpressure.”

The BOP Tool will enable the operational community to increase their awareness of blast overpressure exposure effects, and to reinforce the safety warnings Warfighters first learned during their initial training. It will also inform range modernization and future weapon design by providing information about predicted exposures in training environment. The BOP Tool’s blast exposure predictions can also be used to inform health and performance assessments and clinical decision-making. Such applications promise to improve the DOD’s understanding of blast overpressure exposure effects.

“The next step is to roll out the BOP Tool to Warfighters, instructors, and range managers to start using it, which is expected to happen soon,” says Gupta. “We have demonstrated the BOP Tool to the Marine Corps’ Range and Training Programs Division and the Army’s Training and Doctrine Command, and we are in discussions with Army Combat Capabilities Development Command to establish an agreement to transfer the BOP Tool to end users. We are also providing access to the tool to the DEVCOM’s Armaments Center and Soldier Lethality office to enhance the BOP Tool with their existing weapon data. The addition of this high-quality data will further ensure the BOP Tool is as effective as it can be in mitigating unnecessary blast overpressure exposure effects on our Warfighters.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2508/9256548/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-14 10:56:16.746321

The company reported an adjusted EBITDA of -$4.7 million for Q2 2025, representing a significant improvement from the -$35 million reported in Q1 2024.
In conclusion, American Well Corporation reported improved Q2 2025 financial performance, with revenue growth and cost reductions driving the results.","American Well Corporation (NYSE:AMWL) reported improved Q2 2025 financial performance, with revenue up and a hold rating maintained despite concerns over DHA renewal. The company's SaaS-based healthcare platform connects patients with doctors over secure video.

American Well Corporation (AMWL), a leading SaaS-based healthcare platform provider, reported its Q2 2025 financial performance, highlighting improved revenue growth and a hold rating maintained despite concerns over the renewal of its contract with the U.S. Defense Health Agency (DHA). The company's platform connects patients with doctors over secure video, facilitating virtual care services.

Revenue for Q2 2025 was $70.9 million, marking a 13% year-over-year (YoY) increase from $66.8 million in Q1 2025 [1]. This growth is a positive indicator for the company's ability to expand its service offerings and customer base. However, the extension of the DHA contract by only one year, instead of the anticipated three-year period, raised concerns about long-term performance stability [1].

The DHA contract, a significant growth initiative for Amwell, was extended by one year due to budget restrictions within the Department of Defense (DoD). This extension excluded deployments for Amwell's behavioral health and automated care programs, leading to a downward revision of the 2025 revenue guidance from $250 million to $245 million to $250 million [1].

Despite the revenue growth, Amwell continues to face challenges in achieving profitability. The company reported an adjusted EBITDA of -$4.7 million for Q2 2025, representing a significant improvement from the -$35 million reported in Q1 2024. However, the ongoing negative EBITDA suggests that the company is still operating at a loss [1].

The company's cost reduction efforts are evident in the Q2 2025 results. Research and development spending was reduced by 12.2% YoY to $18.3 million, while sales and marketing expenses were 32% lower than last year at $12.5 million. General and administrative expenses were also reduced by 25.7% compared to Q2 2024 [1].

While these cost reductions are aimed at achieving the company's goal of positive cash flow from operations by 2026, there are risks associated with deep or sustained cuts. Reduced investment in R&D and marketing could limit the company's ability to innovate and maintain brand visibility, potentially leading to a loss of market share and customer touchpoints [1].

The addition of Florida Blue as a new payer is a positive development that could provide more predictable revenue streams for Amwell. The company also launched Amwell Navigate, an AI-powered client experience platform, during the quarter. The platform is designed to empower clients and enable cost-effective delivery of quality support at scale [1].

Despite the positive developments, the company's financial position remains a concern. Amwell reported a quarterly cash burn of $3 million in Q2 2025, and its cash reserves have been depleting year over year. The company's valuation, as measured by EV/EBITDA, is currently non-meaningful due to its negative EBITDA, contrasting sharply with the high valuation of Teladoc (TDOC) [1].

In conclusion, American Well Corporation reported improved Q2 2025 financial performance, with revenue growth and cost reductions driving the results. However, concerns over the DHA contract renewal and the company's ongoing unprofitability remain significant. Investors should continue to monitor the company's financial position and the impact of its new initiatives on future performance.

It’s called the “Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry Overview.” The training is in accordance with the requirements of Section 725 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022.
Under the guidance, healthcare providers must complete the one-hour Joint Knowledge Online training course if they have not already done so.
For medical personnel seeking more information on deployment-related environmental exposures, continuing education-eligible training is offered by the VA’s War Related Illness and Injury Study Center.
Additionally, veterans may have been exposed to depleted uranium from vehicles or being wounded by a fragment containing depleted uranium.","The Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs continue to work closely together to address military-related toxic material/environmental exposures from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars through the VA’s 2014 Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry. In June 2025, the Defense Health Agency added new training requirements for healthcare providers on toxic exposures and burn pits.

On Aug. 1, 2024, the VA launched a redesigned registry after extensive feedback showing veterans found it too challenging to enroll in the program. The new registry helps inform efforts to improve benefits as part of the PACT Act of 2022, also known as the “Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act.”

The VA and the DOD also expanded PACT Act benefits and VA health care for service members and veterans who served in Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, as well as related operations in Iraq, the war on terrorism, and the Vietnam War.

Key updates to the registry include:

Automatic enrollment of more than 4.7 million veterans and service members who meet the expanded eligibility criteria based on DOD manpower and deployment records

Information from all military-exposure databases

Removal of a 144-question survey required to participate in the registry

Establishment of an easy opt-out process for enrollees

New Training Required

The new DHA training is for healthcare providers at all military hospitals and clinics. It’s called the “Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry Overview.” The training is in accordance with the requirements of Section 725 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022.

Under the guidance, healthcare providers must complete the one-hour Joint Knowledge Online training course if they have not already done so. It also requires providers to review the “Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry DoD Health Care Provider Clinical Toolbox.”

Provider Training Updates

The updated training includes expanded information about:

AHOBPR eligibility criteria and the new auto-enrollment process

Clinical content such as recommended diagnostic codes and how to manage patient encounters related to airborne hazards and open burn pit exposures

Information about the Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record, and new information on the Military Health Systems’ Periodic Occupational and Environmental Monitoring Summary. Both the web-based ILER and the monitoring summaries of POEMS track and manage exposure data.

For medical personnel seeking more information on deployment-related environmental exposures, continuing education-eligible training is offered by the VA’s War Related Illness and Injury Study Center.

The resource contains:

Background information on airborne hazards and the registry

Guidance for conducting a medical evaluation associated with environmental exposure concerns

Resources for providers to review and share with service members and other healthcare providers to improve health outcomes for those exposed

Educational materials regarding military exposures are regularly updated, so providers should plan to check in for any changes in guidance.

Related Illnesses

In addition to burn pits, oil well fires, smoke, sand, dust, the mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air (particulate matter), and regional pollution from the climate and environment, the VA links nine infectious diseases to military service in Southwest Asia.

Contact Information: Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C.","NEW YORK, Aug. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against Zynex, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZYXI) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against Zynex on July 9, 2025 with a Class Period from March 13, 2023, to the present. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of Zynex have breached their fiduciary duties to the company.

The complaint alleges that the Individual Defendants began artificially inflating Zynex’s stock price by issuing or allowing false and misleading statements about the Company’s financial performance, operational practices, and compliance with insurance reimbursement policies. These statements concealed a systemic “oversupplying scheme” whereby Zynex shipped excessive quantities of supplies, such as electrode pads and batteries, to patients, billing insurers for thousands of dollars more than necessary. Zynex’s undisclosed practices drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare (the federal health insurer for the military), which represented 20–25% of its annual revenue.

The full extent of Zynex’s misconduct was finally revealed on March 11, 2025, when the Company issued a press release announcing fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results. The release disclosed a significant revenue “shortfall” due to “slower than normal payments from certain payers” and revealed, “Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.” The March 11, 2025, press release admitted that Tricare, representing 20% to 25% of Zynex’s annual revenue, was scrutinizing prior claims, threatening the Company’s financial stability.

The next day, on March 12, 2025, Zynex’s stock price plummeted $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, closing at $3.41 per share. This catastrophic decline wiped out significant shareholder value, reflecting the market’s reaction to Zynex’s exposure to regulatory and financial risks concealed by the Individual Defendants.

The stock’s performance coincided with a high-profile legal ruling involving its subsidiary, Omnicare. A federal judge ordered CVS and Omnicare to pay $949 million in damages and penalties following a whistleblower lawsuit alleging fraudulent billing practices. The case, which spanned nearly a decade, centered on allegations that Omnicare dispensed drugs without valid prescriptions in long-term care facilities and submitted false claims to Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE. The court’s decision trebled damages to $500 million and added $449 million in penalties, marking one of the largest False Claims Act verdicts in recent history. CVS faces ongoing legal challenges as Omnicare seeks to overturn the jury’s verdict, with potential appeals likely.

The ruling highlights regulatory and financial risks for healthcare companies operating in complex reimbursement environments. As the largest pharmacy benefit manager in the U.S., CVS’s exposure to legal disputes involving billing practices could impact investor sentiment. While the company maintains a strong market position, the judgment underscores the importance of compliance in an industry subject to rigorous oversight. Analysts will closely monitor how the case progresses, including any appeals or settlements, to assess long-term implications for CVS’s financial stability and operational practices.

The strategy of buying the top 500 stocks by daily trading volume and holding them for one day from 2022 to now delivered moderate returns.

DETROIT — Two individuals were charged for their involvement in a $500 million, nationwide scheme that involved billing Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and other health insurance programs for COVID-19 testing services that were never rendered, United States Attorney Jerome F. Gorgon Jr. announced today.

Cemhan “Jimmy” Biricik of Boca Raton Florida, and Dr. Martin Perlin of Fairfield, Connecticut were charged with conspiracy to commit health care fraud and more than 50 substantive counts of health care fraud. Biricik was the sole member and Chief Executive Officer of Fast Lab Technologies, LLC (Fast Lab). Dr. Perlin was Fast Lab’s Medical Director and provider responsible for ordering the majority of the tests. Both defendants were arrested this morning.

According to the Indictment, during the Covid-19 pandemic, New York-based Fast Lab operated a website offering “free” covid tests. When individuals went to the website to order tests, they were asked to provide their insurance information. Fast Lab then used this insurance information to fraudulently bill Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and numerous private insurances for both antigen (“rapid”) and PCR (“laboratory) tests, across multiple dates for each beneficiary. Specifically, Fast Lab’s claims represented that (1) the antigen tests had been observed by medical professionals, (2) saliva samples were collected by medical professionals, and (3) PCR testing was performed on those samples. In reality, the vast majority of antigen tests—if taken at all—were taken at home and not observed by medical professionals; saliva samples were never collected nor returned to Fast Lab; and PCR testing was never performed. Dr. Perlin was the ordering physician for these tests, despite not having a treating relationship with the beneficiaries. Further, Fast Lab would regularly submit insurance claims before the test kits were even delivered to the beneficiaries. In total, Biricik billed or caused to be billed more than $500 million in claims and was paid more than $50 million.

Gorgon was joined in the announcement by Special Agent in Charge Karen Wingerd, Detroit Field Office, Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI); Special Agent in Charge Mario Pinto, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), Chicago Regional Office; Special Agent in Charge Cheyvoryea Gibson, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Detroit Division; Special Agent in Charge Derek M.

The public is reminded that an Indictment is not evidence of guilt. The defendants are presumed innocent and entitled to a fair trial at which the government has the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

This case is being investigated by Special Agents from IRS-CI, HHS-OIG, FBI, OPM-OIG, DOL-EBSA, DCIS, MFCU, DOL-OIG, USPIS, and the U.S. Marshal’s Service. It is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Regina R. McCullough and Ryan A. Particka. Assistant United States Attorney Ryan T.

By Mr. Thomas Cieslak

One team’s attention to detail and meticulous execution of their duties plays a critical role in supporting the healthcare of Marines, Sailors and families of Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point while ensuring service members are ready to train and deploy.

Staff of the Naval Health Clinic Cherry Point Patient Administration Department conduct their duties out-of-sight of most visitors to the facility. They ensure the accuracy, accessibility and confidentiality of patient medical records and sensitive patient administrative information.

“It’s more than filing paperwork. Many may think Patient Administration is just about filing records or checking patients in,” said Ms. Cindy Godley, the clinic’s Medical Records Administrator and Assistant Department Head. “In reality, it involves complex processes like medical board coordination, coding audits, proper registration processes, and HIPAA compliance, all of which are vital to patient care and organizational readiness.”

Staff serving in the PAD support a multitude of functions critical to the clinic’s function, the wellness of patients and the deployment readiness of units assigned to MCAS Cherry Point. Those functions include management of Limited Duty, coordinating the process to determine a service member’s fitness for duty, managing overseas screenings and even assisting mortuary affairs.

“We are the gatekeepers of patient data,” said Godley, a native of Havelock, North Carolina. “The department [PAD] ensures data accuracy, privacy, and legal compliance. A single error in documentation or patient eligibility could impact treatment, billing, or readiness for deployment—especially in military healthcare systems.”

Additionally, PAD’s work protects the clinic from numerous risks. The department prevents financial and legal issues through careful oversight of records requests, third-party liability, coding documentation verifications and maintaining Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliance. PAD staff helps the clinic avoid penalties, litigation or lost revenue due to noncompliance or incomplete documentation.

“We are an essential part to continuity of care. From birth to end-of-life, we assist with ensuring documentation is available for the next patient’s visit, either in our clinic or at other facilities,” said Godley. “Patient Administration tracks the full lifecycle of medical care. Without it, care would be delayed, incomplete, or undocumented.”

Though often in the background of all patient interactions, PAD ensures the smooth provision of medical care to the MCAS Cherry Point and surrounding communities.

The Commerce Clause The Commerce Clause seeks to ensure free trade among the states.
The negative implication of this, known as the dormant Commerce Clause, prohibits states from unjustifiably discriminating against interstate commerce.
The judge granted the preliminary injunction, and Arkansas Act 624 is currently blocked from taking effect until the case is ultimately decided.","Last month, we wrote about the CVS, Express Scripts, and Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA) lawsuit challenging Arkansas Act 624—a law prohibiting pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from owning or operating pharmacies in Arkansas. At the end of July, a federal district court judge granted the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction, blocking the law from taking effect until a final disposition in the case has been made.

Arkansas Act 624

The Act, the first of its kind, was set to go into effect on January 1, 2026. However, the plaintiffs alleged that Arkansas Act 624 is unconstitutional and violates the Commerce Clause and other provisions. They asked the court to issue a preliminary injunction blocking the law. After hearing arguments from both parties, the district court judge issued a 17-page opinion.

Court Sides With Plaintiffs

“A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy,” noted the judge. “A party seeking a preliminary injunction must prove that: (1) there is a likelihood of success on the merits; (2) it will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is denied; (3) the harm to the movant, if the injunction is denied, outweighs the harm to the non-movant if the injunction is granted; and (4) an injunction is in the public’s interest.”

To determine whether to issue a preliminary injunction, the judge considered the plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the merits of their argument. The plaintiffs made many different arguments as to why they believed the law was unconstitutional. While the judge rejected the bulk of these arguments, he ultimately agreed that the plaintiffs were likely to prevail on 2 claims—one involving the Commerce Clause and the other involving a Supremacy Clause claim related to TRICARE preemption.

The Commerce Clause

The Commerce Clause seeks to ensure free trade among the states. The negative implication of this, known as the dormant Commerce Clause, prohibits states from unjustifiably discriminating against interstate commerce. “Act 624 appears to overtly discriminate against plaintiffs as out of state companies and the state has failed to show that it has no other means to advance its interest,” wrote the judge. “This is true because section one of Act 624 specifically states that its purpose is to eliminate plaintiffs’ “business tactics that have driven locally-operated pharmacies out of business.”

The Supremacy Clause

The Supremacy Clause provides “that the Constitution and the laws passed pursuant to it are the supreme laws of the land, binding alike upon states, courts, and the people, ‘anything in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.’” The purpose is to prevent confusion and conflicts between state and federal law. Thus, state laws that interfere with or contradict federal law are invalid. The plaintiffs argued that Act 624 interferes with and contradicts 3 federal laws: (1) TRICARE (health insurance for service members), (2) the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), and (3) Medicare. While the judge rejected the ERISA and Medicare arguments, he agreed that Act 624 is explicitly and impliedly preempted by TRICARE.

“TRICARE contains an express preemption clause that overrides any ‘law or regulation of a State or local government relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods’ that is ‘inconsistent with’ or ‘necessary to implement or administer’ the TRICARE program,” wrote the judge.

The judge granted the preliminary injunction, and Arkansas Act 624 is currently blocked from taking effect until the case is ultimately decided.

Clinicians were spending a lot of time researching product specifications and vendor pricing before filling out paperwork to order prosthetic limb components for their patients. What if the process could be streamlined?

The Hearing Center of Excellence led the way with hearing device ordering through VA DLC. They established a way to allow DHA providers to order needed items through VA DLC contracts. In 2018, EACE followed in their footsteps by partnering with VA in a pilot project allowing online ordering of lower-extremity prosthetic componentry. It standardized ordering processes, improved efficiency, and tremendously reduced the administrative burden on clinicians. The pilot was a huge success.

Good news for providers and patients

In 2021, DHA launched the new ordering process at its three advanced rehabilitation centers, helping providers order components as easily as they could order a sandwich online. Ordered parts now arrive quickly in these military hospitals and clinics, often within just a few days. “Use of the ordering process off a VA contract allows clinicians to order exactly the parts they need for scheduled procedures,” said Miller. “It saves time, giving them more time with patients and relieving some of their administrative work.”

This means good news for patients, too. Knowing when a part will be available makes it easier to schedule timely appointments. Fitting patients with prosthetic devices quickly can improve their ability to adapt to the new device. A clinician’s ability to swiftly order and receive a prosthetic device helps their patients in recovery.

Combat support and readiness

DHA and VA DLC set up their contract to be modified throughout the year. This flexibility, coupled with close collaboration, means requests from the three ARCs can be incorporated quickly into the VA DLC catalog of products. In turn, this means DHA providers can offer patients the newest commercially available items.

This has implications for readiness, too. Staying on the cutting edge of technology keeps DHA clinicians’ skills sharp, ready to be put to good use whenever and wherever they’re needed.

In addition, the ordering process is scalable, which helps DHA respond to changing needs in combat support. The system is set up to make it easy to order one part or 10,000. This is a radical departure from how the system worked ago.

The new scalability ensures DHA can have components available to clinicians when and where they’re needed. End-to-end, this process supports healthcare personnel in their readiness mission and supports service members who are approved to return to active duty.

What does the future hold?

The two departments are constantly exploring ways to improve, for example, making the once-laborious process of returns and recalls easier. VA also recently awarded a contract to expand options for lower-extremity devices. According to Miller, the collaboration between DHA and VA continues to expand as the partnership deepens. “VA has been a great partner for us,” said Miller. “I sit on the technical committee and consult on items that we need in DHA, and VA is very responsive. There are things we need more of here in DHA, and VA listens and responds to those needs.”

From faster access to devices to improved clinician satisfaction, the prosthetic component ordering system is delivering tangible benefits. This collaborative approach exemplifies how federal partnerships improve the lives of service members and enhance military readiness.",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9157989.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-13 22:56:17.607887

Chronic fatigue is a symptom of many conditions, while Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex multi system illness. ME/CFS often occurs after infections but the pathogenesis is not certain. The syndrome ""Long COVID"" may be a subset of ME/CFS or a distinct condition. An array of symptoms is required for ME/CFS diagnosis, with the most distinctive symptom being post-exertional malaise (PEM). ME/CFS cannot be improved by exercise or psychiatric treatment.
