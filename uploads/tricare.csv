“Generally, your costs will depend on if the care you get is covered by both Medicare and TRICARE, by only one of them, or by neither,” said Anne Breslin, TRICARE For Life program manager at the Defense Health Agency. “If both Medicare and TRICARE cover the care, you’ll have no out-of-pocket expenses.”

Keep reading to learn more, including costs related to having TFL coverage and how TFL minimizes what you pay for health care services.

What is TRICARE For Life? TFL is Medicare-wraparound coverage if you’re TRICARE-eligible and you’re eligible for Medicare Part A.You must have Medicare Part A and Part B to have TFL, regardless of your age or where you live.

Enrollment fees and premiums TFL has no enrollment fees or premiums. However, you need to pay Medicare premiums to have TFL. · Medicare Part A premiums are financed through payroll deductions while you’re working. · Medicare Part B has a monthly premium based on your income. This premium may change each year. If you receive monthly Social Security retirement or disability benefits, your Part B premium is deducted from these monthly benefits.

Learn more about paying Medicare premiums.

Costs for care covered by both Medicare and TRICARE Medicare and TRICARE work together to coordinate your benefits. Most health care services are covered by both Medicare and TRICARE.

The type of provider you see will affect your costs: · When you see a Medicare participating or Medicare non-participating provider, you have no out-of-pocket costs for services covered by both Medicare and TRICARE. Check out Health Plan Costs or the TRICARE For Life Cost Matrix to see examples of these costs for 2026. · Some providers opt out of Medicare. Medicare doesn’t pay for the services you get from these providers. If you see a provider who has opted out of Medicare, TRICARE pays the amount Medicare would have paid if Medicare had processed the claim. (This is normally up to 20% of the TRICARE-allowable charge.)

Learn more about types of Medicare providers. You can also learn about services Medicare covers and services TRICARE covers.

Costs for care only covered by Medicare When you get care that’s covered by Medicare only, Medicare processes the claim as the primary payer and pays the Medicare-allowed amount. TRICARE pays nothing. You’re responsible for theMedicare deductible and cost-shareand any remaining billed charges. See the TRICARE For Life Cost Matrix to learn more about 2026 Medicare deductibles.

Costs for care Medicare doesn’t cover Medicare doesn’t cover all health care services. Medicare also doesn’t cover care you get outside the U.S. and U.S. territories, as described in the TRICARE For Life Handbook.

In these cases: · TRICARE processes the claim as the primary payer and pays the TRICARE-allowable charge. You’re responsible for the applicable TRICARE deductible, cost-shares, and any remaining billed charges. · You’ll have lower out-of-pocket costs when you see a TRICARE network provider. Learn more about network providers in the U.S. and overseas providers.

During a calendar year (Jan. 1–Dec. 31), the most you pay for TRICARE-covered services and supplies is your TFL catastrophic cap. · The TFL catastrophic cap is $3,000. · When you meet your catastrophic cap, you don’t pay anything for the rest of the calendar year for services and supplies that are medically necessary and covered by TRICARE.

Costs for care not covered by Medicare or TRICARE When you get care that isn’t covered by Medicare or TRICARE, you’re responsible for the entire bill. This may be more than the Medicare-approved amount or TRICARE-allowable amount.

Pharmacy costs TFL includes prescription drug coverage through the TRICARE Pharmacy Program.

JOINT BASE LEWIS-MCCHORD, Wash.– Medical leaders at Joint Base Lewis-McChord are working to integrate military health care services across branches to improve efficiency and strengthen deployment readiness.

Historically, the Soldier Readiness Processing site on the installation has been operated by personnel from Madigan Army Medical Center (MAMC), while the Air Force has managed its deployment preparation independently. Leaders from both services are now collaborating to merge resources and establish a single, installation-wide capability rather than maintaining parallel systems.

“We operate as a joint medical force in theater; it is absolutely vital that we collaborate in preparing all personnel as they get ready to deploy,” said Col. Jimmy Watts, director, Madigan Army Medical Center. MAMC comprises a network of medical facilities located in Washington and California that serve more than 100,000 active-duty service members, their families and retirees, providing healthcare delivery under the Defense Health Agency.

As part of the integration effort, the combined Army and Air Force team is reviewing Air Force-specific deployment requirements and determining how best to incorporate them into the existing Soldier Readiness Processing site. Madigan and the 62nd Medical Squadron have already taken steps toward greater collaboration by integrating general dentists from Madigan into the McChord Clinic.

Officials stated that the decision to expand operations at the McChord Clinic was primarily driven by the facility’s robust infrastructure and well-established processes. Among the clinics on the installation, McChord’s facility most closely aligns with Joint Commission standards, making it well-suited to support a broader mission. Leaders also anticipate that the integration will lead to improvements in access to care.

Organizational changes were also made to support full integration. Before October, 2025, Air Force personnel at the McChord Clinic reported through Air Force leadership, while the clinic’s officer in charge reported to Madigan’s Department of Family Medicine. Leaders said that arrangement limited the unity of effort. The clinic is now unified under Col. John Hatfield, who has operational control of all assigned personnel and is responsible for the clinic’s operating budget.

Madigan Army Medical Center and the 62nd Medical Squadron are continuing to identify additional opportunities for collaboration, including the integration of pharmacy operations, to improve both efficiency and effectiveness of care across the installation.

Deployment health protection When service members deploy, they may face unique health challenges that civilian communities rarely encounter.
Military working dogs The One Health approach also benefits the health and welfare of military working dogs.
By working across traditional boundaries, military health professionals can identify threats earlier, respond more effectively, and protect service members and their families more completely.","When a military working dog gets sick overseas, the issue can involve more than just animal health. When service members deploy to regions with different diseases, there are more than just human health hazards to consider. When food safety becomes a problem at a military dining facility, the cause could be germs originating from humans, animals, or the environment. These interconnected health challenges require an integrated solution, and that's where One Health comes in.

""I prefer to think of One Health as integrated public health, working collaboratively across multiple disciplines,"" said Dr. Kristina McElroy, Veterinary Defense Support of Civil Authorities and interagency coordinator, Veterinary Services Division, Defense Health Agency-Public Health in Falls Church, Virginia. “This transdisciplinary approach guides my daily work as a veterinarian in DHA-Public Health.”

This collaborative approach is protecting military communities worldwide by recognizing that human health, animal health, and environmental health are closely connected.

What is One Health?

One Health is a simple but powerful idea: The health of people, animals, and the environment are linked. When one area has a problem, it can affect the others. For military communities, One Health means taking a team approach to prevent diseases, ensure food safety, and protect service members and their families.

Deployment health protection

When service members deploy, they may face unique health challenges that civilian communities rarely encounter. Service members travel frequently, encounter or work with animals, and deploy to regions with different risks of infectious disease.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, zoonotic diseases are caused by germs that spread between animals and people, and are caused by harmful germs like viruses, bacterial parasites, and fungi.

""Different vectors may be present that increase risk of certain zoonotic diseases, so we consider different parasite prevention and sometimes different daily management practices to limit exposure,"" said Lt. Col. Crystal Doyle, chief of animal medicine, Veterinary Services Division, DHA-Public Health. ""We must also be familiar with differing requirements for reportable diseases in the various countries in which we work.""

This global perspective is also essential for protecting military families. When service members deploy to different regions, they may encounter diseases that aren’t prevalent in their home stations. One Health approaches help identify these risks early and develop prevention strategies.

The benefits of One Health aren't theoretical; they're saving lives and protecting military operations every day, said McElroy.

""During outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza, chikungunya, Zika, as well as COVID-19 — which are all zoonotic diseases — the collaborative interdisciplinary approach of One Health has protected service members' health,"" said McElroy. ""Veterinary Services has worked hand in hand with colleagues at the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Division, the military services and U.S. government agencies to ensure guidance and recommendations are coordinated and appropriate for the military population.""

Military working dogs

The One Health approach also benefits the health and welfare of military working dogs. MWDs are valuable team members who can be affected by zoonotic diseases that can also affect service members.

""There have been MWD kennels with multiple dogs affected by similar clinical signs and symptoms that pointed to a possible zoonotic disease,"" said Doyle. ""While testing was pending to determine a definitive diagnosis, operational tempo was decreased to limit human exposure to the suspected zoonotic disease.""

Military veterinarians also submit ticks from their patients for disease screening, or disease confirmation if a patient is suspected of being infected, said Doyle.

“We routinely submit blood samples from our MWD population to screen for tick-borne diseases, many of which are also found in the human population (such as Lyme disease).”

Food Safety Protection

Food safety is a key part of the One Health mission, as military dining facilities serve thousands of meals daily.

""The military uses a multidisciplinary, multiservice, and interagency approach to analyze food safety and security from a One Health perspective,"" said Lt. Col. Melissa Hehr, deputy chief, Veterinary Services Division, DHA-Public Health. ""This requires close coordination amongst agencies and military services with responsibilities for food procurement, food protection, food sanitation, preventive medicine, public health, diagnostic laboratory, policy, and regulatory functions.""

Global health security benefits

One Health approaches don't just protect individual service members; they strengthen global health security for everyone.

""One Health initiatives leverage unique military capabilities to contribute to the United States' global health security efforts,"" said McElroy. ""Specifically for veterinary services, the DOW (Department of War) provides training to veterinarians and public health professionals in partner nations, strengthening their capacity to prevent and respond to disease outbreaks.""

The military also helps strengthen public health infrastructure worldwide, including laboratories, surveillance systems, and disease reporting networks that benefit both military and civilian populations, said McElroy.

Monitoring emerging threats

Military veterinarians, physicians, environmental health specialists, and public health experts work together using One Health principles. This teamwork helps identify health threats early and respond more effectively than any single group could. An example of this type of collaboration can be found in how these teams are managing the threat of New World screwworm.

“There is currently ongoing collaboration between military veterinary, medical, biosurveillance, and pest management teams to monitor and prepare for a potential incursion of New World screwworm into the United States,” said Hehr. “This flesh-eating parasite is actually a perfect example of a One Health problem where an integrative approach is being used to analyze, monitor, and mitigate the threat posed to human, animal, and environmental health, as well as military operations, food and agriculture, and national security.”

Overcoming challenges

Implementing One Health approaches in military settings requires overcoming unique challenges.

""I think the greatest challenge to implementing a One Health approach lies in our ability to develop a mutual understanding of the capabilities, responsibilities, and authorities of the various organizations and entities that are required for effective One Health integration under different contexts,"" said Hehr.

Military health teams work to build these relationships through various communication methods, including news articles, information papers, social media posts, email, meetings, webinars, and educational courses, said Hehr.

Working together for health

The success of One Health depends on collaboration across different specialties and organizations.

""At DHA Veterinary Services, we strive for collaborative communication and integration across the joint force and entire DOW,"" McElroy explains.

This teamwork includes partnerships among military veterinarians, human health professionals, environmental specialists, and public health experts from all service branches. The approach is proactive rather than reactive.

By working across traditional boundaries, military health professionals can identify threats earlier, respond more effectively, and protect service members and their families more completely. As health threats become more complex and global, One Health approaches become more important for protecting military communities.

The Defense Health Agency supports our Nation by improving health and building readiness—making extraordinary experiences ordinary and exceptional outcomes routine.

TRICARE serves active-duty service members, retirees, and their families with comprehensive medical, dental, pharmacy, and specialty benefits. But eligibility isn’t one-size-fits-all; it varies based on military status and family relationships.

Active duty service members are automatically enrolled in TRICARE Prime—a plan that offers care at military hospitals or through network providers. For those stationed overseas or looking for more flexibility in provider choice, there’s also TRICARE Select Overseas.

Family members play an important role too. Spouses and children under 21 (or up to 23 if they’re enrolled in college) qualify for various plans depending on their sponsor's status. Retired service members have access to additional options like TRICARE For Life if they are also enrolled in Medicare.

But what happens during transitions? Many individuals don’t realize that simply retiring from active duty doesn’t mean your coverage continues seamlessly. It’s vital to verify registration with DEERS (Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System) before making any changes or enrolling anew—this step ensures everyone listed has current information.

Blaine McGraw.

The policy, rolled out in December 2025 and announced publicly this month, marks a direct response to the McGraw case, in which the Army doctor faces 54 counts of indecent visual recording involving 44 women at Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center and Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii.

What Changed

Under the new policy, staff at all military treatment facilities worldwide must now proactively offer chaperones for any sensitive examination. Previously, facilities were only required to accommodate patient requests for chaperones — placing the burden on patients to ask for protection.

""Having chaperones available is a crucial part of patient-centered care,"" said Dr. Paul Cordts, DHA Deputy Assistant Director for Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer. ""Chaperones can help protect both patients and health care staff.""

The policy defines chaperones as ""an impartial third party and a safeguard for patients and staff"" who will ""immediately report any suspected inappropriate conduct.""

Lawsuit Alleges Systematic Failures

But according to a civil lawsuit filed in Bell County on Dec. 10th, 2025, by 82 women, the damage from the old policy was already done.

The petition alleges McGraw ""routinely altered and falsified records...recording the presence of chaperones who, in fact, were never in the room.""

The petition argues that ""the Army's chaperone policy at Darnall Army Medical Center...placed the burden of protection on the very women least equipped to insist on safeguards"" — particularly military spouses, dependents, and junior soldiers who felt intimidated by a male field-grade officer.

Many women requested chaperones but were denied by McGraw, according to the petition.

Shield of Sisters and the Cobos Law Firm brought four survivors to Capitol Hill, pushing Congress to go further than the DHA policy by making chaperones mandatory — not optional.

""We think that chaperones should be mandatory. It should not be optional, nor should it be up to the discretion of the individual who is receiving care,"" said attorney Andrew Cobos, who represents the 82 women suing McGraw.

Cobos argued that mandatory chaperones would not only protect patients but also save taxpayer money by preventing costly federal lawsuits.

""We have seen multiple instances — the Michael Stockton case, this case, the Nassar case — where the federal government has been sued for legitimate reasons for their failure to provide oversight, and that has cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars,"" Cobos said.

Three Legislative Proposals

The advocates introduced three pieces of legislation during their meetings with House representatives, senators, and the Democratic Women's Caucus:

Mandatory chaperones during sensitive medical examinations

Expanded definition of military sexual trauma (MST) to include family members and Department of Defense civilians

Commander accountability for ""quiet PCSing"" — the practice of transferring problem service members without resolving issues internally

""They were saying, 'We thought we'd fixed this with Vanessa Guillen and we thought we did this right,'"" said Shannon Hough, founder and CEO of Shield of Sisters. ""And we told them there's nothing you can do until we start holding commanders and perpetrators accountable just like we would on the civilian side.""

The Transfer That Wasn't Stopped

The lawsuit alleges that McGraw transferred from Tripler to Fort Hood after a patient complained he improperly recorded her pelvic exam on his personal cell phone.

""Rather than investigate or meaningfully restrict his practice, McGraw's chain of command dismissed the complaint, minimized her allegations, and permitted him to continue treating women with little or no supervision,"" the petition states.

The lawsuit calls this a ""systemic military and leadership failure — not an isolated incident.""

Bipartisan Support

Hough said the response from lawmakers was overwhelmingly positive and bipartisan.

""It's so encouraging that they're saying this is not a partisan issue, this is a human issue,"" Hough said.

Lawmakers were shocked to learn the scope of military sexual trauma, Hough said.

""You would not believe how many of them don't know that it's one in three women, that it is such a huge issue. It's a systemic problem and it's an endemic problem,"" Hough said. ""The public needs to know how bad this problem is.""

According to the advocates, more than 56,000 survivors are currently waiting for compensation exams from the Department of Veterans Affairs.

What the New Policy Means for Patients

Under the new DHA policy:

Staff must offer chaperones before any sensitive exam (examinations involving genitalia, rectum, or female breasts)

Patients can request chaperones when scheduling appointments or during visits

Staff will make ""reasonable efforts"" to provide a chaperone of the preferred gender

If a chaperone isn't available, patients can reschedule

Chaperones can be physicians, nurses, medics, technicians, or other qualified staff

The policy applies to all military hospitals and clinics worldwide

Patients with questions or concerns should contact their facility's patient advocate.

The policy may be waived in emergency situations.

Where the Case Stands

McGraw, 47, remains in pretrial confinement at the Bell County Jail. He faces four charges and 61 specifications, with alleged offenses occurring between January 1 and December 1, 2025.

Cobos said his firm has filed a motion for default judgment against McGraw after he failed to respond to the civil lawsuit. They've also submitted Federal Tort Claims Act cases seeking compensation from the federal government, but must wait six months for the Army to respond.

'We're Not Done'

Hough emphasized that the fight extends far beyond the McGraw case.

""We're not done in DC. There's gonna be many more trips. We're not done in Fort Hood or Tripler,"" Hough said. ""We're not done until the last person says, 'I'm the last one who was assaulted in the military,' and that's gonna take a lot.""",https://media.kcentv.com/assets/KCEN/images/79db87a3-6f03-4367-adfa-c1e3fa4c92c0/20251211T123515/79db87a3-6f03-4367-adfa-c1e3fa4c92c0_1140x641.jpg,N,-1.0,2026-01-20 00:56:30.259624

At United Benefits, we specialize in helping federal employees and retirees make sense of their benefit options and guide them toward the best choices for both the present and future. Let’s break down how TRICARE and FEHB work together and what you need to know for a smooth transition into retirement.

Understanding TRICARE

TRICARE is the Department of Defense’s health insurance program for active-duty service members, retirees, and their families. After military retirement, most are eligible for TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select, and upon turning 65, they transition to TRICARE For Life (TFL) when enrolled in Medicare Part A and Part B. TRICARE’s coverage is comprehensive, but understanding how it integrates with other federal health insurance options, such as FEHB, is crucial to avoiding overlap and unnecessary expenses.

Understanding FEHB

The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program offers federal employees and annuitants access to a wide range of private health plans. Coverage continues into retirement as long as you’ve been enrolled for the five years preceding your retirement—or since first becoming eligible. FEHB plans include HMOs, PPOs, and high-deductible options, giving retirees flexibility in terms of providers and premiums. Importantly, you can carry FEHB into retirement even if you’re also eligible for TRICARE.

Coordinating TRICARE and FEHB Coverage

While both programs offer outstanding coverage, maintaining both can sometimes lead to duplication of benefits. Understanding how these two programs coordinate is critical for making informed decisions:

Primary vs. Secondary Coverage: When you have both TRICARE and FEHB, the FEHB plan usually pays first, and TRICARE pays second, covering some or all of your remaining out-of-pocket expenses.

Optional Coverage Strategy: Some retirees choose to suspend (not cancel) their FEHB coverage once they’re covered by TRICARE For Life. This suspension allows them to avoid paying monthly FEHB premiums while retaining the right to reenroll in FEHB later if their circumstances change.

Retain FEHB for Flexibility: Maintaining FEHB coverage can be beneficial for those who live near medical providers who do not accept TRICARE or for anyone who wants additional provider network options.

TRICARE For Life (TFL) and Medicare Coordination

Once you reach age 65 and become eligible for Medicare, you transition from TRICARE Select or Prime into TRICARE For Life (TFL). In this setup, Medicare acts as your primary payer, and TFL pays most of what Medicare doesn’t cover. This can make carrying FEHB in addition to TFL seem redundant. However, maintaining or suspending FEHB coverage should be considered carefully.

According to the Defense Health Agency, more than 5.6 million individuals were enrolled in TRICARE as of 2023, showing how critical it remains for military families across the country (Defense Health Agency, 2023). With more retirees transitioning into federal service and later into Medicare, understanding this coordination is more important than ever.

FEHB Suspension Option for Retirees with TRICARE

Federal retirees with TRICARE For Life can suspend their FEHB plan rather than cancel it outright. This option is available because TRICARE is recognized as an eligible alternative coverage under the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) guidelines. By suspending FEHB, retirees avoid paying monthly FEHB premiums but keep the right to reinstate FEHB in the future—such as if they lose TRICARE eligibility or decide they need additional coverage options.

This suspension option is particularly attractive because reinstatement can occur during any open season or after a qualifying life event, without penalty. Retirees who choose to keep both may do so for reasons such as extra coverage for prescription drugs, access to specific doctors, or family coverage considerations.

Cost Considerations

Balancing TRICARE and FEHB coverage involves understanding premiums, copays, and deductibles. FEHB plans have monthly premiums that can range substantially depending on the plan selected. TRICARE, meanwhile, has lower premiums but requires enrollment fees for certain plans. When evaluating both, consider your health needs, dependents, and future healthcare locations—especially if you plan to relocate after retirement.

As of 2024, TRICARE Select family coverage had an annual enrollment fee of $537.60 for retirees, while TRICARE Prime family coverage had an annual enrollment fee of $744 (TRICARE.mil). FEHB premiums, on the other hand, vary widely but can easily exceed $5,000 a year for comprehensive family plans. These costs highlight the financial advantage that suspension of FEHB may provide for some retirees, though decisions should be based on total expected out-of-pocket costs and provider access.

Making an Informed Decision

No two retirees have the same needs, so there is no one-size-fits-all solution for coordinating TRICARE and FEHB. The right combination depends on your family situation, medical requirements, anticipated travel or relocation, and preferred healthcare providers. Before making changes, it’s wise to consult with a benefits specialist who understands both federal and military systems.

At United Benefits, we provide personalized federal benefits counseling to help you evaluate your options and ensure you’re making informed, strategic decisions. Our experts help federal employees, military retirees, and their families navigate enrollment periods, coverage questions, and planning for future transitions like Medicare eligibility.

Tips for Managing TRICARE and FEHB Together

Review your FEHB plan during Open Season each year, even if you currently have TRICARE, to ensure you’re not missing potential savings or improved coverage options.

Understand your family’s healthcare patterns—if you have dependents not eligible for TRICARE, maintaining FEHB may be essential.

When you reach Medicare eligibility age, review how Medicare, TRICARE For Life, and FEHB interact before making final decisions.

Speak with a United Benefits specialist to ensure your decisions align with both your immediate and long-term healthcare needs.

With various plans available, understanding your options is crucial for ensuring you and your family receive the best possible care. TRICARE serves as a lifeline for uniformed service members and their families, providing access to essential health services across different states.

One of the most popular choices is TRICARE Prime, which operates similarly to an HMO. This plan emphasizes using military hospitals and clinics while significantly reducing out-of-pocket costs when seeking care from authorized civilian providers within the network. For active duty service members (ADSMs), enrollment in TRICARE Prime is mandatory; however, it’s optional for active duty family members (ADFMs) living in designated Prime Service Areas (PSAs). If you're stationed far from these areas or prefer more flexibility, consider TRICARE Select—a self-managed option that allows beneficiaries to choose their own healthcare providers without needing referrals.

Interestingly, if you’re eligible but not enrolled in either of these plans due to unique circumstances or location constraints, there are still viable alternatives such as TRICARE Reserve Select or even TRICARE Young Adult plans tailored specifically for certain demographics.

For those residing overseas or who have command-sponsored family members abroad, options like the TRICARE Overseas Program come into play. These programs ensure that regardless of where life takes you—whether it's a bustling city on U.S. soil or an overseas assignment—you have access to quality healthcare services tailored to your needs.

I might would check and see if it's possible for only one dependent to have Tricare select, so that way they're not as limited in medical providers or care. That's if you want to be able to present more to her as to how it would be beneficial for him to have Tricare as well (honestly not sure why you wouldn't, but that's just my personal thoughts)

Also to add, I'm almost positive that now that you're under prime (I'm new to prime, i've always had select) you have to go through the referral process to continue using your same providers, because prime typically has to be seen by their on post provider.

The child can have 2 insurances. Not sure of the circumstances of them having Medicaid or if theyd be able to maintain that. Thats something the bio mom & your husband need to navigate. But the providers as well as a Triicare need to be informed of dual insurance. Medicaid would be filed 1st & Tricare would pick up second to them. Also, if Tricare finds out there's a different primary insurance & claims aren't filed accordingly, yall could be on the hook, financially. So, get it taken care of sooner than later.

I’m sorry you’re getting so much incorrect info here.

Medicaid is one of the few situations where Tricare is first payer. https://tricare.mil/Plans/OHI

Your stepson’s doctors will need to know he has Tricare. Does he live near a military installation? If so, will his mom be willing to switch his doctors if needed and take him on base?

It might make more sense in this situation to have him on Select. The rest of your can be on Prime if you like.",,N,0.0,2026-01-19 06:56:35.839601

Here are some key tips and insights from Redditors to help you navigate the process and achieve your career goals:

Navigating the Current Climate

The federal job market can be volatile, and it's important to be aware of the current challenges and adjust your strategy accordingly.

Be Selective with Agencies: Focus on agencies that are more stable or considered mission-critical. ""Yes. Just be selective. Look at the non-negotiable agencies, like DoD and VA.""

Consider the Political Climate: Some Redditors advise avoiding federal jobs under certain administrations due to instability and emotional toll. ""Do not work for this administration. The emotional tax is crushing""

Persistence Pays Off: Even during hiring freezes, some jobs are still available. ""My FJO somehow has not been rescinded, I scour USAJobs daily in case something pops up and can apply as a plan B.""

Mastering the Application Process

A well-crafted application and strong interview skills are crucial for securing a federal job.

Good Resume and Interview Skills: Ensure your resume is well-formatted and you can excel in interviews. ""What works best is: 1. Good formatted resume 2. Good interview skills 3. Apply Apply Apply""

Use USAjobs.gov: This is the primary portal for federal job applications. ""USAjobs.gov""

Federal Resume Format: Tailor your resume to the federal format, which often differs from private sector resumes. ""I touched up my resume following the federal resume format""

Career Progression Strategies

Once you're in, there are several ways to advance your career within the federal system.

Seek Ladder Positions: These jobs allow you to progress through different GS levels without reapplying. ""I’m a GS 7 with a ladder to a GS 9""

Gain Experience and Certifications: Continuous learning and skill development are key. ""I got here with solely a combo of experience and IT certifications.""

Networking: Building connections can open doors to new opportunities. ""Best of all get to know people, network and always be positive when dealing with others""

Degrees and Experience

You can get a federal job with or without a degree, depending on your approach.

Degrees Open Doors: Pursuing a degree can make it easier to enter federal service. ""If you want to open doors in federal positions, you need to pursue a degree.""

Experience Can Substitute: Many federal jobs value experience over education. ""Most federal jobs do not require a degree.""

Start Low and Climb: It's possible to start in a lower-grade position and work your way up. ""Started at GS6 0343 and five years later I am a non supervisory GS13""

A new system-wide privileging process allows healthcare professionals to carry their credentials between all military hospitals and clinics.

Strategic benefits for leadership and staff:

 - Eliminates redundant paperwork during permanent changes of station or deployments.

 - Limits onboarding delays to five business days.

 - Increases provider availability for patient care.

 - Enhances medical readiness across the joint force.

This modernization prioritizes mission focus over red tape.

Courthouse wedding.
Yall will lose the cost of a wedding to medical bills otherwise.
You can explain that the courthouse wedding will be done now and then yall can have a big ceremony/reception later.","Cool, she’s complaining about it and yall are gonna be stuck with bills because no, insurance doesn’t “backdate”. Imagine buying car insurance today and trying to claim a wreck two months ago.

So either she needs to get over it or yall can enjoy the medical bills.

You can have the court house wedding right now and then have the fancy wedding later if you both truly love each other and want to get married, that way you both will have the coverage. My friend and her husband (now ex-husband) got married at the courthouse before his deployment and then had the fancy wedding when he got back.

Courthouse wedding.

Eat the costs which will be 6 figures.

Abortion.

You made an adult choice to have unprotected sex, time to have the corresponding adult discussion. Do whatever right means to you but make those choices sooner than later, legitimately in the next two weeks.

FTR they don’t give a fuck about a ring. Just that piece of paper. If gf wants a “real” wedding, just file the official paperwork and be married on paper then have a wedding later. Or look into your state’s Medicaid. They often cover unwed pregnant women.

You done messed up a-a-ron.

Seriously though go ahead and get married at the courthouse. Yall will lose the cost of a wedding to medical bills otherwise. Put that in savings to have the full deal when yall are ready.

Yeah you’re right Tricare won’t cover her until y’all are married. But will cover from the date you get her registered in DEERS as your dependent and she gets her ID card. As for baby, once born, you’ll have 90 days to register baby with DEERS and Tricare and they’ll be covered under you.

You can explain that the courthouse wedding will be done now and then yall can have a big ceremony/reception later. Very common in the service.

Go to the courthouse, do the paperwork and get legally married.

Have a wedding later if that's what she wants.

Hell you don't even have to tell anyone you're married yet if she doesn't want to.

I became a preacher online and did a wedding for a friend on his porch a few months ago, he didn't feel like having a wedding so we did it there. Quick and easy",,N,-1.0,2026-01-17 16:56:18.821284
