For many women in the military, freezing eggs can be a way to create flexibility down the line.
Bottom line According to TRICARE, egg freezing for non-medical reasons is not covered under standard benefits.
Programs like Cofertility’s Split offer a path to free egg freezing when you donate half your eggs to another family.","If you’re an active-duty service member or spouse and thinking about freezing your eggs, you’re not alone. Many women in the military are interested in preserving their fertility, especially given the demanding nature of military life. Between deployments, relocations, and irregular schedules, starting a family may not be a priority right now—but that doesn’t mean you want to close that door entirely.

In this article, we’ll walk through how egg freezing works for military personnel, what TRICARE does and doesn’t cover, which military hospitals offer reproductive services, and how egg sharing programs like Cofertility’s can help bridge the gap if you're looking to freeze your eggs for personal (non-medical) reasons. We’ll also get into what to expect logistically, how to time your cycle, and what options exist if you don’t qualify for military benefits.

What TRICARE covers—and what it doesn’t

Let’s start with the basics. According to TRICARE, the health plan for active-duty service members, retirees, and their families, elective egg freezing is not covered under standard military insurance benefits. That means if you’re freezing your eggs for non-medical reasons—like delaying parenthood, focusing on your career, or preserving your options—you’ll have to pay for it out of pocket. This includes all parts of the process: medications, monitoring, the egg retrieval procedure, and long-term storage.

TRICARE does cover fertility preservation (including egg retrieval and storage) if your fertility has been impaired by a serious or severe illness or injury related to your service. This includes things like combat injuries that affect your reproductive organs or chemotherapy received during active duty. In these cases, coverage is provided through the Supplemental Health Care Program, which falls under a different category of military healthcare and applies to both male and female service members.

To qualify under this medical exception, you must:

Be an active-duty service member

Have a Category II or III illness or injury sustained during active duty

Be unable to conceive or carry a pregnancy without assisted reproductive technology (ART)

If you meet those criteria, TRICARE will cover services like egg retrieval, sperm retrieval, IVF, and intrauterine insemination. And according to TRICARE, if you paid out of pocket for any of these services after March 8, 2024, you may be eligible for reimbursement.

Where you can get fertility care in the military system

Even though TRICARE doesn’t generally cover elective egg freezing, some military hospitals do offer ART services at a significantly reduced cost. These services are available to eligible service members and beneficiaries on a first-come, first-served basis, depending on availability.

As of now, eight military hospitals offer reproductive endocrinology and infertility care through their graduate medical education programs:

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (Bethesda, MD)

Tripler Army Medical Center (Honolulu, HI)

Womack Army Medical Center (Fort Liberty, NC)

Madigan Army Medical Center (Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA)

Brooke Army Medical Center (Fort Sam Houston, TX)

Naval Medical Center San Diego (San Diego, CA)

Naval Medical Center Portsmouth (Portsmouth, VA)

Wright-Patterson Medical Center / 88th Medical Group (Greene County, OH)

While these programs prioritize care for service members with qualifying medical conditions, some do accept elective patients on a limited basis. Costs are often significantly lower than in the civilian market, but availability is highly variable, and waitlists are common.

Why egg freezing may still make sense, even without coverage

Military life is unpredictable. You might be deployed overseas with short notice, move across the country every few years, or find yourself in leadership roles that demand your full attention. Fertility doesn’t hit pause while you or your spouse serves—and unfortunately, egg quality declines with age regardless of your fitness level or overall health.

For many women in the military, freezing eggs can be a way to create flexibility down the line. It gives you more reproductive options, especially if you’re not ready (or able) to start a family during your service years. Even if you don’t end up using those eggs, having them stored offers a sense of security.

How Cofertility’s Split program fits in

If you’re interested in egg freezing but can’t afford the costs out of pocket—and don’t qualify for ART coverage through TRICARE—Cofertility’s Split program may be a great option. Through this program, you can freeze your eggs for free if you qualify and donate half of the eggs retrieved during your cycle to a family who needs them.

Here’s what’s covered through Split:

All fertility clinic fees

Medications and monitoring

Egg retrieval procedure

Storage for your half of the eggs for up to 10 years

In exchange, the other half of your eggs are donated to intended parents who are ready to grow their family. You’ll never be asked to pay for anything out of pocket, and you’ll receive personalized support from our team throughout the process.

Eligibility and what to expect

Unfortunately, not everyone will be eligible for Split. Like all egg donation programs, Cofertility requires certain medical and personal criteria, including:

Age 21–33

No smoking or significant reproductive health issues

Willingness to undergo genetic testing and psychological screening

Ability to provide a biological family medical history

If you were adopted or donor-conceived and don’t have access to your biological family’s health history, that may affect your eligibility. If that’s the case, you might consider freezing your eggs through our Keep program, where you keep 100% of your eggs and pay out of pocket, but get access to discounts and dedicated support.

How to time your cycle around military life

Timing is one of the biggest concerns for active-duty service members. An egg freezing cycle typically takes about two weeks of daily hormone injections, during which you’ll need to visit the clinic several times for bloodwork and ultrasounds. Then comes the egg retrieval itself, which is a minor surgical procedure with a short recovery time.

If you’re on active duty, here are a few ways to make it work:

Plan around a block of leave or light-duty status

Schedule during a stateside posting or training pause

Coordinate with your supervisor for time off (how much you share is up to you)

Stay near one of our partner clinics for the duration of your cycle

We understand that flexibility is limited in the military, but we’ve seen it work when there’s advance planning and support in place.

Privacy and confidentiality

Understandably, many service members want to keep their fertility planning private. With Cofertility, all of your care is coordinated through private clinics—not the military medical system. Your participation in the Split or Keep programs is confidential and never reported to TRICARE or your command.

That said, if you’re requesting leave or modified duty to attend appointments, you may need to give some explanation. Some choose to share openly, while others keep it general and simply say it’s for a medical procedure. Either is completely fine.

What if you’re based overseas?

If you’re currently stationed abroad, your options are more limited. While some countries offer fertility care for military personnel at allied clinics, elective egg freezing is unlikely to be available through TRICARE or DoD channels. In most cases, you’ll need to wait until you're back in the U.S. to start the process—or coordinate a trip home during leave.

Bottom line

According to TRICARE, egg freezing for non-medical reasons is not covered under standard benefits. ART services, including egg retrieval, are only available to service members who sustained a qualifying injury or illness during active duty that impairs fertility. However, eight military hospitals do offer ART services at reduced cost, and may accept elective patients when space allows.

If you don’t meet the medical criteria but still want to freeze your eggs, you’re not out of options. Programs like Cofertility’s Split offer a path to free egg freezing when you donate half your eggs to another family. For many women in the military, this can be a way to take control of their reproductive future without waiting for policy to change.

Military service asks a lot—and family planning often gets pushed to the back burner. But if you’re thinking ahead, egg freezing might help create the space you need to build the life you want, when the time is right.

Use your benefits to make sure your child starts the school year healthy and ready to succeed.","AUGUST 8, 2025 – A new school year brings excitement and new challenges for families. With TRICARE, you have access to health care services that can help your child start the year healthy and ready to learn.

Getting your child’s health care needs taken care of before school starts helps ensure they’re ready to focus on learning. TRICARE covers the essential services that parents need to check off their back-to-school list.

School physicals and health requirements

Most schools require a physical exam before your child can attend classes. TRICARE covers school physicals when required for enrollment.

Review your school district’s physical requirements early. Each state has different rules about when children need physicals and what the exam must include.

Important note: TRICARE doesn’t cover sports physicals. If your child plans to join a sports team, you’ll need to pay for this exam out of pocket.

Immunizations

Schools require up-to-date vaccines to protect all students from serious diseases. Check your school district’s immunization requirements before the school year starts.

TRICARE covers age-appropriate vaccine doses for children, as described in the TRICARE Pharmacy Program Handbook. You can get these vaccines from:

Any TRICARE-authorized provider

Many participating retail network pharmacies

Military pharmacies

Keep your child’s immunization records in a safe place. Schools will ask for proof of vaccines before your child can attend classes.

Vision

Children need clear vision to succeed in school. TRICARE covers eye exams, but the frequency depends on your family’s status. TRICARE covers:

Annual eye exams for children of active duty service members

One eye exam every two years for children of retired service members with TRICARE Prime

Schedule your child’s eye exam before school starts. This gives you time to get glasses or address any vision problems.

If you have vision coverage through Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program or another health plan, be sure to check your plan’s coverage policy.

Dental care for children

Good dental health helps children focus on learning instead of being distracted by tooth pain.

You may qualify for dental coverage through the TRICARE Dental Program. If you’re eligible, you can enroll your child at any time during the year.

Other dental options may also be available to your family. Visit TRICARE Dental Care to learn more about dental coverage options.

Supporting your child’s mental health

Some children feel excited about returning to school, while others feel nervous or scared. These feelings are normal, especially when children:

Meet new friends and teachers

Start at a new school

Move to a different grade level

Watch for signs that your child is having trouble adjusting. Many children feel better once they get involved in school activities. However, TRICARE covers mental health services if your child needs extra help during this transition.

Daily healthy choices

You can help your child make healthy choices every day by:

Packing nutritious lunches and snacks

Making sure your child gets enough sleep

Encouraging physical activity

Talking about school safety

These habits help children stay alert and ready to learn throughout the school day.

College students and TRICARE

If your child is heading to college this fall, they can keep TRICARE coverage until their 23rd birthday or until they graduate, whichever comes first, as long as they:

Are a full-time student at an approved institution of higher education

Have a TRICARE sponsor who provides more than 50% of their financial support

You must update your child’s student status in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System to maintain their coverage. Health care plan options for college students depend on where they live.

After college, they may qualify to purchase TRICARE Young Adult coverage.

Act now

Don’t wait until the last minute to prepare for the school year. Here are some steps to get started:

Check your child’s immunization records

Schedule needed physicals and eye exams

Review your school’s health requirements

Update information in DEERS if needed

Does your child have a prescription (for example, an inhaler) they need to bring to school? Work with a military pharmacy to get the correct prescription labels. Note: The military pharmacy will ask for your child’s DOD ID.

Additional resources

TRICARE offers many programs and resources to help military families. Visit TRICARE or contact your regional contractor for more information about:

Portable headsets let medics rehearse battlefield care wherever they are and in between patient visits.
Advanced simulation works as a “digital health force multiplier,” said Bible, noting that, ultimately, these digital tools ensure the health and safety of the warfighter is in the hands of thoroughly trained medics.","Artificial intelligence and digital simulation tools are transforming how the military trains its future medical workforce. Military doctors, nurses, medics, and U.S. Navy corpsmen can now rehearse battlefield care in the field, trauma bays, or even downrange: repeating each task until it feels natural, all without touching a patient.

U.S. Air Force Maj. Meki Bocage, deputy chief of the Defense Health Agency’s medical modernization and simulation division, summed up the advantages of these tools, saying, “Simulation tools allow the medical workforce to get their sets and reps with realistic simulators and equipment.” She pointed out the newest models, “create live-resuscitation scenarios, and provide immediate, human, realistic responses.”

Many of these simulation products were on display for leaders across the DHA and Military Health System during the Medical Modeling, Simulation, and Pre-Hospital Innovation Expo at the Defense Health Headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia, on July 15, 2025. The event brought together more than 20 companies to demonstrate the latest in digital technology.

The event provides MHS leaders the opportunity to speak with vendors and innovators to discuss the future and how their products may enhance military health care in one place. Bocage said, “The expo allows leadership to see what innovative medical modernization and simulation capabilities that are out there and available.”

Real combat trauma leaves no room for hesitation or mistakes, yet most uniformed clinicians do not get needed battlefield injury training daily, usually only treating everyday illnesses between deployments. Simulation offers unlimited training on complex tasks without harming patients or wasting supplies, and in a shorter time frame.

U.S. Army Col. Ryan Bible, deputy assistant director of DHA’s education and training directorate, called the shift “a game changer,” noting, “the ability to get real-world experience based on a significant pool of data …we get years’ worth of trauma experience in a matter of minutes using this technology.” Virtual platforms extend that realism, where loops within the same scenario turn rare battlefield events into routine muscle memory.

New Tools and the 2025 MHS Digital Transformation Strategy

The MHS strategy lists four main lines of effort: modernize military medical infrastructure, develop digital care models, develop a digitally competent medical workforce, and integrate artificial intelligence and data management. Digital tools advance each goal.

Bible said, “There’s a direct line to the digital transformation strategy … it helps ensure that it’s synergistic across the enterprise, from point of injury to definitive care.”

He stressed the importance of “having a provider that benefits from the AI and simulation tools we have … you no longer have the days of a young doctor out there practicing medicine without real-world experience.”

Simulation checks every box, he says. Virtual reality labs modernize the infrastructure. Portable headsets let medics rehearse battlefield care wherever they are and in between patient visits. Data captured from every training repetition feeds dashboards that enhance learning and training scenarios and turn instructors into data scientists. Algorithms fueled by the new data can predict when skills may need to be polished, and enhanced medics can stay ahead of their training.

Global Learning Environment

MHS leaders envision a “dynamic learning environment,” according to the strategy, where medical personnel in a military hospital or clinic, on a ship, or on the battlefield can join the same scenarios or hear identical vitals and receive feedback within seconds.

“We want to create a comprehensive and holistic learning ecosystem that spans from hospital to battlefield,” said U.S. Army Col. Paul Kwon, chief of DHA’s medical modernization and simulation division. “That continuum of care—from point of injury through the definitive roles of care—is essential for supporting a ready medical force.”

Digital simulation does more than entertain; it produces biometric and task data. Kwon explained how gamified modules run on low-bandwidth tablets, so a corpsman on night watch can treat a blast victim, upload results, and receive a custom refresher before dawn. “The flexibility slashes travel costs and lets units train without pulling clinicians from clinics,” said Kwon.

Turning Practice into Readiness

Every digital pulse and airway attempt generates metrics and data, said Jacqueline Haven, DHA Academy lead. “This data can then lead to more specific training interventions that advance your skills development in a way that’s very targeted to your specific needs. The analytics give us targeted, skill-based training interventions. That’s powerful. It’s not just better training—it’s smarter training,” she said.

Military leaders can now see which medics need a certain training refresher and schedule a shorter drill instead of sending them to a week-long course, and predictive dashboards will soon alert leaders before skills may slip.

Simulation also answers a mandate from the National Defense Authorization Act to adopt best practices from civilian trauma centers while lowering costs. “Simulation training … saves costs. It saves resources. It saves time. It can be at the point of need,” said Kwon. The approach cuts live-tissue labs, reduces bio-waste, and avoids ethical concerns.

Scenarios once limited by space or travel budgets now play out anywhere a secure network reaches remote clinics, forward operating bases, and aboard hospital ships.

Coverage of weight loss drugs for active-duty service members, retirees and their families enrolled in other health care plans, such as Tricare Prime or Tricare Select, will depend on a person’s condition and certain criteria, Tricare said.
It wasn’t clear exactly what benchmarks people would need to meet for weight loss drug coverage.
“Otherwise, if you have an approved prior authorization for weight loss drugs, it’s no longer valid,” Tricare said in the statement.
Likewise, the number of monthly prescriptions for weight loss drugs filled during the same period rose from seven to 816.","Some retired service members and others fighting the battle of the bulge will no longer have the cost of several popular weight loss drugs covered by the military health system, Tricare announced this week.

Starting Aug. 31, Tricare for Life beneficiaries won’t receive coverage for Zepbound, Wegovy or other GLP-1 medications, a Tricare statement said Tuesday. Tricare is the federal health care program for active-duty service members, retirees and their families.

The change also applies to Defense Department civilians and other people not covered by Tricare but who are eligible to receive care at military hospitals, according to the statement.

Coverage of weight loss drugs for active-duty service members, retirees and their families enrolled in other health care plans, such as Tricare Prime or Tricare Select, will depend on a person’s condition and certain criteria, Tricare said.

It wasn’t clear exactly what benchmarks people would need to meet for weight loss drug coverage. Enrollment in a Tricare premium plan, prior authorization and a prescription from a network health care provider are among the requirements, according to the statement.

“Otherwise, if you have an approved prior authorization for weight loss drugs, it’s no longer valid,” Tricare said in the statement. “You’ll need to see your provider to discuss your options.”

People affected by the change will get a notice in the mail in the coming weeks, Tricare added.

Use of GLP-1 medications, such as Trulicity, Ozempic, Mounjaro or Victoza, to treat type-2 diabetes still will be covered provided that the treatment is medically necessary and prior authorization is obtained. Some drugs, such as Ozempic, require a copayment.

It’s unclear how many people will be affected by the change. But a Military Health System report published in January 2024 found that the number of active-duty service members who were prescribed a weight loss drug from January 2018 through June 2023 increased nearly a hundredfold, from 1.2 to 104.4 per 100,000 service members.

Likewise, the number of monthly prescriptions for weight loss drugs filled during the same period rose from seven to 816. Nearly 100% of those prescriptions were for a supply of 90 days or less, according to the report.

The report also said that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated in 2022 that increased obesity prevalence in military members costs a potential $1.5 billion annually in obesity-related health care and 658,000 lost workdays.

“The trend in use of weight loss medication in the military should continue to be monitored, as these therapies represent a novel tool to manage obesity in this population,” the military health report stated.

The DHA action comes as civilian health care insurers also grapple with a surge of people seeking the costly drugs amid an obesity epidemic.

In a cost-saving move last month, CVS Caremark stopped covering Zepbound, which is used for chronic weight management in obese or overweight adults, CNN reported July 1.

Zepbound and other weight loss drugs typically used to treat diabetes mimic hormones that regulate hunger and satiety, helping people feel full sooner and eat less, according to a University of Chicago Medicine report in June.

But the cost of those benefits ranges from $700-$800 per month, according to the report.

The researchers also studied the financial impacts if a government health care program, such as Medicare, were to expand its coverage of weight loss drugs for medical treatments beyond diabetes or sleep apnea.

Their projections showed that such an expansion could result in $48 billion in new Medicare spending over 10 years, according to the report.

“Insurers and policymakers aren’t just asking, ‘Is this a good treatment?’” David Kim, a health economist at the University of Chicago, said in the report. “They’re asking, ‘What will this do to our budget?’ And for now, the budget impact is huge.”",https://www.stripes.com/incoming/15pb85-110825drugsphoto01.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/110825DRUGSphoto01.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-08 12:56:28.597132

As part of the initiative, the EACE, a joint effort between the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, released peer-reviewed care pathways, including “Rehabilitation of Lower Limb Amputation” and “Management of Upper Limb Amputation Rehabilitation,” to support patient care.

These studies are part of a broader set of 28 Clinical Practice Guidelines developed since the early 1990s. Designed as tools for clinicians, the guidelines address a range of medical issues commonly faced by warfighters and are grounded in the latest research and best practices.

The seminar also featured hands-on sessions involving guided imagery, visualization, music, dance, movement, and creative arts therapy, of which many providers are aware but rarely implement.

“FAST always has had some element of mental health, but mental health emerged as the next clear priority topic based on an emphasis in the clinical practice guidelines and clinician input,” said Andrea Crunkhorn, a physical therapy doctor and chief of clinical affairs at EACE.

Connecting Chronic Pain With Behavioral Health

Dr. Ajay Manhapra, Chief of Pain Medicine at Hampton VA Medical Center and a presenter at FAST, introduced a model centered on “trauma narratives.”

By establishing a trauma narrative, patients and providers can co-create a goal-oriented recovery plan focused on achieving a functional “new normal.”

This method is designed to assist patients in making sense of their experiences by mapping a timeline linking physical injuries to behavioral health challenges, such as post-traumatic stress disorder or opioid dependence.

These existing laws, Judge Miller noted, are sufficient to address the state's stated concerns without imposing the sweeping restrictions of Act 624.
Judge Miller found that Act 624 does not violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause, the Takings Clause, or the Equal Protection Clause.
He also declined to find preemption under ERISA or Medicare, noting that Act 624 regulates pharmacy licensing rather than plan administration.
If upheld, Act 624 could serve as a model for other states seeking to rein in PBM influence.","In a significant legal development, a federal judge has temporarily blocked Arkansas from enforcingAct624. Act624 prohibits pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from owning or operating pharmacies in the state, effectively forcing vertically integrated companies to divest or shut down their Arkansas pharmacy operations. However, on July 28, 2025, U.S. District Judge Brian Miller granted a preliminary injunction to several major PBMs and affiliated entities, halting the law's implementation pending final resolution of the case.

Court Finds Violation of Commerce Clause and TRICARE Preemption

In hisorder, Judge Miller concluded that Act 624 likely violates the U.S. Constitution's Commerce Clause by overtly discriminating against out-of-state companies and imposes an excessive burden on interstate commerce. The statute's preamble explicitly states its purpose is to eliminate ""business tactics that have driven locally-operated pharmacies out of business,"" which the court interpreted as protectionist rhetoric targeting non-Arkansas entities.

""Although the state argues that it is merely targeting a form of business structure, this appears to only be a half-truth,"" Judge Miller wrote. ""The statute discloses that the state is also attempting to protect 'locally operated pharmacies' as opposed to just consumers and non-PBM affiliated pharmacies, including out-of-state non-PBM affiliated pharmacies like Walgreens.""

The judge emphasized that Arkansas already has several laws regulating PBMs, including statutes that prohibit discriminatory reimbursement practices and exclusion of willing pharmacies from health networks. These existing laws, Judge Miller noted, are sufficient to address the state's stated concerns without imposing the sweeping restrictions of Act 624.

In addition to the Commerce Clause violation, the court found that Act 624 is likely preempted by TRICARE, the federal health benefits program for military personnel and retirees. The law would interfere with the U.S. Department of Defense's ability to contract with PBM-owned pharmacies, undermining the uniformity and stability of the TRICARE network.

""Subjecting TRICARE to the Arkansas Act624 license requirements would give the State's pharmacy board a virtual power of review over . . . who the Department of Defense can contract with,"" and "". . . impede[] the TRICARE program's ability to accomplish the purposes for which Congress enacted it,"" Judge Miller wrote..

Broader Constitutional Claims Rejected

While the court granted the injunction based on the Commerce Clause and TRICARE preemption, it rejected the plaintiffs' other constitutional claims. Judge Miller found that Act 624 does not violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause, the Takings Clause, or the Equal Protection Clause. He also declined to find preemption under ERISA or Medicare, noting that Act 624 regulates pharmacy licensing rather than plan administration.

Furthermore, the court dismissed the argument that Act 624 constitutes a bill of attainder, concluding that the law does not specifically target the plaintiffs and does not impose punishment in a constitutional sense. ""While Act 624 is tainted by its protectionist rhetoric so much as to render it unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause, it was not enacted in a wholly arbitrary manner,"" Judge Miller wrote.

Irreparable Harm and Public Interest Support Injunction

As outlined in ourJune 2025 blog post, the plaintiff PBMs and other organizations argued that Act 624 would disrupt access to medications for tens of thousands of Arkansans, including TRICARE beneficiaries, seniors, and patients with complex conditions. The court found that the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm if the law were allowed to take effect, citing the threat of unrecoverable economic losses and the inability to seek damages due to the government's sovereign immunity. The balance of equities and public interest also favored the plaintiffs, as ""no harm is caused when defendants are enjoined from enforcing an unconstitutional law.""

Next Steps and Broader Implications

The legal battle over Act624 is far from over. On July 31, 2025, the Arkansas State Board of Pharmacy filed a notice of appeal. The litigation, now consolidated under Express Scripts Inc. et al. v. Richmond et al., Case No. 4:25-cv-00520, will continue in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas.

The case is being closely watched nationwide, as Arkansas is the first state to enact such a sweeping restriction on PBMs' ownership of pharmacies. If upheld, Act 624 could serve as a model for other states seeking to rein in PBM influence. Conversely, a final ruling against the law could reinforce federal protections for PBMs and affiliated pharmacies.

For now, the preliminary injunction preserves the status quo, allowing PBM-affiliated pharmacies to continue operating in Arkansas while the legal battle unfolds.

This process can seem daunting, but a systematic approach makes it much more manageable.

Step 1: Use the Official TRICARE Provider Directory

Your first and best resource is the official provider directory for your TRICARE region. This ensures the doctors you find are in the TRICARE network, which will save you significant money and paperwork.

TRICARE East Region: Use the Humana Military Provider Finder.

TRICARE West Region: Use the Health Net Federal Services Provider Directory.

You can filter by specialty (e.g., Pediatrics, Family Medicine), location, and other factors to generate a list of potential doctors.

Step 2: Getting Referrals (TRICARE Prime)

If you are enrolled in TRICARE Prime, you will need a referral from your assigned Primary Care Manager (PCM) before you can see most specialists.

The Process: Once you have a new PCM, you will make an appointment with them to discuss your need for specialty care (e.g., for an allergist, dermatologist, etc.). Your PCM will then submit a referral request to TRICARE.

Check the Status: You can check the status of your referral on your regional contractor's website. Once approved, you will be authorized to see a specific specialist or choose from a list of approved specialists.

Step 3: Finding a Dentist

Dental care is separate from your main TRICARE health plan. Most active-duty families are covered by the TRICARE Dental Program, which is administered by United Concordia.

Find a Dentist: Use the United Concordia ""Find a Dentist"" tool to locate dentists in your new area who accept the TRICARE Dental Program.

“Act 624 is explicitly preempted by TRICARE’s ‘health care delivery’ provision because Act 624 prohibits PBM-owned pharmacies from delivering healthcare to Arkansas patients.
The judge also wrote that the plaintiffs would “suffer irreparable harm” from the Arkansas law, including great financial consequences.
“I think when the law was passed, it was by far, one of the most radical PBM state bills out there,” she said.
The National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA), meanwhile, believes Arkansas’ law is going to prevail.","As greater scrutiny envelops the largest pharmacy benefit management companies, one thing is clear: They are not going to give up without a fight.

And in that existential battle, they just notched a major win. Last week, U.S. District Judge Brian Miller blocked an Arkansas law (Act 624) that would have banned PBMs from owning and operating pharmacies in the state.

Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed Act 624 into law in April, arguing that PBMs have increasingly bought pharmacies, allowing them to increase drug prices and put competitors out of business.

Shortly after, CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and PBM lobbying group Pharmaceutical Care Management Association filed separate lawsuits challenging the law.

Miller issued a preliminary injunction against the law, stating that it violates the Commerce Clause, which says that states cannot pass laws that unfairly hurt or discriminate against businesses from other states.

In response to the decision, Sanders said in a statement that “Arkansas was the first state to force big drug middlemen called PBMs to stop inflating drug prices and manipulating the market. The PBMs sued Arkansas and a judge let them get away with it. But we’ll appeal, win in higher court, and set a new standard for the country.”

While the state plans to appeal, at least one healthcare expert isn’t so sure that this law has a future.

“I could be wrong, but I don’t think, as it is drafted today, that there’s any possibility that it gets around the constitutional challenges that it faces,” said Chris Deacon, principal and founder of VerSan Consulting.

That said, Arkansas’ efforts still sent a powerful message.

“If anything, what I think this does is it very clearly sends a signal to Congress that the states are trying [and that] this is a problem,” Deacon stated. “They are trying to deal with it head on. ‘We cannot do this alone. … We need Congress to act because the holding is very clear: Congress has the authority to regulate interstate commerce. The states do not.’”

The judge’s decision

The judge granted the plaintiffs’ motions for a preliminary injunction for a few reasons. That includes his conclusion that they are likely to “prevail” on their Commerce Clause and TRICARE preemption claims.

The Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce, while the negative implication of this authority — the dormant Commerce Clause — bars states from discriminating against interstate commerce.

“Act 624 appears to overtly discriminate against plaintiffs as out of state companies and the state has failed to show that it has no other means to advance its interests,” the judge stated. “This is true because section one of Act 624 specifically states that its purpose is to eliminate plaintiffs’ ‘business tactics that have driven locally-operated pharmacies out of business.’”

Moreover, the judge found that Act 624 conflicts with the federal TRICARE program, which is a healthcare program for active duty service members. TRICARE includes a preemption clause, meaning it overrides state laws that are inconsistent with TRICARE.

“Act 624 is explicitly preempted by TRICARE’s ‘health care delivery’ provision because Act 624 prohibits PBM-owned pharmacies from delivering healthcare to Arkansas patients. This prohibition is inconsistent with the TRICARE program that has existing contracts with some of the plaintiffs,” Miller said.

The judge also wrote that the plaintiffs would “suffer irreparable harm” from the Arkansas law, including great financial consequences.

CVS previously told MedCity News that it would be forced to close 23 community pharmacies in Arkansas and fire more than 500 local healthcare workers. Express Scripts doesn’t operate brick & mortar pharmacies in Arkansas, but it does have 25 non-resident pharmacy licenses in Arkansas that would be affected by the law.

The ruling was warmly greeted by plaintiffs whose response was framed in the context of how Arkansas’s law would harm patients with no mention of how it harmed their business prospects in the state.

David Whitrap, vice president of external affairs at CVS Health, said the company is “pleased with the Court’s decision to grant a preliminary injunction to stop the implementation of Act 624. We continue to be focused on serving people in Arkansas and are actively looking to work together with the state to reduce drug prices and ensure access to pharmacies.”

A representative for Express Scripts echoed this.

“We appreciate the Court acting to protect Arkansans’ access to their pharmacies,” said Andrea Nelson, chief legal officer of The Cigna Group, which owns Express Scripts. “Every day, our nurses, pharmacists and other dedicated team members provide care to Arkansas patients that can’t be easily replaced, and we will continue doing everything we can to protect Arkansas patients’ access to care and affordable medicines.”

What’s ahead?

It will be interesting to see how the battle between a Republican governor of a conservative state and the PBMs plays out if Sanders formally appeals.

Deacon of VerSan Consulting believes there isn’t any hope left for Arkansas’ PBM law, given this decision from the lower court was expected as it’s a “clear violation of the Commerce Clause.” She speculated that whoever reviewed the legality of the law likely knew that it would be challenged. However, passing the law brought great awareness to the issue of PBMs, she said.

“I think when the law was passed, it was by far, one of the most radical PBM state bills out there,” she said. “It was definitely the talk of the town. I think for the state of Arkansas, it really showed that they were ready to move on this and act against some of these big industries’ corporate interests, which made a big statement.”

Not all are swayed by this bleak prospect for the law.

The National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA), meanwhile, believes Arkansas’ law is going to prevail.

“I do feel like it was the wrong decision because if you look at the way the law was written, you get away from all of the extraneous information that was brought into the record by the PBMs to sort of place a fog over the overall purpose and meaning of this law. I think reasonable minds will agree that this does not violate the Commerce Clause because there’s not a regulation of out-of-state entities, as the PBMs have claimed,” declared Matthew Seiler, general counsel at the NCPA, in an interview. He noted that it is actually a regulation of the corporate structure of PBMs, “regardless of where they are located.”

Whatever the legal future of the Arkansas law is, meaningful PBM reform needs to come from a national level instead of a patchwork of states, Deacon said. And currently, PBM reform is at the top of a lot of lawmakers’ minds. Numerous bills have been introduced targeting PBMs, including efforts to delink PBM compensation from list prices and banning spread pricing, in which PBMs charge payers more than they pay the pharmacy for a medication and then keep the difference.

Deacon is particularly in favor of the Patients Deserve Price Tags Act, which goes beyond PBM reform by requiring providers to publish the costs of services so Americans can compare prices. It ensures employer access to claims data and PBM information as well.

Seiler also called out the PBM Reform Act, which would ban spread pricing in Medicaid and delink PBM compensation from the cost of medications under Medicare Part D.

In December, a bill in Congress similar to the Arkansas law was also introduced. It’s called the Patients Before Monopolies Act and would ban the joint ownership of PBMs and pharmacies. However, this bill may be a “bridge too far” from what the federal government can achieve at this point, but it is indicative of where lawmakers want to go in the future, Deacon said.

In the absence of Congressional action, the states will likely continue to try and regulate PBMs. For example, California recently proposed a bill that would delink PBM compensation from the list price of a drug, which Paul Markovich, CEO of Ascendiun, noted in a recent episode of MedCity Debunked. Ascendiun is the nonprofit parent company of Blue Shield of California. He argued that the role of PBMs has absolutely nothing to do with the price of the drug.

“It’s not as if Amazon charges you for the cost of the contents of the box,” he said.

But Deacon hopes that with states stepping up, that Congress won’t slow its roll.

“What I would hate to see is Congress lose their energy and impetus to do something on a federal level [thinking] the states have this,” she said. “That would be a real lost opportunity.”

She added that states likely aren’t cracking down on PBMs because they simply want to, but because they’ve become a serious problem. Most states would probably be in favor of federal action against PBMs.

“The brief was informative, and it empowered our primary care teams with the knowledge and understanding of a program available for their patients who may come to them for help. There was very good discussion among our teams and the presenters,” said Lt. Col. (Dr.) Reginald Trevino, Munson’s chief medical officer and internal medicine physician.

While overall access to care at Munson is good, the health center is currently experiencing limited mental health services for family members and retirees and is looking at all available options to help connect military families with the services they need. Through a targeted care model, patients may be vectored to other resources on post, like the chaplain; Military and Family Life counselors, and Family Advocacy, but Trevino welcomed the opportunity for the team to expand their knowledge of resources available through TRICARE.

The discussion focused on how Telemynd’s services could bridge critical gaps in behavioral health care, its integration within TRICARE and the Defense Health Agency, services for children as young as age 5, and a program overview.

With an increasing demand for mental health support among military communities, Munson leaders learned Telemynd has more than 1,300 providers nationwide and offers TRICARE-covered services without a referral for family members and retirees. Their services help reduce wait time, and optional, after-hours appointments provide added convenience.

Their ability to adapt to regional needs and streamline referral processes could significantly enhance the mental health support system for Munson’s beneficiaries.

The meeting underscored a shared commitment to improving mental health outcomes through collaboration and innovative care solutions.

Family members and retirees may request a Telemynd appointment by calling 1-866-991-2103. Telemynd will match patients with a therapist or prescriber who fits their needs and schedule an appointment.

This service is not intended for patients in a life-threatening situation. Call 911 for medical emergencies, call or text 988 to speak with crisis clinician.

Precision Symptom Phenotyping Identifies Early Clinical and Proteomic Predictors of Distinct COVID-19 Sequelae

Companion editorial: Prospectively Defined Clusters of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Sequela

Post-COVID conditions are not a single disease but rather distinct symptom-based phenotypes predicted by host characteristics, acute illness severity and distinct early inflammatory markers. This study of 1,988 SARS-CoV-2 positive U.S. military health system beneficiaries revealed three symptom-based clusters: a sensory cluster, a fatigue/difficulty thinking cluster and a difficulty breathing/exercise intolerance cluster. These findings may support future clinical trials using similar precision phenotypes endpoints.

Variability in Vaccine Response and Trajectory in Early Childhood and Association With Demographic Variables, Antibiotic Exposure and Infection Proneness

This study of 357 prospectively-recruited children (age 6-36 months) revealed another potential consequence of excess antibiotic use. When vaccine-induced antibody levels were used to define vaccine response groups, children with lower vaccine-induced antibody levels had more frequent antibiotic exposures. Low vaccine responsiveness was further linked to more frequent antibiotic-treated infections. Individual children can persist or change vaccine response groups over time.

Enhanced Killing of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus With Ceftaroline or Vancomycin in Combination With Carbapenems

In this study, carbapenems (ertapenem/meropenem) enhanced the efficacy of ceftaroline or vancomycin against MRSA. Results demonstrate in vitro and in vivo (murine) synergy, reduced resistance and virulence, and enhanced immune-mediated killing. Findings suggest that adjunctive carbapenems may be a promising therapy for MRSA.

Population-Level Impact of Human Papillomavirus Vaccination on the Incidence of Genital Warts in Sweden

HPV vaccination programs have significantly reduced incidence of genital warts in Sweden, especially among women aged 15-34 with reductions of 89%, 73%, 50% and 20% in women aged 15-19, 20-24, 25-29 and 30-34, respectively. Incidence among men has also decreased substantially, likely through herd effect. During 2006-2018, 31,233 cases were averted, highlighting vaccination's remarkable population-level impact.

Review your school district’s physical requirements early. Each state has different rules about when children need physicals and what the exam must include.

Important note: TRICARE doesn’t cover sports physicals. If your child plans to join a sports team, you’ll need to pay for this exam out of pocket.

Immunizations

Schools require up-to-date vaccines to protect all students from serious diseases. Check your school district’s immunization requirements before the school year starts.

TRICARE covers age-appropriate vaccine doses for children, as described in the TRICARE Pharmacy Program Handbook. You can get these vaccines from:

Any TRICARE-authorized provider

Many participating retail network pharmacies

Military pharmacies

Keep your child’s immunization records in a safe place. Schools will ask for proof of vaccines before your child can attend classes.

Vision

Children need clear vision to succeed in school. TRICARE covers eye exams, but the frequency depends on your family’s status. TRICARE covers:

Annual eye exams for children of active duty service members

One eye exam every two years for children of retired service members with TRICARE Prime

Schedule your child’s eye exam before school starts. This gives you time to get glasses or address any vision problems.

If you have vision coverage through Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program or another health plan, be sure to check your plan’s coverage policy.

Dental care for children

Good dental health helps children focus on learning instead of being distracted by tooth pain.

You may qualify for dental coverage through the TRICARE Dental Program. If you’re eligible, you can enroll your child at any time during the year.

Other dental options may also be available to your family. Visit TRICARE Dental Care to learn more about dental coverage options.

Supporting your child’s mental health

Some children feel excited about returning to school, while others feel nervous or scared. These feelings are normal, especially when children:

Meet new friends and teachers

Start at a new school

Move to a different grade level

Watch for signs that your child is having trouble adjusting. Many children feel better once they get involved in school activities. However, TRICARE covers mental health services if your child needs extra help during this transition.

Daily healthy choices

You can help your child make healthy choices every day by:

Packing nutritious lunches and snacks

Making sure your child gets enough sleep

Encouraging physical activity

Talking about school safety

These habits help children stay alert and ready to learn throughout the school day.

College students and TRICARE

If your child is heading to college this fall, they can keep TRICARE coverage until their 23rd birthday or until they graduate, whichever comes first, as long as they:

Are a full-time student at an approved institution of higher education

Have a TRICARE sponsor who provides more than 50% of their financial support

You must update your child’s student status in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System to maintain their coverage. Health care plan options for college students depend on where they live.

After college, they may qualify to purchase TRICARE Young Adult coverage.

Act now

Don’t wait until the last minute to prepare for the school year. Here are some steps to get started:

Check your child’s immunization records

Schedule needed physicals and eye exams

Review your school’s health requirements

Update information in DEERS if needed

Does your child have a prescription (for example, an inhaler) they need to bring to school? Work with a military pharmacy to get the correct prescription labels. Note: The military pharmacy will ask for your child's DOD ID.

Additional resources

TRICARE offers many programs and resources to help military families. Visit TRICARE or contact your regional contractor for more information about:

Amwell has extended a contract with the Defense Health Agency to support virtual care at the military health system, one of the company’s most significant growth initiatives, for another year, the telehealth vendor said Tuesday.

However, the deal cut out deployments for Amwell’s behavioral health and automated care programs “due to budget restrictions being broadly enforced by the Department of Defense,” CEO Ido Schoenberg said during a second quarter earnings call on Tuesday.

The contract change led the telehealth firm to revise its guidance for 2025. Amwell now expects revenue from $245 million to $250 million this year, down from its previous outlook of $250 million to $260 million.

Dive Insight:

The virtual care company, in partnership with technology firm Leidos, first won the contract worth up to $180 million with the DHA in 2023.

Amwell’s platform for scheduled virtual visits has now been deployed across the DOD, including to the Military Entrance Processing Command and the Coast Guard. Since going live on Amwell’s platform, virtual visits have nearly tripled compared with the military’s legacy system, Schoenberg said.

However, the original deal with DHA was set to expire in July, leading analysts to pepper Amwell executives about the contract’s renewal in recent earnings calls. In May, leaders said rollouts for its automated and behavioral health programs would be delayed due to leadership changes at the DHA.

Now, those products have been excluded from the latest contract after the Trump administration enacted spending cuts across the federal government — including at DOD.

Still, the programs could be added back to a future contract, given they were well received and had a positive impact on costs, Schoenberg said.

“We have every reason to believe that the lack of inclusion of those programs at this stage is related to broad budget reasons much more than anything else,” he said.

The telehealth vendor also narrowed its guidance range for adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the wake of the contract renewal and cost cuts made earlier this summer, including streamlining its workforce, CFO Mark Hirschhorn said.

Amwell expects adjusted EBITDA for 2025 between a loss of $50 million to $45 million, compared with earlier guidance of a loss of $55 million to $45 million.

Overall, Amwell reported a net loss of $19.5 million during the second quarter, compared with a loss of $50.6 million during the same period last year. Revenue was $70.9 million, rising about 13% year over year from $62.8 million in 2024.

The telehealth vendor also reiterated its plans to achieve positive cash from operations next year by cutting costs and utilizing artificial intelligence.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/mXGjYhCQYEE8HZ91czunxEQp0ZfHOcuk_tMp83nqkkw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9BbXdlbGxfRGV2aWNlcy1Db25zdW1lci1pUGhvbmUtRGVzay1WaXNpdC1Xb21hbi5qcGc=.webp,N,0.0,2025-08-07 15:56:08.309674

Executives said the company is focused on the potential of AI to transform care, and the industry’s move towards financial savings. The company is making progress towards its goal of having a positive operational cash flow by 2026.

Amwell reported a quarterly revenue of $70.9 million from a total of 1.2 million visits. The majority of its revenue came from its subscription business while Amwell Medical Group visit revenue was $22.8 million.

Chief Financial Officer Mark Hirschhorn reported on the call that Amwell’s software revenue has grown 47% since last year, and it represents nearly 60% of Amwell’s total revenue. Executives boasted the more favorable revenue mix and explained that the company is moving away from expensive, one-time customizations for customers and towards a more centralized and standard platform experience.

The company reported a gross margin of 56.1% and an adjusted EBITDA of 4.7 million, compared to 12.2 million in the first quarter of 2025. The company had a net loss of $19.5 million, compared to $18.4 million in the first quarter.

Executives discussed the company’s across-the-board cost-cutting measures to achieve its break-even goal in 2026. The company cut its research and development expenses by 12.2% in the second quarter compared to Q2 2024. It has also slashed its sales and marketing spend by 32.4% and laid off staff to improve its margins.

Amwell decreased its full year guidance range from $250-$260 million to $245-$250 million; it expects to end the year with $190 million in cash. Its third-quarter revenue expectations are $53-$56 million with an adjusted EBITDA of negative $15 million to negative $13 million.

On the second quarter earnings call, CEO Ido Schoenberg touted the renewal of a contract with the Defense Health Agency (DHA), which oversees services for the Military Health System. With Amwell, the DHA has been able to disconnect its legacy video visit system, and telehealth visits have tripled in number.

Amwell expanded its services to the Coast Guard and said its video visits are being used in combat zones connected to military hospitals in the U.S.

DHA renewed its Amwell contract for one year but discontinued its payment for behavioral health and automated care services. Schoenberg said the discontinuation of services and the limited contract expansion was due to the Department of Defense’s general cost-cutting measures as directed by President Donald Trump—not the department’s satisfaction with the services.

Schoenberg said the new administration is negotiating contracts differently, and Amwell was not in the room when the decisions were being made. Schoenberg said he expects Amwell to continue to do business with the Department of Defense and that there would likely be opportunities in the future to expand the number of services they offer.

Executives also promoted a new contract with Florida Blue, the state’s Blue Cross Blue Shield plan, for its white label telehealth services.

The healthcare sector is bracing for reduced income over the next several years because the number of uninsured people is likely to rise with federal cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. Amwell is positioning itself as a cost saver for health systems.

“If at times in the past, member experience and clinical outcomes were discussion starters, in the market today, it is cost savings. If we are able to create a much more efficient experience that results in better not only clinical but financial outcomes, that wins the day.“

Vendors are struggling with high customer acquisition costs, Schoenberg said. Amwell is working to continue to bring third-party vendors into its fold to offer customers more vendor options through its integrated platform. This is good for vendors to get access to more customers and makes it easy for Amwell clients to try new solutions without locking themselves into the vendor.

“The market today is very focused on cost, there’s no question about it, the need for a platform that is very efficient in the way that it engages with consumers and retain them and matches them with the most optimal clinical programs with the ability to track the savings and make amendments and optimizations is suddenly something that people pay attention to,” Schoenberg said.

He continued: “Our clients are also very aware of the enormous potential of using AI to achieve those goals, and our ability to embed it liberally pretty much in everything we do in an iterative process is something that we believe is a factor that really is helpful in the conversations in the market today.”",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/fiercehealthcare/1635878145/Abilify.jpg/Abilify.jpg?VersionId=lzWYEwQnIH4bR1Z0xHxbx6oxAOYc0OiS,N,0.0,2025-08-07 13:56:09.090413

Transferring your TRICARE plan is not automatic; you must take action. Here is a step-by-step guide.

Step 1: Update DEERS (This is Non-Negotiable!) Before you can do anything with TRICARE, you must update your new address in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS). Your TRICARE eligibility is based on your DEERS information.

How: The service member can update DEERS in person at the local ID card office (RAPIDS site) on the new installation. You can find your nearest office here.

Why it's first: If you try to change your TRICARE plan before your new address is reflected in DEERS, the system will not recognize you as being in the new location, and your transfer will be rejected.

Step 2: Understand Your New TRICARE Region The continental U.S. is divided into two TRICARE regions: East and West. Your regional contractor will change if you move from one to the other (e.g., from Virginia to California).

TRICARE East Region: Managed by Humana Military.

TRICARE West Region: Managed by Health Net Federal Services. Knowing your new region is key to knowing who to call for help.

Step 3: Change Your Primary Care Manager (PCM) If you are enrolled in TRICARE Prime, you must enroll in the new region and select a new PCM for each family member. You have a few ways to do this:

Online (Easiest Method): Go to the main TRICARE website and log in to the ""Beneficiary Web Enrollment (BWE)"" portal. This will walk you through the process of disenrolling from your old region and enrolling in the new one.

By Phone: You can call your new regional TRICARE contractor directly. They can handle the transfer over the phone.

By Mail/Fax: You can download a TRICARE Prime Enrollment form, fill it out, and mail or fax it to your new regional contractor.

Step 4: Confirm the Transfer Do not assume the transfer went through correctly.

Wait a few days for the system to process the change.

Log back into the TRICARE website or call your new regional contractor to confirm that your enrollment has been successfully transferred and that your new PCM is assigned correctly for each family member.",https://family-media.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/article-poster-images/tricare.png?w=1200&h=630&q=82&auto=format&fit=crop&dm=1754581768&s=d51e5321e2f9720bf3073e88b15f3557,N,0.0,2025-08-07 15:56:26.274023

Structure and Evolution: How the Defense Health Agency is Organized The Defense Health Agency (DHA) might feel like a seasoned veteran, but it’s actually a relatively young organization!","What is the Defense Health Agency?

The Defense Health Agency (DHA) is a vital part of the U.S. Department of Defense. It acts as a joint, integrated combat support agency. The DHA’s core mission is to ensure that our uniformed service members are medically ready to deploy anywhere in the world. It also makes sure they receive high-quality healthcare when and where they need it.

Here’s a quick overview of what the Defense Health Agency does:

Primary Mission: Provides a medically ready force and a ready medical force for combat operations and everyday care.

Support: Enables the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Air Force medical services.

Reach: Delivers healthcare to 9.5 million patients worldwide through TRICARE.

Operations: Manages over 700 hospitals and clinics globally.

Key Areas: Leads medical research, public health initiatives, and medical education programs.

Workforce: Comprises nearly 130,000 civilians and military personnel.

The DHA is more than just a healthcare provider. It’s a global system built to improve health and build readiness, anytime, anywhere.

As the CEO and Co-founder of Lifebit, I specialize in enabling secure, data-driven insights for complex healthcare systems, much like the extensive data landscape managed by the Defense Health Agency. My expertise in computational biology and AI helps illuminate how advanced technology can transform military medicine and global health.

The Core Mission: Supporting a Medically Ready Force

Ever wondered what truly drives the Defense Health Agency? It all boils down to two incredibly important ideas: making sure our forces are medically ready and that our medical teams are ready to serve. It’s more than just words; it’s the very foundation of keeping our nation safe, ensuring every service member is prepared for anything, anywhere. The DHA acts as a united, integrated support agency for combat, working hand-in-hand with the medical teams of the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Air Force. This means they ensure seamless, high-quality care across all branches.

Our mission is crystal clear: to make health better and build readiness. We aim to make extraordinary healthcare experiences feel ordinary and exceptional outcomes a regular occurrence. This strong vision guides every single thing the Defense Health Agency does, from a simple clinic visit to managing a large-scale disaster response. As U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Telita Crosland, the DHA’s Director, recently put it, the Military Health System is always growing and adapting. She highlighted how they’re “changing how we organize to counter threats that surround us, how we deliver care on the battlefield or at home, and how we leverage the tools and technologies of this digital age to better service our patients.” It’s this forward-thinking spirit that keeps our fighting force strong and healthy.

The Defense Health Agency is a crucial piece of the larger Military Health System. Want to dive deeper into its foundational role? You can learn more by visiting The Military Health System.

The Defense Health Agency truly stands out because of its unique dual mandate, which is different from most other healthcare groups.

First up is the “medically ready force.” This means keeping our amazing uniformed service members healthy and fit for whatever comes their way. Picture it as a huge, worldwide wellness program! It covers everything: routine check-ups, important immunizations, mental health support, and even physical therapy. The big goal? To make sure every single soldier, sailor, airman, and marine is physically and mentally ready to go, perform their duties, and serve effectively, no matter where they are or when duty calls.

Then there’s the “ready medical force.” This refers to the medical professionals themselves, plus all their equipment and facilities. It means having highly skilled doctors, nurses, medics, and support staff who are prepared to give care in any setting. This could be a top-notch military hospital, a field clinic in a far-off place, or even aboard a naval ship. This also includes making sure deployable medical teams are fully equipped and trained for both day-to-day operations and the tough demands of wartime support, including crucial combat casualty care. By bringing together clinical care and business operations across the Military Health System (MHS), the DHA ensures healthcare is delivered in an integrated and cost-effective way, making sure our medical teams are just as prepared as the forces they support.

How the DHA Supports Each Military Branch

Before the Defense Health Agency came into being, each military branch largely ran its own healthcare system. While they certainly did good work, this often led to things being done twice or differently across the services. The DHA was created to smooth out these operations, bringing a united approach to military healthcare for everyone.

How does the Defense Health Agency make sure everyone gets top-notch care? By bringing things together and making policies the same across the board. This means whether you’re in the Army, Navy, or Air Force, you get the same great, consistent healthcare. We’re talking about everything from unified electronic health records (more on those later!) to shared medical procedures and even how supplies get delivered. This common approach doesn’t just make care better; it also makes everything run more smoothly and uses resources wisely. It’s all about resource optimization and improved efficiency.

This way of working also encourages tri-service leadership. This is where high-ranking general and flag officers hold key positions within the DHA, often with roles that connect the agency with the individual military branches. This setup strengthens the ties between headquarters and the teams on the ground, helping them respond faster to requests for support. It truly creates a more agile and cohesive healthcare system for our entire joint force. In short, it’s all about working smarter, together, to deliver the absolute best care to those who serve us all.

A Global Health System in Action: Key Operations

The Defense Health Agency‘s reach extends far beyond just scheduling doctor’s appointments. It manages a truly immense, global health system. Think of it as a worldwide network of care, all working together to support our military personnel and their families, no matter where they are. This incredible system covers everything from everyday healthcare to groundbreaking medical research, vital public health programs, and even training the next generation of military medical experts. As the DHA itself puts it, it’s truly “More Than Healthcare Delivery.”

Our team at Lifebit understands the challenges of managing such a vast and complex health system. We specialize in analyzing huge amounts of health data securely. Our platform, with its ability to ensure health data interoperability and use advanced AI/ML tools, is built for exactly this kind of large-scale, diverse data. It helps organizations like the Defense Health Agency get real-time insights and make smart decisions, even with teams spread all over the world.

The Role of the Defense Health Agency in Healthcare Delivery

At its core, the Defense Health Agency is all about delivering top-notch healthcare. The main way it does this is through TRICARE, the healthcare program designed for uniformed service members, retirees, and their families. Through TRICARE, the DHA provides health care to an amazing 9.5 million patients across the globe! This is a huge job, requiring careful coordination across more than 700 hospitals and clinics worldwide.

A true game-changer in this system is MHS GENESIS. This is the Military Health System’s new electronic health record. Imagine having one complete medical and dental record for every service member and their family, all in one place. That’s MHS GENESIS! It means that whether someone is stationed stateside or overseas, their medical history is always available. This helps ensure smooth, continuous care and makes patient care even safer. With MHS GENESIS, you can access records, book appointments, refill prescriptions, and even chat with your healthcare team 24/7. The U.S. rollout finished in 2023, and overseas deployment began that same year – a truly massive step forward in managing global health data.

We know how important it is for health data to flow easily between different systems. The Defense Health Agency‘s push for MHS GENESIS shows their strong commitment to better data sharing across their huge network. If you need to find care, you can easily explore options at Find a Military Hospital or Clinic.

Advancing Military Medicine Through Research and Education

The Defense Health Agency doesn’t just treat illnesses; it actively works to prevent them, understand them better, and find new, innovative solutions. This dedication shines through its significant investment in both medical research and education. The DHA leads cutting-edge medical research, often partnering with top institutions like the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and the Uniformed Services University.

Their research efforts cover a wide range of vital areas. They tackle infectious diseases, doing crucial work on vaccines, like a malaria vaccine, to protect service members in high-risk areas. They focus on combat casualty care, aiming to improve outcomes for those injured in battle, from advanced trauma care to rehabilitation. Brain health is another major priority, especially concerning Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and the mysterious Anomalous Health Incidents (AHI), sometimes called “Havana syndrome.” The DHA even created a special tool, DHA Form 244, to help assess AHI symptoms. Plus, they explore environmental medicine, looking at how different environmental exposures affect military operations and personnel.

Beyond research, the DHA plays a big role in medical education. They train and equip medical professionals at all levels through various academic programs within the Department of Defense. This includes supporting advanced opportunities like Graduate Medical Education, the VA/DOD Women’s Mental Health Mini-Residency, and the Immunization Essentials Course. This ensures a steady stream of highly skilled healthcare providers for our military. The growing field of AI for Precision Medicine also holds immense promise for military healthcare, helping to create more personalized and effective treatments for individuals.

Protecting the Force with Public Health Initiatives

A healthy military force is a ready military force. That’s why the Defense Health Agency takes public health so seriously. They run comprehensive health surveillance programs to keep an eye on disease trends and protect our personnel from all sorts of threats, both infectious and environmental. For example, they closely watch for public health updates, like recent measles outbreaks in the U.S., and advise service members and their families on symptoms and how to stay safe.

Their public health efforts also work to understand and fight new threats, like tick-borne diseases such as Babesiosis and Lyme disease. These are becoming more common co-infection threats. They also make sure our warfighters have safe food, whether they’re in the field or at dining facilities. This is a critical job often led by the Army Veterinary Corps.

The DHA also manages crucial programs like the Armed Services Blood Program, which ensures a constant supply of blood products for our forces around the world. And the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center (now a Division) acts as the main health resource for the entire U.S. military. These initiatives rely heavily on strong data linking capabilities. This helps connect different pieces of information to spot patterns and guide public health actions. This proactive approach helps stop outbreaks and keeps our military community healthy, ensuring they’re always ready to serve, anytime, anywhere.

Structure and Evolution: How the Defense Health Agency is Organized

The Defense Health Agency (DHA) might feel like a seasoned veteran, but it’s actually a relatively young organization! It officially came into being on October 1, 2013. Its creation was a really big step in how the Department of Defense organizes its healthcare services. It all stemmed from important recommendations made in a 2011 report, showing a clear need for a more unified approach.

Before the DHA, military healthcare was largely managed by something called the TRICARE Management Activity. But the new agency was designed to be much more: a joint, integrated combat support agency. Think of it as bringing all the military health efforts under one roof to make things run smoother and more efficiently across the entire Military Health System. Our main office, where a lot of the magic happens, is located in Falls Church, Virginia.

The Defense Health Agency is led by some truly dedicated individuals. Currently, LTG Telita Crosland serves as our Director, with Dr. Michael P. Malanoski as the Deputy Director. Together, they guide a massive global workforce of almost 140,000 civilians and military personnel. Imagine managing a team that big! For an agency of this scale, capabilities like federated data governance are absolutely essential. They help ensure that data is accessed securely and compliantly across its vast, distributed network, making sure we stay on top of all our information needs.

From Service-Led Markets to Integrated Networks

A really significant change in how the Defense Health Agency operates recently happened: we moved from an older “market-based” healthcare model to a system of integrated Defense Health Networks. This big shift officially launched in October 2023. Instead of 20 separate markets, the DHA established nine new, streamlined Defense Health Networks.

This strategic move is all about making operations even smoother, connecting our headquarters better with teams in the field, and speeding up how quickly we can respond to support requests. Each Defense Health Network brings together military medical and dental facilities in a specific geographic region. They work as a coordinated system to improve how health services are delivered and ensure continuous care. This new structure also standardizes leadership, with general and flag officers often holding dual roles within the DHA and the military departments. As DHA Deputy Director Dr. Michael Malanoski wisely put it, this approach “standardizes leadership to improve health care delivery around the globe.” It empowers local decision-making, making the entire system more flexible and responsive to the needs of service members and their families, no matter where they are in the world. It’s a clear sign of our commitment to always getting better and providing excellent care!

Key Collaborations with Government Partners

The Defense Health Agency doesn’t work alone. Its vital mission is deeply connected with other government agencies and military branches, creating a strong network of cooperation. A perfect example is our close partnership with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). While the DHA takes care of active-duty personnel and their families, and the VA focuses on veterans, their missions often overlap. This collaboration leads to fantastic joint initiatives, like the VA/DOD Women’s Mental Health Mini-Residency, which helps mental health providers offer specialized care to both service members and veterans. If you’re curious to learn more about veterans’ benefits and healthcare, you can visit the VA’s website directly.

Our inter-agency cooperation also extends to other important government entities. This means we might work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on public health surveillance, or team up with other defense agencies on developing new technologies. Beyond government, the DHA also forms crucial public-private partnerships. These allow us to tap into outside expertise and innovation, especially in areas like medical research and technology. These collaborations are super important for improving the quality of care, expanding our research capabilities, and ensuring that our service members have access to the very best healthcare resources. They also highlight just how important secure data environments (SDE) are for safely and compliantly sharing information across all these different partners.

Frequently Asked Questions about the DHA

We often get asked about the specifics of the Defense Health Agency and its role in the broader healthcare landscape. It’s a big, vital organization, and we’re always happy to shine a light on what we do. Let’s tackle some of the most common questions to provide even more clarity on our mission and how we support those who serve.

What is the difference between the Defense Health Agency and the VA?

This is a fantastic and frequently asked question! It’s easy to get these two vital agencies confused, as both are dedicated to the well-being of our military community. While both the Defense Health Agency and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are critical components of the U.S. government’s commitment to military healthcare, they serve distinct populations with different primary missions.

Think of it this way: the Defense Health Agency (DHA) is like the ongoing healthcare provider for our active military community. Our primary focus is on ensuring a medically ready force and a ready medical force. This means we provide healthcare to active-duty service members, their families, and military retirees through the TRICARE health plan. We support the current fighting force and their dependents globally, delivering care in military hospitals and clinics, as well as through civilian providers.

On the other hand, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) primarily serves veterans—individuals who have bravely completed their military service. The VA provides a wide range of benefits, including healthcare services, disability compensation, education, and housing assistance, to those who have honorably served our nation. So, while the DHA cares for those currently serving and their families, the VA steps in to continue caring for them once they’ve transitioned out of uniform.

Despite their separate missions, there are significant collaboration points between the two agencies. We work closely on initiatives like mental health support, traumatic brain injury research, and even share electronic health records (MHS GENESIS) to ensure a truly seamless transition of care for service members as they become veterans. It’s all about teamwork to support our heroes, from enlistment to retirement and beyond.

What are the career opportunities with the Defense Health Agency?

Working for the Defense Health Agency means being part of a global team dedicated to a vital mission. It’s incredibly rewarding to contribute to the health and readiness of our uniformed service members and their families. We offer a truly wide array of career opportunities for both civilian and military personnel, making us a fantastic place for healthcare professionals and many other specialists.

For our incredible healthcare professionals, the DHA offers the chance to practice top-tier medicine alongside other dedicated civilian and military colleagues. We’re always looking for talented doctors, nurses, dentists, pharmacists, therapists, and many other medical specialists. Often, these roles come with a satisfying work-life balance and excellent employment benefits, allowing you to focus on what you do best: caring for others.

But our needs extend far beyond clinical roles! Running a global healthcare system requires a diverse team. We also have critical positions for administrative staff who keep everything running smoothly, IT professionals managing MHS GENESIS and cutting-edge cybersecurity, and brilliant researchers contributing to groundbreaking medical advancements. We also need public health specialists working on disease prevention and health surveillance, as well as experts in human resources, finance, and legal to ensure the smooth functioning of the agency.

With locations worldwide, the Defense Health Agency provides unique opportunities to serve those who serve, whether you’re working in the U.S. or at one of our many overseas military installations. We are always looking for dedicated individuals to join our team and contribute to improving health and building readiness, making a real difference in the lives of millions.

What is MHS GENESIS and why is it important?

MHS GENESIS is the Department of Defense’s new electronic health record (EHR) system, and it’s nothing short of a monumental leap forward for military healthcare. Imagine having all your medical information in one place, accessible by your care team no matter where you are in the world. That’s exactly what MHS GENESIS is: a single, unified EHR for all service members, veterans, and their families. So, whether you’re an active-duty soldier stationed in Germany, a Navy spouse in Japan, or a retiree in Florida, your medical and dental records are housed in one comprehensive, secure system.

Why is this so incredibly important? It transforms how healthcare is delivered and received:

Patient safety soars. With all medical information readily available, healthcare providers have a complete picture of a patient’s health history. This significantly reduces the risk of errors and dramatically improves the quality of care.

Continuity of care is seamless. As service members move between duty stations, deploy overseas, or transition from active duty to veteran status, their health records move with them. This ensures uninterrupted care, no matter where life takes them.

Data access is a breeze. Patients and providers alike have 24/7 access to medical and dental records. You can easily book appointments, refill prescriptions, and securely message your healthcare teams, putting you in control of your health journey.

Efficiency gets a major boost. By streamlining administrative processes, MHS GENESIS allows our dedicated healthcare professionals to focus more on what they do best: providing excellent patient care, rather than getting bogged down in paperwork.

The full stateside rollout of MHS GENESIS was completed in 2023, and overseas deployment began the same year. It represents a significant investment in modernizing military healthcare, making it more efficient, safer, and truly more patient-centered for everyone involved. You can access your information and connect with your care team through the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal.

Conclusion

As we wrap up our journey through the incredible work of the Defense Health Agency, it’s clear they stand as a powerful symbol of our nation’s deep commitment to those who serve. From ensuring our troops are healthy enough to face any challenge, to delivering top-notch care wherever they are, the DHA is truly a cornerstone of military readiness and well-being.

We’ve seen how the DHA seamlessly supports every military branch, creating a unified healthcare experience. We’ve explored the massive reach of TRICARE and the game-changing power of MHS GENESIS, which brings all medical records together in one place.

,,2025-08-07 15:24:04+00:00,www.army.mil,Inaugural Bug Camp brings real-world science to young students at Aberdeen Proving Ground,Not Available,,,,,https://www.army.mil/article/287641/inaugural_bug_camp_brings_real_world_science_to_young_students_at_aberdeen_proving_ground,"For educators like McDowell, who discovered the program through the National Science Teacher Association, Bug Camp represented an invaluable opportunity for students to see science careers up close.
Students embrace hands-on science For 12-year-old Mariia Shestiuk, going into seventh grade, the camp opened her eyes to a potential career path.
Jennifer Carder, Integrated Pest Management branch chief and Bug Camp director, explained the program's format.
""This is such a great opportunity for kids to interact with insects and develop their ecological literacy,"" said Snyder, who plans to incorporate the Bug Camp lesson into his own classroom.
Bug Camp impact The camp's impact extends beyond individual learning, said Carder.","The Defense Centers for Public Health-Aberdeen launched its first-ever Bug Camp, July 14-18, introducing 10 middle school students to the world of military entomology through hands-on scientific research and direct interaction with professional scientists.

The weeklong program, held in DCPH-A's lab building at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, gave students from as far away as Virginia, New York and Texas the opportunity to work alongside entomologists using professional-grade equipment and real-world research techniques. The program drew significant interest, with organizers selecting participants from 25 applications submitted nationwide.

""This is the most 'science-y' science camp I've ever seen for junior high kids in terms of the in-depth science and exposure to science with real scientists,"" said Sarah McDowell, an assistant professor of secondary education at Maryville College, Tennessee, who served as a resource teacher for the camp. ""This has been an amazing experience.""

The campers spent five days learning about public health entomology through activities including mosquito surveillance, tick collection, microscopy work, and even polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, laboratory techniques typically used by professional researchers--exposure that would be impossible in most traditional classroom settings. According to the National Institutes of Health, PCR is a fast and inexpensive technique used to ""amplify""—copy—small segments of DNA. Because significant amounts of a sample of DNA are necessary for molecular and genetic analyses, studies of isolated pieces of DNA are nearly impossible without PCR amplification.

Program support and lasting impact

The program was supported through the Army Educational Outreach Program's Gains in the Education of Mathematics and Science, which provided insurance coverage, funding for supplies including lab coats and notebooks, and $125 stipends for each camper to offset transportation and meal costs. DCPH-A used AOEP GEMS grant money to purchase some of the specialized materials including the permethrin-treated protective coveralls used during field collection work. Clothing treated with the insecticide permethrin protects the wearer from mosquitoes, ticks, and other pesky biting arthropods.

For educators like McDowell, who discovered the program through the National Science Teacher Association, Bug Camp represented an invaluable opportunity for students to see science careers up close.

""Students don't typically have this type of access,"" she said. ""Here, students see it as a normal occupation because they are working with seven or eight entomologists. They see the diversity and passion of people who have conveyed their science so well to the students.""

Students embrace hands-on science

For 12-year-old Mariia Shestiuk, going into seventh grade, the camp opened her eyes to a potential career path.

""I learned a lot of stuff about mosquitoes. I learned about the different types, and that was really interesting,"" she said. ""I'm actually quite interested in entomology; I might even become an entomologist when I grow up.""

Owen Skufis, 12, from Bel Air, Maryland, was struck by the variety of field experiences.

""It was a really interesting experience. We learned about mosquitoes and ticks and caught a bunch of ticks in the field. Then we got to search around the lab building to try and find different bugs,"" he said.

Local student Owen Halgas, 12, from Aberdeen, Maryland, appreciated both the outdoor activities and sophisticated laboratory work.

""I really liked catching the bugs and pinning them to posts. I thought that was really cool,"" he said. ""The camp was fun. We get to go outside in nature and get off screen and enjoy the world as it is. We got to do lab stuff, like checking ticks for diseases.""

Professional-level learning experience

The camp's carefully structured curriculum was designed to give students authentic scientific experiences while maintaining high engagement through hands-on activities. Jennifer Carder, Integrated Pest Management branch chief and Bug Camp director, explained the program's format.

""We set it up so the campers would get a little bit of classroom time, followed by some activity, back to the classroom, and then another activity.""

Day one began with Entomology 101, introducing students to the field before moving into specialized mosquito education. Campers toured DCPH-A's insectary and pesticide laboratory, then ventured into the field to set up various mosquito traps and collect specimens using sweep nets.

""I've caught different bugs using a sweep net. I caught aquatic bugs using dippers, including a water bug. That was fun,” said Shestiuk.

On the second day, students checked their mosquito traps and worked with microscopes and dissecting scopes to identify their specimens using dichotomous keys—tools that guide identification through paired choices based on observable characteristics. After identifying insects to their proper order, students pinned their specimens for future study.

The microscopy work particularly impressed the young scientists.

""We were able to look at insects in detail using microscopes. I liked looking at the tiny little details on an insect. I would have never known beetles had hair on them,"" said Halgas.

This was a unique opportunity for the campers.

""Junior high students do not typically have a lot of contact with microscopes in the classrooms, and to be able to look at the insects they just collected under the microscopes has been very engaging and enjoyable,"" said McDowell. ""They've identified what they found with entomologists who are very engaged and passionate about entomology.""

Advanced laboratory techniques

Wednesday focused on tick surveillance, with Robyn Nadolny, chief of the DCPH-A vector-borne disease branch, leading education about ticks, organisms ""vying for the 'most dangerous' animal, along with mosquitoes,"" said Carder. Students donned Permethrin-treated coveralls to flag for ticks in wooded areas before working in the sophisticated tick laboratory.

""They got to run a gel with some already prepared products and see how their PCR products separated in that gel,” said Carder. “Not using little plastic pipettes, but the actual ones our researchers would use in the lab.”

Halgas was impressed by the laboratory's capabilities.

""It was really cool because the lab has futuristic tech for us to use,"" he said.

Kevin Harkins, an entomologist with the Entomological Sciences Division at DCPH-A, emphasized the unique value of having students conduct their own collecting rather than working with pre-collected specimens.

""Having them collect insects is a change from how we generally interact with these students,"" said Harkins. ""Usually, we're bringing insects that we've already collected. Having them do the collection themselves and using equipment that we provide, including professional traps for collecting mosquitoes, or flags for collecting ticks, they're making a connection now that maybe they wouldn't normally make.""

The hands-on approach proved highly effective with the target age group.

""Kids like hands-on activities, right? Anytime we're doing hands-on anything, they're 100% engaged,"" said McDowell. ""That's the kind of science and the kind of exposure we want students to have.""

Military-civilian collaboration

The program brought together expertise from multiple military installations, demonstrating the interconnected nature of military science careers. U.S. Army Reserve Maj. Ted Snyder, an entomology officer at Public Health Command East who also works as a high school science teacher, co-taught a session on urban cockroach adaptation.

""This is such a great opportunity for kids to interact with insects and develop their ecological literacy,"" said Snyder, who plans to incorporate the Bug Camp lesson into his own classroom. ""They get to work with actual scientists doing inquiry-level work.""

Students appreciated the building inspection activities that Snyder helped lead.

""I really enjoyed doing all of the field work outside and doing the building pest inspections we did today. That was really fun,"" said Shestiuk.

James Butler, chief of the entomological sciences division at Public Health Command East, praised the program's comprehensive scope.

""It provides the students a complete overview of what entomology is; the different avenues within it and then be able to have that applied science they've seen over the past few days. It gives these students an opportunity to see what real-world science is like.""

Expert panel and competition

The camp concluded Friday with an expert panel featuring four entomologists who answered student questions, followed by the first Bug Camp ""Ento Games"" challenge—a college bowl-style quiz competition complete with buzzers—moderated by Dr. Ashley Kennedy, a state entomologist representative and former ORISE intern at DCPH-A.

The expert panel included Dr. Kennedy, James Butler from Fort George G. Meade, U.S. Army Col. Hee Kim (currently director for Occupational Health Sciences but trained as an entomologist), and Dr. Charles Bartlett, an entomology professor at the University of Delaware.

Bug Camp impact

The camp's impact extends beyond individual learning, said Carder.

""We plant seeds, and then they can actually start ripples,"" she said. ""If we teach these kids about how important it is for them to protect themselves, the hope is that they take that home and that ripple continues, and they can share that with their friends at school or in their neighborhood, and with their parents.""

Butler noted that the program targets an ideal age group for scientific engagement.

""At this age, it's getting them excited for it—to want to learn it—so we show them and have them go through motions of how to collect stuff, how to inspect. This engages their mind and gets them to want to learn more.""

DCPH-A hopes to continue the program in future years and build on this inaugural event.

""It's great to have a chance to interact with students and show them all the great things that we do, the types of equipment that entomologists use—and maybe one day they'll grow up and want to be an entomologist,"" said Carder.

The Defense Health Agency supports our Nation by improving health and building readiness—making extraordinary experiences ordinary and exceptional outcomes routine.

“Our servicemembers are constantly focused on increasing their readiness, enhancing their lethality, and preparing to fight whenever they are called,” she added. “Their confidence and mission focus for future conflicts are directly tied to the lifesaving treatments and capabilities OPMED is developing right now, and there is nothing more important to the WEMT team than meeting and exceeding the expeditionary medical needs of the joint force for future fights.”

These existing laws, Judge Miller noted, are sufficient to address the state’s stated concerns without imposing the sweeping restrictions of Act 624.
“Subjecting TRICARE to the Arkansas Act 624 license requirements would give the State’s pharmacy board a virtual power of review over .
He also declined to find preemption under ERISA or Medicare, noting that Act 624 regulates pharmacy licensing rather than plan administration.
If upheld, Act 624 could serve as a model for other states seeking to rein in PBM influence.","In a significant legal development, a federal judge has temporarily blocked Arkansas from enforcing Act 624. Act 624 prohibits pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from owning or operating pharmacies in the state, effectively forcing vertically integrated companies to divest or shut down their Arkansas pharmacy operations. However, on July 28, 2025, U.S. District Judge Brian Miller granted a preliminary injunction to several major PBMs and affiliated entities, halting the law’s implementation pending final resolution of the case.

Court Finds Violation of Commerce Clause and TRICARE Preemption

In his order, Judge Miller concluded that Act 624 likely violates the U.S. Constitution’s Commerce Clause by overtly discriminating against out-of-state companies and imposes an excessive burden on interstate commerce. The statute’s preamble explicitly states its purpose is to eliminate “business tactics that have driven locally-operated pharmacies out of business,” which the court interpreted as protectionist rhetoric targeting non-Arkansas entities.

“Although the state argues that it is merely targeting a form of business structure, this appears to only be a half-truth,” Judge Miller wrote. “The statute discloses that the state is also attempting to protect ‘locally operated pharmacies’ as opposed to just consumers and non-PBM affiliated pharmacies, including out-of-state non-PBM affiliated pharmacies like Walgreens.”

The judge emphasized that Arkansas already has several laws regulating PBMs, including statutes that prohibit discriminatory reimbursement practices and exclusion of willing pharmacies from health networks. These existing laws, Judge Miller noted, are sufficient to address the state’s stated concerns without imposing the sweeping restrictions of Act 624.

In addition to the Commerce Clause violation, the court found that Act 624 is likely preempted by TRICARE, the federal health benefits program for military personnel and retirees. The law would interfere with the U.S. Department of Defense’s ability to contract with PBM-owned pharmacies, undermining the uniformity and stability of the TRICARE network.

“Subjecting TRICARE to the Arkansas Act 624 license requirements would give the State’s pharmacy board a virtual power of review over . . . who the Department of Defense can contract with,” and “. . . impede[] the TRICARE program’s ability to accomplish the purposes for which Congress enacted it,” Judge Miller wrote..

Broader Constitutional Claims Rejected

While the court granted the injunction based on the Commerce Clause and TRICARE preemption, it rejected the plaintiffs’ other constitutional claims. Judge Miller found that Act 624 does not violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause, the Takings Clause, or the Equal Protection Clause. He also declined to find preemption under ERISA or Medicare, noting that Act 624 regulates pharmacy licensing rather than plan administration.

Furthermore, the court dismissed the argument that Act 624 constitutes a bill of attainder, concluding that the law does not specifically target the plaintiffs and does not impose punishment in a constitutional sense. “While Act 624 is tainted by its protectionist rhetoric so much as to render it unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause, it was not enacted in a wholly arbitrary manner,” Judge Miller wrote.

Irreparable Harm and Public Interest Support Injunction

As outlined in our June 2025 blog post, the plaintiff PBMs and other organizations argued that Act 624 would disrupt access to medications for tens of thousands of Arkansans, including TRICARE beneficiaries, seniors, and patients with complex conditions. The court found that the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm if the law were allowed to take effect, citing the threat of unrecoverable economic losses and the inability to seek damages due to the government’s sovereign immunity. The balance of equities and public interest also favored the plaintiffs, as “no harm is caused when defendants are enjoined from enforcing an unconstitutional law.”

Next Steps and Broader Implications

The legal battle over Act 624 is far from over. On July 31, 2025, the Arkansas State Board of Pharmacy filed a notice of appeal. The litigation, now consolidated under Express Scripts Inc. et al. v. Richmond et al., Case No. 4:25-cv-00520, will continue in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas.

The case is being closely watched nationwide, as Arkansas is the first state to enact such a sweeping restriction on PBMs’ ownership of pharmacies. If upheld, Act 624 could serve as a model for other states seeking to rein in PBM influence. Conversely, a final ruling against the law could reinforce federal protections for PBMs and affiliated pharmacies.

For now, the preliminary injunction preserves the status quo, allowing PBM-affiliated pharmacies to continue operating in Arkansas while the legal battle unfolds.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.68_5501.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-07 11:56:13.691315

Hertzler",,,,,https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/healthcare/1662564/federal-court-preliminarily-enjoins-arkansas-ban-on-pbm-ownership-of-pharmacies,"This order follows a series of lawsuits challenging Act 624, which was passed into law on April 16, 2025.
The Commerce Clause Challenge The court's reasoning rested on the dormant commerce clause doctrine, which states that because the Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce, states may not unjustifiably discriminate against interstate commerce.
The court opined that because Arkansas already has laws in place regulating PBM reimbursement and prohibiting certain PBM business tactics, the breadth of Act 624 is unjustifiable.
Since federal laws preempt state laws, the court said that TRICARE therefore preempts Act 624.
The court's reasoning for the commerce clause and supremacy clause challenges rests entirely on a preliminary assessment of existing law.","On July 28, 2025, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas issued an order preliminarily enjoining enforcement of Arkansas' Act 624, a recently enacted,first-of-its-kind law that would prohibit pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) from owning or operating pharmacies in Arkansas, effective January 1, 2026.

Act 624 was enacted based on growing concern that ""vertical integration [by PBMs has] transformed PBMs from useful administrative service providers into market-dominating behemoths that control the industry."" For instance, through years of horizontal consolidation, the three largest PBMs—CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and OptumRx—now ""process 80% of the nation's prescriptions and bring in 70% of specialty drug revenue."" At the same time, the top six PBMs have vertically integrated downstream by acquiring and operating their own affiliated pharmacies. Id.

Majority of Claims Likely to Fail

The order holds that although the plaintiffs are likely to fail on six of their eight claims, their likelihood of success on the remaining two claims—based on the preliminary evidence and law before the court—is high enough to warrant pausing enforcement of Act 624 pending the outcome of the suit. Thus, this case will now move to litigation, where the court will be able to assess the PBM act based on evidence gathered during discovery and further arguments brought by the parties.

This order follows a series of lawsuits challenging Act 624, which was passed into law on April 16, 2025. The lead plaintiffs in the key lawsuits are some of the largest actors in the pharmacy and PBM industries: Express Scripts Inc. (a PBM owned by health insurer Cigna Healthcare), Optum Inc. (a PBM owed by health insurer UnitedHealth Group), CVS Pharmacy Inc. and the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association. Their cases were eventually consolidated into Express Scripts, Inc. v. Richmond, so the court's order was a response to the combined legal efforts of these parties, including multiple complaints and motions for a preliminary injunction. Together, those pleadings raise eight challenges to the PBM act, arguing that it violates the U.S. Constitution's privileges and immunities clause, bill of attainder clause, takings clause, equal protection clause, commerce clause and supremacy clause—the last of which plaintiffs argue Act 624 violates as it is preempted by TRICARE, Medicare and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).

Two Claims Have a Chance of Success

The order assesses each of these legal challenges and concludes that all but two of the challenges (the commerce clause and supremacy clause challenges) are likely to fail at trial.

The Commerce Clause Challenge

The court's reasoning rested on the dormant commerce clause doctrine, which states that because the Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce, states may not unjustifiably discriminate against interstate commerce. The court opined that because Arkansas already has laws in place regulating PBM reimbursement and prohibiting certain PBM business tactics, the breadth of Act 624 is unjustifiable.

The Supremacy Clause Challenge

The court held that because the TRICARE program already has contracts with PBM-owned pharmacies in Arkansas, and because Act 624 would give Arkansas power over TRICARE's future in-state contracts, Act 624 would conflict with the TRICARE statute. Since federal laws preempt state laws, the court said that TRICARE therefore preempts Act 624.

Conclusion

Although this order likely postpones Act 624's effective date, a preliminary injunction is just that: preliminary. The court's reasoning for the commerce clause and supremacy clause challenges rests entirely on a preliminary assessment of existing law. But since those challenges are now moving to litigation, both parties must now present evidence for their claims, along with additional legal arguments, which will inform the final decision on Act 624 at trial. Further, the court's reasoning for one of the challenges is a constitutional doctrine (that of the dormant commerce clause) that has been expressly rejected by several recent U.S. Supreme Court justices. This could affect the success of any appeal of this case. Thus, although the order pauses Act 624's enforcement, the order is temporary, and the full merits of the case—and of Act 624's legality—have yet to be assessed.

MHSRS is a DoD-sponsored event that brings together leading experts from across the military and medical development industry to discuss the current and future states of military medicine, and to showcase the latest devices and technologies designed to preserve and protect the lives of America’s Warfighters.

During the event, OPMED experts showcased the medical solutions they are developing through partnerships and agreements with DoD and private sector organizations. The team’s current programs are designed to fill capability gaps across the spectrum of combat casualty care – from point of injury and evacuation to hospitalization – with an emphasis on Large-Scale Combat Operations in remote, austere environments.

“Future conflicts will present complex and evolving challenges unique to modern warfare,” said U.S. Army Col. Owen L. Roberts, program manager for OPMED. “We are driving rapid capability development to deliver critical solutions directly to frontline medics. Our mission is clear: field life-saving technologies that protect service members on the battlefield and return them to duty without delay.”

During the symposium, OPMED took center stage as a key element of the Defense Health Agency’s overall medical development and acquisition strategy. On the symposium’s first day, the OPMED Warfighter Protection and Acute Care project management team took home the award for Outstanding Program Management (Team) in recognition of their Freeze-Dried Plasma development program.

“I’m incredibly honored to be part of the team that has brought FDP to force-enabling reality. Blood products are a critical and urgent need across the Department of Defense and the service branches, and FDP is a game-changer to fill capability gaps at the front line,” said Andy Atkinson, the FDP product manager with WPAC. “Our focus has always been to enhance Warfighter readiness and to provide a solution for military medical providers that works across the spectrum of conflict.

“FDP, because it is so user-friendly, portable, cost-effective, and shelf stable, is form-fitted for use by both conventional and special forces literally anywhere in the world,” he added. “This award is a huge indicator that what we and our commercial partners are developing and acquiring is both urgently needed and in line with what our Joint Force partners need to save lives during future conflicts. I could not be any more proud of this team and our efforts.”

Additionally, OPMED team members, along with representatives from several military service branches, participated in the DHA-hosted “Spurring Innovation to Deliver Joint Force Medical Solutions” breakout session on day two of the conference. Panel discussions centered on the challenges facing military medicine, the DHA approach to acquisition of medical products, and the opportunities to use novel acquisition pathways to expedite product delivery to Warfighters. During the symposium’s exhibit hours, team members met with hundreds of current and potential partners to highlight the strength of OPMED’s core programs and show their persistent focus on meeting the needs of the U.S. Joint Force, according to Roberts.

“The accelerating pace of warfighting technology leaves no room for complacency,” he said. “Getting lifesaving capabilities to the front lines is critical to preserving Joint Force lethality and staying ahead of modern threats. As the DoD’s Joint medical capability developer, OPMED stands ready to deliver exactly what the Joint Force needs to fight and win – anywhere, against any adversary.”

Doing your best to pay down the principal of bad debt as much as possible will help smooth your transition to civilian life.
If possible, service members with good debt, such as a mortgage, should consider refinancing it at a better rate.","Arguably, the two most important days of a military member's career are the day they join and the day they hang up their uniform for good. While the former involves excitement, the latter is often accompanied by anxiety and uncertainty about what the future entails. At least that’s how I felt before I left the United States Navy.

While I knew my transition from the military to becoming a civilian again would be arduous, my preparation and commitment to my finances helped me soften the blow of losing my military salary and TRICARE benefits. In this article, I will cover the financial tactics I used to ensure my transition. Those steps can help other service members transition smoothly into the civilian world.

Assess Your Current Financial Situation

Every service member knows their separation date. For those who are staying until their contractual separation date, assessing your financial situation at least a year in advance should be a top priority.

A good approach is to take a financial inventory of the following:

Income

Savings

Debt

Future expenses

This will identify any weak spots that need to be addressed for you to take the necessary proactive steps.

Build a Transition Budget

It’s important to note that service members entering the civilian sector lose not only their military pay but also housing benefits, subsistence allowance, and access to TRICARE. They should prepare for those financial blows. I found transitioning from the military to civilian life very difficult, but preparation is key. Savings should typically equal about three to six months of your living expenses. However, you may need up to a year or more, depending on your current financial situation, goals, and future costs.

Additionally, your transition budget should account for periods spent looking for your next career, which may have to be done without any income, while meeting the bare minimum living expenses, such as food, clothes, and housing.

Consider doing the following:

Identify all current essential and non-essential expenses.

Consider cutting non-essential spending.

Place extra money in a money market account, high-yield savings, or online broker account.

To optimize your budgeting needs, check out the best budgeting apps.

Tackle Existing Debt

Debt can be a crippling burden, but not all debt is the same. There is such a thing as good debt (e.g., a mortgage loan) and bad debt (e.g., a credit card and a high-interest auto loan). Doing your best to pay down the principal of bad debt as much as possible will help smooth your transition to civilian life. If possible, service members with good debt, such as a mortgage, should consider refinancing it at a better rate.

In order to make it possible for me to pay down my debt, a drastic change in my money habits had to occur. I was able to pay off my vehicle loan and credit card debt by taking the aggressive approach of adding far more than the minimum payment to those balances. There are options you may want to consider, such as:

Debt consolidation: Consolidating your debt can often make it easier to manage.

Refinancing your auto loan: If your auto loan has a high interest rate, consider refinancing it for a better rate.

In addition to managing your debt, managing your credit score can help lower your borrowing costs. Using a credit monitoring service that fits your needs can help you manage your credit score.

Ensure You Have the Proper Financial Accounts

Having the proper financial accounts is essential. It’s mandatory for all military personnel to have a savings and checking account. But not just any bank will do. Make sure your bank is one you can easily access wherever you settle and work in the civilian world. While most institutions can conduct business online, banking with an institution not in your state can be problematic, especially if you need access to physical branches or frequent access to an ATM. Services such as lending may be limited as well.

Those leaving the service may wonder what they can do with their thrift savings plan (TSP). Keeping assets in the account until retirement is an option. But once separated, account holders won’t be able to contribute to it. If they continue in a federal occupation whose retirement system is supported by the TSP, they can kick into a new TSP account. However, rolling it over to a traditional or Roth IRA is also an option.

The Bottom Line

Service members separating from the military should not take the process lightly. I found it to be a big deal, and while I felt all my ducks were in a row, it was still very difficult. Before you separate, you should have a game plan for what will come by assessing your financial health and seeing where you stand. Then, ensure you create a budget to follow, reduce any bad debt as much as possible, and open relevant accounts to better service your financial needs and rollover assets from your TSP, if necessary. While the process won’t be easy, being prepared can mitigate frustration.",https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/SODZdN8USAl4sXEwQmv-dJZVXeQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-11762258901-f26efa748ca545d3bb39a070cd30a106.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-07 11:57:17.066621

Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, presented the awards to the winning individuals and teams. Their research spanned diverse topics, including warfighter readiness, traumatic brain injury, PTSD, and mental health.

Individual Distinguished Service Award Winners

Two researchers in the military medical community were recognized for significant contributions to the success of Military Health System medical studies supporting the deployed warfighter.

In the research category, “Innovation and Current Directions in Military Suicide Prevention, Research, and Programs,” Retired U.S. Air Force Col. (Dr.) Robert Ursano, director of the Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress and professor of psychiatry and neuroscience at the Uniformed Services University, was honored for advancing mental health care, resilience, and trauma research in support of the health and well-being of warfighters.

Ursano’s key research included combat stress, posttraumatic stress disorder, and traumatic brain injury, with a focus in suicide prevention. The findings from his work provided essential data informing suicide prevention efforts and the understanding of risk and resilience in service members. The PTSD Brain Bank provides a lasting resource for future research aimed at developing better treatments. Through his leadership of CSTS, he oversaw the development and dissemination of training and intervention programs aimed at improving the psychological health of service members and families exposed to trauma and disaster.

In the research category, “Optimizing the Human Weapon System: Utilizing Wearable Sensor Data to Inform Readiness,” Dr. Karl Friedl, senior research scientist of performance physiology, U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, was recognized as a leader in service member health and performance. Friedl's research focused on extending limits of human physiological performance, with contributions including endocrine regulation in semi-starvation, physiological effects of anabolic steroids, body composition methods and standards, physiological monitoring, and metrics of research.

Outstanding Research Accomplishment

Individual awards were given to three researchers for outstanding research contributions supporting the warfighter with significant accomplishments of high impact achieved since February 2024.

Justin Baker, who has a doctorate in psychology, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral health, Ohio State University College of Medicine, was recognized for his work in the category, “Innovation and Current Directions in Military Suicide Prevention, Research, and Programs.”

Baker's work focused on increasing the reach and accessibility of suicide prevention treatments through research that advances group therapy, telehealth, virtual learning platforms, and other innovative resources for service members struggling with suicidal thoughts and behaviors. His accomplishments stem from leading successful military-academic partnerships to help warfighters return to operational readiness and build resilience skills.

Mary Jo Pugh, a retired U.S. Air Force nurse who has a doctorate in psychology, and professor, Division of Epidemiology at the University of Utah School of Medicine, was recognized for her work in the category, “Evolving Methods for the Analysis of Large Complex Data Sources to Inform Military Health Policy, Readiness, Performance and Medical Practices.” She is also an investigator at the Informatics, Decision-Enhancement and Analytic Sciences Center of Innovation and the Department of Veterans Affairs Salt Lake City.

Pugh made groundbreaking contributions to research on TBI on multiple morbidity in veterans. She pioneered the integration of Department of Defense and VA data, revolutionizing the study of military exposures and complex comorbidities. Her leadership in the LIMBIC Phenotype study, encompassing over 2.5 million post-9/11 veterans, unveiled critical insights into TBI phenotypes and their associated outcomes. Pugh's innovative application of complexity theory and her dedication to advancing research methodologies significantly enhanced understanding of deployed warfighter and veteran health.

U.S. Army Capt. (Dr.) Maya Alexandri, J.D., U.S. Army Medical Corp, was recognized in the category, “Portable Medical & Dental Imaging in the Far Forward Environment.”

Alexandri led groundbreaking research measuring the electromagnetic signature of handheld ultrasound systems, otherwise known as EMS and HUS, as a crucial step for ensuring safe use in austere, high-risk combat environments. Her pilot study, conducted with the DOD’s Joint Electromagnetic Warfare Center, found that the EMS of HUS probes is negligible—undetectable at distances beyond 10 feet—suggesting they likely can be safely used without risking adversary detection. This first-of-its-kind research lays the foundation for U.S. Army doctrine integrating HUS into far-forward military medical care.

Warfighter Medical Research Public Communication

Doug Jones, who has a doctorate in movement and sport sciences, research physiologist, and director for the Warfighter Performance Department’s Thermal Physiology Lab, Naval Health Research Center, and team member, Dr. Timothy Dunn, who has a doctorate in cognitive psychology, cognitive scientist, Warfighter Performance Department, were recognized for contributions to broadening the general public's awareness of DOD-sponsored warfighter-related medical research through public communications in the category, “Polar Performance at Altitude and Arctic Activities.”

Jones and Dunn significantly advanced understanding of warfighters’ physiological and cognitive responses to operating in extreme environments. Their dedication and scientific rigor in medical research were recognized by National Public Radio’s Marketplace podcast during joint exercise Arctic Edge 2024. When NPR travelled to NHRC to record a special episode on the challenges warfighters face operating in the extreme cold, Jones and Dunn were able to relay to a general audience their scientific efforts to improve service members’ readiness, resilience, and lethality.

Team Awards in Outstanding Research Accomplishment

Three teams were awarded for their outstanding research contributions supporting the warfighter with significant accomplishment of high impact achieved since February 2024.

The Linking Investigations in Trauma and Emergency Services Network team from the University of Pittsburgh, led by Dr. Jason Sperry, section chief of trauma surgery, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Division of Surgery, was honored in the research category, “Blood and Blood Products: Novel Strategies for Treatment of Blood Failure.”

The LITES Network completed two high-impact trials—CriSP-HS and CriSP-TBI—demonstrating the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of early, cold-stored platelet transfusion in patients with hemorrhagic shock and TBI. These trials provided the first high-level evidence supporting early CSP use in injured patients. LITES demonstrated CSP transfusions were safe, could be provided earlier, and may improve outcomes. Incorporating CSPs into military transfusion protocols has the potential to augment the platelet supply, expand access to operationally complex environments, and improve outcomes in the critically injured warfighter.

The Naval Psychological Readiness and Human Performance team from the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory, led by Justin Handy, who has a doctorate in cognitive psychology, research psychologist, Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory, and Dominica Hernandez, Ph.D. team co-lead, research psychologist, principal investigator, was honored in the research category, “Undersea Operational Research Panel.”

The NPRHP team transitioned multiple evidence-based fleet deliverables that improved submariner and nuclear-operator screening, career prediction, and individual coaching to foster readiness, professional development, leadership, team performance, and retention. The team validated a model for predicting optimal career outcomes and targeting optimal points for career intervention. Their submarine leadership and sailor development programs transitioned to the fleet, becoming mandated for submariners assigned to operational boats. Their efforts also formed the basis for a U.S. Navy-wide leadership assessment and development program.

The interdisciplinary team comprised of Dr. Francisco Vital-Lopez, with the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine in support of the DOD Biotechnology High Performance Computing Software Applications Institute, and Jaques Reifman, who has a doctorate in nuclear engineering, director and senior research scientist of the Biotechnology High-Performance Computing Software Applications Institute, U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command, was honored in the research category, “Big Data, AI and Machine Learning in Military Research: Precision Medicine and Operational Readiness.”

Reifman led the team in developing and clearing with the Food and Drug Administration the APPRAISE-Hemorrhage Risk Index application, an artificial intelligence-enabled decision-support system designed to help combat medics triage trauma casualties for hemorrhage risk near the point of injury. The FDA clearance was a major milestone allowing for wide use and dissemination of this critical capability that will improve the chances of survival of combat casualties. APPRAISE-HRI is a one-of-a-kind application and the first and only AI-enabled software as a medical device approved by the FDA from the DOD.

Team Awards in Outstanding Program Management

Three teams were honored for outstanding medical product program management. The award focused on the accomplishments of a team charged with further maturing medical research and development or a commercial effort.

The Freeze-Dried Plasma Integrated Product Team from the Warfighter Protection and Acute Care, Operational Medical Systems, and industry partner Octapharma, led by Andrew Atkinson, product manager, OPMED, WPAC, and Kendra Lawrence, Ph.D., project manager OPMED, WPAC, was honored in the research category, “Advances in Far-Forward (Roles 1/2) Clinical Care Provision.”

Using a combination of traditional and innovative product development strategies together with an unprecedented level of collaboration, the FDP Integrated Product Team and industry partner Octapharma achieved an emergency use authorization for OctaPlasLG Powder in August 2024. This delivered the first ability for conventional forces to stock and field FDA-authorized FDP and demonstrates significant achievement in product development through the team’s depth of expertise, flexibility in acquisition and regulatory strategies, and unwavering commitment to find solutions to priority medical gaps.

The U.S. Army Office of Regulated Activities Medical Devices and Diagnostics branch, in partnership with military medical product developers across DOD, led by Dr. Chandar Thakur, chief of ORA, was recognized in the category, “State of the Technology: Demonstrations of Acute Diagnostic and Monitoring TBI Devices.”

MDD played a crucial role in achieving five FDA approvals of military-focused medical products since February 2024. Efforts included the Automated Processing of the Physiologic Registry for Assessment of Injury Severity, Analyzer-Traumatic Brain Injury, MEQU Fluid Warmer, Infrascanner 2500, and SymVess. MDD also addressed several program-impacting issues with FDA, leading to successful milestones.

The Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Medical team, led by U.S. Army Col. Matthew Clark, joint project manager for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Medical, was recognized in the category, “Enhancing Military Medical Readiness through Global Health Engagement and Research.”

The JPM CBRN Medical team is recognized for excellence in support of their efforts increasing warfighter readiness and reducing operational risk from chemical agents. They have received seven FDA-approved products; four this year alone. Much of the recent success of the JPM CBRN Medical can be attributed to the “Year of the Integrated Product Team (IPT)” initiative the team kicked off in 2023, and its strong focus on an integrated master schedule and schedule management. The Year of the IPT highlighted that quality is essential for success.

March 27, 2020

Untangling the relationship between traumatic brain injury (TBI and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a complex challenge. Service members can experience both a mild TBI (also known as concussion) and psychological distress from combat situations, assaults and motor vehicle crashes. But research from the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center (DVBIC), a division of the Defense Health Agency Research and Development Directorate, has found that psychological experiences prior to TBI may play a role in recovery.

In a 2018 study from DVBIC's San Antonio site, we identified 165 service members with concussion, some of whom also had a diagnosis of PTSD. Drawing on data from our Prospective Traumatic Brain Injury Clinical Tracking Repository, we were able to collect information on life experiences and mental health prior to joining the military. We considered variables such as resilience and past trauma. The data showed that resilience, or ""positive attitudes,"" were inversely associated with whether an individual reported symptoms from concussion and traumatic stress.

Interestingly, data from the same study revealed that how one copes with adversity, or the number of traumatic experiences, can impact symptoms reported from concussion. So that those who have experienced more adversity in life, such as really bad accidents, seeing someone hurt or die, or some other sudden event that was scary or horrific, reported greater concussion symptoms. This effect was independent from the effect of resilience.

Social support is also an important factor. In a survey of 326 service members with concussion, we found that the presence of regular social relationships – for example, consistent weekly interactions with friends and family – appeared to protect service members from concussion symptoms.

These findings contain important insights that may help military health care providers understand and treat service members with a history of concussion. Screening for prior trauma may help to identify those at greater risk of developing persistent post-concussion symptoms. Intervention that promotes resilience and social support may be an important part of a comprehensive intervention plan for those with a history of TBI.

The Department of Veterans Affairs posted the proposed rule change on Monday and opened a public comment period on it that runs through Sept. 3. The department said in its proposal that it wants to ensure it “provides only needed medical services to our nation’s heroes and their families.”

The department says it would still provide abortion in life-threatening circumstances – something state laws allow, even in places where bans are in place. But critics of the change note that abortion would not be provided when pregnancies are the result of rape or incest.

Amy Friedrich-Karnik, director of federal policy at the Guttmacher Institute, said in a statement that the change would cut off millions of veterans and their families from services.

“Veterans have historically faced significant barriers to reproductive health care, and with the current patchwork of abortion bans and restrictions across the country, these barriers are even steeper today,"" she said.

Veterans Affairs, which provides health coverage for veterans and their dependents, did not include abortion in its coverage until 2022. President Joe Biden's administration added it months after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and state abortion bans began kicking in.

The Biden changed allowed the VA to provide abortion even in states where it was banned. The VA says in its proposal that allowing abortion is legally questionable because Congress has not specifically allowed it. The policy change would also bring the VA's coverage into line with other federal health care plans – including Medicaid and the TriCare coverage for active military members and their families – which exclude abortion in most cases.

The VA said in its filings that about 100 veterans and 40 dependents obtain abortions using the benefits each year – far below the projection the department made in 2022 of a total of 1,000 a year.

American Well Corporation’s recent earnings call presented a balanced sentiment, highlighting both strategic wins and challenges. The company reported significant improvements in software revenue and EBITDA, but also faced hurdles such as the exclusion of certain programs from the Military Health System contract extension and a decline in visit metrics, leading to revised revenue guidance. Despite these challenges, cost reduction initiatives and strategic wins suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook.

Strategic Win with Florida Blue

American Well Corporation secured a significant contract with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida, known as Florida Blue. This partnership will allow the company to white label Florida Blue’s brand and provide unified access to integrated clinical programs. This strategic win underscores the company’s commitment to innovation and expanding its reach in the healthcare sector.

Military Health System Contract Extension

The company successfully extended its engagement with the Military Health System for another year, focusing on delivering a SaaS software platform for digital-first initiatives. This extension has tripled virtual visits and achieved high satisfaction among providers and patients, marking a significant milestone in the company’s government business.

Significant Software Revenue Growth

American Well Corporation reported a remarkable 47% year-over-year growth in software revenue. This growth was driven by strategic client deployments and milestones, highlighting the company’s successful efforts in expanding its software offerings and client base.

Improved Adjusted EBITDA

The company achieved a significant improvement in adjusted EBITDA, moving from a negative $35 million in Q2 of last year to a negative $4.7 million. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of improvement, showcasing the company’s effective cost management and operational efficiency.

Cost Reduction Initiatives

American Well Corporation made substantial progress towards a leaner cost structure by reducing R&D expenses by approximately 12.2% and sales and marketing expenses by 32% compared to last year’s second quarter. These initiatives reflect the company’s focus on optimizing its operations and improving financial performance.

Reduction in Behavioral Health and Automated Care Programs

The 2026 contract extension for the Military Health System excluded behavioral health and automated care programs due to budget restrictions. This exclusion has impacted the company’s revised guidance, highlighting the challenges faced in aligning with budgetary constraints.

Decrease in Visit Metrics

The company completed approximately 1.2 million visits in Q2, which is about 22.3% lower than a year ago. Additionally, AMG visit revenue was 20.8% lower than last year, indicating a decline in visit metrics that the company needs to address moving forward.

Revised Revenue Guidance

American Well Corporation revised its 2025 revenue guidance to a range of $245 million to $250 million, down from the prior range of $250 million to $260 million. This revision reflects new expectations around contributions from the government business, particularly the extension of the Military Health System contract.

Forward-Looking Guidance

During the earnings call, American Well Corporation provided updated guidance with a focus on achieving positive cash flow from operations by 2026. The company reported a total revenue of $70.9 million for Q2, a 13% increase year-over-year. Subscription software revenue grew by 47%, reaching $40.4 million and comprising 57% of total revenue. The company anticipates full-year revenue for 2025 to be between $245 million and $250 million, with subscription software revenue expected to represent 53% of total revenues. They project adjusted EBITDA to range from negative $50 million to negative $45 million, demonstrating a 65% improvement year-over-year.

In summary, American Well Corporation’s earnings call reflected a balanced sentiment with both achievements and challenges. The company’s strategic wins, particularly with Florida Blue and the Military Health System, highlight its growth potential. However, challenges such as reduced visit metrics and revised revenue guidance underscore the need for continued focus on cost management and strategic partnerships. Overall, the company’s efforts in improving software revenue and EBITDA suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook for the future.",https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/shutterstock_2127549605-750x406.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-06 22:56:18.010480

Guido Valdes, director of Defense Health Network Pacific Rim, hosted Patrick Picardo, executive director of the Office of VA/DoD Health Affairs, Veterans Health Administration, July 10 to discuss implementation of a DOD and VA initiative to expand healthcare collaboration. Two of DHN-PR’s military hospitals and clinics, Naval Medical Center San Diego and Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton, have been designated jointly as one of five initial shared sites nationwide.

The two hospitals are participating as a single shared site due to their geographic proximity. They are also close to the San Diego VA Healthcare System’s medical center, which is approximately 15 miles from NMCSD and 41 miles from NHCP. The initiative will focus on enhancing readiness skills for DoD medical professionals, expanding access to care for TRICARE beneficiaries and veterans, and reducing network costs. It will achieve these goals by leveraging shared clinical workload capacity, aligning operational capabilities, and improving care coordination between these military hospitals and VA San Diego.

“Our mission is grounded in integration—between the Defense Health Agency and Navy Medicine, and now increasingly with the VA,” said Valdes, who is also the Naval Medical Forces Pacific commander. “By working together, we can expand access to care through resource sharing, promote readiness, and reduce reliance on external medical systems while maintaining the highest standards of care.”

The meeting reflected ongoing DOD-VA resource sharing to more efficiently use taxpayer resources and provide timely, coordinated care to eligible beneficiaries.

The discussion overviewed the network's capabilities, which span nine military hospitals and clinics across the Pacific Rim. Leaders at both NMCSD and NHCP met with Picardo and his team July 9 to develop familiarity with the facilities and their scope of operations.

""It was a privilege to host Mr. Patrick Picardo and his team at Naval Medical Center San Diego,"" said NMCSD Acting Director Capt. Laurie Chavez. ""Our discussions reinforced a shared commitment to expanding access to high-quality care for our nation's veterans. Whether it's improving base access, optimizing operating room capacity, or aligning with VA partners, NMCSD remains steadfast in our dedication to delivering world-class medical support to those who have served.""

Picardo talked about the value of partnerships to break down barriers and build bridges between the two organizations while also emphasizing how future collaborations will enhance existing relationships between military hospitals and clinics and VA hospitals.

The visit also emphasized the importance of leader-to-leader communication at all levels—local, regional, and national—to maintain alignment and drive progress.

“As we expand these initiatives, it’s critical we stay connected—from the facility level up to the department level,” Valdes said. “That’s how we ensure we are collaborating strategically and making these partnerships work.”

This agreement supports the ongoing digital transformation of the Military Health System (MHS), allowing Amwell to continue supplying its technology platform for virtual care [1].

The extended contract enables Amwell to maintain its virtual care platform for MHS providers, which has been successfully implemented across the Department of Defense’s global operations, including the US Military Entrance Processing Command and US Coast Guard. The platform integrates seamlessly with the MHS electronic health record, supporting adaptable healthcare solutions for military personnel, their families, and care teams [1].

Amwell's platform has been instrumental in streamlining care team workloads, enhancing beneficiary health, reducing costs, and improving the use of the Defense Health Agency’s clinical resources worldwide. Through the DHA’s Digital Front Door initiative, new features have been added to MHS GENESIS, a sophisticated electronic health record system for military and Veteran healthcare. Amwell’s platform supports effective, high-quality care delivery within existing clinical workflows, including those in MHS GENESIS, enabling the DHA to adopt hybrid care models [1].

The Digital First program supports approximately 9.6 million users, including active-duty service members, their families, retirees, and healthcare professionals across all levels of care. Amwell chairman and CEO Ido Schoenberg stated, ""Our platform is in use across the global DOD enterprise, enabling high-quality, efficient care for this important population. We are grateful for the service of our nation’s military, and we are proud to be supporting their wellbeing"" [1].

Financial Performance and Valuation

Despite the contract extension, Amwell has experienced a decline in revenue over the past year, with a 3.4% decrease. The company reported an operating margin of -66.08% and a net margin of -59.14%. However, the company's valuation metrics suggest potential undervaluation, with price-to-sales and price-to-book ratios close to their one-year lows [2].

Amwell's Q2 2025 earnings call highlighted several key points. The company reported a 47% year-over-year increase in Q2 subscription software revenue, with a gross margin of 56.1% and a significant narrowing of adjusted EBITDA loss. Cash burn declined to $3 million, with $219 million in cash on hand. The company also secured a strategic partnership with Florida Blue, expanding its payer market footprint [2].

However, the contract extension excludes AmWell’s behavioral health and automated care programs due to Department of Defense budget caps, prompting a downward revision in 2025 subscription revenue guidance. The company lowered its full-year 2025 revenue guidance to $245–$250 million from $250–$260 million and narrowed adjusted EBITDA to a negative $50 million to $45 million [2].

Conclusion

Amwell's contract extension with the Military Health System demonstrates the company's commitment to providing high-quality, efficient virtual care solutions. Despite financial challenges, the company's strategic partnerships and operational progress indicate potential growth opportunities. Investors should closely monitor Amwell's financial performance and strategic initiatives to assess its long-term prospects.

Carnegie, Samantha Hawkins",,,,,https://www.mintz.com/insights-center/viewpoints/2146/2025-08-06-federal-court-blocks-arkansas-pbm-ownership-law-citing,"In a significant legal development, a federal judge has temporarily blocked Arkansas from enforcing Act 624.
These existing laws, Judge Miller noted, are sufficient to address the state’s stated concerns without imposing the sweeping restrictions of Act 624.
“Subjecting TRICARE to the Arkansas Act 624 license requirements would give the State’s pharmacy board a virtual power of review over .
He also declined to find preemption under ERISA or Medicare, noting that Act 624 regulates pharmacy licensing rather than plan administration.
If upheld, Act 624 could serve as a model for other states seeking to rein in PBM influence.","In a significant legal development, a federal judge has temporarily blocked Arkansas from enforcing Act 624. Act 624 prohibits pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from owning or operating pharmacies in the state, effectively forcing vertically integrated companies to divest or shut down their Arkansas pharmacy operations. However, on July 28, 2025, U.S. District Judge Brian Miller granted a preliminary injunction to several major PBMs and affiliated entities, halting the law’s implementation pending final resolution of the case.

Court Finds Violation of Commerce Clause and TRICARE Preemption

In his order, Judge Miller concluded that Act 624 likely violates the U.S. Constitution’s Commerce Clause by overtly discriminating against out-of-state companies and imposes an excessive burden on interstate commerce. The statute’s preamble explicitly states its purpose is to eliminate “business tactics that have driven locally-operated pharmacies out of business,” which the court interpreted as protectionist rhetoric targeting non-Arkansas entities.

“Although the state argues that it is merely targeting a form of business structure, this appears to only be a half-truth,” Judge Miller wrote. “The statute discloses that the state is also attempting to protect ‘locally operated pharmacies’ as opposed to just consumers and non-PBM affiliated pharmacies, including out-of-state non-PBM affiliated pharmacies like Walgreens.”

The judge emphasized that Arkansas already has several laws regulating PBMs, including statutes that prohibit discriminatory reimbursement practices and exclusion of willing pharmacies from health networks. These existing laws, Judge Miller noted, are sufficient to address the state’s stated concerns without imposing the sweeping restrictions of Act 624.

In addition to the Commerce Clause violation, the court found that Act 624 is likely preempted by TRICARE, the federal health benefits program for military personnel and retirees. The law would interfere with the U.S. Department of Defense’s ability to contract with PBM-owned pharmacies, undermining the uniformity and stability of the TRICARE network.

“Subjecting TRICARE to the Arkansas Act 624 license requirements would give the State’s pharmacy board a virtual power of review over . . . who the Department of Defense can contract with,” and “. . . impede[] the TRICARE program’s ability to accomplish the purposes for which Congress enacted it,” Judge Miller wrote..

Broader Constitutional Claims Rejected

While the court granted the injunction based on the Commerce Clause and TRICARE preemption, it rejected the plaintiffs’ other constitutional claims. Judge Miller found that Act 624 does not violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause, the Takings Clause, or the Equal Protection Clause. He also declined to find preemption under ERISA or Medicare, noting that Act 624 regulates pharmacy licensing rather than plan administration.

Furthermore, the court dismissed the argument that Act 624 constitutes a bill of attainder, concluding that the law does not specifically target the plaintiffs and does not impose punishment in a constitutional sense. “While Act 624 is tainted by its protectionist rhetoric so much as to render it unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause, it was not enacted in a wholly arbitrary manner,” Judge Miller wrote.

Irreparable Harm and Public Interest Support Injunction

As outlined in our June 2025 blog post, the plaintiff PBMs and other organizations argued that Act 624 would disrupt access to medications for tens of thousands of Arkansans, including TRICARE beneficiaries, seniors, and patients with complex conditions. The court found that the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm if the law were allowed to take effect, citing the threat of unrecoverable economic losses and the inability to seek damages due to the government’s sovereign immunity. The balance of equities and public interest also favored the plaintiffs, as “no harm is caused when defendants are enjoined from enforcing an unconstitutional law.”

Next Steps and Broader Implications

The legal battle over Act 624 is far from over. On July 31, 2025, the Arkansas State Board of Pharmacy filed a notice of appeal. The litigation, now consolidated under Express Scripts Inc. et al. v. Richmond et al., Case No. 4:25-cv-00520, will continue in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas.

The case is being closely watched nationwide, as Arkansas is the first state to enact such a sweeping restriction on PBMs’ ownership of pharmacies. If upheld, Act 624 could serve as a model for other states seeking to rein in PBM influence. Conversely, a final ruling against the law could reinforce federal protections for PBMs and affiliated pharmacies.

For now, the preliminary injunction preserves the status quo, allowing PBM-affiliated pharmacies to continue operating in Arkansas while the legal battle unfolds.",https://www.mintz.com/sites/default/files/media/images/2020-02-14/Health-Care_Small_Viewpoints.png,N,0.0,2025-08-06 17:56:09.013043

Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, presented the awards to the winning individuals and teams. Their research spanned diverse topics, including warfighter readiness, traumatic brain injury, PTSD, and mental health.

Individual Distinguished Service Award Winners

Two researchers in the military medical community were recognized for significant contributions to the success of Military Health System medical studies supporting the deployed warfighter.

In the research category, “Innovation and Current Directions in Military Suicide Prevention, Research, and Programs,” Retired U.S. Air Force Col. (Dr.) Robert Ursano, director of the Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress and professor of psychiatry and neuroscience at the Uniformed Services University, was honored for advancing mental health care, resilience, and trauma research in support of the health and well-being of warfighters.

Ursano’s key research included combat stress, posttraumatic stress disorder, and traumatic brain injury, with a focus in suicide prevention. The findings from his work provided essential data informing suicide prevention efforts and the understanding of risk and resilience in service members. The PTSD Brain Bank provides a lasting resource for future research aimed at developing better treatments. Through his leadership of CSTS, he oversaw the development and dissemination of training and intervention programs aimed at improving the psychological health of service members and families exposed to trauma and disaster.

In the research category, “Optimizing the Human Weapon System: Utilizing Wearable Sensor Data to Inform Readiness,” Dr. Karl Friedl, senior research scientist of performance physiology, U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, was recognized as a leader in service member health and performance. Friedl's research focused on extending limits of human physiological performance, with contributions including endocrine regulation in semi-starvation, physiological effects of anabolic steroids, body composition methods and standards, physiological monitoring, and metrics of research.

Outstanding Research Accomplishment

Individual awards were given to three researchers for outstanding research contributions supporting the warfighter with significant accomplishments of high impact achieved since February 2024.

Justin Baker, who has a doctorate in psychology, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral health, Ohio State University College of Medicine, was recognized for his work in the category, “Innovation and Current Directions in Military Suicide Prevention, Research, and Programs.”

Baker's work focused on increasing the reach and accessibility of suicide prevention treatments through research that advances group therapy, telehealth, virtual learning platforms, and other innovative resources for service members struggling with suicidal thoughts and behaviors. His accomplishments stem from leading successful military-academic partnerships to help warfighters return to operational readiness and build resilience skills.

Mary Jo Pugh, a retired U.S. Air Force nurse who has a doctorate in psychology, and professor, Division of Epidemiology at the University of Utah School of Medicine, was recognized for her work in the category, “Evolving Methods for the Analysis of Large Complex Data Sources to Inform Military Health Policy, Readiness, Performance and Medical Practices.” She is also an investigator at the Informatics, Decision-Enhancement and Analytic Sciences Center of Innovation and the Department of Veterans Affairs Salt Lake City.

Pugh made groundbreaking contributions to research on TBI on multiple morbidity in veterans. She pioneered the integration of Department of Defense and VA data, revolutionizing the study of military exposures and complex comorbidities. Her leadership in the LIMBIC Phenotype study, encompassing over 2.5 million post-9/11 veterans, unveiled critical insights into TBI phenotypes and their associated outcomes. Pugh's innovative application of complexity theory and her dedication to advancing research methodologies significantly enhanced understanding of deployed warfighter and veteran health.

U.S. Army Capt. (Dr.) Maya Alexandri, J.D., U.S. Army Medical Corp, was recognized in the category, “Portable Medical & Dental Imaging in the Far Forward Environment.”

Alexandri led groundbreaking research measuring the electromagnetic signature of handheld ultrasound systems, otherwise known as EMS and HUS, as a crucial step for ensuring safe use in austere, high-risk combat environments. Her pilot study, conducted with the DOD’s Joint Electromagnetic Warfare Center, found that the EMS of HUS probes is negligible—undetectable at distances beyond 10 feet—suggesting they likely can be safely used without risking adversary detection. This first-of-its-kind research lays the foundation for U.S. Army doctrine integrating HUS into far-forward military medical care.

Warfighter Medical Research Public Communication

Doug Jones, who has a doctorate in movement and sport sciences, research physiologist, and director for the Warfighter Performance Department’s Thermal Physiology Lab, Naval Health Research Center, and team member, Dr. Timothy Dunn, who has a doctorate in cognitive psychology, cognitive scientist, Warfighter Performance Department, were recognized for contributions to broadening the general public's awareness of DOD-sponsored warfighter-related medical research through public communications in the category, “Polar Performance at Altitude and Arctic Activities.”

Jones and Dunn significantly advanced understanding of warfighters’ physiological and cognitive responses to operating in extreme environments. Their dedication and scientific rigor in medical research were recognized by National Public Radio’s Marketplace podcast during joint exercise Arctic Edge 2024. When NPR travelled to NHRC to record a special episode on the challenges warfighters face operating in the extreme cold, Jones and Dunn were able to relay to a general audience their scientific efforts to improve service members’ readiness, resilience, and lethality.

Team Awards in Outstanding Research Accomplishment

Three teams were awarded for their outstanding research contributions supporting the warfighter with significant accomplishment of high impact achieved since February 2024.

The Linking Investigations in Trauma and Emergency Services Network team from the University of Pittsburgh, led by Dr. Jason Sperry, section chief of trauma surgery, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Division of Surgery, was honored in the research category, “Blood and Blood Products: Novel Strategies for Treatment of Blood Failure.”

The LITES Network completed two high-impact trials—CriSP-HS and CriSP-TBI—demonstrating the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of early, cold-stored platelet transfusion in patients with hemorrhagic shock and TBI. These trials provided the first high-level evidence supporting early CSP use in injured patients. LITES demonstrated CSP transfusions were safe, could be provided earlier, and may improve outcomes. Incorporating CSPs into military transfusion protocols has the potential to augment the platelet supply, expand access to operationally complex environments, and improve outcomes in the critically injured warfighter.

The Naval Psychological Readiness and Human Performance team from the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory, led by Justin Handy, who has a doctorate in cognitive psychology, research psychologist, Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory, and Dominica Hernandez, Ph.D. team co-lead, research psychologist, principal investigator, was honored in the research category, “Undersea Operational Research Panel.”

The NPRHP team transitioned multiple evidence-based fleet deliverables that improved submariner and nuclear-operator screening, career prediction, and individual coaching to foster readiness, professional development, leadership, team performance, and retention. The team validated a model for predicting optimal career outcomes and targeting optimal points for career intervention. Their submarine leadership and sailor development programs transitioned to the fleet, becoming mandated for submariners assigned to operational boats. Their efforts also formed the basis for a U.S. Navy-wide leadership assessment and development program.

The interdisciplinary team comprised of Dr. Francisco Vital-Lopez, with the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine in support of the DOD Biotechnology High Performance Computing Software Applications Institute, and Jaques Reifman, who has a doctorate in nuclear engineering, director and senior research scientist of the Biotechnology High-Performance Computing Software Applications Institute, U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command, was honored in the research category, “Big Data, AI and Machine Learning in Military Research: Precision Medicine and Operational Readiness.”

Reifman led the team in developing and clearing with the Food and Drug Administration the APPRAISE-Hemorrhage Risk Index application, an artificial intelligence-enabled decision-support system designed to help combat medics triage trauma casualties for hemorrhage risk near the point of injury. The FDA clearance was a major milestone allowing for wide use and dissemination of this critical capability that will improve the chances of survival of combat casualties. APPRAISE-HRI is a one-of-a-kind application and the first and only AI-enabled software as a medical device approved by the FDA from the DOD.

Team Awards in Outstanding Program Management

Three teams were honored for outstanding medical product program management. The award focused on the accomplishments of a team charged with further maturing medical research and development or a commercial effort.

The Freeze-Dried Plasma Integrated Product Team from the Warfighter Protection and Acute Care, Operational Medical Systems, and industry partner Octapharma, led by Andrew Atkinson, product manager, OPMED, WPAC, and Kendra Lawrence, Ph.D., project manager OPMED, WPAC, was honored in the research category, “Advances in Far-Forward (Roles 1/2) Clinical Care Provision.”

Using a combination of traditional and innovative product development strategies together with an unprecedented level of collaboration, the FDP Integrated Product Team and industry partner Octapharma achieved an emergency use authorization for OctaPlasLG Powder in August 2024. This delivered the first ability for conventional forces to stock and field FDA-authorized FDP and demonstrates significant achievement in product development through the team’s depth of expertise, flexibility in acquisition and regulatory strategies, and unwavering commitment to find solutions to priority medical gaps.

The U.S. Army Office of Regulated Activities Medical Devices and Diagnostics branch, in partnership with military medical product developers across DOD, led by Dr. Chandar Thakur, chief of ORA, was recognized in the category, “State of the Technology: Demonstrations of Acute Diagnostic and Monitoring TBI Devices.”

MDD played a crucial role in achieving five FDA approvals of military-focused medical products since February 2024. Efforts included the Automated Processing of the Physiologic Registry for Assessment of Injury Severity, Analyzer-Traumatic Brain Injury, MEQU Fluid Warmer, Infrascanner 2500, and SymVess. MDD also addressed several program-impacting issues with FDA, leading to successful milestones.

The Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Medical team, led by U.S. Army Col. Matthew Clark, joint project manager for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Medical, was recognized in the category, “Enhancing Military Medical Readiness through Global Health Engagement and Research.”

The JPM CBRN Medical team is recognized for excellence in support of their efforts increasing warfighter readiness and reducing operational risk from chemical agents. They have received seven FDA-approved products; four this year alone. Much of the recent success of the JPM CBRN Medical can be attributed to the “Year of the Integrated Product Team (IPT)” initiative the team kicked off in 2023, and its strong focus on an integrated master schedule and schedule management. The Year of the IPT highlighted that quality is essential for success.

Several other awards will be presented during the week-long symposium. The Young Investigator Competition will be held during the conference to honor three top investigators. More than 1,400 scientific posters will be presented during MHSRS, and top poster presenters will be recognized by their peers.

Ryan wrote a letter to Defense Health Agency Acting Director David Smith, demanding that the Keller inpatient unit remain open.
Ryan said he is demanding better for the Hudson Valley military community.
Keller Army Community Hospital provides a range of health care services for the cadets and military personnel stationed at West Point, including inpatient and surgical care.
Additionally, West Point has 30 NCAA sports teams whose athletes receive treatment at Keller.","Congressman Pat Ryan has raised the alarm on the Trump Administration’s plan to “downsize” 17 Military Treatment Facilities across the country, including Keller Army Community Hospital at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. The plan would downgrade Keller from a community hospital where patients can receive high-quality inpatient treatment into what is effectively an urgent care – stripping critical medical care away from West Point cadets, servicemembers, retirees, and their families. Patients will no longer be able to receive treatment and observation overnight, instead being forced to seek care at already-overloaded private facilities.

Ryan wrote a letter to Defense Health Agency Acting Director David Smith, demanding that the Keller inpatient unit remain open. Especially as he continues his fight to reopen 20 inpatient beds at Castle Point VA, which closed amid Trump’s hiring freeze. Ryan said he is demanding better for the Hudson Valley military community.

Keller Army Community Hospital provides a range of health care services for the cadets and military personnel stationed at West Point, including inpatient and surgical care. “Downsizing” the facility, Ryan said, will force West Point patients to seek inpatient care off-post at private facilities, running the risk that they will experience significantly increased wait times and a lower quality of care. It also terminates Keller’s ability to provide hospital care – which has alarming implications for patients in emergency situations. Not only does this add an extra burden to patients in emergency situations, it would divert significant resources from cadets and instructors who would then be responsible for transporting patients.

Ryan added that the proposal comes at a time when the health care system in the Hudson Valley is already significantly strained and struggling to provide care to the civilian population. It also comes following years of reductions in services at Keller, including the loss of labor and delivery, pediatric, podiatric, and ear, nose and throat care. “Past decisions to cut services and systemic underfunding have led to a downward cycle that has significantly diminished care at Keller,” he said.

Further, the congressman said, closing Keller’s inpatient unit has potentially degrading effects on West Point’s capability to recruit talent.

Government data show that in just three months, February to April, 318,000 Black women left the U.S. labor force.

Raise your hand if the following sentence surprises you:

As the Trump regime’s seeming resegregation of the federal workforce continues and the reality of the thousands of jobs summarily eliminated by DOGE becomes clear, it is Black women who have been the most negatively impacted.

Scanning the room, I see no hands raised. Good on you for understanding this country’s centuries of mistreatment of Black women.

Since our national nightmare began anew on Jan. 20, there have been shameless dismissals of Black women in higher-level government roles: Carla Hayden, the first Black person to run the Library of Congress; Gwynne Wilcox, the first Black woman on the National Labor Relations Board; Lt. Gen. Telita Crosland, head of the military’s Defense Health Agency, who retired “abruptly”; and Charlotte A. Burrows, chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. All illustrate that to President Donald Trump and his miscreant minions, apparently only white is right when it comes to leadership roles.

Government data show that in just three months, February to April, 318,000 Black women left the U.S. labor force. The number might be higher now because more dismissals have occurred in the months since.

Though many bureaus have seen some reduction in staff, major slashes have come at the departments of Education, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, and Veterans Affairs; at each, the percentage of Black employees was 20% or higher.

Gender economist Katica Roy believes it’s not an accident.

With the reductions, “you’re not just trimming the fat, you’re actually cutting the economic backbone for Black women,” Roy said in a recent ABC News interview. “When we often think about women’s issues or Black women’s issues, we think of it as an ‘over there’ problem. It’s not—it’s an everybody problem.”

Underscoring her point, Roy noted that the drop in Black women’s workforce participation means a $37 billion loss in gross domestic product. Higher employment rates mean higher wages across the board.

Though they represent roughly 6% of the total workforce nationally, data published in 2023 shows Black women made up nearly 12% of the federal workforce before cuts began. We can’t know exactly how many of the cohort were forced out of their jobs since the Office of Personnel Management, a supposedly independent agency, scrubbed all racial demographic information from its public data website in March (probably to appease Dear Leader), but in late February Education Department union leader Sheria Smith said 60 of the 74 workers that had been let go from the department are Black.

The cuts are more than a loss of experience and efficiency. Federal employment has played a significant role in building the Black middle class.

Black veterans were essentially shut out of the post-World War II G.I. Bill that set millions of their white colleagues on a path to generational wealth, further increasing the economic divide between white and Black Americans. But the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act prompted the government to diversify its workforce.

Crucially, civil service jobs provide stability, a chance to climb the ladder that’s not always afforded in the private sector, plus benefits and pensions. And because 25.1% of all federal employees are unionized, compared with just 6% in the private sector, there is often an extra layer of security built in. (The pay gap, however, persists: Black women in civil service are not paid at the same rate as their white woman counterparts, let alone white men.)

Long the most unprotected demographic in America, Black women were relegated to the lowest-paying jobs for generations and still make up a disproportionate share of workers in sectors like child care, retail, and hospitality, A 2019 study shows that many of those jobs will be automated by 2030. Black women have largely been locked out of tech roles and receive essentially pennies of venture capital money. With programs meant to help increase those numbers frequently facing big-money-backed lawsuits crying that it’s discriminatory to only help Black women, that might not change anytime soon.

Thirty-eight percent of young Black women have earned a college degree, but most borrow a significant amount in student loans. Add that to rising inflation because of tariffs and the price of women’s goods already costing more than men’s goods, and it’s easy to see that some might be headed for catastrophe.

Slightly more than half of Black households with children have mothers as the breadwinner, so the financial success—or failure—of Black women can have significant consequences.

“If we take a step back, this is an economic alarm bell,” Roy said.

There’s a truism that says when America gets a cold, Black people get the flu. In this case, Black women seeing alarming job losses is likely a signal that the rest of America’s workforce should start stocking up on Kleenex.

Despite this, the company reported a net loss of $19.5 million, wider than the previous quarter. The company highlighted strategic achievements, including adding Florida Blue as a strategic client and extending its contract with the U.S. Defense Health Agency. However, ongoing net losses highlight challenges in achieving profitability.

American Well Corp (AMWL), a leading telehealth solutions provider, reported its second-quarter 2025 results on August 5, 2025. The company's GAAP revenue of $70.9 million in Q2 2025 exceeded analyst estimates by 11.7%, driven primarily by a significant increase in software subscription revenue [1]. This performance was bolstered by the addition of Florida Blue as a strategic client and the extension of its contract with the U.S. Defense Health Agency (DHA).

Despite the revenue growth, American Well reported a net loss of $19.5 million, which was wider than the previous quarter's net loss of $17.5 million. The company attributed this to ongoing declines in visit volumes, with total visits dropping to 1.2 million in Q2 2025 from 1.3 million in Q1 2025 [1].

The company's adjusted EBITDA loss narrowed significantly to $(4.7 million) in Q2 2025, an 86.6% year-over-year improvement compared to Q2 2024. Gross margin expanded to 56.1% in Q2 2025, reflecting the company's focus on recurring software subscription revenue [1].

American Well's full-year revenue guidance for FY2025 was lowered to a range of $245 million to $250 million after the divestiture of Amwell Psychiatric Care, down from the previous guidance of $250 million to $260 million. The company expects adjusted EBITDA loss for FY2025 to be $(50) to $(45) million, a narrower range indicating progress on improving operating performance [1].

The company's stock price surged 20.45% in aftermarket trading following the earnings report, reaching $7.82, and has seen a year-to-date return of 16.97% [3]. Despite the strong financial performance, ongoing net losses highlight challenges in achieving profitability.

American Well continues to focus on scaling its technology, signing partnerships with large health systems and payers, and transitioning to recurring software subscription revenue. The company's success relies on maintaining regulatory compliance and interoperability with other healthcare systems.

Investors will likely remain focused on the pace of platform adoption, the outcome of government contract renewals, and continued improvement in profit metrics as American Well navigates the rapidly evolving telehealth sector.

The seminar focused on the holistic connection between mental health and limb loss or limb trauma. Speakers addressed how the mind-body connection is a tool for managing severe, chronic pain, with potential to heal and function in daily life.

“FAST always has had some element of mental health, but mental health emerged as the next clear priority topic based on an emphasis in the clinical practice guidelines and clinician input,” said Andrea Crunkhorn, the EACE chief of clinical affairs who holds a doctorate in physical therapy.

EACE, part of the DHA Research and Engineering Directorate, is advancing the science of trauma-related and patient-centered care. EACE is a joint operation of the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs.

DOD and VA have jointly published 28 clinical practice guidelines based on current best practices and the most up-to-date, evidence-based research. DOD-VA have published two limb loss clinical resources:

Rehabilitation of Lower Limb Amputation

Management of Upper Limb Amputation Rehabilitation

Functional recovery speaker captures meeting themes

Dr. Ajay Manhapra, who works at the Hampton VA Medical Center, encapsulated the mind-body connection in his presentation, “Enabling physical and psychosocial recovery among veterans with debilitating chronic pain: Can lessons learned help people with limb loss experiencing chronic pain?”

“A chronic pain syndrome diagnosis means that the pain has become a separate problem … and is not a symptom of some other physical disorder,” Manhapra said.

Manhapra is a pioneer of the care model where patients establish a “trauma narrative” to reframe their trauma and help make sense of their experience. Patients build a timeline linking their injuries with subsequent behavioral challenges, such as PTSD or opioid addiction.

With a trauma narrative, provider and patient build a goal-oriented recovery plan to develop a “new normal with good functioning, but not the prior normal without pain,” Manhapra said. Patients learn to gradually increase their physical function with their existing pain. He also advocated for limited-time use of pain management medication.

Keynotes highlight amputees’ recovery and lessons for attendees

Three military amputees were FAST keynote speakers. All were treated at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, and discussed their experiences with their injuries. They emphasized physical rehabilitation paired with mental health care helped them feel whole and healthy again.

Retired U.S. Army Sgt. 1st Class Daniel Metzdorf lost his right leg to a roadside bomb in Iraq in January 2004. He told the audience: “If I could go back in time and talk to that 2004 me, I would ask the hospital to make my mental health care therapy the same tempo as my physical therapy.”

U.S. Marine Corps Lt. Col. Erik Melanson, a former intelligence officer in the special operations community, suffered a traumatic dislocation of his left knee and subsequent paralysis below the knee in a recreational accident. Melanson credits his physical and mental therapy as the main reason he’s been able to stay active duty. “It's not the injury itself. The greatest threat to you is going to be isolation,” he said. “If you're struggling, just find some meaning in your struggle.”

Retired U.S. Army 1st Sgt. Christopher Roseberry lost his right leg above the ankle and suffered serious back and arm fractures in a hit-and-run accident. He spent two years recovering and returned to active duty for another 12 years. He reinjured his leg in Afghanistan and had another amputation.

From training to practice

Crunkhorn said the meeting’s interactive sessions on evidence-based imagery, visualization, music, dance/movement, and creative arts therapy were beneficial because “many therapists know of these techniques but haven’t tried to implement them in clinical practice.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9197727.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-06 13:56:25.761859

I am just so sorry for those that are not near their weight goals yet.
