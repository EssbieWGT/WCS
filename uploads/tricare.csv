Tricare is an entitlement only if you retired from the military however that entitlement DOES cost money … prime in my opinion only works if you have a doctor that takes it… most don’t where I live in Florida but I use select.. next problem is soon to going on Tricare for life…so my cheap select goes away and then I have to pay for part B of Medicare in order to get Tricare for life and part b is MUCH more expensive than Tricare select.

📊 The Hard Data:

PT saves TRICARE an estimated $4,000–$13,981 per patient by preventing unnecessary surgeries, opioid dependency, and chronic disability.

TRICARE spends over $100,000 per patient on spinal fusion surgery but makes rehab harder to access.

Knee & hip replacements cost TRICARE $30,000+ per patient, yet studies show structured PT could prevent or delay many of these surgeries.

Opioid prescriptions cost TRICARE millions annually, even though early rehab reduces opioid use by 60% in chronic pain cases.

Smarter healthcare = lower costs & better outcomes. Expanding PT coverage is not just about better care—it’s a financially responsible solution for both veterans and taxpayers.

🛑 We need TRICARE to fix this broken system. Sign & share the petition to demand smarter, more cost-effective healthcare policies:

Urgent: we need your support now!

Today the Defense Health Agency declined to participate in a listening session scheduled by members of Congress for military families to inform Tricare about the devastating impacts of planned pharmacy cuts.

Fox News reported that Amanda Johnson, the spouse of a U.S. Marine and mother of five children, has claimed that her family has been denied an upcoming move to Peru due to her children not being fully vaccinated. The outlet noted that the Navy’s official policy does not require military families to have their children receive all recommended vaccines.

In a post on Instagram, Johnson wrote, “We are 30 days out from our overseas move & the Navy hasn’t cleared my children because they aren’t following the ACIP jab schedule. We are in limbo and have been waiting for months for a determination.”

“The Navy is saying because our children do not follow the CDC/ACIP schedule (the c0vid-19 shot is on here as well), our children are not medically suitable,” Johnson added. “And if we want to keep our family together, they must get *every* shot on the schedule.”

A picture of Johnson’s post, which features her family, has been shared on X, formerly Twitter.

Johnson told Fox News that the family was informed their children were “not suitable solely based on their vaccination status.”

The Navy’s BUMEDINST 1300.2B policy states, “Family members are not required to be immunized.” Additionally, Fox News reported that TRICARE, the U.S. military’s health care program, notes that an individual’s vaccination status “is not reviewed as part of the TRICARE overseas enrollment screening process.”

“We’re not breaking any rules,” Johnson told Fox News. “Peru doesn’t require vaccines, and Navy policy doesn’t either. We’ve done everything right, but, still, we’re stuck.”

Fox News reported that Amanda Johnson’s husband, Marine Capt. Hunter Johnson, sent a letter to Navy Medical Jacksonville regarding the family’s medical plan.

“Our children have not been, and will not be, enrolled in childcare. My wife is fully devoted to their daily care,” the Marine captain wrote in a letter to the Navy. “We homeschool using Time4Learning and limit exposure to institutional illness risks.

“Peru has no vaccination requirements… My continued presence is essential to our family’s stability,” Johnson added. “This is not a deployment, it’s a PCS [permanent change of station].”

According to Fox News, the Johnson family has already made preparations for housing in Peru and secured an Airbnb location near the Los Angeles International Airport ahead of their expected flight to Peru.

“They told us, ‘You can push out your orders,’ but that’s absolutely not an option,” Johnson said. “We’re not going to be punished because Navy can’t get it together.”",https://americanmilitarynews.com/wp-content/uploads/US-NEWS-HEALTH-VACCINES-EXEMPTIONS-DMT-scaled.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-23 16:56:20.188936

Our Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP) offers veterans the opportunity for intensive, structured care without requiring overnight stays. It is an important step between inpatient and outpatient therapy, offering daily assistance as veterans establish stability and confidence to progress. With clinical treatment, veteran peer support, and trauma-informed therapy, we create an environment where healing can actually happen.

What is a Partial Hospitalization Program for Veterans?

A Partial Hospitalization Program is a structured outpatient treatment model that combines the rigor of inpatient care with the freedom of living off-site. Veterans attend full-day therapy sessions, skill-building groups, and supportive activities, then return to their homes or sober living environments in the evening.

For many, PHP offers the ideal balance: the security of daily therapeutic engagement without the restrictions of inpatient living. It is especially valuable for those stepping down from detox or residential programs, as well as for veterans whose symptoms are too intense for weekly outpatient therapy alone.

At Sober First Recovery, our PHP for veterans is built with a deep understanding of the unique challenges faced by those who have served. From PTSD and depression to anxiety and substance use disorders, our approach is sensitive, purposeful, and rooted in real-world understanding of the military experience.

What Veterans Can Expect in Our PHP

A Structured Daily Routine for Recovery

Consistency is a powerful tool in the recovery process. Our PHP provides a predictable, supportive schedule five days a week, creating a sense of normalcy that helps veterans regain confidence. Each day typically includes individual therapy, group sessions, educational workshops, and time for skill development—all focused on emotional, psychological, and social healing.

By maintaining a steady rhythm, veterans are able to rebuild their internal sense of stability, which often feels disrupted after struggles with trauma or addiction.

Individualized Therapy with Veteran-Focused Clinicians

Healing is deeply personal, and every veteran deserves one-on-one attention. Veterans enrolled in our PHP work closely with licensed clinicians who specialize in both mental health and addiction recovery for military populations. Therapy sessions address core issues such as combat trauma, survivor’s guilt, grief, moral injury, and the complicated emotional aftermath of military service.

The aim is not just symptom reduction but genuine, meaningful progress that empowers each veteran to move forward.

Group Therapy Centered on Shared Experience

Veterans often find powerful connections with others who have lived through similar experiences. Our group therapy sessions are built around this principle. Groups explore critical topics like emotional regulation, relapse prevention, rebuilding civilian identities, and fostering healthy relationships.

Group therapy is not just about sharing; it is about understanding, challenging, and lifting each other up. Veterans find strength in the community and learn new coping skills that extend far beyond the walls of the treatment center.

Medical Oversight and Medication Management

Many veterans face co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders that require careful medical attention. Our PHP includes active involvement from medical professionals who oversee medication management and monitor physical health. By integrating medical care into daily programming, we provide a full spectrum of support that addresses both emotional and physical needs.

Family Support and Communication

Recovery does not happen in isolation. Families often play a key role in a veteran’s healing process. Our program offers family therapy options that help restore trust, rebuild communication, and foster healthier family dynamics. When families heal alongside veterans, long-term recovery becomes more sustainable.

Core Services for Veterans in Partial Hospitalization

At Sober First Recovery, veterans receive focused, veteran-specific services that extend beyond generic addiction treatment:

Trauma-Informed Care Every Step of the Way

Trauma leaves deep imprints on the mind and body. Our trauma-informed approach respects the unique realities veterans carry. Every therapy session and group meeting is conducted with sensitivity, compassion, and a recognition of the lasting effects of trauma.

Support for Dual Diagnoses

Veterans often face different mental health and substance use challenges simultaneously. Our team is skilled at addressing dual diagnoses, which is treating both issues concurrently to promote stronger outcomes and lasting stability.

Coordination with VA Benefits and Insurance

Most veterans have already spent time dealing with VA benefits, and the process is not always easy. While VA coverage can help pay for treatment, figuring it out can be confusing and frustrating. Our admissions team steps in to help sort through the paperwork, answer questions, and make sure veterans are not stuck waiting for the care they need. We keep it simple so the focus stays on getting better.

Personalized Discharge Planning

No one leaves our PHP without a solid plan for what comes next. Each veteran receives a highly detailed discharge plan that might include stepping into an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP), pursuing sober living arrangements, or connecting with long-term therapy and community support resources.

Civilian Reintegration Support

Transitioning from military to civilian life can be challenging. We offer practical support to help veterans navigate employment, family reintegration, community involvement, and rebuilding purpose. Life after service can be meaningful, and we help veterans rediscover their place in the world.

Who Benefits Most from Our Partial Hospitalization Program for Veterans?

Our PHP is ideal for veterans who:

Are transitioning from detox or inpatient residential programs but still need daily therapeutic structure

Are struggling with symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, depression, or substance use disorders that interfere with daily life

Are motivated to build coping skills and reconnect with civilian life

Need a higher level of support than traditional outpatient therapy can provide

For many veterans, reaching out for help can feel intimidating. At Sober First Recovery, vulnerability is met with understanding and respect. Veterans are not defined by their struggles—they are recognized for their strength, resilience, and potential.

Seamless Transitions Into and Beyond PHP

Recovery is a continuum, not a one-time event. We make sure that transitions into and out of PHP are smooth and supportive. For veterans moving into PHP from detox or residential care, we offer structured admission processes that maintain momentum and reduce anxiety.

When the time comes to graduate from PHP, our team provides personalized aftercare planning that might include:

Intensive Outpatient Programming (IOP)

Individual outpatient therapy

Peer mentorship programs

Community-based support groups

Sober living homes

Employment and education assistance

No veteran leaves without a clear, personalized roadmap for continued success.

What Makes Sober First Recovery for Veteran Partial Hospitalization Different

Veterans deserve treatment centers that honor their experience, see their strengths, and recognize their unique hardships. At Sober First Recovery, we combine expert clinical care with an authentic, heart-centered approach.

We are committed to:

Listening to each veteran’s story with respect and without judgment

Providing a safe and welcoming environment that fosters real growth

Addressing both substance use and mental health issues thoroughly and carefully

“Our common-sense reforms honor the service and sacrifice military families make every day.
But for too many military families, long waiting lists put that lifeline out of reach,” said Besa Pinchotti, CEO of the National Military Family Association.
The bill allows military families to remain on their home state’s Medicaid throughout their military career.
The Care for Military Kids Act is endorsed by the National Guard Association of the United States (NGAUS), the National Military Families Organization, and Blue Star Families.","[WASHINGTON, DC] – U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and U.S. Representative Jen Kiggans (R-VA) this week introduced a bipartisan, bicameral legislative package that aims to improve services and benefits for military families. Included in the package is the Care for Military Kids Act – which is co-led by U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) – the Servicemember Healthcare Freedom Act, the Coast Guard Parity Act, and the Bonus Act, all of which make meaningful reforms to improve health, personal, and financial outcomes for servicemembers and their families.

“Our bipartisan, bicameral legislative package will make a real difference in servicemembers’ lives—expanding benefits and improving healthcare for their loved ones,” said Blumenthal. “Our common-sense reforms honor the service and sacrifice military families make every day. By easing the financial burden on families and ensuring access to critical healthcare coverage, our measures will improve the quality of life for thousands of military families.”

“As a Navy spouse and mom of four, I know the extraordinary sacrifices our military families make to keep our nation safe—and they deserve more than just words of appreciation,” said Kiggans. “That’s why I’ve worked across the Capitol to advance commonsense legislation that improves healthcare access, protects earned benefits, and provides greater financial security for our servicemembers. Whether it’s ensuring National Guard members are able to choose the healthcare that works best for them and their families, fixing gaps in Medicaid coverage when families move between states, or making sure Coast Guardsmen can finish their careers with dignity, these bills are about honoring service with real, meaningful support.”

“Military families make immense sacrifices for our nation, and ensuring their children have consistent access to critical healthcare should never be a burden placed on them,” said Tillis. “This bipartisan legislation will allow these families to maintain their home state's Medicaid benefits, giving our servicemembers the peace of mind they deserve.”

“Medicaid can be a lifeline for military families whose family members need services that TRICARE doesn’t cover. But for too many military families, long waiting lists put that lifeline out of reach,” said Besa Pinchotti, CEO of the National Military Family Association. “The Care for Military Kids Act would ensure that military families can maintain vital Medicaid services regardless of where they are stationed. We thank Senator Blumenthal and Representative Kiggans for leading the way on this important legislation.”

“For Guardsmen, juggling military requirements along with family, civilian careers, and education can be daunting. These bills are excellent steps forward to ease some of those stressors,” said retired Maj Gen. Francis M. McGinn, NGAUS president. “These policies address real issues that military families face on a personal, health, and financial level. I commend Senator Blumenthal and Congresswoman Kiggans for recognizing the unique nuances and for addressing them with continued dedication.”

The Care for Military Kids Act ensures servicemembers can maintain critical healthcare coverage and medical services for their children no matter where their service takes them. After moving to another state, current Medicaid regulations force military families to reapply for their children’s long-term care benefits through Medicaid since Tricare does not provide that benefit. The bill allows military families to remain on their home state’s Medicaid throughout their military career. The Care for Military Kids Act is endorsed by the National Guard Association of the United States (NGAUS), the National Military Families Organization, and Blue Star Families. Bill text is available here.

The Servicemember Healthcare Freedom Act allows members of the Selected Reserve and National Guard holding employment within the federal government the choice between military and civilian healthcare plans. Current federal law prohibits members of the Reserves and Guard who are Federal employees – and eligible for Federal Health Benefits – from participating in the DOD’s Tricare system. The Servicemember Healthcare Freedom Act is endorsed by NGAUS, the Reserve Organization of America (ROA), and the Military Officers Association of America (MOAA). Bill text is available here.

The Bonus Act would make all military recruitment and retention bonuses tax-free. Currently, military bonuses are taxed at the same level as those in the private sector. As a method to improve recruitment and retention, this legislation would eliminate the tax penalty on every eligible bonus. Bill text is available here.

The Coast Guard Parity Act ensures that enlisted Coast Guardsmen with at least 18 but fewer than 20 years of service are retained until they reach 20 years, unless separated for cause or misconduct. All other branches of the Armed Forces provide this protection. Bill text is available here.

Here’s what you need to know about TRICARE health plan options for young adults.

“As your child reaches important milestones like graduation or specific birthdays, they may face changes to their TRICARE health plan eligibility,” explained Debra Fisher, health system specialist, Policy & Programs Branch, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “Understanding these options early helps ensure your adult child can make well-informed decisions about their future health care coverage.”

Coverage before age 21 and during college

Young adults can keep their current TRICARE plan until at least age 21. College students may use their existing plan until they turn 23 or graduate, whichever happens first, as described in the TRICARE Young Adult Program Fact Sheet.

To qualify, they must:

Be a full-time student at an approved institution of higher education

Have a TRICARE sponsor who provides more than 50% of their financial support

If your child attends college, they’ll need to update their student status in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. Additionally, if your child moves away for college, they’ll need to update their address in DEERS. This is especially important if they move to a different TRICARE region or outside a Prime Service Area.

TRICARE Young Adult

TRICARE Young Adult offers health coverage for children who lose TRICARE eligibility due to age. To qualify, they must:

Be an unmarried child of an eligible service member

Be at least 21 but not yet 26 years old

Not qualify for employer-sponsored health plans

Not be eligible for other TRICARE plans

Not be a member of the uniformed services

TYA comes in two options: TYA-Prime and TYA-Select. Which one your child can choose depends on their sponsor’s status and where they live.

TYA has monthly premiums. After premiums, other out-of-pocket costs depend on which option your child chooses, their sponsor’s status, and where they get care.

TYA-Prime

With TYA-Prime, your child will:

Mainly get care from military hospitals and clinics

Need referrals for specialty care

Have lower out-of-pocket costs

TYA-Select

With TYA-Select, your child will:

Choose any TRICARE-authorized provider

Not need referrals for most care

Pay higher out-of-pocket costs than with TYA-Prime

Both TYA options include medical and pharmacy benefits, plus routine eye exams. Neither includes full vision or dental coverage, which can be purchased separately.

When TYA coverage ends

Your child’s TYA coverage will end when any of the following occur:

They turn 26

They get married

They become eligible for an employer-sponsored health plan

They qualify for other TRICARE coverage

They choose to end coverage

If your child ends TYA coverage voluntarily, they can’t purchase it again for 12 months. This lockout doesn’t apply if they gain access to an employer plan or other TRICARE coverage.

Continued Health Care Benefit Program

If your child loses TRICARE eligibility, they may qualify for the Continued Health Care Benefit Program. This premium-based plan offers the same coverage as TRICARE Select for up to 36 months, serving as a bridge to civilian health insurance.

To enroll in CHCBP, your child must apply within 60 days of losing TRICARE eligibility.

Further details can be found at https://onatreatmentcenter.com/tricare-approved-alcohol-rehab-facility/

Alcohol abuse remains a significant issue in the military, with a 2020 study by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) revealing that nearly 27% of active-duty service members reported binge drinking in the past month, far exceeding the general population’s average. This statistic highlights the critical need for accessible, effective treatment options for military personnel, and the qualified staff at Ona Treatment Center work to provide this care.

“We understand the unique challenges that military personnel face and are committed to providing specialized care that addresses both the physical and emotional aspects of alcohol addiction,” said a spokesperson for the center. “Our TRICARE-approved programs are designed to support active-duty service members as they embark on the path to recovery, helping them regain their health and well-being.”

The center’s alcohol rehab services include a variety of treatment options, from medical detoxification and inpatient care to intensive outpatient programs (IOP) and partial hospitalization programs (PHP). All treatments are delivered by a team of trained professionals using proven therapies, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and dual diagnosis treatment, to ensure comprehensive support for service members struggling with alcohol abuse.

TRICARE’s coverage of alcohol rehab programs ensures that service members have access to the support they need to overcome addiction, without the burden of excessive out-of-pocket costs.

In addition to individual therapy, Ona Treatment Center also provides family therapy and support groups to help service members maintain long-term sobriety and rebuild their relationships with loved ones. Support continues after programs have finished, making sure clients have the tools they need for a bright future.

The report, “Hearing Health Surveillance Data Review-Calendar Year 2023,” includes data from DOD personnel in hearing conservation programs across all military departments.

The number of all service members with hearing loss decreased slightly to 12.0% in 2023 compared to 2022, and civilians with hearing loss was 34.7% for the same period. Active duty service members had the lowest rates of hearing loss in 2023 (10.7%) compared to the National Guard (16.2%) and Reserve (15.2%).

For DOD, good hearing is essential for being fit and ready for duty. “Healthy hearing means service members can clearly hear commands or instructions, as well as hear a nearby enemy. Wearing hearing protection that is fitted to each person and their job also keeps their hearing healthy,” said Dr. Theresa Schulz, the center’s hearing loss prevention chief.

Hearing protection fits right when it:

Fits tightly inside or over your ears

Feels comfortable

Blocks out noise

Reducing Hearing Loss

According to Schulz, testing how well a hearing protector fits a person can help reduce hearing loss compared to when the protection doesn’t fit correctly.

The goal is to simplify processes and create standard rules, to make surgeries smoother and improve patient care.

The effort aims to reduce delays, improve communication among surgical teams, and make ORs more efficient. Standardizing processes will also help every patient receive a high level of care, no matter where they’re treated in the Military Health System.

Project Goals

The OR Optimization Project focuses on:

Reducing surgery delays

Improving communication with surgical teams

Standardizing care across the MHS

Solving Common Problems

The OR Optimization Project looks to improve several issues:

Staff Readiness: Standard rules lead to more efficient medical teams who are better prepared to do their jobs.

Cost Savings: Having the right number of staff in operating rooms saves money.

Performance Metrics: Using the same measures for all operating rooms makes it easier to see how they are doing.

“The OR Optimization Project benefits everyone—lower costs for taxpayers, better readiness for the force, and better outcomes for patients,” said Dr. Matthew Mayfield, DHA’s Assistant Director Health Care Administration surgical lead.

Creating Standard Rules

The DHA and surgery experts are writing rules for scheduling surgeries, deciding how many staff members are needed, and measuring how well operating rooms perform.

These rules mix the best ideas from civilian hospitals with the special needs of military surgery, Mayfield said. “The project uses civilian expertise along with military surgery knowledge to create strong, efficient processes across the Defense Health Agency,” he explained.

Training staff is also an important part of this effort. Teams will learn how to follow the new rules and use the tools provided to help them succeed.

Benefits for Patients and Providers

Patients will see fewer delays and cancellations as processes improve. For medical staff, the changes will mean clearer steps to follow, better teamwork, and less paperwork. “Our teams are dedicated to making things better and providing safe and efficient surgical care,” said U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr. Aaron Johnson, department head of the main operating room at Naval Medical Center San Diego.

What’s Next

The OR Optimization Project is rolling out in steps so facilities can adjust gradually. Feedback from staff and patients will help improve the processes. “This teamwork is about building a better system for everyone,” said Johnson. “By working together, we’re laying the foundation for long-term success in surgical care.”

“How close am I to being memorialized?”

Yet above the whirring of medical equipment around him, the beeps of his heart rate, and the sympathetic, soft voices of the doctors telling him that they had to amputate his leg to save his life—a second thought emerged:

“I’m not going to quit.”

Days earlier, Gadson had been on a routine patrol in Baghdad, Iraq. He was thrown from his vehicle after it was struck by an improvised explosive device. Gadson was in critical condition, his legs and arm severely damaged from the attack.

“All I knew how to do was push back, even in this fog and moment of uncertainty, not knowing what to expect.”

What Gadson didn’t know at the time was that his story of resilience would define his life’s work moving forward. He would remain on active duty, promoted to the rank of colonel, take command of one of the largest U.S. Army installations in the world, and serve 26 years in the U.S. Army. In retirement, Gadson would become a motivational speaker, sharing his story of how he recovered, rebuilt, and persevered in the years following his injuries. His compelling message would inspire crowds at events and conferences even in front of thousands of military health professionals at the 2024 Military Health System Research Symposium. Gadson would highlight the importance of medical training, and how the character of the military medical experts involved in his care, were instrumental in saving his life.

He would discuss his journey with NFL teams who went onto victory, with cadets looking upon their next chapter of life, with Department of Defense staff about hiring those with disabilities. He would share his story as encouragement to carry on, to spark hope to those fighting for recovery, and to tell others to “be the best you can today … and moving forward, really embrace health,” said Gadson.

A football star in his youth, Gadson followed his dream of becoming a professional football player—all the way to U.S. Military Academy at West Point.

“That was the most important thing, in the back of my mind, to have a pro-football career,” Gadson said. “You might say I went there with a bit of a chip on my shoulder, because I wanted to prove that I could play at the highest level.”

While football and good grades may have brought him to school, it was the mindset of the military that truly became his passion.

Sports served as “a tremendous sort of development and building block. In my maturing as an athlete that, in a lot of ways, I took that into being a soldier. We have a five-year service obligation after attending the academy and I thought I would transition out and try to find my way back into football. But I fell in love with being a soldier and I just decided to keep going.”

Gadson rose through the ranks as a field artillery officer and through the guidance of “strong noncommissioned officers that I say raised me right, raised me to understand how to care, to hold us to task and to living up to standards,” that allowed him to lead soldiers.

“What kept me in was really the sense of being on a team, the sense of being part of something greater than myself, which was, ironically, very similar to being on a football team,” he said. “One of the common bonds between team sports and in our military, what we do is the sense of commitment. And I say all the time that commitment's blind it's without condition.”

As he excelled in his military career, Gadson’s West Point football teammate was also striving for success—Paul Pasquina, who was studying medicine. Their journeys would connect later in ways neither of them would have predicted.

Gadson went on to serve in Operations Desert Shield/Storm in Kuwait, Operation Joint Forge in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, and Operation Iraqi Freedom, where that one night would change his life forever.

May 7, 2007

Gadson’s battalion was returning from a memorial service in Iraq. As the patrol neared the base, it was struck by an IED.

A 19-year-old private—who had just completed a two-week medic training course—rushed to his side to treat his injuries. Before their deployment, the private had trained with his platoon, and Gadson personally had him “pulled up to be a medic because I was the senior guy in the organization. I didn’t want to break up all the teamwork that they had built for deployment.”

His senior leader intuition about the young private proved right.

“The doctors gave this young man credit for saving my life by how well he put the tourniquets on my legs,” Gadson said. “My soldiers had my life in their hands.”

After he was evacuated off the battlefield and rushed into triage, Gadson, ever the charismatic leader, found a moment of humor amid the chaos.

“They got me (triaging) in the medical clinic on the base, and they're trying to get the bleeding stopped … there’s a nurse who’s trying to get my glove off of me. I look up at him and said, ‘How are you going to save my life if you can’t get my glove off?’”

He quickly lost consciousness and was rushed to the hospital, where Gadson would go through “129 pints of blood and go into (cardiac) arrest six times … but the doctors didn't give up on me and they kept fighting for me.”

Gadson stabilized in a combat support hospital in the Green Zone, then was flown to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Germany, and Joint Base Andrews, and finally onto Walter Reed Army Medical Center, now part of the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

A sense of familiarity came to Gadson as a member of his care team: Pasquina, now a U.S. Army colonel and doctor, recognized his former teammate.

Fate aside, his health care team had to give him the grim news about what they needed to do to save his life.

“I required surgery every other day to repair my blood vessels and clean up my wounds,” he said. “A week after arriving at Walter Reed, the doctors had to take my left leg to save my life. The blood vessels could no longer sustain blood flow, so they amputated my left leg above the knee. Ultimately, I would make the decision for them to take my right leg, because it was a not going to function as it was intended.”

He also had limited use of his right arm, learning that “my upper bicep and elbow were broken as well. That would require some surgery. And unfortunately, I had some complications from that surgery.”

Gadson also developed heterotopic ossification at the end of his legs, a condition where bone tissue forms abnormally in soft tissues outside of the skeletal system.

He said it was “one of my lowest moments because I was down to one limb. My nondominant left arm and hand was really all I had to use for all my activities of daily life. I needed someone to help me.”

Family and Seeking Support

That someone to help him was his wife. They had met as classmates at West Point, married, and had children before the attack. It was her “unconditional love” that “underwrote my recovery,” he said. “I didn't have to worry about her leaving me or my family, not wanting to be around me, wanting to shun me because I was way different. No family ever asks for this, and we certainly didn't. But she stepped up and led our family, my kids, through this.”

As Gadson adjusted to his new way of life and coped with the emotional and physical trauma of his injuries, his wife urged him to seek mental health support.

“I didn't want professional mental health, but she said, ‘We’re all going through this; you got to get some help.’”

Gadson sought his care team at Walter Reed. He started to receive mental health support for his injuries. He never lost sight of his primary goal—to continue to serve.

“I wasn't going to let myself be defined by these injuries. I was going to be defined by what I was willing to do. And so I fought to continue to stay on active duty, which ultimately was approved.”

He remained on active duty in the U.S. Army for seven years after the IED attack, eventually becoming garrison commander of Fort Belvoir, Virginia, where he oversaw the daily operations for more than 140 commands and agencies for the Department of Defense. He also sought treatment from the Soldier Recovery Unit at Walter Reed—participating in unique therapies, including “elements of adaptive reconditioning,” such as riding horses, cycling, and skiing—all tailored for his healing experience.

“I thought they were absolutely brilliant because my mission was to heal,” he said. “You don't need to feel bad about being there … you need to take advantage of it because you can grow. When you struggle in life, that's when we grow.”

‘Angels’ in Recovery

When Gadson retired from the military, he realized that he had a story “people wanted to hear,” he said. As military leaders, “we have a moral obligation, a responsibility to share our life experiences. The good, the bad, the ugly. And that's strength.”

In his motivational career, he has spoken with service members in recovery, co-wrote a book, titled, “Finding Waypoints: A Warrior’s Journey Towards Peace and Purpose,” and even gave inspirational speeches to the NFL New York Giants football team, merging his passion for sports with his unprecedented story of resilience.

Aside from his own determination, grit, and strive for excellence, Gadson references his MHS care team for his successes.

“That's how I describe this network of angels in my care, everything literally was perfect, right?” Gadson said. “I'm not supposed to be here, and I'm here.”

He encourages people to think about Memorial Day as inspiration to carry on.

“My motivation is to live my best life for those who didn't make it home,” he said. “I have to make their sacrifice worth it. And the only way I make their sacrifice worth it is to make the most of my life.”

Trump DoD Nominee: “Dental health issues are often the largest cause of non-deployability within a military unit.”

“Medical readiness of Reserve and National Guard personnel is an ongoing challenge, and this could be exacerbated by the decision to remove fluoride from community drinking water.”

Text of Letter (PDF)

Washington, D.C. — U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass), ranking member of the Personnel subcommittee for the Senate Armed Services Committee, pressed Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on the harmful impact that Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kennedy’s work to remove fluoride from drinking water would have on our military readiness.

“As the Secretary of Defense, you are responsible for ensuring the readiness of American troops to maintain a capable and lethal military.” wrote Senator Warren. “Dental readiness is consistently falling short of the Military Health System (MHS) readiness goals, and will further suffer as a direct result of Secretary Kennedy’s plans.”

In 2011, the Department of Defense found that “dental decay continues to be a major problem for military personnel and is a significant reason for personnel to be classified as non-deployable.” Sean O’Keefe, the Trump administration’s nominee to be Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, recently indicated to Sen.Warren in questions for the record following his confirmation hearing that, “dental health issues are often the largest cause of non-deployability within a military unit.”

“Secretary Kennedy’s reversal of CDC’s recommendations on fluoridated water will exacerbate these readiness concerns.” wrote Senator Warren.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends community water fluoridation to prevent cavities and tooth decay. However, on April 8, 2025, Secretary Kennedy announced his plans to direct the CDC to stop recommending the fluoridation of drinking water in American communities.

In 2013, the Department of Defense mandated water fluoridation at “all [military] installations in the United States and territories that own or operate a potable water treatment facility serving 3,300 persons or more.” While this safeguard is beneficial for the military personnel that live on military installations, the majority of servicemembers live in civilian communities and would be directly affected by Secretary Kennedy’s work to undermine community water fluoridation.

Senator Warren’s letter requests information related to dental readiness and to compliance with the Department of Defense mandate to fluoridate water on military installations. In order to ensure the Department of Defense continues to prioritize military readiness, Senator Warren requested additional information from the Department by June 5, 2025.

Senator Warren has led work to improve servicemembers’ access to health care:

In December 2024, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) sent a letter to Acting Under Secretary Vazirani raising continued concerns about the Department of Defense’s (DoD) failure to prevent price gouging and overpayments in the military’s TRICARE health program.

In June 2024, Senators Elizabeth Warren, Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), U.S. Representative Buddy Carter (R-Ga.), and 20 other lawmakers sent a letter to Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Dr. Lester Martinez-Lopez and Director of the Defense Health Agency (DHA) Lieutenant General Telita Crosland, raising concerns over Express Scripts’ exclusive contract to administer TRICARE’s pharmacy program, the healthcare system for the military, retirees, and their families.

In July 2023, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren chaired a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Personnel. She called out the Department of Defense (DoD) for wasting billions in taxpayers dollars due to price gouging by defense contractors for services and in health care, and identified opportunities for cost savings when DoD buys personnel-related goods and services.

In July 2023, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III and Director of the Defense Health Agency (DHA), Lieutenant General Telita Crosland, regarding a series of DoD Inspector General (IG) reports finding that the Department of Defense (DoD) is failing to prevent price gouging and overpayments to contractors in the TRICARE health program.

On March 2, 2022, Senator Warren and her colleagues called out drug manufacturers for squeezing American families with rapid and widespread price hikes on prescription drugs.

In February 2022, at a hearing, Senator Warren called out corporations for abusing their market power to raise consumer prices and boost profits.

In May 2020, Senator Warren wrote to the Department requesting clarification on how the Department would prevent profiteering following a recent change to increase payments to contractors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In March 2020, Senator Warren joined her colleagues in urging the FTC to use its full authority to prevent abusive price gouging on consumer health products during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The report, “Hearing Health Surveillance Data Review-Calendar Year 2023,” includes data from DOD personnel in hearing conservation programs across all military departments.

The number of all service members with hearing loss decreased slightly to 12.0% in 2023 compared to 2022, and civilians with hearing loss was 34.7% for the same period. Active duty service members had the lowest rates of hearing loss in 2023 (10.7%) compared to the National Guard (16.2%) and Reserve (15.2%).

For DOD, good hearing is essential for being fit and ready for duty.

“Healthy hearing means service members can clearly hear commands or instructions, as well as hear a nearby enemy. Wearing hearing protection that is fitted to each person and their job also keeps their hearing healthy,” said Dr. Theresa Schulz, the center’s hearing loss prevention chief.

Hearing protection fits right when it:

• Fits tightly inside or over your ears

• Feels comfortable

• Blocks out noise

Reducing Hearing Loss

According to Schulz, testing how well a hearing protector fits a person can help reduce hearing loss compared to when the protection doesn’t fit correctly.

Apart from barracks, the quality-of-life funding in the bill includes $2 billion for defense health programs, which have faced shortages in recent years.
""President Trump's One, Big, Beautiful Bill is great for our veterans and military families,"" Kelly, the White House spokesperson, added in a statement Thursday.
Related: Republicans Unveil Pentagon Portion of Trump's 'Big, Beautiful Bill' with Extra Money for Barracks Story Continues","A plan to inject $8.5 billion into military quality-of-life initiatives overcame a key hurdle early Thursday morning as House Republicans narrowly approved a sweeping bill to enact President Donald Trump's legislative agenda.

The quality-of-life funding is part of $150 billion for the Defense Department that Republicans included in what they are officially calling the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a wide-ranging legislative package that touches everything from taxes to health care to border policy.

The Pentagon funding could provide a much-needed boost to barracks maintenance, military health care and other areas that directly affect the well-being of service members. But military and veterans advocates have expressed concerns about other aspects of the bill, particularly cuts to a federal food benefits program and the repeal of a rule that restrains for-profit colleges from targeting veterans.

The bill must still pass the Senate, where there will almost certainly be further changes to win over some Republicans skeptical about various aspects, including the food assistance cuts. But the House passage -- which came in a party-line 215-214 vote at about 6 a.m. Thursday -- is a key milestone in the process.

""Without this generational investment in national defense, we will no longer be able to deter our adversaries or ensure America's global leadership,"" House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., said in a statement after the vote. ""The One Big Beautiful Bill provides long overdue resources to modernize our military, revitalize the defense industrial base and improve the quality of life for our service members.""

The two biggest pots of Pentagon funding in the bill are $34 billion for shipbuilding and $25 billion for the Golden Dome, which is Trump's proposal for a space-based missile defense shield over the U.S.

Of the $8.5 billion that would go toward military quality-of-life issues, $1.3 billion is devoted to barracks maintenance and restoration across the military services.

The military has faced years of problems with squalid living conditions for its most junior troops, and military officials have often blamed persistent underfunding of housing for the issue.

In addition to the barracks funding, the bill would also provide temporary authorization for more widespread barracks privatization, an idea that has gained steam in recent years as the services have struggled with maintenance backlogs.

A recent analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, estimated that the two barracks privatization-related provisions in the bill could increase government spending by about $2 billion over 10 years.

Apart from barracks, the quality-of-life funding in the bill includes $2 billion for defense health programs, which have faced shortages in recent years. There is also $2.9 billion for Basic Allowance for Housing payments, $50 million for special pay and bonuses, $100 million for child-care fee assistance for service members, and $10 million for military spouse professional licensure fee assistance.

Elsewhere in the bill, a food assistance program that many military families rely on is facing steep cuts.

Under the bill, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which is often referred to as food stamps, would receive less federal funding, and states would be required to make up the difference.

Anti-hunger and military families advocates, as well as governors and other state officials across the country, have been warning that states will not be able to handle the extra budget burden and will need to cut benefits, restrict eligibility or, in the worst-case scenario, stop offering SNAP in the state altogether. Since military families are among SNAP beneficiaries, they would undoubtedly be swept up in the cuts, advocates say.

The White House is pushing back on the idea that military families would be affected by the SNAP cuts.

""President Trump is strengthening SNAP for Americans who need it -- especially military families -- to ensure these programs are sustainable for future generations,"" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement Tuesday.

Senate Republicans have reacted tepidly to the state cost-sharing plan for SNAP. In a statement last week, Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman John Boozman, R-Ark., said the Senate ""will carefully consider the House's approach,"" while stopping short of endorsing it.

Republicans are using a process known as reconciliation that will allow them to pass the bill in the Senate with a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes needed for most legislation. That means they won't need any Democratic votes, but they will still have to overcome any intra-party disputes.

Veterans organizations are also hoping senators will make changes to the education policy portion of the bill. In particular, they are sounding the alarm about the fact the bill would repeal what's known as the 90/10 rule, which limits how much of a for-profit school's revenue can come from federal student aid.

A loophole in the rule that allowed shady for-profit schools to take advantage of veterans' GI Bill benefits was closed in 2023. But advocates are warning that repealing the rule altogether could lead to for-profit schools once again scamming veterans out of their education benefits.

Republicans have argued the rule unfairly targets for-profit colleges and that repealing it would expand educational opportunities by treating all types of schools the same.

""President Trump's One, Big, Beautiful Bill is great for our veterans and military families,"" Kelly, the White House spokesperson, added in a statement Thursday. ""By delivering the largest tax cut for middle and working-class Americans in history, ensuring greater educational choices for veterans and strengthening SNAP, this president is dedicated to delivering on his campaign promises and ensuring our men and women in uniform have the support they need.""

A CBO estimate released last week said that repealing the 90/10 rule could increase federal spending by $1.6 billion, including increasing veterans education benefits costs by about $25 million.

Since Senate Republicans were instrumental in the bipartisan deal that closed the loophole in the 90/10 rule, veterans advocates are leaning on them now to keep the rule alive.

""This cannot and should not be allowed to be included in the final bill, and IAVA and the veterans you see here today will fight tooth and nail to make sure it does not happen,"" Allison Jaslow, CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said at a news conference last week. ""I can tell you that there are members of the majority in the Senate who are watching this closely and aren't liking what they're seeing. They're just not saying so publicly yet.""

If you or a loved one is struggling with substance use or mental health issues, and you’re enrolled in TRICARE East, you may be eligible for comprehensive, veteran-centered treatment at our facility. Our admissions team is experienced in working with military insurance and can help you navigate the process—from verifying coverage to coordinating care.

What Is TRICARE East?

TRICARE East is one of two regional TRICARE programs that provide health coverage to eligible active-duty service members, National Guard and Reserve members, military retirees, and their families. Administered by Humana Military, TRICARE East covers a large portion of the eastern and southeastern United States. It offers access to a broad network of civilian healthcare providers who meet Department of Defense standards.

As a TRICARE Prime plan, TRICARE East is known for its robust behavioral health coverage, making it a strong option for those seeking support for substance use disorders, mental health conditions, or dual diagnosis treatment. Many of the services offered at Sober First Recovery fall within TRICARE East rehab coverage and are approved when deemed medically necessary.

Behavioral health benefits under TRICARE East include:

Inpatient detox and rehabilitation programs

Partial hospitalization programs (PHP)

Intensive outpatient programs (IOP)

Medication-assisted treatment (MAT)

Psychiatric evaluations and medication management

Trauma therapy for PTSD and co-occurring conditions

Individual, group, and family therapy

Veteran Addiction Treatment Through TRICARE East

Veterans face unique challenges that can make substance use and mental health issues more complex. Prolonged stress, trauma, moral injury, and difficulty reintegrating into civilian life often contribute to substance use disorders. TRICARE East substance use benefits help ensure that military members and their families can access care tailored to these challenges.

At Sober First Recovery, we provide trauma-informed, evidence-based care that addresses both the physical and emotional aspects of addiction. Our team understands military culture and the demands of service, and we are committed to treating each client with compassion, respect, and clinical excellence.

What Addiction and Mental Health Services Are Covered?

Sober First Recovery offers a complete continuum of care, much of which is covered by TRICARE East depending on the individual’s clinical needs and benefit eligibility:

Medical Detox Coordination

While Sober First does not directly provide detox services, we refer clients to in-network, TRICARE-approved facilities that offer 24/7 medical supervision during withdrawal. We coordinate your care from start to finish to ensure a safe transition into treatment.

Residential Treatment Program (RTC)

Our residential program provides immersive, 24/7 care in a supportive and structured environment. Veterans in RTC receive daily individual and group therapy, medication management, and holistic services such as mindfulness, fitness, and peer support. TRICARE East rehab coverage typically includes residential services when deemed medically necessary.

Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP)

PHP is an ideal step-down from RTC or a higher level of outpatient care for veterans who still need daily structure and intensive support. Our PHP includes multiple therapy sessions each day, access to medication management, and individualized treatment planning.

Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP)

For veterans who need flexibility while maintaining recovery progress, IOP provides structured therapy several times per week. TRICARE East IOP benefits help veterans transition into daily life while continuing to receive high-quality care.

Outpatient and Aftercare Services

We believe recovery doesn’t end with discharge. Our outpatient therapy and aftercare services include weekly sessions, peer group involvement, relapse prevention planning, and alumni support. TRICARE East typically covers ongoing outpatient care as part of long-term recovery planning.

Virtual Therapy and Telehealth Services

For those unable to attend in-person sessions, our HIPAA-compliant virtual care platform makes it easy to access therapy from anywhere in the TRICARE East region. Veterans in rural or underserved areas can receive the same high-quality care from the comfort and privacy of their home.

Dual Diagnosis and Mental Health Support

Many veterans live with co-occurring disorders—conditions where substance use and mental health issues like PTSD, depression, or anxiety exist simultaneously. TRICARE East mental health coverage ensures that these underlying issues can be addressed alongside addiction treatment.

Sober First Recovery specializes in dual diagnosis care that integrates trauma therapy, medication management, and therapeutic support into every level of treatment. Veterans deserve care that treats the whole person—not just the symptoms.

DEFENDER 25 is a major annual U.S. Army exercise, involving approximately 12,000 U.S. servicemembers and 13,000 troops from 29 partner nations.

The exercise underscores the Department of Defense’s commitment to bolstering Warfighter lethality and combatant command readiness across Europe.

During Swift Response, the initial phase of DEFENDER 25, OPMED’s Force Health Protection, or FHP, team provided essential support and expertise to U.S. Army medical providers assigned to the 512th Field Hospital, 519th Hospital Center, 68th Theater Medical Command and 30th Medical Brigade; and 173rd Airborne Brigade.

FHP plays a critical role in bridging medical gaps by providing investigational medical products, which are authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration, to the joint force. This occurs when no FDA-approved solution is available or feasible to meet operational requirements, according to U.S. Army Col. Chuck Bane, director of FHP. His team works with combatant commands and regulatory experts across the globe to make lifesaving treatments available to Warfighters when there is an urgent need.

DEFENDER 25 is a chance for FHP to exercise and validate their regulatory oversight processes and learn from frontline medical providers. The knowledge gained will assist the Operational Medical Systems Program Management Office in developing the next generation of medical treatment capabilities for the U.S. joint force.

""DEFENDER 25 provided a critical opportunity to assess our capabilities in a complex, multinational environment,"" said Bane, an Army veterinarian by trade. ""Our team focused on ensuring our partners with the 512th Field Hospital have the tools and knowledge necessary to protect the force while adhering to regulatory policies, even in the most challenging scenarios.""

The 512th Field Hospital, based at Kaiserslautern, Germany as part of 519th Hospital Center, established far-forward medical facilities in support of DEFENDER 25 at Vepriai Rocket Base. Part of the DEFENDER 2025 Hospital Exercise included the strategic deployment of prophylactic drug treatments that are designed to counter potential airborne biological weapon threats against U.S. joint forces operating in challenging and remote locations.

In partnership with the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense Enabling Biotechnologies, JPEO-CBRND-EB — which manages the Rapid Access to Products in Development, RAPID, program — FHP assessed the 512th Field Hospital’s capability to adhere to regulatory requirements for transporting, storing and administering a simulated investigational pre-exposure treatment made available under an investigational new drug expanded access protocol in forward operational areas.

Under a concept of operations created by the JPEO-CBRND-EB RAPID team, a notional treatment was pre-staged in Germany in the weeks leading up to DEFENDER 25 through collaboration and logistical planning between FHP, JPEO-CBRND, the U.S. Army Medical Materiel Distribution Operations Center, and the U.S. Army Medical Materiel Center-Europe. During DEFENDER 2025, the FHP team worked with medics and medical officers on the ground at Vepriai Rocket Base to ensure all EAP use guidelines were followed, according to Chris Weselek, a product manager with FHP and a retired U.S. Army combat medic.

""Our priority is to equip our medical personnel with the confidence and understanding to safely and effectively utilize investigational medical countermeasures when standard options are unavailable,"" said Weselek. ""This collaboration with the RAPID team at DEFENDER 25 highlights the capability that the RAPID program will bring to the table while allowing us to validate our training and oversight processes in a realistic operational setting.""",https://api.army.mil/e2/c/images/2025/05/23/0893ad4b/max1200.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-23 10:56:23.391014

Our Residential Treatment Program isn’t simply a place to stay.","Finding real healing after military service is not easy. At Sober First Recovery, our Residential Treatment Program (RTC) was built specifically for veterans, offering care that truly respects their experiences and challenges. Here, recovery is not treated as a concept to talk about. It is something we work toward every day through consistency, safety, and real connection.

Veterans who come here find steady support, trauma-informed care, and a community that understands what they have been through. It is a place to step away from daily pressures, confront what has been weighing them down, and start rebuilding a life with real meaning.

What is Residential Treatment and Why Does it Matter?

The path to recovery often isn’t a straight line. Veterans may have tried outpatient programs, therapy, or medication before without feeling real progress. That’s because some wounds—especially those tied to trauma, moral injury, and addiction—require deeper intervention.

Residential treatment, or inpatient rehab, offers an immersive environment where veterans can step away from the demands and noise of everyday life. It’s a space where healing becomes the primary focus. Veterans stay onsite, work closely with medical teams, engage in structured therapy, and connect with peers who share a common bond.

Unlike outpatient care, where daily life pressures can interfere, RTC provides the protected environment needed to break destructive cycles and build new, healthier ones.

The Continuum of Care: Finding Your Starting Point

Addiction treatment flows through different levels of care, each building on the last. Residential treatment typically sits at the midpoint of the recovery spectrum:

Many veterans begin with Medical Detox to safely manage withdrawal symptoms.

After detox, Residential Treatment offers a fully immersive healing experience.

Once stability grows, veterans may transition to a Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP) or Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) for continued support while gaining more independence.

Every level plays a role, and residential care is often the bridge that turns hope into reality.

What Makes Our Veteran Residential Treatment Different?

Trauma-Informed, Veteran-Centric Care

At Sober First Recovery, we acknowledge military service and build our program around it. Our clinical team understands the impact of combat stress, the weight of moral injuries, and the unique challenges veterans face after returning home.

Therapy sessions are designed with respect for those experiences. We explore trauma without judgment. We recognize the resilience veterans carry while helping them face the pain that may linger below the surface.

Structure Without Rigidity

Daily schedules are thoughtfully crafted. From therapy groups to recreational activities, every part of the day is planned to support emotional, physical, and psychological well-being. Yet we balance structure with humanity. Veterans are encouraged to engage fully and treated as individuals, not cogs in a system.

24/7 Access to Support

Healing doesn’t always happen neatly between the hours of 9 to 5. Crises, doubts, and emotional breakthroughs often come at unexpected times. That’s why around-the-clock care matters. Our clinical and medical staff are present day and night, providing support whenever it’s needed, whether for a sleepless night, an overwhelming memory, or simply a need for connection.

Inside the Residential Program

One-on-One Therapy

Each veteran’s path into addiction and mental health struggles is personal. In individual therapy sessions, our clinicians work closely with veterans to explore those personal narratives—unpacking trauma, grief, shame, and resilience at a pace that feels manageable but meaningful.

Evidence-based therapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) provide frameworks for real change. No one is asked to “just move on.” Instead, veterans are given the tools to process and integrate painful experiences in ways that free them rather than chain them.

Group Therapy

Isolation feeds addiction. Connection fights it. Group therapy sessions create space for veterans to find common ground, challenge distorted thinking, and build relationships rooted in mutual respect and understanding.

Veteran-specific groups tackle topics like reintegration into civilian life, managing trauma triggers, dealing with grief, and rebuilding purpose beyond service. Hearing “I get it” from someone who truly does can be the catalyst for real progress.

Physical Wellness

Healing isn’t confined to therapy rooms. At Sober First Recovery, physical wellness activities are interwoven into the treatment experience. Through structured fitness sessions, mindfulness practices, or recreational outings, movement supports the body and mind. Physical strength and emotional resilience often grow together.

Creative Expression and Mindfulness

Words aren’t always enough. Some wounds live beneath the surface of language. Through art therapy, writing exercises, and mindfulness practices, veterans can access those deeper layers. Expression becomes a doorway to parts of the self that have long been locked away—and often, it’s in those moments that the deepest healing begins.

Who Should Consider Residential Treatment?

Residential treatment isn’t just for the most “severe” cases. It’s for anyone who needs intensive, immersive support to truly turn a corner in recovery. Veterans who may benefit include:

Those struggling with moderate to severe substance use disorders.

Individuals facing co-occurring conditions like PTSD, depression, or anxiety.

Veterans who have attempted outpatient treatment without sustained success.

Those whose home environments trigger relapse or emotional distress.

Individuals who require medical monitoring during early recovery stages.

The decision to enter residential care is not an admission of weakness—it’s a commitment to life.

Planning for the Next Step

Our commitment to veterans doesn’t end when they leave residential treatment. Discharge planning is a critical part of the process, beginning early and evolving as each veteran’s goals become clearer.

We help veterans transition smoothly into the next phase of care, whether that’s PHP, IOP, sober living, or a return home with strong outpatient support. Relapse prevention strategies are woven into every stage, helping veterans anticipate challenges and build defenses against them.

Aftercare planning also connects veterans with community support, veteran-focused organizations, and alumni networks—giving them a wider net of support as they reenter the flow of life outside treatment.

Insurance, VA Benefits, and Getting Started

Worries about logistics shouldn’t delay healing. Our admissions team is ready to help veterans and their families understand insurance coverage, explore VA benefits, and remove as many barriers as possible. Many private insurance plans and VA programs can cover part or all of residential treatment. Assistance with verifying benefits and understanding options is available from the very first call.

Start Healing at Sober First Recovery

There’s no perfect moment to seek help. Recovery begins in small, courageous steps, and at Sober First Recovery, we walk alongside every veteran who decides to take those steps.

Our Residential Treatment Program isn’t simply a place to stay. It’s a place to build a life worth living.

“We were told that our children are not suitable solely based on their vaccination status,” Johnson told Fox News Digital.
Peru doesn’t require vaccines, and Navy policy doesn’t either,” Johnson said.
No officer has ever called us from Navy Medical.
“Vaccination status is no one’s business, especially for dependents.","​

Amanda Johnson, a Marine spouse and homeschooling mother of five with a set of twins and a newborn is speaking out after months of what she calls stonewalling by the U.S. military medical establishment.

Her family’s upcoming move abroad has been put on hold because their children have not received all the recommended vaccinations despite the Navy’s policy stating they’re not required. The Marine Corps is interdependent with the Navy for logistical support and medical services through Navy Medical, a sister service in the military.

In an Instagram post by Johnson to her nearly 15,000 followers, one popular commentator summarized the family’s situation, writing, “The dark irony of military families being stripped of their freedoms in exchange for their father’s sacrifice protecting American freedoms… shameful.”

REP. SARA JACOBS: MILITARY FAMILIES DESERVE IVF COVERAGE AND TRUMP’S SUPPORT

That post has gone viral among military communities, drawing attention from other spouses, advocacy groups and even congressional offices.

“We were told that our children are not suitable solely based on their vaccination status,” Johnson told Fox News Digital. “Even after my husband sent a prevention letter explaining our health plan overseas, they still denied us.”

Official Navy policy under BUMEDINST 1300.2B is clear: “Family members are not required to be immunized.”

Similarly, TRICARE, healthcare for uniformed service members, explicitly states that “vaccination status is not reviewed as part of the TRICARE overseas enrollment screening process.” And the Johnsons’ destination, Peru, does not require any vaccinations for entry or residence.

“We’re not breaking any rules. Peru doesn’t require vaccines, and Navy policy doesn’t either,” Johnson said. “We’ve done everything right, but, still, we’re stuck.

“My husband’s chain of command supports us and keeps asking, ‘Who do we need to call?’ But there’s no one. No officer has ever called us from Navy Medical. We haven’t worked with a single point of contact on our case.”

Marine Capt. Hunter Johnson, Amanda’s husband, wrote a detailed prevention and medical readiness letter to Navy Medical Jacksonville, outlining the measures his family takes to maintain their children’s health.

“Our children have not been, and will not be, enrolled in childcare. My wife is fully devoted to their daily care,” he wrote. “We homeschool using Time4Learning and limit exposure to institutional illness risks.

“Peru has no vaccination requirements… My continued presence is essential to our family’s stability. This is not a deployment, it’s a PCS [permanent change of station].”

Despite that, Amanda Johnson says Navy Medical Jacksonville denied the package and falsely claimed last month it had been sent to Naval Medical Atlantic Region for final review.

The stress has deeply affected their family. Johnson shared that her husband delayed his paternity leave to avoid being recycled through his language course.

“He went back to work five days after I had our fifth baby. Now, during his leave, instead of relaxing, he’s chasing paperwork and dealing with this nightmare,” she said.

They’ve already secured housing in Peru and booked an Airbnb near Los Angeles International Airport as they prepare for their flight.

“They told us, ‘You can push out your orders,’ but that’s absolutely not an option. We’re not going to be punished because Navy can’t get it together,” she said.

The family filed a congressional inquiry through the office of Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. Johnson also confirmed that the office of Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, reached out after seeing her story on Instagram.

“My husband had a phone call with them and explained everything. I’m not from Texas, but they saw the post and wanted to help,” she said. “It’s a big, big mess.”

Johnson said she isn’t just asking for her own family to be cleared. She wants reform.

“I want whoever denied our package to be held accountable. There should be consequences. The policy is clear, and they’re ignoring it,” she said. “No doctor in the Navy should be allowed to declare a child unsuitable for travel just because of their vaccine status. That needs to end.”

She said she hopes her story sparks wider change.

“Vaccination status is no one’s business, especially for dependents. I hope the Navy stops asking altogether unless the host country requires it. We’re being punished for nothing.”

New Indo-German JV to both offer select powertrain technologies that meet Bharat Stage VI norms and cater to passenger car, commercial vehicle and two-wheeler OEMs. Mayank Dhingra reports.

As businesses around the world put an increased amount of effort to drive sustainability and eco-friendliness, the automotive industry, which is one of the key pillars of the global economic framework, is accelerating innovation and adoption of clean mobility solutions for a greener tomorrow. While it has been a highly debatable subject so far, electric mobility does seem to be the pinnacle of a zero-tailpipe-emissions transportation world, with the journey to implement advanced technologies.

While the new JV company will see a standalone manufacturing facility, it will only get set up over the period of the next 12 months at an acquired land parcel in Gurgaon. In the meanwhile, however, the supplies will commence by leveraging the existing operations of both the partners.

According to Prakash Bhalekar, president and CEO, Padmini VNA Mechatronics, and director, PV Clean Mobility Technologies, “Vitesco has been our customer for a long time and we had an existing business relationship with them. We thought we could do a lot more by doing a strategic partnership.”

The supplies of fuel delivery modules and sensors would initially be taken care by Vitesco Technologies, while Padmini VNA Mechatronics will provide throttle bodies, intake and exhaust actuators

BS VI emission norms, which have come into force since April 2020, are bound to create huge demand for locally developed powertrain solutions which the Indo-German JV is banking on.

PV CLEAN MOBILITY TECHNOLOGIES is Driven by Purpose of Innovating for a Sustainable automotive future, Localising Global Technologies for Selfreliance, Prioritise Quality, and Deliver cost-effective solutions for clean and efficient propuksion in the subcontinent

Gurugram, India-based PV Clean Mobility Technologies is a joint venture, between India-based leading manufacturer of advanced auto components for the automobile industry — Padmini VNA Mechatronics and international supplier for modern drive technologies for sustainnable mobility — Germany-based Vitesco Technologies.

The company says the joint venture was formed in 2020 with a commitment to deliver world-class technical solutions to customers in India and globally. Ananda Reddy, CEO, PV Clean Mobility Technologies shares his thoughts on how the company’s state-of-the-art technical capabilities can help deliver world-class quality, best-in-class customised products for electric, hybrid, and combustion engines for discerning customers.

PV Clean Mobility’s core product area has been ICE powertrains. How do you plan to mitigate impact from new technologies like EVs and fuel-cell vehicles? What are the plans to foray in these segments?

PV Clean Mobility Technologies’ portfolio for ICE solutions has been dominating the overall share of business, Fuel Delivery Modules contributes a significant share to our overall revenue and this business is still growing for us. However, our efforts have always been to focus on new technology development and upgradation to sustain the business growth. We are investing in products like Electric Actuator, Electronic Throttle Control Valve, Low Pressure EGR Valve and a few others.

What solutions are you offering for EVs?

We have developed new solutions for Hybrids and Electric Vehicles like Electric Water Pump and Coolant Flow Control Valves and Temperature Sensors. We are offering advanced technology solutions at highly competitive quality and cost. We have already partnered with a few OEMs for smart Thermal Management solutions for the Battery and Traction cooling systems. I personally see a huge potential of growth for the Thermal Management solutions in Hybrids and EVs. Also, we are in advanced development for alternative fuels for future powertrain technologies. So, I would say the pie is already shared among these segments and the business will grow with the market adaptation of these powertrain technologies

He would administer “unnecessary treatments” and order “unnecessary testing” on the patients, according to the Justice Department.

Dr. Jorge Zamora-Quezada, 68, was sentenced to 10 years in prison and ordered to repay over $28 million, including 13 real estate properties, a jet and a Maserati, according to a May 21 news release from the U.S. Department of Justice.

McClatchy News reached out to Zamora-Quezada’s attorney for comment May 22 but did not immediately hear back.

The Justice Department said Zamora-Quezada lived a luxurious life and lied to patients so he could receive payments from insurance companies.

Zamora-Quezada defrauded Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and Blue Cross Blue Shield by falsely diagnosing his patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the Justice Department said.

He then gave the patients “toxic medications,” according to federal officials.

Zamora-Quezada made patients believe they had “a life-long, incurable condition that required regular treatment at his offices,” the Justice Department said.

He would administer “unnecessary treatments” and order “unnecessary testing” on the patients, according to the Justice Department. This included different “injections, infusions, x-rays, MRIs, and other procedures—all with potentially harmful and even deadly side effects,” the agency said.

Zamora-Quezada also fabricated medical records and lied to insurers about the patients’ conditions, the Justice Department said.

“Dr. Zamora-Quezada funded his luxurious lifestyle for two decades by traumatizing his patients, abusing his employees, lying to insurers, and stealing taxpayer money,” Matthew R. Galeotti, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, said in the news release.

Other rheumatologists testified that hundreds of their patients diagnosed by Zamora-Quezada in fact did not have rheumatoid arthritis, according to federal officials.

Some patients suffered from “debilitating” side effects from the “powerful” medications they were given, including strokes, hair loss, liver damage, pain and necrosis of the jawbone, the Justice Department said.

One patient said in court that they were “constantly being in bed and being unable to get up from bed alone, and being pumped with medication, I didn’t feel like my life had any meaning.”

“Testimony also revealed Zamora-Quezada’s obstruction of insurer audits by fabricating missing patient files, including by taking ultrasounds of employees and using those images as documentation in the patient records,” federal officials said.

The Justice Department said the scheme involved over $118 million in false claims and over $28 million paid out by insurers.",https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/jsd987/picture281210368/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/hush-naidoo-jade-photography-yo01Z-9HQAw-unsplash%20(8).jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-22 16:56:30.044142

The goal is to simplify processes and create standard rules, to make surgeries smoother and improve patient care.

The effort aims to reduce delays, improve communication among surgical teams, and make ORs more efficient. Standardizing processes will also help every patient receive a high level of care, no matter where they’re treated in the Military Health System.

Project Goals

The OR Optimization Project focuses on:

• Reducing surgery delays

• Improving communication with surgical teams

• Standardizing care across the MHS

Solving Common Problems

The OR Optimization Project looks to improve several issues:

• Staff Readiness: Standard rules lead to more efficient medical teams who are better prepared to do their jobs.

• Cost Savings: Having the right number of staff in operating rooms saves money.

• Performance Metrics: Using the same measures for all operating rooms makes it easier to see how they are doing.

“The OR Optimization Project benefits everyone—lower costs for taxpayers, better readiness for the force, and better outcomes for patients,” said Dr. Matthew Mayfield, DHA’s Assistant Director Health Care Administration surgical lead.

Creating Standard Rules

The DHA and surgery experts are writing rules for scheduling surgeries, deciding how many staff members are needed, and measuring how well operating rooms perform.

These rules mix the best ideas from civilian hospitals with the special needs of military surgery, Mayfield said.

“The project uses civilian expertise along with military surgery knowledge to create strong, efficient processes across the Defense Health Agency,” he explained.

Training staff is also an important part of this effort. Teams will learn how to follow the new rules and use the tools provided to help them succeed.

Benefits for Patients and Providers

Patients will see fewer delays and cancellations as processes improve. For medical staff, the changes will mean clearer steps to follow, better teamwork, and less paperwork.

“Our teams are dedicated to making things better and providing safe and efficient surgical care,” said U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr. Aaron Johnson, department head of the main operating room at Naval Medical Center San Diego.

What’s Next

The OR Optimization Project is rolling out in steps so facilities can adjust gradually. Feedback from staff and patients will help improve the processes.

“This teamwork is about building a better system for everyone,” said Johnson. “By working together, we’re laying the foundation for long-term success in surgical care.”

“How close am I to being memorialized?”

Yet above the whirring of medical equipment around him, the beeps of his heart rate, and the sympathetic, soft voices of the doctors telling him that they had to amputate his leg to save his life—a second thought emerged:

“I’m not going to quit.”

Days earlier, Gadson had been on a routine patrol in Baghdad, Iraq. He was thrown from his vehicle after it was struck by an improvised explosive device. Gadson was in critical condition, his legs and arm severely damaged from the attack.

“All I knew how to do was push back, even in this fog and moment of uncertainty, not knowing what to expect.”

What Gadson didn’t know at the time was that his story of resilience would define his life’s work moving forward. He would remain on active duty, promoted to the rank of colonel, take command of one of the largest U.S. Army installations in the world, and serve 26 years in the U.S. Army. In retirement, Gadson would become a motivational speaker, sharing his story of how he recovered, rebuilt, and persevered in the years following his injuries. His compelling message would inspire crowds at events and conferences even in front of thousands of military health professionals at the 2024 Military Health System Research Symposium. Gadson would highlight the importance of medical training, and how the character of the military medical experts involved in his care, were instrumental in saving his life.

He would discuss his journey with NFL teams who went onto victory, with cadets looking upon their next chapter of life, with Department of Defense staff about hiring those with disabilities. He would share his story as encouragement to carry on, to spark hope to those fighting for recovery, and to tell others to “be the best you can today … and moving forward, really embrace health,” said Gadson.

Football-Turned-War Hero

A football star in his youth, Gadson followed his dream of becoming a professional football player—all the way to U.S. Military Academy at West Point.

“That was the most important thing, in the back of my mind, to have a pro-football career,” Gadson said. “You might say I went there with a bit of a chip on my shoulder, because I wanted to prove that I could play at the highest level.”

While football and good grades may have brought him to school, it was the mindset of the military that truly became his passion.

Sports served as “a tremendous sort of development and building block. In my maturing as an athlete that, in a lot of ways, I took that into being a soldier. We have a five-year service obligation after attending the academy and I thought I would transition out and try to find my way back into football. But I fell in love with being a soldier and I just decided to keep going.”

Gadson rose through the ranks as a field artillery officer and through the guidance of “strong noncommissioned officers that I say raised me right, raised me to understand how to care, to hold us to task and to living up to standards,” that allowed him to lead soldiers.

“What kept me in was really the sense of being on a team, the sense of being part of something greater than myself, which was, ironically, very similar to being on a football team,” he said. “One of the common bonds between team sports and in our military, what we do is the sense of commitment. And I say all the time that commitment's blind it's without condition.”

As he excelled in his military career, Gadson’s West Point football teammate was also striving for success—Paul Pasquina, who was studying medicine. Their journeys would connect later in ways neither of them would have predicted.

Gadson went on to serve in Operations Desert Shield/Storm in Kuwait, Operation Joint Forge in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, and Operation Iraqi Freedom, where that one night would change his life forever.

May 7, 2007

Gadson’s battalion was returning from a memorial service in Iraq. As the patrol neared the base, it was struck by an IED.

A 19-year-old private—who had just completed a two-week medic training course—rushed to his side to treat his injuries. Before their deployment, the private had trained with his platoon, and Gadson personally had him “pulled up to be a medic because I was the senior guy in the organization. I didn’t want to break up all the teamwork that they had built for deployment.”

His senior leader intuition about the young private proved right.

“The doctors gave this young man credit for saving my life by how well he put the tourniquets on my legs,” Gadson said. “My soldiers had my life in their hands.”

After he was evacuated off the battlefield and rushed into triage, Gadson, ever the charismatic leader, found a moment of humor amid the chaos.

“They got me (triaging) in the medical clinic on the base, and they're trying to get the bleeding stopped … there’s a nurse who’s trying to get my glove off of me. I look up at him and said, ‘How are you going to save my life if you can’t get my glove off?’”

He quickly lost consciousness and was rushed to the hospital, where Gadson would go through “129 pints of blood and go into (cardiac) arrest six times … but the doctors didn't give up on me and they kept fighting for me.”

Gadson stabilized in a combat support hospital in the Green Zone, then was flown to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Germany, and Joint Base Andrews, and finally onto Walter Reed Army Medical Center, now part of the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

A sense of familiarity came to Gadson as a member of his care team: Pasquina, now a U.S. Army colonel and doctor, recognized his former teammate.

Fate aside, his health care team had to give him the grim news about what they needed to do to save his life.

“I required surgery every other day to repair my blood vessels and clean up my wounds,” he said. “A week after arriving at Walter Reed, the doctors had to take my left leg to save my life. The blood vessels could no longer sustain blood flow, so they amputated my left leg above the knee. Ultimately, I would make the decision for them to take my right leg, because it was a not going to function as it was intended.”

He also had limited use of his right arm, learning that “my upper bicep and elbow were broken as well. That would require some surgery. And unfortunately, I had some complications from that surgery.”

Gadson also developed heterotopic ossification at the end of his legs, a condition where bone tissue forms abnormally in soft tissues outside of the skeletal system.

He said it was “one of my lowest moments because I was down to one limb. My nondominant left arm and hand was really all I had to use for all my activities of daily life. I needed someone to help me.”

Family and Seeking Support

That someone to help him was his wife. They had met as classmates at West Point, married, and had children before the attack. It was her “unconditional love” that “underwrote my recovery,” he said. “I didn't have to worry about her leaving me or my family, not wanting to be around me, wanting to shun me because I was way different. No family ever asks for this, and we certainly didn't. But she stepped up and led our family, my kids, through this.”

As Gadson adjusted to his new way of life and coped with the emotional and physical trauma of his injuries, his wife urged him to seek mental health support.

“I didn't want professional mental health, but she said, ‘We’re all going through this; you got to get some help.’”

Gadson sought his care team at Walter Reed. He started to receive mental health support for his injuries. He never lost sight of his primary goal—to continue to serve.

“I wasn't going to let myself be defined by these injuries. I was going to be defined by what I was willing to do. And so I fought to continue to stay on active duty, which ultimately was approved.”

He remained on active duty in the U.S. Army for seven years after the IED attack, eventually becoming garrison commander of Fort Belvoir, Virginia, where he oversaw the daily operations for more than 140 commands and agencies for the Department of Defense. He also sought treatment from the Soldier Recovery Unit at Walter Reed—participating in unique therapies, including “elements of adaptive reconditioning,” such as riding horses, cycling, and skiing—all tailored for his healing experience.

“I thought they were absolutely brilliant because my mission was to heal,” he said. “You don't need to feel bad about being there … you need to take advantage of it because you can grow. When you struggle in life, that's when we grow.”

‘Angels’ in Recovery

When Gadson retired from the military, he realized that he had a story “people wanted to hear,” he said. As military leaders, “we have a moral obligation, a responsibility to share our life experiences. The good, the bad, the ugly. And that's strength.”

In his motivational career, he has spoken with service members in recovery, co-wrote a book, titled, “Finding Waypoints: A Warrior’s Journey Towards Peace and Purpose,” and even gave inspirational speeches to the NFL New York Giants football team, merging his passion for sports with his unprecedented story of resilience.

Aside from his own determination, grit, and strive for excellence, Gadson references his MHS care team for his successes.

“That's how I describe this network of angels in my care, everything literally was perfect, right?” Gadson said. “I'm not supposed to be here, and I'm here.”

He encourages people to think about Memorial Day as inspiration to carry on.

“My motivation is to live my best life for those who didn't make it home,” he said. “I have to make their sacrifice worth it. And the only way I make their sacrifice worth it is to make the most of my life.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2408/8616272/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-22 14:56:31.369113

Many wonder if military insurance—such as TRICARE or VA health benefits—is truly a smart and reliable way to access detox and rehab services.

The short answer is yes, military insurance can be a highly effective option for receiving professional addiction treatment. However, understanding the scope of coverage, eligibility requirements, and how to make the most of these benefits is key to maximizing this valuable resource.

That’s why Downbeach is stepping in with this resource to assist you with your decision.

Understanding Military Insurance Options for Treatment

Military insurance typically falls under two primary programs: TRICARE and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system. TRICARE provides health coverage to active-duty service members, retirees, National Guard and Reserve members, and their families.

The VA offers healthcare benefits primarily to veterans, with services administered through VA Medical Centers and affiliated facilities. Both systems include provisions for mental health and substance use disorder treatment, including medically supervised detoxification, inpatient rehab, outpatient therapy, and medication-assisted treatment (MAT).

TRICARE operates similarly to civilian insurance, contracting with private treatment providers who meet network qualifications. Plans under TRICARE include Prime, Select, and Reserve Select, each with different cost structures and referral requirements.

Meanwhile, VA benefits are coordinated through the veteran’s assigned VA Medical Center and often require eligibility verification based on service history, disability status, or other criteria.

The Rising Need for Detox and Rehab Among Military Populations

Military personnel face unique stressors; combat exposure, traumatic brain injuries, PTSD, chronic pain, and frequent relocations, all of which can increase the risk of developing substance use disorders.

Alcohol misuse, prescription drug dependency, and co-occurring mental health conditions are particularly prevalent among veterans and active-duty service members. Unfortunately, stigma and logistical challenges have historically created barriers to seeking care.

The Department of Defense and VA have acknowledged these challenges and have made concerted efforts to expand access to treatment. Using military insurance to pursue rehab or detox services is not only smart but also increasingly encouraged.

These systems aim to reduce stigma, streamline access, and improve outcomes by partnering with reputable treatment centers across the country.

What Services Are Typically Covered by Military Insurance?

You’ll want to locate residential programs that take TRICARE or VA benefits. Both can cover a broad spectrum of treatment options, though some restrictions may apply depending on the plan and provider. Covered services often include:

Medical Detoxification: For individuals physically dependent on substances such as alcohol, opioids, or benzodiazepines, medically supervised detox is often the first step. TRICARE and VA plans generally cover inpatient detox, which includes 24/7 monitoring, medication support, and stabilization.

Inpatient Residential Treatment: Following detox, residential rehab provides a structured, supportive environment where clients receive counseling, behavioral therapy, group support, and dual diagnosis care. Both TRICARE and VA can cover residential care, particularly when deemed medically necessary.

Partial Hospitalization and Intensive Outpatient Programs (PHP/IOP): These structured day programs offer comprehensive therapy without requiring overnight stays. Military insurance typically includes coverage for these step-down levels of care, which are ideal for maintaining progress after inpatient treatment.

Outpatient Therapy and Aftercare: Long-term recovery often involves ongoing therapy. TRICARE and the VA support various outpatient services, including individual counseling, psychiatric follow-ups, group therapy, and relapse prevention planning.

Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT): MAT uses FDA-approved medications like Suboxone or Vivitrol to manage cravings and reduce relapse risks. Military insurance covers MAT when prescribed as part of a comprehensive care plan.

What to Watch Out for: Authorization, Referrals, and Network Status

While the benefits are extensive, successfully using military insurance for detox and rehab requires attention to administrative details. For TRICARE users, seeking care from an in-network provider simplifies the process and reduces out-of-pocket costs.

Depending on the plan, a referral from a primary care manager (PCM) may be required before admission to a treatment facility.

VA-covered treatment, on the other hand, often involves a more centralized process. Veterans must first be enrolled in VA health care and receive a diagnosis through their assigned VA provider. From there, they may be referred to a VA facility or a community provider under the VA’s Community Care Network.

In emergencies or urgent situations, VA benefits may also cover care at non-VA facilities, provided eligibility criteria are met.

For both systems, pre-authorization is often required, especially for residential care or high-cost services. This step confirms that the treatment is medically necessary and that the chosen facility is approved to accept military insurance. It’s wise to work with a treatment center that has dedicated admissions staff experienced in military insurance verification.

Why Choosing a Military-Approved Rehab Facility Matters

Not all treatment centers are created equal, and when finding help using your military insurance, it’s important to choose a facility that understands the needs of service members and veterans. Some centers specialize in treating trauma, PTSD, and military-related behavioral health issues, offering evidence-based approaches tailored to this population.

Facilities that are in-network with TRICARE or contracted through the VA’s Community Care Network often have additional training, cultural competency, and programming aligned with military life.

These facilities may include therapies such as cognitive processing therapy (CPT), prolonged exposure therapy, EMDR, and veteran-specific support groups.

The quality and relevance of care directly affect long-term recovery outcomes. Partnering with a military-approved provider ensures that the clinical team is not only licensed and experienced but also aligned with military culture and values.

Financial Considerations: Is It Cost-Effective?

One of the major advantages of using military insurance is cost control. Compared to private-pay treatment, which can run tens of thousands of dollars, military insurance greatly reduces or eliminates financial barriers.

TRICARE plans typically feature lower deductibles, co-pays, and cost-sharing when care is obtained in-network.

VA services, for those who qualify, are often provided at no cost or minimal cost, depending on the veteran’s priority group and financial means. This makes treatment accessible even for those with limited income, unemployment, or housing instability.

However, it’s important to clarify all financial details before starting treatment. Admissions teams at quality treatment centers should provide cost estimates and explain what military insurance covers, what might be billed to the patient, and whether secondary insurance (such as Medicare or Medicaid) can help with any remaining costs.

Long-Term Benefits of Starting Recovery with Military Insurance

Addiction is a chronic disease, and timely treatment is one of the most important decisions a service member or veteran can make for their long-term health, relationships, and career stability. When individuals take advantage of military insurance for detox and rehab, they’re accessing care that’s backed by federally supported infrastructure, often with built-in pathways to continued support.

These systems also connect patients to broader community resources, including vocational assistance, housing programs, peer support networks, and mental health case management. Whether the goal is to return to active duty, transition to civilian life, or simply feel like oneself again, these benefits lay a foundation for stability and growth.

In many cases, starting with military insurance opens doors to other critical services, such as family counseling, trauma recovery, or treatment for co-occurring diagnoses like anxiety and depression.

These interconnected services can improve not just sobriety outcomes but also overall quality of life.

Choosing the Right Time to Seek Help

Knowing when to seek detox or rehab is a personal decision, but early intervention can make all the difference. Whether substance use has just begun to interfere with responsibilities or has already caused legal, health, or relational consequences, it’s never too soon to ask for help.

Military insurance is a smart choice because it removes many of the traditional barriers to access—cost, location, or lack of insurance. If you or a loved one are covered under TRICARE or VA benefits, there’s a structured, proven system in place that supports treatment and recovery.

Take Smart, Strategic Step Toward Getting Help

Using military insurance for detox and rehab isn’t just a practical choice—it’s a strategic one. These benefits exist for a reason: to ensure those who’ve served their country, and their loved ones, can access life-saving care when it’s needed most.

If you or someone you care about is considering treatment, don’t wait for the situation to worsen. Reach out to a treatment center familiar with military benefits, start the verification process, and get the guidance needed to take the first step.

With the right support, recovery is not only possible—it’s sustainable. Military insurance makes that journey a whole lot more attainable.",,N,1.0,2025-05-22 13:56:24.686502

Paris, France and Munich, Germany, 22 May, 2025 – TRiCares SAS (“TRiCares”), a privately held pioneer in the field of minimally invasive treatment of tricuspid regurgitation, is presenting data in a late-breaking session at EuroPCR today from its first-in-human trial of Topaz, its Transcatheter Tricuspid Valve Replacement (TTVR) system.

Today, Dr Julien Dreyfus, MD, PhD will present 30-day post-procedural data from 20 tricuspid regurgitation (TR) patients treated with Topaz across eight specialist cardiac centers in Europe. The TRICURE First-In-Human study demonstrated significant elimination of TR in treated patients, with grade ‘none’ (0+) or ‘mild’ (1+) TR reported in all patients implanted with Topaz. In addition, zero permanent pacemakers were required due to the investigational device. The implantation procedure lasted, on average, 35 minutes.

These early clinical results from Topaz compare favorably with existing TTVR treatment approaches, with a procedure that is fast, easy-to-use, and less demanding of imaging specialists.

Further details on the data will be shared in today’s oral presentation at EuroPCR 2025 and on Clinicaltrials.gov.

“We are highly encouraged by the results of this first-in-human trial. These initial findings serve as important validation for our ongoing clinical trials for Topaz in Europe and the US,” said Ahmed Elmouelhi, President & CEO of TRiCares. “I want to extend our sincere gratitude to the participating hospitals, the dedicated interventional teams and clinical investigators who contributed to these patient outcomes. To date, the TRiCares team has overseen 60 Topaz implantations, and we continue to work closely with clinicians to refine the procedure and technique.”

The initial findings will be used to inform the company's ongoing European pivotal trial (NCT06581471) and U.S. Early Feasibility Study (NCT06506942).

About TRiCares

TRiCares is a privately held company developing Topaz, a minimally invasive tricuspid valve replacement system for the elimination of tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Topaz’s unique dual stent design is easy to implant and uses established transfemoral and transjugular delivery methods, avoiding the need for high-risk open-heart surgery. Topaz is designed to fit a wide range of anatomies and replaces the diseased tricuspid valve. Once in place, it flexes with every heartbeat. A European Pivotal Study and a US/Canadian Early Feasibility Study are underway, with progress being made towards FDA approval and CE marking. TRiCares has focused on TR since its inception and its ambition is for Topaz to become the valve of choice for the millions of TR patients worldwide, overcoming the limitations of current treatment approaches.

TRiCares is a global business, with offices in France, Germany, the US and Brazil, and is supported by a strategic partner and leading life science venture capital firms: 415 Capital, Andera Partners, Bayern Kapital, BioMed Partners, Credit Mutuel Innovation, GoCapital, Karista, and Wellington Partners.

About Topaz

The Topaz Transcatheter Tricuspid Valve Replacement (TTVR) System is designed to eliminate tricuspid regurgitation through a minimally invasive approach. This system consists of the Topaz Heart Valve Prosthesis and a catheter-based implantation system. It is developed exclusively for use in the tricuspid position and to provide a system for physicians that is safe and easy to implant. The unique two-stent valve prosthesis is inserted primarily via the femoral vein and transports the prosthesis into the right side of the heart, where it is finally released to replace the diseased tricuspid valve.

Originally, NASA reported an expense of $417,798 on union time, but now the space agency is updating that figure to $893,620 over the 12 months ending Sept. 30, The Post has learned.

“As has been the case with other federal agencies under the Biden administration, NASA bureaucrats were racking up an astronomical tab doing union time on the taxpayers’ dime,” Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), whose office requested the data, told The Post.

“We need to end the absurd practice of taxpayer-funded union time across government to ensure that federal employees serve the American people, not themselves.”

NASA also spent more than previously known on union activities in 2023. Initially, the space agency reported spending $477,204 in fiscal year 2023, but now the agency is updating those figures to $636,189.

Meanwhile, its budget shrank from $25.4 billion in fiscal year 2023 to $24.88 billion in fiscal year 2024.

Taxpayer-funded union time includes labor meetings, union-sponsored training activities, preparations for collective bargaining, work on behalf of those facing disciplinary action and more.

Due to the Federal Service Labor Management Relations Statute, federal unions can’t negotiate with Uncle Sam on pay or benefits, which are determined by legal and regulatory policy.

Instead, federal unions negotiate over smaller-scale issues such as workplace procedures and telework policies.

“They’re left negotiating for tedious things that are of zero or negative benefit to taxpayers,” Rachel Greszler, a senior research fellow on workforce and public finance at the Heritage Foundation, previously explained to The Post.

“This includes things like the height of cubicle panels, securing designated smoking areas on otherwise smoke-free campuses, and the right to wear Spandex at work.”

In 2023, there were 43 employees at NASA who logged in taxpayer-funded union time, with about 6,588.5 hours of union work done that year.

By 2024, that jumped to 49, with 8,780.25 union work done, according to the new data.

NASA is covered by two prominent federal unions — the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers and the American Federation of Government Employees.

Ernst, who chairs the Senate DOGE Caucus, has been seeking to end the practice of taxpayer-funded union time and fired off a slew of requests to 24 government agencies demanding data.

NASA had been one of the first to respond.

In a statement to The Post, the agency said it always “complies with federal law.”

“In keeping with precedent, NASA is committed to providing transparency to those conducting oversight in the legislative branch,” a spokesperson said.

“NASA complies with federal law, allowing employees to be granted official time to perform certain labor union representation activities.”

So far, of the agencies that have divulged data to Ernst’s office, the largest expenditure on taxpayer-funded union time came from the Defense Health Agency, which spent $3.3 million on it in fiscal years 2023 and 2024.

DHA is tasked with overseeing TRICARE benefits for military members.

The Office of Personnel Management used to collect comprehensive data on taxpayer-funded union time, but stopped after 2019. In February, the Trump administration pushed agencies to report that data.

In 2019, OPM found that the entire federal government had spent at least $135 million on taxpayer-funded union time. NASA spent $641,037 in 2019, according to the OPM data.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/105054419.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,N,0.0,2025-05-22 13:56:37.978238

Col. Melissa Boyd, Licensed Clinical Psychologist, Defense Health Agency-Public Health

Service members encounter a wide range of both rewarding and demanding experiences throughout their careers. Some unique challenges can include frequent relocations, family separations, irregular work hours, and deployments. To help manage the mental health challenges that may result from these experiences, there are free and confidential resources available to support and enhance the well-being of service members.

Free and confidential mental health services

Service members’ ability to regulate emotions in healthy ways plays a crucial part in their ability to cope with challenges. Military OneSource and Military and Family Life Counselors (https://www.militaryonesource.mil/confidential-counseling/) are examples of free and confidential mental health counseling programs that offer military members and their families counseling to address short-term, non-medical concerns. Counselors within these programs are equipped to help service members improve healthy stress management, time management, and decision-making strategies and tools, including the ability to problem solve, manage conflict, build coping skills, and adapt to change. In addition, these programs foster health, resiliency, and readiness.

Military OneSource

Military OneSource is a U.S. Department of Defense program that provides free, short-term, solution-focused, confidential, non-medical counseling services for a wide range of issues, including relationship conflicts, stress management, parenting issues, coping with grief and loss, and managing deployments. Military OneSource supports active-duty, National Guard and Reserve service members and their families anywhere in the world and is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week at no cost. The program is comprised of master’s- or doctoral-level mental health professionals (in psychology, counseling, social work or marriage and family counseling) who are licensed to practice independently. In addition to providing counseling for military- and life-related stressors, Military OneSource offers webinars and online trainings on topics including tax services, spouse employment, relocation and deployment, and stress management.

Counseling sessions can take place in a variety of forms:

In person - Face-to-face confidential counseling in an office setting with a counselor located in the local community.

Telehealth - Confidential telephonic Military OneSource counseling for service members and family members who are unable to attend in-person counseling sessions. Telephonic counseling is only available to adults aged 18 and older.

Secure online chat - Online counseling via secure chat involving a real-time conversation with a counselor using instant messaging. Military OneSource uses state-of-the-art technology to transfer information over the internet securely. Chat-based counseling is only available to adults aged 18 and older.

Secure video sessions - Video counseling requiring a video-enabled computer. Military OneSource uses state-of-the-art technology to transfer information over the internet securely.

Children ages 6 to 17 are eligible to receive counseling in person or through video only. Family sessions are also provided for children ages 6 to 12 who may attend with a parent or caregiver present. For youth ages 13 to 17, a parent or caregiver must be available to give consent at the start of each counseling session.

For diagnosable conditions and concerns that are best suited for long-term care services not provided through Military OneSource, additional support and treatment options are available through military medical treatment facilities, embedded behavioral health clinics, and Tricare network providers.

According to Military OneSource (https://www.militaryonesource.mil/benefits/confidential-counseling/), the following issues are not appropriate or suitable for its counseling services:

• Active suicidal or homicidal thoughts

• Sexual assault

• Child abuse

• Domestic violence

• Alcohol and substance abuse

• Mental health conditions such as depression

Counseling through Military OneSource is also considered not suitable for individuals who are—

• Taking prescribed psychoactive medication

• Receiving therapy with another practitioner

• Involved in Family Advocacy Program cases

• Undergoing fitness-for-duty evaluations

• Undergoing court-ordered counseling

Military and Family Life Counseling (MFLC)

The Military and Family Life Counseling Program (https://www.militaryonesource.mil/benefits/military-family-life-counseling-program/) provides free, confidential counseling to service members, their families, and survivors on or near installations. Counselors are licensed to practice independently in the location where they are providing services and are trained to deliver valuable counseling services, briefings, and presentations to the military community. The MFLC program was designed to deploy counselors rapidly for short- and long-term assignments based on each military branch’s specific need.

The MFLC Program provides non-medical counseling for issues requiring short-term attention, including everyday stressors, deployment and reintegration concerns, parenting, grief and loss, and marital issues. MFLCs conduct consultation and outreach services to more than 200 military installations or nearby civilian communities located in most of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories and commonwealths, and over 25 foreign countries including areas considered hazardous duty/danger zones. MFLCs provide support to individuals, couples, families and groups for a range of issues including, but not limited to, deployment stress, reintegration, relocation adjustment, separation, anger management, conflict resolution, parenting, parent-child communication, relationship and family issues, coping skills, homesickness, grief and loss, isolation from extended family members, children coping with the absence of a parent, child education, and spousal employment.

Additionally, there are Child and Youth Behavioral Military and Family Life (https://www.militaryonesource.mil/benefits/military-family-life-counseling-program/) Counselor programs that specifically provide support to military children and families on topics including, but not limited to, identifying feelings, bullying, conflict resolution, self-esteem, anger management, family concerns, problem-solving, coping with deployment and reunification, transition and moving, sibling and parental relationships, time management, and divorce.

Confidential mental health resources

Confidential counseling provides service members and their loved ones with resources and support to address a variety of issues and build important skills to tackle life's challenges.

Confidential counseling is crucial for the military because it allows service members to seek support openly and discuss personal concerns when needed without fear of repercussions on their career or unit standing. With confidential services, a service member’s personal information is not provided to their military chain of command, shared with family or friends, or released to other agencies. Although services are confidential, one caveat is that counselors are required by law to report illegal activities or situations where there could be danger to the service member or to others. These include suspected domestic violence and child or elder abuse or neglect.

Other benefits of confidential military counseling:

• Reduces stigma - By ensuring privacy, it removes the stigma associated with seeking mental health support, making it more likely for service members to access necessary care.

• Improves unit cohesion - Addressing personal issues through confidential counseling can help service members better manage their emotions and perform effectively within their unit.

• Builds resilience - Open communication with a counselor allows service members to develop coping mechanisms and build resilience against the unique stressors of military life.

• Supports family well-being - Confidential counseling is also available for military families, helping them navigate challenges related to deployments, frequent moves, and other stressors.

• Provided access to specialized support - Military counseling programs often provide specialized support tailored to military experiences, such as combat trauma or deployment-related issues.

In addition to mental health counseling services, there are apps that promote healthy techniques for managing stress, seeking help with life challenges, addressing health problems, and implementing safety measures against harmful behaviors.

We were seen on base happily, but recently the appt waits were wild. I called Tricare and explained my daughter was waiting 4 months for her yearly checkup. They switched her to an off base PCM. I made her an appointment and we went. When trying to make an appt for my sons 4 mo visit, base ultimately canceled it and he was going to be seen at 6 mo on base.

So, same as my daughter, I called to switch my son (was having trouble logging in), and they said oh it looks like him and your daughter both have X provider on base (not off base). I said that's odd because we switched her off base.

The rep switched both my son to the off base provider and daughter BACK to the off base provider. Has anyone had this happen?! Any idea if there is a way to find online what correspondence Tricare has had with you? We got letters about PCM changes, but I didn't keep them. I can only see my correspondence on milconnect and it is my proof of coverage.

The area on milconnect that normally shows as providers change by date has NO record of her being assigned this provider. The rep couldn't explain. I'm worried we will get a bill. I would never go to a PCM without first being assigned.",,N,-1.0,2025-05-22 12:56:35.809816

Paris, France and Munich, Germany, 22 May, 2025 – TRiCares SAS (“TRiCares”), a privately held pioneer in the field of minimally invasive treatment of tricuspid regurgitation, is presenting data in a late-breaking session at EuroPCR today from its first-in-human trial of Topaz, its Transcatheter Tricuspid Valve Replacement (TTVR) system.

Today, Dr Julien Dreyfus, MD, PhD will present 30-day post-procedural data from 20 tricuspid regurgitation (TR) patients treated with Topaz across eight specialist cardiac centers in Europe. The TRICURE First-In-Human study demonstrated significant elimination of TR in treated patients, with grade ‘none’ (0+) or ‘mild’ (1+) TR reported in all patients implanted with Topaz. In addition, zero permanent pacemakers were required due to the investigational device. The implantation procedure lasted, on average, 35 minutes.

These early clinical results from Topaz compare favorably with existing TTVR treatment approaches, with a procedure that is fast, easy-to-use, and less demanding of imaging specialists.

Further details on the data will be shared in today’s oral presentation at EuroPCR 2025 and on Clinicaltrials.gov.

“We are highly encouraged by the results of this first-in-human trial. These initial findings serve as important validation for our ongoing clinical trials for Topaz in Europe and the US,” said Ahmed Elmouelhi, President & CEO of TRiCares. “I want to extend our sincere gratitude to the participating hospitals, the dedicated interventional teams and clinical investigators who contributed to these patient outcomes. To date, the TRiCares team has overseen 60 Topaz implantations, and we continue to work closely with clinicians to refine the procedure and technique.”

The initial findings will be used to inform the company's ongoing European pivotal trial (NCT06581471) and U.S. Early Feasibility Study (NCT06506942).

About TRiCares

TRiCares is a privately held company developing Topaz, a minimally invasive tricuspid valve replacement system for the elimination of tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Topaz’s unique dual stent design is easy to implant and uses established transfemoral and transjugular delivery methods, avoiding the need for high-risk open-heart surgery. Topaz is designed to fit a wide range of anatomies and replaces the diseased tricuspid valve. Once in place, it flexes with every heartbeat. A European Pivotal Study and a US/Canadian Early Feasibility Study are underway, with progress being made towards FDA approval and CE marking. TRiCares has focused on TR since its inception and its ambition is for Topaz to become the valve of choice for the millions of TR patients worldwide, overcoming the limitations of current treatment approaches.

TRiCares is a global business, with offices in France, Germany, the US and Brazil, and is supported by a strategic partner and leading life science venture capital firms: 415 Capital, Andera Partners, Bayern Kapital, BioMed Partners, Credit Mutuel Innovation, GoCapital, Karista, and Wellington Partners.

About Topaz

The Topaz Transcatheter Tricuspid Valve Replacement (TTVR) System is designed to eliminate tricuspid regurgitation through a minimally invasive approach. This system consists of the Topaz Heart Valve Prosthesis and a catheter-based implantation system. It is developed exclusively for use in the tricuspid position and to provide a system for physicians that is safe and easy to implant. The unique two-stent valve prosthesis is inserted primarily via the femoral vein and transports the prosthesis into the right side of the heart, where it is finally released to replace the diseased tricuspid valve.
