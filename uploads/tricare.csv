The Military health system is already using virtual healthcare capabilities that allow specialists to provide remote consultation to battlefield medics.

The Military health system is already using virtual healthcare capabilities that allow specialists to provide remote consultation to battlefield medics. The technology enables real-time guidance for complex procedures that might have been impossible without immediate specialist presence.

Dr. Stephen Ferrera, acting assistant secretary for Health Affairs, said the military health system is fundamentally rethinking how it delivers care in wartime environments, particularly as the Pentagon shifts focus to regions where vast distances could complicate traditional battlefield medicine.

“We are the only health care system in America that goes to war. And so, our North Star always has to be that we are ready to provide first-class, world-class health care to our service members, to our warfighters, should we have to go into harm’s way,” Ferrara said on Federal Monthly Insights – Health IT.

The modern battlefield

The emphasis on readiness comes as military medical planners grapple with scenarios where air superiority, a key advantage during the War on Terror, may not exist. During conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, wounded service members were often evacuated to advanced medical facilities within the ‘golden hour,” contributing to the highest survivability rates in warfare history. But future conflicts may demand that field medics manage patients for extended periods without immediate evacuation options. That’s where technology becomes a force multiplier, according to Dr. Ferrara.

“How can we leverage artificial intelligence, other technological systems to be able to empower and use those as force multipliers for our field personnel?” Ferrara asked. “We can have specialists, whether they’re trauma specialists, intensivists, surgeons — you name it — be able to in real time, help guide people that are on the ground at the front line.”

Healthcare innovation at home and abroad

DHA is also rolling out advanced electronic health record systems designed specifically for deployed environments. The Battlefield Assisted Trauma Distributed Observation Kit — known as “BATDOK” — can track wounded service members from initial injury through their entire care from international warzone evacuation to facilities like Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.

“It’s also synchronous, so a provider back here in the states can know exactly what’s going on with that patient in real time and give highly specialized, informed clinical decision support to a battlefield provider,” Ferrara said.

The technology is moving beyond battlefield applications. Military treatment facilities are implementing ambient listening technology that automatically transcribes clinical notes as providers speak — reducing administrative burden and allowing more time for direct patient care.

“The technology can listen, and you can speak to it, and it can just document instead of the old days where you had to write it and then type it out” Ferrara said. “That enables us to have our people who are our most valuable resource, spending their time doing direct patient care.”

The Military Health System is also leveraging generational advantages in technology adoption. Ferrara noted that medical personnel under 40 are ‘largely digital natives’ who have grown up with technology, making them more comfortable with new systems in their practice.

However, the increased reliance on technology raises questions about cybersecurity and communication reliability in contested environments. Military planners recognize that cyberspace is now part of the battlefield, creating both opportunities and vulnerabilities.

“We are always looking at how could we do these things asynchronously or offline.” Ferrar said. “That’s where things, especially like AI can come into play, where if a person on a battlefield can have a device and have tools that can help them,” Ferrara told The Federal Drive with Terry Gerton.

Technology deployment is part of a broader modernization effort that includes expanding partnerships with civilian healthcare systems and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Military Health system is implementing a common electronic health record, MHS Genesis, that will eventually provide seamless care transitions from military service to veteran status.

“Theater Genesis” represents the deployed version of this system, already operational on hospital ships and in European theaters. The goal is creating an integrated healthcare record that follows service members from stateside facilities through combat zones and back.

For Ferrara, who served 25 years as a Navy physician with four operational deployments, the technology investments represent a personal commitment to ensuring military medical readiness.

“The most important thing is that I can feel I take a very personal stake in knowing that our service members, when they go down range in harms way, are going to get the best care that they can possibly get. That’s honoring the pact that we make, not only with those service members, but with their parents,” Ferrara said.

“We go to war,” said Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, Dr. Stephen Ferrara, to a packed auditorium. Dr. Ferrara toured Naval Hospital Bremerton as part of his first official trip to the Pacific Northwest, July 14, 2025.

With 25 years of experience working with the Navy, Dr. Ferrara is no stranger to the challenges and opportunities that come with living and working at sea. “I’ve worn your uniform, sat in your seats, shared your mission, and understand how important it is to come out to talk with you,” he said.

As the direct advisor to the undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, as well as the Secretary of Defense, for all things related to military medicine and healthcare, Dr. Ferrara emphasized that part of his role is to promote the work of hospitals across the country, including Bremerton, and to advocate on their behalf.

“The reason that’s important is that I’m your voice,” he said. “When I have to talk to the (Secretary of Defense), or folks at the White House or from across our government, I’m here to tell your story and explain what you do.”

Visiting hospitals and clinics is part of his “boots on the ground” approach to listen to local issues, concerns and successes, and understand how an installation works and succeeds.

""Here, in the third largest fleet concentration in the Navy, the geography is really unique. It’s really helpful to be able to come in and get that understanding. The most important thing is making sure those submarines, those ships, those air wings, are fully staffed,” he said.

He also noted that it is critical that those who need care are treated quickly so they can safely get back to work. “That’s our first mission,” he said.

Dr. Ferrara’s visit comes after Bremerton has faced about a decade of change. Staff shortages have pushed the hospital to do more with less. Despite the challenges, Dr. Ferrara spoke with conviction and optimism.

“One of the reasons why we’re such an amazing, strong military that represents our American values is that we make a compact with servicemembers, including yourselves, parents, loved ones, that when we send people into harm’s way, we’re going to provide them with world class military healthcare wherever they go. We have to be ready to do that,” he said.

He emphasized the need to work together to find durable solutions, increase the complexity of care, and maintain critical skills to solidify readiness.

Just as important is caring for the entire community. “Taking care of family members … is incredibly important. When our servicemembers have to go, they need to be laser-focused on their mission. Our servicemembers go to places we ask them to go where they may not have family or friends nearby. The Military Health System becomes a really important care provider and also a support network. That allows those warfighters to focus on their mission. That’s a really important thing we do.""

Reflecting his passion for meeting with hospital staff working on the ground, Dr. Ferrara met with Director and Navy Medicine Readiness Training Command Bremerton Commanding Officer Capt. Karla Lepore; Executive Officer Capt. Molly Jenkins; and Command Master Chief William Eickhoff. He also spoke with hospital staff and local Navy leadership.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2507/9181273/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-07-15 16:56:19.693950

Or, have you just married a uniformed service member? If you’re new to TRICARE, you may have some questions about how to enroll in a plan, get care, and learn more about your coverage. So, what exactly is TRICARE?

“TRICARE is the uniformed health care program for service members, retirees, their family members, and other eligible beneficiaries,” explained Malcolm Jones, a TRICARE subject matter expert at the Defense Health Agency. “It brings together the resources of military hospitals and clinics with a network of civilian health care providers and pharmacies.”

TRICARE covers:

Active duty service members and their family members

National Guard and Reserve members and their family members

Retirees and their family members

Survivors

Certain former spouses

Medal of Honor recipients and their family members

Dependent parents and parents-in-law (In some locations, they may be eligible for TRICARE Plus, a program offered at some military hospitals and clinics.)

Foreign force members and their family members

Are you in one of these groups? Keep reading to learn more about the basics of using your TRICARE benefit.

Eligibility

Your uniformed service personnel office determines your TRICARE eligibility.

To check your eligibility, first make sure your information is fully updated in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. Sponsors are automatically registered in DEERS, but they must register their eligible family members by going to a local ID card office. (Note: You should call first, or set up an appointment online, to check appointment availability.)

Then, log in to milConnect to check if you’re eligible for TRICARE. Once you’ve registered on the milConnect website, you can update your contact information in DEERS and view your TRICARE enrollment information.

Health plans

Choosing a plan

You have different TRICARE health plan options depending on your sponsor’s status, your relationship to your sponsor, your age, and where you live.

To see which plans you may be eligible for, check out the Plan Finder Tool and answer a few simple questions. Then, you can use the Compare Plans Tool to figure out which plan is right for you. (Note: Families can have split enrollment, meaning some family members can enroll in one plan, while others enroll in a different one.)

Enrolling in a plan

Once you know your plan, visit TRICARE Enrollment for steps on how to enroll or purchase a plan. These steps may differ depending on the plan you choose and where you live.

Are you a new active duty family member? Once you’re registered in DEERS, you'll be automatically enrolled in a TRICARE plan based on where you live and the plan selection of your other family members who aren’t active duty service members. You have 90 days from the automatic enrollment date to change to a different plan (TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, TRICARE Prime Remote, or the US Family Health Plan, if available).

Changing plans

Interested in switching your TRICARE plan? You may have the opportunity to do so during the annual TRICARE Open Season in the fall each year. Changes you make during open season will take effect Jan. 1 of the following year.

You may also be able to change your plan when you experience a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event. QLEs are certain life changes that open a 90-day window for you and your family members to make eligible enrollment changes, as described in the TRICARE Qualifying Life Events Fact Sheet.

Common QLEs include, but aren’t limited to:

Marriage, divorce, or annulment

Birth or adoption of a child (or placement of a child by a court in a member’s home)

Moving

Activation or deactivation

Retirement or separation

Losing or gaining other health insurance

If you experience a QLE, make sure to update DEERS right away.

Getting care

Regions

TRICARE is available worldwide, and your benefits are the same no matter where you live. But different regional contractors help deliver the benefit around the world. If you get civilian health care, this means you’ll reach out to different customer service contacts depending on where you live.

There are two TRICARE regions in the U.S.:

East Region

West Region

And there is one Overseas Region.

To learn which region you’re in, visit Regions.

Military hospitals and clinics

The DHA operates military hospitals and clinics. You may be able to seek care there, depending on where you are, what plan you have, and your beneficiary group.

Civilian network

You can also seek care from a civilian network of TRICARE-authorized providers. This network depends on your region.

To search for a network provider, use the Find a Doctor Tool to get you to the right provider directory.

Note: You may be able to see a non-network TRICARE-authorized provider, depending on your TRICARE plan. But you may have higher out-of-pocket costs, and you may have to file your own claims.

ID cards

For most beneficiaries, you’ll need to show your Uniformed Services ID card to your provider as proof of TRICARE coverage. If you’re an active duty service member, you’ll need to show your Common Access Card.

Coverage

TRICARE covers treatments, procedures, prescription drugs, or devices that are medically necessary and considered proven. Learn more about how a service becomes a TRICARE-covered benefit.

You can use the Covered Services Tool to see if a service is covered by TRICARE or not. You can search by keyword or browse common categories.

Pharmacy, dental, and vision coverage

TRICARE offers prescription drug coverage and several options for filling your prescriptions. You have the same prescription coverage with almost any TRICARE health plan. (Note: If you’re enrolled in USFHP, you have separate pharmacy coverage.)

To check if your prescription drugs are covered, use the TRICARE Formulary Search Tool.

Dental coverage is separate from TRICARE’s medical coverage. Depending on your beneficiary group, you may get dental care through:

Military dental clinics

Active Duty Dental Program

TRICARE Dental Program

Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program

Vision coverage, including eye exams, depends on:

Who you are

Your TRICARE plan

Your age

Costs

HARRISBURG – Attorney General Dave Sunday joined a coalition of 48 other Attorneys General in securing a combined $202 million settlement from Gilead Sciences, Inc. for running an illegal kickback scheme to promote its HIV medications.

Gilead violated federal law by illegally providing incentives – including awards, meals, and travel expenses – to health care providers to prescribe Gilead’s medications, resulting in millions of dollars of false claims submitted to government health care programs.

Pennsylvania is expected to receive $1.28 million and $642,189 will go directly to its Medicaid program.

The settlement, reached in coordination with the U.S. Department of Justice and approved by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, provides $49 million for Medicaid programs nationwide — with the remainder going to Medicare, Tricare, and the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP).

“Gilead used illegal kickbacks to corner the market on these life-saving drugs needed by one million Americans living with HIV,” Pennsylvania Attorney General Dave Sunday said. “We saw similar kickback schemes from drug manufacturers during the eruption of the opioid crisis. The money from this settlement will support people living with HIV and bolster prevention programs.”

From January 2011 to November 2017, Gilead violated federal anti-kickback laws by providing gifts to health care providers who attended and spoke at promotional speaker programs for Gilead’s HIV drugs: Stribild, Genvoya, Complera, Odefsey, Descovy, and Biktarvy. Gilead paid high-volume prescribers tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars to present as “HIV Speakers.” The company also covered travel expenses for speakers, including those traveling long distances and to attractive destinations, and hosted dinners at high-end restaurants.

Gilead’s internal compliance mechanisms failed to halt these violations. The company maintained policies and procedures that failed to prevent its sales representatives from improperly offering incentives to induce prescriptions.

Joining Attorney General Sunday in securing settlements with Gilead are the Attorneys General of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The Pennsylvania Medicaid Fraud Control Unit receives 75 percent of its funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under a grant award totaling $12,839,940 for Federal fiscal year (FY) 2025. The remaining 25 percent, totaling $4,279,979 for FY 2025, is funded by Pennsylvania.

Gilead undermined our health care system with illegal kickback payments, and now they are being held accountable. I will continue to fight for New Yorkers’ right to honest, transparent health care.”

From January 2011 to November 2017, Gilead violated federal anti-kickback laws by providing gifts to health care providers who attended and spoke at promotional speaker programs for Gilead’s HIV drugs: Stribild, Genvoya, Complera, Odefsey, Descovy, and Biktarvy. Gilead paid high-volume prescribers tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars to present as “HIV Speakers.” The company also covered travel expenses for speakers, including those traveling long distances and to attractive destinations, such as Hawaii, Miami, and New Orleans, and hosted dinners at high-end restaurants. In New York, Gilead held dinners at several upscale restaurants including Del Posto, Asiate, and Palma. Gilead also held 157 HIV Speaker Programs at the James Beard House, making it one of Gilead’s most used venues for HIV Speaker Programs.

Gilead’s internal compliance mechanisms failed to halt these violations. The company maintained policies and procedures that failed to prevent its sales representatives from improperly offering incentives to induce prescriptions. Examples of this conduct include:

A nurse practitioner in New York City who attended 75 HIV Dinner Programs. This nurse practitioner attended 40 HIV Dinner Programs on the same topic three times or more within a six-month period. This nurse practitioner often brought their sibling—a pediatric nurse practitioner and non-prescriber of Gilead HIV drugs—to the programs.

In certain instances, the same group of doctors repeatedly attended the same HIV Speaker Programs together at various restaurants. For example, a group of ten doctors in Manhattan spoke at or attended approximately 384 HIV Dinner Programs at which the others were in attendance. Over 300 of these 384 HIV Dinner Programs were led by one of these 10 doctors. Each of the doctors repeatedly attended HIV Speaker Programs within 90 days of speaking on the same topic. In many instances, they attended a Dinner Program less than two weeks after speaking on the same topic.

Attorney General James thanks the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York for its partnership and assistance.

Joining Attorney General James in securing settlements with Gilead are the attorneys general of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

A National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units (NAMFCU) team participated in the investigation and conducted the settlement negotiations with Gilead on behalf of the states. In addition to New York, the team included representatives from the offices of the attorneys general of California, Indiana, North Carolina, and Virginia.

This matter was handled for New York by Assistant Attorneys General Jill D. Brenner and Nathan Shi, as well as Senior Auditor Investigator Tatum Serfilippi under the supervision of Medicaid Fraud Control Unit Director Amy Held and Assistant Deputy Attorney General Paul J. Mahoney. The Division of Criminal Justice is led by Chief Deputy Attorney General José Maldonado under the oversight of First Deputy Attorney General Jennifer Levy.

The counties affected are Delta, Mesa, and Montrose.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator (https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/find-pharmacy).

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices Page for updates (https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/notices/weather).

(NASDAQ: ) to $3.00 from $4.00 while maintaining a Sector Perform rating on the medical technology company’s stock. The stock, currently trading at $2.19, has fallen nearly 78% over the past year, with InvestingPro data showing it’s trading well below its 52-week high of $10.62.

The price target reduction follows Zynex’s first-quarter revenue miss and the company’s decision not to issue guidance for 2025, creating uncertainty about its financial outlook.

RBC Capital noted that Zynex is experiencing payment volatility from former Tricare payers and, more significantly, a complete suspension of payments from Tricare itself, which represents 20-25% of the company’s sales exposure.

The payment issues with Tricare, Zynex’s largest payer, remain unresolved, with the company recently announcing that Tricare is extending its payment pause while it reviews prior claims.

In response to these challenges, Zynex has implemented two rounds of workforce reductions in 2025, announcing a 14% staff cut on June 24 following an earlier 15% reduction in the first quarter.

In other recent news, Zynex, Inc. announced that Tricare, its largest insurance customer, will continue its temporary payment suspension as it conducts further review. This development creates uncertainty for Zynex’s revenue stream, as Tricare represents a significant portion of the company’s customer base. The company has not provided a timeline for when a final decision on the suspension might be reached. Additionally, Zynex has appointed Steven Dyson as the new CEO, effective August 18, 2025. Dyson, who has over 25 years of experience in the medical technology sector, is expected to refocus Zynex’s business strategy towards a more optimized payer mix.

In another development, Zynex has secured a UK patent for a multiparameter, noninvasive sepsis monitoring device. This technology aims to provide early alerts about a patient’s sepsis status, potentially contributing to earlier detection and reduced mortality rates. Furthermore, H.C. Wainwright has reiterated its Buy rating on Zynex stock, maintaining a price target of $8.00. The firm believes Dyson’s leadership will help Zynex return to a strong growth trajectory. These recent developments reflect Zynex’s ongoing efforts to strengthen its market position in the medical technology sector.

Hauschild, MPH, Defense Health Agency-Public Health

Most of us have had that “uh-oh” feeling usually accompanied by the desperate urge to find the “head” or “latrine” ASAP. This thought might be followed by, “Did I get some kind of stomach bug?”

Acute gastroenteritis illness, or AGI, commonly referred to as a “stomach bug,” can spread quickly through communities. It typically causes symptoms such as diarrhea, stomach pain or cramping, nausea, vomiting and sometimes fever and fatigue. Dehydration is a serious concern, especially in young children and older adults. Symptoms may last a day to over a week depending on the type of infection.

An AGI is often caused by a virus, bacteria, or parasite that has been unknowingly ingested, usually from a contaminated food or water source. These infections can lead to intense symptoms, including both vomiting and diarrhea, commonly described as “coming out both ends.”

Though AGIs occur year-round, they are often associated with food- and water-borne germs during the summer months, according to Defense Health Agency–Public Health experts.

“The cause may be traced to one’s own backyard, a local food source, or recreational activity,” said Dr. Charles McCannon, a medical doctor working for the preventive medicine division of the DHA-PH at Aberdeen, Maryland. “While the specific type of bug or germ responsible for the illness may not be identified, both the symptoms and the way to minimize the risk of getting sick are often the same.”

AGIs Are No Joke

“Most of the time, AGIs get better without treatment, but in certain people with weakened immune systems, the illness can become severe enough to require hospitalization or even cause death,” said McCannon.

Even in healthy adults, an AGI can impair a person’s ability to work and perform physical tasks, said McCannon. It can take days before symptoms improve, and a patient often needs time to rest for full recovery. Additionally, the dehydration and diarrhea associated with AGIs can also increase the risk of heat illness in hot environments.

The Military Is Not Immune

AGIs have long been a significant cause of illness among U.S. service members, said McCannon.

“In fact, U.S. service members have been found to be less likely to seek medical treatment than civilians,” he said. “By choosing to ‘tough it out’ while sick, service members are likely not going to be operating at their best and may increase the spread of germs to others in their units.”

AGI outbreaks in the military have resulted in temporary suspension of training, quarantining to barracks, efforts to disinfect barracks floors, and increased inspections of military eating establishments, said McCannon.

To identify possible outbreaks before they can affect military readiness, DHA-PH experts routinely monitor medical visits for several common AGI diseases. The diseases, categorized as reportable medical events, or RMEs, are required to be documented by military hospitals and clinics across all services in what’s called the DHA Disease Reporting System internet or DRSi (https://drsi.health.mil/DRSi).

To know the actual disease name, a patient must seek medical evaluation that includes laboratory testing to identify the specific type of virus, bacteria, or parasite. The diseases identified are reported in the Medical Surveillance Monthly Report, known as the MSMR (https://www.health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Health-Readiness/AFHSD/Reports-and-Publications/Medical-Surveillance-Monthly-Report). However, since many cases of AGI are not diagnosed with the specific diseases, the number of reported cases is much lower than the number of service members infected.

“Most of the AGIs have similar symptoms and most people ‘self-treat,’ meaning service members don’t seek medical treatment,” said McCannon. “So, we know the reported medical data are just the tip of the iceberg. The actual impact to military readiness is even larger than what is suggested by the numbers of cases.”

Understanding Food- and Water-Borne Diseases of Military Concern

The most frequently diagnosed food- and water-borne AGI disease is Norovirus, also referred to as the Norwalk virus (https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/index.html). In 2024, the next five most common AGI diseases in the military included campylobacteriosis (https://www.cdc.gov/campylobacter/about/index.html), salmonellosis (https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html), giardiasis (https://www.cdc.gov/giardia/about/index.html), E.coli (https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/about/index.html) infection, cryptosporidiosis (https://www.cdc.gov/cryptosporidium/about/index.html), and shigellosis (https://www.cdc.gov/shigella/about/index.html). Each year, thousands of service members seek medical treatment and are diagnosed with these diseases.

Most food- and water-borne diseases of military concern have similar symptoms and types of sources, said McCannon. In general, the germs that cause these diseases may last hours to days on surfaces and may live weeks, months or even years in some environments. Variations include time of symptom onset and duration of symptoms (https://www.fda.gov/food/consumers/what-you-need-know-about-foodborne-illnesses). Most patients are treated for the symptoms, though antibiotics may also be prescribed for some.

McCannon explains that these common diseases occur everywhere and are consistent with occurrences in the civilian population. Service members can be at higher risk of exposure when performing duties in field, operational, or other austere conditions. Less common diseases, like amebiasis (https://www.cdc.gov/amebiasis/about/index.html) and hepatitis A (https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-a/about/index.html) or, more rarely, botulism (https://www.cdc.gov/botulism/about/index.html), cholera (https://www.cdc.gov/cholera/about/index.html), Listeriosis (https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/about/index.html), and typhoid fever (https://www.cdc.gov/typhoid-fever/about/index.html), are often associated with exposures overseas.

“It might sound gross, but most of the viruses and bacteria transmitted in food and water sources initially come from fecal matter of an infected animal or human,” said McCannon. “Until a body’s immune system can fight them off, the germs often live and multiply in the gut. Then the infectious germs are excreted, especially in diarrhea and vomit.”

McCannon said diseases are spread when the microscopic infectious germs get into drinking water, meat or seafood products, onto fruits or vegetables, or on surfaces that have been contaminated by infectious food products. A patient may ingest the germs directly from a food or water source. Sometimes they are infected by touching their mouth after contact with a contaminated object.

While AGIs are not spread through the air, they can be passed from a sick person to other people by activity such as not washing hands properly after using the bathroom, or by touching doorknobs, phones, or utensils. This is why these diseases are considered infectious or communicable.

“As an example, Norwalk virus is considered a very contagious disease because the virus can easily be spread from a sick person to other people when they get virus particles on their hands from surfaces or items,” said McCannon. “The virus can survive 12 hours on hard surfaces. People who contact the contaminated surfaces of items and then touch their mouths can become sick.”

How Service Members Can Reduce Spread and Lower Risk

While there are no vaccines to prevent these specific diseases, they’re largely preventable by practicing good hygiene, cooking food thoroughly, consuming food and water from approved sources, and avoiding contact with contaminated sources, said McCannon.

He offered the following tips:

• Keep your hands clean—always!

o Wash hands with soap and water (https://www.cdc.gov/clean-hands/about/index.html) for at least 20 seconds often, especially:

• After contacting food, animals, other people who may be sick (or their clothing or linens they use)

• Before and after handling or touching food or utensils/surfaces.

o Use gloves to avoid contacting potential germs.

• Clean and disinfect:

o Areas where a person or pet recently had diarrhea or vomited

o Potentially contaminated food utensils or surfaces (such as those in contact with raw meat or unwashed produce)

• Cook meats and shellfish thoroughly. In general, processed meet like hamburgers should be well-done, with no pink showing. But since meat can brown before it's completely cooked–especially in outdoor grilling–it’s best to use a meat thermometer to ensure the meat is heated to at least 160 F (71 C) at its thickest point.

• Drink pasteurized milk, juice, and cider.

• Wash fruits and vegetables.

• Wash laundry in hot water.

• Avoid swallowing water while swimming.

• Boil or filter (https://www.cdc.gov/drinking-water/prevention/water-treatment-hiking-camping-traveling.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/travel/index.html) water from lakes, springs or rivers before drinking or preparing food with it.

Help Limit the Spread

Once sick, the most important thing a service member can do is help limit the spread, said McCannon. Avoiding contact with a sick person or their belongings is important, but that isn’t always practical.

“In certain military settings, close contact and shared quarters are a recognized concern,” he said.

McCannon recommended staying at home or isolating from casual contact with others as much as possible, ideally, for two days after symptoms stop. For more intimate contact, it’s best to wait much longer, like several weeks after you or your partner has been sick with an AGI.

While sick, don’t eat or drink anything that makes diarrhea worse, like dairy products, caffeine, or alcohol, said McCannon. Drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated. For most AGIs, treatment includes rest and fluids to help prevent dehydration and fatigue. But consider seeking medical evaluation for a specific diagnosis of diarrheal illness.

Knowing the name of the germ causing your stomach bug may not change the treatment, but knowing the diagnosis can help our military’s public health experts identify trends and address outbreaks to keep our forces strong.

BiomX, a clinical-stage biotechnology company, has recently made significant strides in its phage therapy development. The company successfully dosed the first patient in its Phase 2b trial for BX004, a treatment for cystic fibrosis patients with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections. This milestone has rekindled investor interest in BiomX's novel approach to treating antibiotic-resistant infections, which has been underperforming in recent years.

The Phase 2b trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving approximately 60 cystic fibrosis patients. The trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of BX004, with topline results expected in the first quarter of 2026. The therapy has already received both Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations from the FDA, potentially accelerating its development timeline.

BiomX's pipeline extends beyond its cystic fibrosis program. The company recently reported positive Phase 2 results for BX211, its phage therapy for diabetic foot osteomyelitis, showing statistically significant improvements in ulcer healing compared to placebo. This program has attracted $40 million in non-dilutive funding from the U.S. Defense Health Agency, highlighting its strategic importance in addressing battlefield wound infections as well as civilian medical needs.

Investors are particularly encouraged by the regulatory pathway for BX004. The company anticipates feedback from the FDA in the second half of 2025 regarding plans to use real-world evidence linking bacterial reduction to clinical outcomes, which could further streamline the approval process. Despite the recent drop in stock price, the company's innovative approach to phage therapy and its potential to address significant unmet medical needs continue to attract investor attention.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,0.0,2025-07-15 07:56:16.786869

[WASHINGTON, D.C.] — Combat Veteran and U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL)—who served in the Reserve Forces for 23 years and had both of her daughters through in vitro fertilization (IVF)—successfully secured a provision in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) approved last week which would require TRICARE coverage of fertility services, including IVF for servicemembers who rely on it to build their families.

The SASC-passed bill will soon be considered by the full Senate.

“Even before I was wounded, I had made the difficult decision to delay building a family because I knew getting pregnant would impact my ability to be an Army aviator and to advance in the career I loved. Because of the miracle of IVF—and my access to reproductive healthcare through the VA—I’m now a mom to two beautiful girls. The reality is that members of the uniformed services face unique challenges when trying to start or build a family, and studies show that servicemembers and Veterans have higher rates of infertility compared to the general population. Given how much we ask of our heroes, we should do what we can to support them in building their families.

“After successfully securing this provision in last year’s bill that passed through committee, I’m so proud my colleagues helped me build on this progress to include it in this year’s bill as well. It’s past time our nation provides uniformed servicemembers with the same access to IVF that all Members of Congress already have and ensure our heroes can access the fertility treatment they need to start the families they’ve dreamed of.”

Military Foot & Ankle Conditions We Treat

Tired of long waits on base for simple foot problems? We frequently treat:

Plantar fasciitis and chronic heel pain

Achilles tendinitis and calf tightness

Chronic or recurrent ankle sprains

Bunion pain and big toe joint stiffness

Toenail trauma from military boots or ruck marches

Running-related injuries from PT testing or training

Postural and gait issues affecting performance

Many military patients come to us after delaying care due to wait times or limited access on base. Once they’re here, they receive a thorough evaluation, clear answers, and a fast track to recovery.

Patient Testimonials

“I suffered for years with foot and ankle pain. I tried orthotics, PRP, and multiple rounds of physical therapy on base, but nothing helped. I was told surgery might be the only fix because of a tendon tear. Then I found Dr. Repko. Two months later, I’m pain-free—no surgery, no downtime. I’m still amazed.”

,,2025-07-14 18:45:06+00:00,DefenseScoop,Pentagon reviewing payment applications from Havana Syndrome victims - DefenseScoop,Jon Harper,,,,,https://defensescoop.com/2025/07/14/havana-syndrome-dod-military-payment-applications/,"The Defense Department has started reviewing applications from personnel seeking financial compensation for brain health issues associated with the phenomenon known as Havana Syndrome, according to the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson.
“Although there are reports that predate these incidents, the media originally called these phenomena Havana Syndrome, as they were the first to garner public attention.
“The Department of Defense has begun reviewing applications by DoD personnel for payments pursuant to the Helping American Victims Afflicted by Neurological Attacks Act of 2021 (HAVANA Act),” chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement Friday.
The Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service (DCPAS) is responsible for administering the HAVANA Act-related payment program for the Pentagon.
“DCPAS will collect and review applications that have been submitted, using the DD Form 3220, ‘Eligibility Questionnaire for HAVANA Act Payments,’ claim form, to the HAVANA Act email address (dodhra.mc-alex.dcpas.mbx.dod-havana-act@mail.mil).","The Defense Department has started reviewing applications from personnel seeking financial compensation for brain health issues associated with the phenomenon known as Havana Syndrome, according to the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson.

The term Havana Syndrome was coined after people working at the U.S. Embassy in Cuba’s capital city in 2016 reported a sudden onset of symptoms that had no obvious cause, including vertigo, imbalance, blurry vision, tinnitus, headache, hearing loss, nausea and cognitive dysfunction.

“Although there are reports that predate these incidents, the media originally called these phenomena Havana Syndrome, as they were the first to garner public attention. Such events have affected U.S. government employees, military servicemembers, and their families in countries around the world, and are now referred to as anomalous health incidents (AHI) by the U.S. government,” the Government Accountability Office explained in a July 2024 report, which also highlighted challenges that sufferers faced in accessing the Military Health System.

Congress several years ago passed legislation that authorized federal agencies to compensate affected employees, former employees and dependents for qualifying brain injuries.

“The Department of Defense has begun reviewing applications by DoD personnel for payments pursuant to the Helping American Victims Afflicted by Neurological Attacks Act of 2021 (HAVANA Act),” chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement Friday.

“Under the HAVANA Act, DoD employees and their covered dependents who suffered qualifying brain injuries on or after January 1, 2016, in connection with certain Anomalous Health Incidents (AHI), are eligible for a one-time payment. The Department is committed to helping DoD personnel affected by AHIs,” he added.

A House Intelligence subcommittee report issued last December noted that Havana Syndrome incidents have also been reported in Austria, China, Colombia, Georgia, Germany, India, Poland, Russia and Vietnam, as well as the United States.

Estimates vary as to the number of individuals affected by the problem, GAO noted in last year’s report. As of January 2024, 334 people had qualified for care in the Military Health System, according to the government watchdog.

Some observers believe that incidents of Havana Syndrome may have been intentionally caused by adversaries using pulsed radio-frequency energy or focused ultrasound devices, but others are skeptical.

“Various government agencies and medical researchers have conducted studies on aspects of AHIs, but none have isolated a cause,” the GAO report stated.

A study by a panel of U.S. intelligence community experts — whose findings were declassified in 2022 — found that “known medical and environmental conditions, including psychosocial factors, could not explain some AHI cases with abrupt-onset, location dependent, audio-vestibular phenomena. It concluded that various forms of pulsed radiofrequency energy, as well as focused ultrasound in close access scenarios, were plausible explanations for these cases, though information gaps existed,” according to the GAO report, which noted that the experts “did not address the question of attribution to an actor, including the question of whether a foreign actor may be involved.”

Another IC assessment, released in March 2023, concluded it was “very unlikely” that a foreign adversary was responsible for the reported incidents, and that deliberate causal mechanisms were “very unlikely” to have produced the sensory phenomena and symptoms associated with them — although confidence levels in those conclusions varied among the IC agencies, per the GAO report.

Leadership of a GOP-led House Intelligence subcommittee criticized the 2023 IC assessment, saying it “lacked analytic integrity.”

“It appears increasingly likely and the Chairman is convinced that a foreign adversary is behind some AHIs,” officials wrote in a subcommittee report released in December 2024.

A former U.S. Army officer who led an official investigation told journalists from the show 60 Minutes that he believed Russia was behind attacks that caused Havana Syndrome symptoms, according to CBS News.

The Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service (DCPAS) is responsible for administering the HAVANA Act-related payment program for the Pentagon.

“DCPAS will collect and review applications that have been submitted, using the DD Form 3220, ‘Eligibility Questionnaire for HAVANA Act Payments,’ claim form, to the HAVANA Act email address (dodhra.mc-alex.dcpas.mbx.dod-havana-act@mail.mil). Individuals applying on behalf of a covered employee or covered dependent must provide documentation demonstrating the individual is authorized to act on behalf of the applicant,” Jules Hurst III, acting undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, wrote in a June 20 memo, which provides details about the adjudication, payment and appeals processes.

“DCPAS may consult with offices within the Office of the Secretary of Defense to determine whether the incident causing the injury was in connection with war, insurgency, hostile act, or terrorist activity. For applications involving incidents that have been designated by DoD as ‘other incidents’ … DCPAS will request that the applicant or Director, Defense Health Agency, provide a designation letter … to validate that an incident at a particular location has been reported and the covered employee or covered dependent is authorized to receive medical care from DoD in relation to the incident,” Hurst wrote in the memo.",https://defensescoop.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2020/06/6192861.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-14 15:56:25.587524

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: The TRICARE referral and authorization waiver for the West Region expired on June 30. Providers must now follow standard TRICARE requirements for all new outpatient services.

The U.S. Defense Health Agency has confirmed that the temporary waiver of referral and authorization requirements for TRICARE Prime beneficiaries in the West Region ended on June 30, 2025. As of July 1, 2025, all outpatient services for TRICARE Prime patients once again require appropriate referrals and authorizations in accordance with standard TRICARE guidelines.

The waiver was initially enacted to ease administrative burdens during the transition of managed care responsibilities to TriWest Healthcare Alliance (TriWest), which assumed management of TRICARE West Region services on January 1, 2025. Under the waiver, providers did not need to submit referral or authorization requests for TRICARE Prime patients seeking TRICARE-covered outpatient services, with some exceptions.

Referrals for care that extend beyond June 30, 2025, will need to follow the prior established TRICARE referral and authorization requirements and obtain approval to continue care after June 30. Referrals issued after June 30, 2025, will be subject to normal TRICARE referral and authorization requirements.

Providers are strongly encouraged to review the TriWest TRICARE Provider Handbook and referral protocols to avoid disruptions in care or reimbursement issues effective July 1.

I’m proud to help lead this effort, and I thank the Problem Solvers Caucus for endorsing this bipartisan solution.
The Problem Solvers Caucus gladly endorses this bill, and we’ll keep working across the aisle to help military families in whatever way we can,” said Problem Solvers Caucus Co-Chair Congressman Tom Suozzi (NY-03).
(link is external) ### The Problem Solvers Caucus is a group of Members of Congress — split between Republicans and Democrats — committed to advancing common-sense solutions to key issues facing our nation.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the Problem Solvers Caucus announced its endorsement of the TRICARE OB-GYN Treatment and Access without Lags in Care (TOTAL Care) Act, bipartisan legislation to make it easier for women enrolled in TRICARE Prime to access OB-GYN services.

Under current TRICARE Prime rules, beneficiaries must obtain a referral before visiting an OB-GYN, even for routine care like annual exams or prenatal appointments. This requirement often leads to delays and unnecessary administrative burdens for military families who already frequently face gaps in healthcare access due to relocations and deployments.

The TOTAL Care Act would remove outdated referral requirements for OB-GYN care under TRICARE Prime to ensure timely access to essential reproductive and maternal health services. Specifically, the bill would:

Allow TRICARE Prime beneficiaries to access OB-GYN care without a referral

Permit patients to designate an OB-GYN as a primary care provider

Allow OB-GYNs to directly order related services without extra approvals

The bipartisan legislation was introduced by Representatives Steven Horsford (NV-04), Maria Salazar (FL-27), and Chrissy Houlahan (PA-06) and has 12 additional cosponsors, four of whom are Members of the Problem Solvers Caucus. The bill was brought forward for Caucus endorsement by Representatives Horsford and Salazar.

“Ensuring military personnel and their loved ones have the best care available isn’t partisan politics – it’s common sense,” said Congressman Steven Horsford (NV-04). “I’m proud to partner with Rep. Salazar on the TOTAL Care Act, and I’m grateful for the Problem Solvers Caucus’ endorsement. Our legislation cuts through red tape to ensure servicemembers have access to the same, high-quality care that every other American has.”

""Our women in uniform risk their lives to defend this country, yet they’re forced to navigate unnecessary bureaucracy just to see an OB-GYN. That’s unacceptable,"" said Congresswoman María Salazar (FL-27). ""The TOTAL Care Act fixes that. I’m proud to help lead this effort, and I thank the Problem Solvers Caucus for endorsing this bipartisan solution. This is not a partisan issue, it’s about basic dignity, respect, and doing right by the servicewomen who fight for us. Together, we’re cutting the red tape and delivering the care they’ve earned.""

""OB-GYN care is primary care,” said Congresswoman Chrissy Houlahan (PA-06). “As a veteran, I am proud to stand with my colleagues to introduce this long overdue legislation to ensure our servicemembers and their families receive care in line with their civilian counterparts and without additional referrals or barriers. Servicemembers and their families should not be unfairly burdened simply because they raised their right hands in service. This bipartisan effort eliminates redundancy and delays and ensures access to critical women's healthcare.""

“Cutting down red tape to allow service members and their families easier access to critical care is a common sense fix. The Affordable Care Act got rid of the need for referrals for this kind of coverage years ago — leaving out members of our military is legislative oversight. The Problem Solvers Caucus gladly endorses this bill, and we’ll keep working across the aisle to help military families in whatever way we can,” said Problem Solvers Caucus Co-Chair Congressman Tom Suozzi (NY-03).

“The TOTAL Care Act is a smart, bipartisan fix that removes an outdated barrier to care and restores direct OB-GYN access for military families under TRICARE. It reflects exactly the kind of commonsense, patient-first reform I’ve long championed—cutting bureaucracy, improving care delivery, and ensuring our servicemembers and their families get the support they’ve earned,” said Problem Solvers Caucus Co-Chair Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01). “The Problem Solvers are proud to support this effort—and we’ll continue championing bipartisan solutions that ensure our military families receive the care, respect, and commitment their service has earned.”

Find a doctor in the West region

Find a doctor in the East region

You don't need a referral from a military doc, just find an in-network urologist in your region, call and make an appointment. Your health insurance card is your CAC and/or your SSN.

That said, you really need to go to the doctor more, at least to get an annual physical done. You might feel healthy now but you never know what a physical might catch, a lot of medical issues show no symptoms until they're severe, but easily treated if caught early. The copays are absurdly cheap and in my experience most clinics accept TRS.

You haven't been to the doctor and gotten an annual physical / check up? Or even gone to urgent care? If nothing else, I would highly recommend finding a primary family care doctor. Please get in the habit of preventative care.

Practically - you can go to your Tricare provider's website (mine is Triwest) and look up in network doctors. Or. start with the Tricare website and go from there. From there you can work out which hospitals / clinics / specialties are covered. I don't know if you need a referral for a urologist, but once you find out if they are in network you can call their office and find out.

But part of finding out who is in network will also let you know which urgent care / emergency room is in network so you don't need to stress about where you can go / who covers you when you actually need care in the moment.",,N,0.0,2025-07-14 16:56:16.176866

Charles Rhyee has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors that highlight Talkspace’s promising growth trajectory. The company is expected to achieve significant payor revenue growth, particularly with a 35% year-over-year increase, as it expands its Medicare and TRICARE contributions through 2025. Management has indicated that TRICARE is performing better than anticipated, benefiting from efficient marketing strategies and lower competition, which supports a positive outlook.

Furthermore, Talkspace’s strategic focus on enhancing utilization in the Payor segment is anticipated to yield returns on marketing investments in the latter half of 2025. The company has reaffirmed its revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance, with expectations of a stronger performance in the fourth quarter. This strategic positioning, along with the potential for revenue reacceleration, underpins Rhyee’s confidence in Talkspace’s future prospects, justifying the Buy rating.
