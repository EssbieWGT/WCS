Walter’s Way: Proactive Booking to Improve Specialty Care

By Roan Smith, WRNMMC Hospital Communications

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center is making it easier for patients to schedule specialty care appointments with a new system called proactive booking. This new method is a more efficient and simplified process designed to get patients seen faster.

Launched in September 2025 with Walter Reed’s Orthopedics Department and expanded to include Oncology as of Nov. 1, proactive booking is part of the Walter’s Way initiative to improve access to care and medical readiness.

With this new approach, patients no longer need to call the Integrated Referral Management and Appointment Center (IRMAC) to schedule specialty appointments. Instead, trained bookers review accepted referrals and reach out directly to patients to schedule appointments, including virtual visits when available.

“The goal is to make sure every appointment slot is filled, and that patients get the care they need as quickly as possible,” said Cindy Cruzan, a Walter Reed nurse.

This new process helps Walter Reed ensure that active-duty service members receive timely specialty care while continuing to support retirees and family members.

“This process lets us manage appointments more efficiently,” Cruzan added. “And improves access for everyone.”

More departments are expected to adopt proactive booking in the months ahead as Walter Reed continues to expand efforts that simplify access and enhance patient experience.

Female breast cancer accounted for the highest cancer incidence rate for the ten leading cancers among active-duty members of the military between 2018 and 2022. Innovative research funded by the BCRP contributes to high-impact advances in clinical practice and treatment used within the Military Health System. Continued breast cancer research gives hope to current and future members of the military, and helps Warfighters stay mission-ready while knowing their Families receive the best care available.

According to data provided by the Defense Medical Surveillance System of the Defense Health Agency, on average, the Military Health System provided care for 67,739 women and 507 men for invasive breast cancer annually between 2015 and 2024, including an average of 420 active-duty military members each year. For females 40-59 years of age, the incidence rate of breast cancer is https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.34978 in Service Members compared to the general population.

Environmental Exposures and Breast Cancer Risk Among Military Women

Throughout their service, members of the military may experience environmental exposures to substances that can increase the risk of developing cancer. The Department of Veterans Affairs recognizes female breast cancer as a presumptive cancer related to burn pit exposure.

In fiscal year 2019, the BCRP funded a Breakthrough Award – Funding Level 2 – Population Science and Prevention Studies – Partnering Principal Investigator Option, led by Celia Byrne, Ph.D., at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, and Mary Beth Terry, Ph.D., at Columbia University, to investigate the association between environmental exposures and breast cancer risk for women serving in the military.

“For our project, CDMRP funding has been critical in supporting research into the reasons why young, active-duty military women are experiencing an increase in early onset breast cancer,” Byrne and Terry said. “CDMRP’s emphasis on the need for innovative and novel approaches to studying breast cancer risk allowed us to design a study to evaluate the impact of environmental determinants of breast cancer and the potential for impact of exposures that, while common in the civilian population, may be more prevalent with military service.”

Byrne and Terry’s study builds on existing resources within the Department of Defense. The team identifies cases of breast cancer diagnoses in active-duty women using the DOD’s Cancer Registry, a registry documenting tumors and cancers across the Military Health System. Then, the researchers obtain pre-diagnostic serum samples from the same individuals through the DOD’s Serum Repository, which stores blood samples collected from active-duty military members. To date, the researchers identified over 850 breast cancer cases from the cancer repository.

By combining biospecimens and other data, including genetic information and blood-based biomarkers of environmental exposures, the researchers aim to answer longstanding questions regarding potential associations between environmental exposures and risk of breast cancer in specific populations.

“Rather than only looking at genetic factors alone, we must consider how women at higher genetic risk of developing breast cancer might be more susceptible to the influences of these environmental exposures,” Byrne and Terry said.

Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Vaccine Advances to Clinical Trials

Triple-negative breast cancer, an aggressive subtype associated with fast-growing tumors that often spread to other parts of the body, accounts for approximately https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21863 of all breast cancers. This subtype represents a larger proportion of breast cancers among younger women, including the age range for active-duty military service, compared to other age groups. Triple-negative breast cancer lacks estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors and large amounts of HER2/neu protein commonly used as targets for the treatment of other breast cancer subtypes, limiting treatment options.

In fiscal year 2016, the BCRP funded a Breakthrough Award – Funding Level 3 – Clinical Trial – Partnering Principal Investigator Option, led by the late Vincent Tuohy, Ph.D., George Budd, M.D., and Thaddeus Stappenbeck, M.D., Ph.D., at the Cleveland Clinic, to conduct a phase 1 clinical trial testing a vaccine for triple-negative breast cancer. The vaccine generates an immune response to alpha-lactalbumin, a milk protein expressed in the breast during late pregnancy and lactation. Most triple-negative breast cancers express high levels of alpha-lactalbumin, making this protein a potential target for treatment or prevention.

The investigators aim to determine the best dose and safety of the vaccine in females recently diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer who recovered from current standard of care therapy. The researchers also test the vaccine in healthy subjects who elected prophylactic mastectomy because of their familial risk for breast cancer.

“CDMRP's BCRP has been a vital source of funding for studies of novel approaches to breast cancer treatment and prevention,” Budd said. “Thanks to the CDMRP, we have been able to perform a first-in-human trial of a vaccine designed to prevent or treat breast cancer.”

With an early phase clinical trial underway, the research team’s work will inform the next set of clinical trials, demonstrating potential to move new treatments and preventative approaches to patients.

Improving Care in the Military Health System

Since the program’s inception in 1992, BCRP-funded research contributed to the development of digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis, also known as 3D mammogram, now adopted as the standard of care for breast imaging and breast cancer detection across all health care sectors, including those where Service Members and their Families seek care.

According to data provided by the DHA Pharmacy Operations Division, Military Health Service providers filled more than 132,900 prescriptions between 2007 and 2024 for FDA-approved drugs developed in part by BCRP-funded research: abemaciclib, palbociclib, ribociclib and trastuzumab.

In 2023, the DHA expanded a genetic testing pilot program for Service Members and their Families to include the Breast Cancer Index®. Research funded by the BCRP contributed to the development of this prognostic test that evaluates the likelihood of recurrence and benefit from extended anti-estrogen therapy.

Kara Kenan, a disabled U.S. Air Force Veteran due to breast cancer diagnosis, received the Breast Cancer Index test after experiencing side effects from anti-estrogen therapy during the first five years after breast cancer treatment.

“I finally had the Breast Cancer Index test, which indicated I wasn't really getting any additional benefit from continuing on hormonal treatments. I was able to come off of [the treatment], and my body was really grateful because that treatment was really difficult.” Kenan said.

Kenan served as a fiscal year 2024 BCRP peer reviewer, sharing her experiences to help ensure funded research addresses the concerns and need of patients, including Service Members and Veterans.

“I think we are in a renaissance of what is happening with cancer treatments and diagnostics,” Kenan said. “There's so much going on right now, and it is all so very exciting.”",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,0.0,2025-12-01 07:56:40.212528

Thousands of providers were not paid on time throughout the country, said Eileen Huck with the National Military Families Association.
""But I think what we may see is that providers are limiting the number of Tricare patients that they'll accept, or just deciding that they won't accept new Tricare patients.""
For 2026, most Tricare health plan costs for military families and retirees will go up between 2% and 3% next year.
The charges are in line with what Tricare patients have seen over the last several years, Huck said.","For the first half of 2025, mental health providers in Hampton Roads complained that the military health insurance Tricare was not paying providers on time.

Ramsey Goshert with Mission Harbor Counseling in Virginia Beach was one of several mental health counseling services in the area who did not get paid on time for several months by the contractors hired by the Defense Health Agency to run Tricare. Payments are now arriving on time, but the billing issues put a strain on providers and patients, he said.

The larger issue is because of Tricare's ""completely insulting reimbursement rates, many providers are no longer participating,"" Goshert said. ""This is making it increasingly difficult for Tricare beneficiaries to find a provider, especially therapy.""

Changes in Tricare administration at the start of the year contributed to the issues. A new contractor, TriWest Healthcare Alliance, was put in place to run the western part of the country.

Humana Military, which administers Tricare in the eastern part of the country, changed the subcontractor which handles their claims. Thousands of providers were not paid on time throughout the country, said Eileen Huck with the National Military Families Association.

Mental health providers, some of which didn't see payments for several months, were hit particularly hard, she said.

""A small mental health provider or speech therapist or physical therapist, somebody who's seeing a patient multiple times over the course of a few weeks or months,"" she said. ""If they're not getting reimbursed, that's really something that they just can't sustain.""

NMFA is one of the groups that pushed Congress to place language in the new defense bill that will require DHA to report on what caused the 2025 Tricare delays.

""I don't know where the breakdown occurred, but I think that it's on DHA to make sure that they are exercising very close oversight during what is a very complicated process,"" she said.

Many of the payment delays were resolved by the second half of the year, but not before causing massive disruption for the 9.4 million troops, military families and retirees around the country which use Tricare, she said.

""When I ask if they are seeing providers leave the network, they have consistently said that they are not seeing that,"" Huck said. ""But I think what we may see is that providers are limiting the number of Tricare patients that they'll accept, or just deciding that they won't accept new Tricare patients.""

And cost increases are coming for families as well. For 2026, most Tricare health plan costs for military families and retirees will go up between 2% and 3% next year. The price of prescription drugs will increase more than 15%. The charges are in line with what Tricare patients have seen over the last several years, Huck said.

""Certainly anytime there's a cost increase, especially when the cost of living is already so high, and we know a lot of families are struggling financially, the last thing we want to see is, you know, struggling to afford health care.""

“Our technical experts are committed to delivering state-of-the-art predictive modeling solutions that enhance military medical planning.","Core4ce has won the Role 4 Modeling Tool development contract from the Army Contracting Command through the Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation’s TReX II consortium. The consortium focuses on identifying, developing and testing modeling, simulation and training capabilities at a faster pace.

The Role 4 Modeling Tool will serve as an enterprise predictive planning system for the Defense Health Agency and medical planners across the combatant commands. The tool will support large-scale casualty flow planning by identifying available specialized care across military treatment facilities and other designated National Disaster Medical System sites.

“This award marks a significant step forward in supporting the Department of War and the Joint Force in their combat support missions, particularly in planning scenarios related to large-scale combat operations,” said Core4ce’s Vice President of Advanced IT Solutions Stevyn Buie. “The development of the Role 4 Medical Modeling and Simulation Tool will better enable DHA to model casualty flow across MTFs, the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, the private sector, and activated National Disaster Medical System facilities.”

Core4ce’s modeling and simulation teams have a strong record of applying advanced analytics and machine learning to deliver actionable insights. In work for NIWC Atlantic and the Program Executive Office for Defense Healthcare Management Systems, the company developed a Biosurveillance Hub & Portal proof of concept to detect, analyze and track potential biothreats through predictive modeling. The effort focused on building predictive threat models and tailored biosurveillance tools to improve decision-making and strengthen operational effectiveness.

“Core4ce is proud to serve as a partner to the Defense Health Agency in its mission to ensure our medical force is ready to deliver care in any combat environment,” said Core4ce CEO Mike Morehouse. “Our technical experts are committed to delivering state-of-the-art predictive modeling solutions that enhance military medical planning. This contract underscores our dedication to advancing the Department of War’s operational readiness and ensuring our warfighters receive optimal support.”",https://washingtonexec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dod-pentagon-Kiyoshi-Tanno-.jpg,N,0.0,2025-11-30 18:56:19.747819

To get Tricare doula coverage, work with OBGYNs and CNMs who accept Tricare and have a participation agreement.
Childbirth and Breastfeeding Support Tricare benefits cover breastfeeding support services and demonstrations.
When hiring a Tricare doula, talk to them about your partner's current work situation.
Doulas may take other specific trainings, such as LGBTQ+ doulas, abortion doulas, and more.","The easy answer? Yes, Tricare-authorized doulas are an option when giving birth as a military spouse or as someone with Tricare. If you are giving birth at a military hospital or clinic, this information does not apply to you. Unfortunately, if you are at a military hospital or clinic, you cannot get coverage for certified labor doulas.

A Tricare doula doesn’t necessarily mean that you have coverage. To get Tricare doula coverage, work with OBGYNs and CNMs who accept Tricare and have a participation agreement. To find a Tricare authorized doula, please reach out to me via email.

I keep a list of Tricare-authorized doulas organized by location. If you plan to give birth in Southeast CT or in Charleston, SC, I have you covered. Whether you plan to give birth at home or in a hospital, many of these doulas have experience with both options.

Childbirth and Breastfeeding Support

Tricare benefits cover breastfeeding support services and demonstrations. They also include doula support during childbirth. You can get up to 8 hours of visits before or after birth. Whether you’re 20 weeks pregnant, 27 weeks pregnant, or 36 weeks pregnant, you can always benefit from a certified labor doula.

During your prenatal or postnatal care, you can schedule up to 8 hours of visits, split into 15-minute increments. This support could include working on birth plans, labor and delivery education, breastfeeding support, and more. Tricare childbirth and breastfeeding coverage plans are to expand even more after December 31, 2026.

Through Tricare, you can also receive coverage for breastfeeding counseling through lactation consultants or lactation counselors. Coverage may not include IBCLCs, but working with a lactation counselor or consultant is important for postpartum support.

Benefits of Working with a Tricare Doula for Military Spouses

My daughter is the child of someone who is Active Duty, and this specific topic is important to me. Giving birth alone can be an isolating experience, and one that I had my own journey with. For military spouses, working with a Tricare authorized doula is critical in my eyes. It protects you from being alone during the birthing process. And having a doula present means someone is always there, focused on you.

Whether your partner is deployed, working state-side, out to sea, or what have you, it can be tricky to ensure your partner will be there for the birth of your child. Working with a doula ensures you have someone there, focused on you, who can also help navigate notifying your spouse or trying to reach their command. Either way, when a doula is free through Tricare, to me, this is a no-brainer.

When hiring a Tricare doula, talk to them about your partner's current work situation. With your doula, have a conversation about what their day-to-day might look like in the two weeks before or after your due date—ensure to always remember OPSEC.

You may notify their ombudsman or similar that the doula may be calling with an update, and what the doula’s name and phone number are. You can also create a group chat with your partner and doula once you hit 36 weeks to notify them both of your progress.

Specialized Labor and Post Partum Doulas

The birthing event itself can be supported by a doula, but did you know that there are specialized doulas? The National Black Doulas Association offers doula support for BIPOC folks. Doulas may take other specific trainings, such as LGBTQ+ doulas, abortion doulas, and more. If it matters to you that a doula has special experience or training, ask them about it.

Great questions to ask in the interview process include the following:

How do most of your clients benefit from working with you?

What are the common struggles for your clients?

Do you have personal experience giving birth? How does that come up in your work as a doula?

How long have you been a Tricare authorized doula?

Do you offer breastfeeding support demonstrations?

What is your favorite part about being a doula?

What got you interested in becoming a doula?

How did you choose your doula training program?",https://assets.squarespace.com/universal/default-favicon.ico,N,1.0,2025-11-29 18:56:21.426183

TRICARE Costs and Key Charges

Understanding the TRICARE cost is highly effective because every plan is associated with specific charges, which directly influence how the better and their family members pay for care:

How to Enroll in TRICARE

Verify the eligibility before moving ahead with TRICARE enrollment or benefits:

Ensure that your DEERS information is accurate, and then head towards the milConnect portal.

Explore the selected plan’s tools, such as the Plan Finder, to compare the plans to understand which plan fits into your status as well as your needs.

Once you pick a relevant plan, go to the tab of Beneficiaries Web Enrollment, which is BWE, to submit the enrollment or by the purchase prompt.

If you require any help, then you can contact the offline helpline support number, which is 800-538-9552 to confirm eligibility.

Choosing TRICARE Insurance Guide for Veterans & Families

Begin by understanding which beneficiary categories completely align with your situation so that you can understand what the available plans are for you:

If they are active duty members, they can utilize the official TRICARE tool, which is a Plan Finder, to understand their eligibility by providing a zip code as well as sponsorship information.

An applicant belonging to active duty families or those who have newly added can ensure that their DEERS information is updated.

As for Active duty applicants the initial enrollment is often automatic, but still the plan changes within the span of 90 days.

Once you finalize your plan selection, enrollment will be done through the milConnect WEB portal or even via through mail or phone as per the region’s guidance.

Once enrolled it is always advisable to check the network directory of your region, whether East or West, to confirm which military or civilian hospitals or clinics are covered under this plan.

Getting TRICARE Healthcare Services for Members

TRICARE members can get significant access to care at medical facilities or even approved clinical providers as managed by the Department of Defense. The availability is exceptionally dependent on the location and beneficiary category as well as the plan type.

In addition to medical facilities, an applicant can also choose convenient access for care that is close to their home, while non-network providers also have an option in certain circumstances. But this may lead to higher out-of-pocket costs along with extra steps for claim submission.

New TRICARE Updates

TRICARE has recently rolled out clear guidance and a more streamlined set of instructions, which came to help beneficiaries avail of health coverage options.

The latest highlights emphasize how users can get eligibility via DEERS and explore plans via tools such as Plan Finder, along with seeking care from civilian or military providers depending on the plan rules.

It also makes sure that TRICARE’s dental, medical, and vision as well as pharmacy offerings remain available globally, which gets the regional partner support.

The association made the comments in a press release and to federal MPs in a committee meeting in Ottawa.
CADA said dealers have invested heavily in the EV transition.
“The expectations set out in the ZEV mandate do not match what is happening in the marketplace,” said Tim Reuss, CADA President, in a statement.
“Current EV targets simply don’t reflect what we’re seeing on the ground,” said Charles Bernard, CADA’s Chief Economist.","The Canadian Automobile Dealers Association is urging Ottawa to reset the federal Zero-Emission Vehicle mandate, arguing that current sales targets are no longer realistic for consumers or the market.

The association made the comments in a press release and to federal MPs in a committee meeting in Ottawa.

CADA said dealers have invested heavily in the EV transition. But the association now warns the pace set by government is out of step with affordability pressures and limited product availability. Cost remains the biggest obstacle for buyers. National figures show 67 per cent of Canadians expect to spend under $500 a month on a vehicle.

“The expectations set out in the ZEV mandate do not match what is happening in the marketplace,” said Tim Reuss, CADA President, in a statement. “With affordability concerns rising and new pressure created by U.S. tariffs, continuing on the current path risks making vehicles even more expensive for Canadians and undermining the competitiveness of our sector.”

CADA released figures saying the average payment a month on a vehicle has climbed to $770 for leases and $880 for loans. These are increases driven by tariffs, supply constraints and rising interest costs. Dealers say those numbers are pushing many households to postpone replacing older vehicles.

CADA said uneven charging infrastructure and weaker EV demand in rural regions add further strain. “Current EV targets simply don’t reflect what we’re seeing on the ground,” said Charles Bernard, CADA’s Chief Economist. “Canadians are under growing financial pressure, and policy has to align with what consumers can actually afford.”

Appearing before the committee CADA proposed suspending the mandate until Canada’s trade negotiations with the U.S. and Mexico conclude, counting all hybrids toward future targets, aligning provincial and federal frameworks, excluding EVs and hybrids from the luxury tax, and preventing companies without a Canadian manufacturing or retail footprint from profiting through credit sales.",https://tricorauto.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cropped-tricor-favicon-O-32x32.png,N,0.0,2025-11-29 22:57:00.880516

Therefore, investors can confidently bet on BigBear.ai stock.
However, to say BigBear.ai is the “next NVIDIA” is premature.","The artificial intelligence (AI) boom has fueled rapid growth for NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, whose shares increased 33.2% over the past year. However, in the same period, the smaller BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc. BBAI capitalized on the rising demand for the AI software solutions market and climbed 181%. Does this imply that BigBear.ai could become the “next NVIDIA” and merit investor attention now? Let’s see –

2 Reasons to be Bullish on BigBear.ai Stock

At the beginning of the year, the federal government’s willingness to boost domestic growth in technology fueled BigBear.ai’s shares to record highs. However, later, President Trump’s substantial cuts to federal spending impacted BigBear.ai’s share price. As a result of the reduced funding, BigBear.ai’s revenues fell 20% year over year to $33.1 million in the third quarter, following an 18% year-over-year decline to $32.5 million in the second quarter.

But BigBear.ai’s top-line performance is poised to rebound following its definitive deal to acquire Ask Sage for $250 million, which is a rapidly expanding generative AI platform built for secure AI deployment in regulated fields, including defense and national security, citing ir.bigbear.ai. Ask Sage is widely adopted, with agencies ranging from the Defense Health Agency to the US Space Force employing it. Now, Ask Sage supports 100,000 users across 16,000 government teams.

CEO of BigBear.ai, Kevin McAleenan, said, “by integrating Ask Sage with BigBear.ai, we are creating what the market has been asking for: a secure, integrated AI platform that connects software, data, and mission services in one place.” Banking on the Ask Sage acquisition to accelerate revenue growth, BigBear.ai is sticking to its full-year sales guidance between $125 million and $140 million.

In addition to an expected improvement in revenues, BigBear.ai also benefits from a strong balance sheet. Its balance sheet strengthened sequentially, culminating in a record $456.6 million in cash as of September 30, 2025, giving the company a strong foundation to ramp up growth. A strong cash position will help BigBear.ai to fund growth initiatives, pursue additional acquisitions, and scale its operations at a faster pace.

Is BBAI Worth Investing In Now? Could it be the Next NVIDIA?

BigBear.ai is set for growth with the Ask Sage acquisition and a strong cash cushion, and McAleenan expects the increased government spending next year, thanks to Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” to further boost the company’s business. Lest we forget, the company did post a net income of $2.5 million for the third quarter, whereas it had posted a net loss of $15.1 million in the same period a year ago, a significant milestone toward profitability.

Brokers are also optimistic about BigBear.ai’s growth in the future. Consequently, they forecast the average short-term price target for BBAI stock at $6.67, reflecting a 10.8% increase from the last closing price of $6.02. The highest target is $8, suggesting a potential upside of 32.9%. Therefore, investors can confidently bet on BigBear.ai stock. BigBear.ai carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment.

However, to say BigBear.ai is the “next NVIDIA” is premature. This is because BigBear.ai’s loss from operations of $21.9 million in the third quarter more than doubled the $10.5 million loss a year earlier. The increase in operating losses, coupled with declining sales, may slow the company’s growth momentum. NVIDIA, on the other hand, has consistently delivered an increase in revenue and profit, driven by its dominance in AI hardware and a strong competitive edge provided by its CUDA software platform, which is likely to continue fueling its expansion (read more: 3 Reasons to Buy NVIDIA After Its Massive 62% Revenue Surge).
