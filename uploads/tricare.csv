Among 105 patients diagnosed with pure MLN in the 2004-2022 US Military Health System followed for a mean of 110 months, 16% experienced Scr doubling.
At baseline, Scr was 1.27 vs 0.89 mg/dL in those with vs without Scr doubling.

In the largest US-based pure MLN cohort reported, achieving a complete remission or reducing urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) to less than 1 g/g within 1 year of diagnosis correlated with lower odds of doubling of serum creatinine (Scr) during extended follow-up, Stephen Olson, MD, of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, and colleagues reported.

Among 105 patients diagnosed with pure MLN in the 2004-2022 US Military Health System followed for a mean of 110 months, 16% experienced Scr doubling. At baseline, Scr was 1.27 vs 0.89 mg/dL in those with vs without Scr doubling. Patients who experienced Scr doubling were significantly more likely to have hypertension (50% vs 20.3%; P =.044), acute kidney injury (38.5% vs 11.9%; P =.018), or low complement C3 levels (73.3% vs 41.4%; P =.025) at diagnosis. This subgroup also had a lower mean baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; 72.6 vs 97.0 mL/min/1.73 m²; P =.004), but proteinuria at diagnosis did not differ significantly between groups.

Clinical course diverged substantially depending on remission status. Patients without Scr doubling were significantly more likely to achieve complete remission (55.6% vs 7.7%; P =.002), UPCR less than 1 g/g (81.3% vs 33.3%; P =.001), or UPCR less than 0.5 g/g (59.4% vs 8.3%; P =.001) within 1 year of diagnosis. Partial remission was not protective. Complete remission was defined as UPCR less than 0.5 g/g and eGFR within 15% of baseline within 1 year of treatment initiation. Partial remission was defined as reduction in UPCR by 50% to at least less than 3 g/g, and eGFR within 15% of baseline.

In contrast, patients who experienced Scr doubling were significantly more likely to progress to proliferative lupus nephritis (18.8% vs 3.5%; P =.018), develop end-stage kidney disease (25% vs 0%; P <.001), or die (6.3% vs 0%; P =.021).

Kaplan-Meier analysis reinforced that Scr doubling-free survival was higher in patients achieving complete remission, UPCR less than 1 g/g, or UPCR less than 0.5 g/g. Multivariable logistic regression confirmed these protective effects after adjusting for age, race, and baseline renal function.

Complete remission (OR, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.01-0.75), UPCR less than 1 g/g (OR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.03-0.59), and UPCR less than 0.5 g/g (OR, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.01-0.69) at 1 year were each significantly associated with decreased odds of Scr doubling, even after adjustment for immunosuppressive treatment.

No differences in renal outcomes were observed by histopathology. The investigators could not determine individual effects of therapeutic agents likely due to the small sample size.

These results highlight the prognostic value of remission and proteinuria reduction as therapeutic benchmarks in pure MLN. While the retrospective design and modest sample size are study limitations, this analysis provides much-needed clarity on long-term outcomes in MLN, a subgroup often underrepresented in lupus nephritis research. Notably, patients were not censored at the time of transitioning from MLN to proliferative disease.

“Overall, our study provides data to better assess prognosis at MLN diagnosis and suggests that patients with MLN should receive treatment with the minimal goal of achieving less than 1 gm proteinuria, if not a [complete response],” Dr Olson’s team concluded. “Future MLN specific trials are required to determine the optimal treatment strategy to achieve this goal.”",https://www.renalandurologynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2024/12/Renal-Urology.png,N,0.0,2025-09-08 13:56:25.378710

“We play a combat support role at AFHSD, and we are responsible for protecting the Joint Force,” said Navy Capt. Richard Langton, chief of AFHSD. “We carry out our assigned duties through retrospective, near real-time, and prospective health surveillance — in a nutshell, full-spectrum health surveillance.”

AFHSD is a public health component of the DHA and the U.S. military’s central public health entity. The division focuses on global health surveillance, providing operational forces with early warning, health threat assessments, and force-readiness data.

The division is organized into three branches: Epidemiology and Analysis, Global Emerging Infections Surveillance, and Integrated Biosurveillance.

AFHSD is the central repository of medical surveillance data for the armed forces. This is done through technical infrastructure, expertise in database management for the Defense Medical Surveillance System and related applications, and operations, and management of the Department of Defense Serum Repository.

The DMSS houses current and historical data on diseases and medical events. These include hospitalizations, ambulatory visits, reportable medical events, laboratory tests, immunizations, periodic and deployment-related health assessments, and casualty data affecting service members throughout their military careers. It contains billions of data records on service members and other Military Health System beneficiaries.

Leveraging data to manage seasonal respiratory illnesses

The AFHSD uses this wealth of data to analyze and anticipate potential threats.

“AFHSD plays a key role in integrating biosurveillance efforts by collecting data and information in near real-time of the threats from endemic diseases and emerging infectious diseases relevant to the military worldwide,” said Juan I. Ubiera, chief of the IB branch. “IB also conducts forecasting analytics to predict and communicate seasonal respiratory illnesses threats.”

This surveillance information enables weekly trend analysis and situation reports on seasonal respiratory illnesses. It also includes a report on respiratory illness activity on and around selected installations, to assist senior leaders in making decisions regarding resource and personnel distribution.

IB also supports early warnings and monitoring of various syndromes, including respiratory illnesses at military hospitals and clinics, communicated through the Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community Based Epidemics, or ESSENCE. This program, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, allows public health professionals to analyze events of public health interest, monitor health care data for events that could affect public health, and share data and analyses.

Raising awareness with the Medical Surveillance Monthly Report

The AFHSD disseminates important biosurveillance information through a peer-reviewed journal, the Medical Surveillance Monthly Report.

“The MSMR publishes summaries of notifiable diseases, trends of illnesses of special interest, and field reports describing outbreaks and case occurrences,” said Shauna Stahlman, senior epidemiologist in the E&A branch.

“Launched in 1995, the journal provides evidence-based estimates of the incidence, distribution, impact, and trends of illness and injuries among U.S. military service members and associated populations,” she said.

According to Stahlman, the MSMR publishes “pertinent articles on military public health, epidemiology, surveillance, and disease and injury prevention, continuously evaluating manuscript submissions for scientific accuracy.”

“The journal reports present data, public health information, and original research with direct relevance to the operational fitness of military members or MHS beneficiaries' health, safety, and well-being,” she added.

Future of biosurveillance

Each branch has specific goals in their continuing efforts to meet the needs of service members and other MHS beneficiaries.

“The E&A branch’s goal is to be flexible, responsive, and predictive to our customers by releasing accurate, timely, and actionable surveillance data, and leveraging partnerships and networks within and outside of DHA public health to better predict and respond to their needs,” said Stahlman.

“In addition, we also aim to reduce the spread of medical misinformation and disinformation, which were identified as potential vulnerabilities for biodefense in the 2023 Biodefense Posture Review,” she noted.

The GEIS branch is expanding capabilities for pathogen-agnostic genomic sequencing, a method for detecting unknown pathogens to determine the cause of an illness, and wastewater surveillance, said June Early, deputy chief of the GEIS branch. “The future development, implementation, and expansion of these capabilities will enable a more comprehensive understanding of infectious disease threats.”

“Also, our respiratory infections focus area oversees the coordination of the DOD global influenza vaccine effectiveness analysis,” said Early. “These analyses directly inform selection and composition of the following season’s northern hemisphere influenza vaccine.”

The IB branch is enhancing biosurveillance early warning content and information dissemination on the Health Surveillance Explorer, the DHA’s mapping application that provides near real-time integrated global health surveillance information for force health protection.

“We are increasing syndromic surveillance capabilities through collaborative partnerships with additional states,” said Ubiera. “IB is working with combatant commands and services to provide tailored biosurveillance information. We are also working to expand global biosurveillance capabilities by working with partner nations and allies to exchange information. This is one of the reform initiatives established in the 2023 Biodefense Posture Review.”

Capturing the high ground in health surveillance

Military public health surveillance is vital in detecting and mitigating emerging health threats, Langton said.

“We’re very proud of the capabilities we already bring to the fight. But future success requires us to move beyond the current state,” he said. “The task before us is to capture the high ground in health surveillance. We are meeting that head-on by adopting new capabilities and tapping into the unique capabilities of our partners to create synergies that endure and allow us to dominate the health surveillance space.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2308/7999800/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-08 13:56:29.916144

The privately-operated aged care and retirement living provider originally sought to modify a May 2007 development consent for 84 independent living units, 94 supported living units and a 67-bed high care facility on the coastal site, 124km from Brisbane and 819km from Sydney.

That application was refused by Tweed Shire Council in July 2021. TriCare has since opted to pursue a new SSD development consent to complete the project.

From old approvals to new demand

The May 2007 approval was secured by another provider before TriCare purchased the site. Over time, the project has received a number of modified consents for minor amendments.

Stage One – comprising 91 independent living units across three three-storey buildings with basement car parks – was completed and occupied in 2009.

A new Scoping Report by Planit Consultancy, submitted on behalf of TriCare, outlines a redesign that the company says better reflects today’s seniors living market. The updated proposal includes:

74 additional supported living units

44 residential aged care beds

New communal facilities, including an indoor pool and bowls green

Increased on-site car parking and improved site accessibility

“These measures facilitate an ability for seniors residents to comfortably stay in their homes for longer, which is reflected in contemporary market expectations for individual suites, private space, and facilities of greater proportions,” the report states.

Bill S. 2239, titled the ""Improving Access to Prenatal Care for Military Families Act,"" proposes the establishment of a pilot program by the Department of Defense to treat pregnancy as a qualifying event for enrollment in TRICARE Select. This legislative proposal aims to facilitate better access to health care services for military families by offering an inclusive framework for enrollment driven by the occurrence of pregnancy.

[b]Main Focus and Key Objectives[/b]

The central objective of the Bill is to provide a mechanism that allows eligible beneficiaries to enroll in TRICARE Select during pregnancy, categorized as a qualifying event. The proposal underlines the need to adapt healthcare benefits to the specific needs of military personnel and their families, thus enhancing prenatal care access. The Bill signifies a commitment to supporting military families by recognizing pregnancy as an important trigger for healthcare enrollment adjustments.

[b]Pilot Program Establishment[/b]

The Bill mandates the commencement of a five-year pilot program not later than 180 days after its enactment. Under this program, the Secretary of Defense is instructed to treat pregnancy as a qualifying event as outlined in section 1099(b)(1)(B) of Title 10, United States Code. This provision applies to TRICARE Select enrollment by an eligible beneficiary, aiming to streamline and facilitate access to necessary prenatal healthcare services.

[b]Initial Briefing and Reporting Requirements[/b]

Within one year after enacting the Bill, the Secretary of Defense is required to deliver a briefing to the appropriate congressional committees regarding the status of the pilot program. This ensures continuous oversight and evaluation of the program's implementation and efficacy. Subsequently, an annual report is mandated, with the first submission due one year after the program's commencement. These reports will provide data on enrollment changes influenced by the pilot program, with disaggregated statistics by month and specific circumstances leading to such changes, including pregnancy as a qualifying event.

[b]Definitions and Relevant Terms[/b]

The Bill includes clear definitions of terms vital to the understanding and implementation of its provisions. ""Active duty"" follows the meaning set forth in section 101(d) of Title 10, United States Code. ""Appropriate congressional committees"" encompass the Committee on Armed Services of both the Senate and House, in addition to other relevant committees in the House of Representatives. The terms ""covered enrollment change,"" ""dependent,"" ""TRICARE Select,"" ""eligible beneficiary,"" and ""uniformed services"" are also defined according to the United States Code.

[b]Noteworthy Provisions[/b]

A significant aspect of the Bill is its emphasis on treating pregnancy as a notable qualifying event for health coverage adjustments, addressing potential barriers to timely access to prenatal care for the military community. The proposed pilot program serves as both an innovative and responsive measure to the unique demands faced by those serving in the armed forces and their dependents. Through systematic reporting and oversight, the Bill ensures that informed decisions are made regarding the future of such healthcare initiatives.

This Bill engages actively with the need to improve health care accessibility for military families, placing particular importance on adaptability to personal circumstances like pregnancy, thus reflecting a comprehensive approach to personnel welfare and family support within the military framework....",Not Available,"https://4a4c3a29ba9d1a23d3f6651fb46d2f54.cdn.bubble.io/cdn-cgi/image/w=,h=,f=auto,dpr=1,fit=contain/f1708896951335x142739689930226020/CodifyLogo1.png",N,0.0,2025-09-08 12:56:15.493741

There is increasing evidence on regional variations in U.S. Medicare utilization based on older patients who move. Yet evidence is limited for younger ages in the U.S., and movers may differ systematically from those who don’t move. In this paper, we harness the mandatory migration of military personnel and dependents (age 5 to 64) to estimate supply and demand factors in a system of care in which military physicians are salaried and copayments and deductibles are negligible. In our sample of 3 million enrollees, we find that place or supply effects explain as much as 80 percent of the overall regional variation for both the entire sample and for active-duty personnel. These regional place effects are correlated across age groups, with correlations as high as 0.84 between middle-aged and older military enrollees. These regional supply-side variations cannot be explained by differences in health, financial incentives, or quality of care, but appear consistent with location-specific differences in physician beliefs.",https://cdn.ssrn.com/ssrn-global-header/11589acb53bc518aa22929bf19add113.svg,N,0.0,2025-09-07 01:56:21.553148

He emphasized the importance of delivering high-quality medical care to those who we serve.

“We’re here to support the warfighter, and I don’t think there’s a place that could embody that more than Fort Bragg,” said Ferrara. Fort Bragg is one of the largest U.S. military installations in the world with more than 50,000 service members assigned.

As the principal medical advisor to the Secretary of Defense and the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Ferrara oversees health policy, programs, and force health protection across the MHS. Since his appointment to his position on Jan. 20, he has been visiting and touring military medical facilities to collect firsthand feedback to understand local issues and successes, which helps him advocate for the staff and resources needed.

During the visit, he met with key leaders, department chiefs and toured various medical units to gain a deeper understanding of the unique aspects of WAMC’s mission and the challenges faced by health care providers in the field. Ferrara also presented coins to several individuals who have played a vital role in WAMC’s success, recognizing their dedication and hard work.

At a town hall with Womack staff, he emphasized that one of the most important parts of his job is being the voice of healthcare providers and personnel.

“What makes the Military Health System unique is there are many great health care systems in America, but we’re the only American healthcare system that goes to war,” he said. This means a high level of readiness is required for medical forces supporting both deployed personnel and their families with high-quality care.

“I’m your voice,” Ferrara said. “When I’m advising up, its essential to have that kind of understanding, to hear from people that do the work. The reason we're doing all that is not only to help our beneficiaries by taking care of them, but it's to maintain our readiness.”

Ferrara also emphasized the importance of collaboration between the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs. “We’re working together more closely than ever before, and that’s going to lead to better care for our veterans and our beneficiaries.”

“By taking care of veterans, we’re not only improving their health outcomes, but were also improving readiness and generating revenue for our military treatment facilities,” Ferrara explained.

The Military Health System is committed to delivering high-quality medical care to warfighters and their families ensuring their wellbeing and supporting their service.

He emphasized the importance of delivering high-quality medical care to those who we serve.

“We’re here to support the warfighter, and I don’t think there’s a place that could embody that more than Fort Bragg,” said Ferrara. Fort Bragg is one of the largest U.S. military installations in the world with more than 50,000 service members assigned.

As the principal medical advisor to the Secretary of Defense and the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Ferrara oversees health policy, programs, and force health protection across the MHS. Since his appointment to his position on Jan. 20, he has been visiting and touring military medical facilities to collect firsthand feedback to understand local issues and successes, which helps him advocate for the staff and resources needed.

During the visit, he met with key leaders, department chiefs and toured various medical units to gain a deeper understanding of the unique aspects of WAMC’s mission and the challenges faced by health care providers in the field. Ferrara also presented coins to several individuals who have played a vital role in WAMC’s success, recognizing their dedication and hard work.

At a town hall with Womack staff, he emphasized that one of the most important parts of his job is being the voice of healthcare providers and personnel.

“What makes the Military Health System unique is there are many great health care systems in America, but we’re the only American healthcare system that goes to war,” he said. This means a high level of readiness is required for medical forces supporting both deployed personnel and their families with high-quality care.

“I’m your voice,” Ferrara said. “When I’m advising up, its essential to have that kind of understanding, to hear from people that do the work. The reason we're doing all that is not only to help our beneficiaries by taking care of them, but it's to maintain our readiness.”

Ferrara also emphasized the importance of collaboration between the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs. “We’re working together more closely than ever before, and that’s going to lead to better care for our veterans and our beneficiaries.”

“By taking care of veterans, we’re not only improving their health outcomes, but were also improving readiness and generating revenue for our military treatment facilities,” Ferrara explained.

The Military Health System is committed to delivering high-quality medical care to warfighters and their families ensuring their wellbeing and supporting their service.

The House of Representatives and Senate returned to Washington, D.C. this week. Congress will prioritize government funding for fiscal year 2026 before the deadline on September 30th.

On September 1st, the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies issued its draft fiscal year 2026 spending bill. In this bill the subcommittee eliminates funding for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The bill will be voted on by the full Appropriations Committee later this month. American Liver Foundation will closely monitor the bill and the effect this will have on the first-ever national study to assess the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), now called metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease or MASLD currently underway at AHRQ.

As of August 31st, Military retirees and family members on Tricare for Life will no longer have weight loss medications covered by their insurance. Medicare eligible retirees and Defense Department civilians, as well as others with access to military hospitals but who aren't on Tricare, will no longer be able to get these popular medications through the Department of Defense health system. Beneficiaries with Tricare Prime, Tricare Select, and Premium based Tricare plans will continue to have coverage if they meet certain clinical criteria.

This latest move by Congress comes in response to repeated reports of delayed payments, ongoing operational and access issues, and patient care disruptions. The House Armed Services Committee has included language in a new report that could trigger deeper federal oversight.

As reported in a June article, APTA has been steadfast in its efforts to bring attention to some of these severe disruptions from TRICARE T-5, which began on Jan. 1 and is the fifth generation of TRICARE Managed Support Contracts. Since the start of 2025, when TriWest Healthcare Alliance took over as the Managed Care Support Contractor and the West region took on seven additional states, these disruptions have continued to wreak havoc on TRICARE beneficiaries and providers.

In July, APTA signed onto joint letters to both the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services and the U.S. House Armed Services Committee, citing the following critical issues:

The crisis within the TRICARE system is jeopardizing the health and stability of veterans, service members, and their families.

Critical data transfer failure, rooted in flawed software implementation and deployment of an inaccurate database on a live platform, has inflicted immeasurable damage upon providers and patients with no end point or solution.

Beneficiaries and health care providers are grappling with unprecedented barriers to accessing care.

In its new report accompanying the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, the House Armed Services Committee has included provisions requiring detailed reviews of TRICARE claim processing delays and the implementation of a study to investigate the Department of Defense’s Military Health System's new TRICARE T-5 contract.

The provisions call on the Department of Defense to submit two comprehensive reports to Congress by March 31, 2026. These reports will examine:

The root causes of TRICARE claim and payment delays, including contractor transitions, staffing shortages, and system inefficiencies

The number of affected providers and beneficiaries, including disruptions in care, delayed authorizations, and access

Performance metrics like average claim processing times and payment timelines broken out by region and contractor

The reasons health providers left the TRICARE network

The full scope and impact of the T-5 contract implementation in TRICARE East and West regions

You can read the full House NDAA report language here.

Calling APTA members who treat TRICARE beneficiaries: If you're still experiencing delays or challenges with TRICARE, we want to hear from you and assist you in your advocacy. Please contact APTA Advocacy for assistance.
