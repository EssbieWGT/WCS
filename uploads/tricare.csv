This vaccine is only available to children 12 months old through 12 years old.","FALLS CHURCH, Va. — You may have heard about the ongoing measles outbreak in the U.S. As of April 10, there have been 712 confirmed cases in 2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While most of these cases are in Texas and New Mexico, cases have been rising across the country.

Anyone who isn’t protected against measles can get the illness—and children are especially at risk of getting seriously sick. You may be wondering how to keep your family safe.

“Measles is more than just a rash; it can lead to severe illness, and it’s extremely contagious—you can catch it just from being in the same room as an infected person,” explained Dr. Eric Deussing, Public Health Emergency Officer for the Defense Health Agency. “So, it’s important to take steps to keep you and your loved ones protected and learn how to recognize potential symptoms. Two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine provide the best protection against measles.”

Here’s what you need to know.

What is measles?

Measles is a highly contagious illness that can cause serious complications. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes—sometimes, this happens up to four days before they’re even showing symptoms.

People of any age can get serious cases of measles. But the following groups are at increased risk for complications:

Children younger than age 5

Adults older than age 20

Pregnant women

People with weakened immune systems

Recognizing measles signs and symptoms

Measles symptoms usually appear between seven and 14 days after infection.

Initial symptoms typically include:

High fever (sometimes above 104 degrees)

Cough

Runny nose

Red, watery eyes

Two to three days after the start of symptoms, you may see tiny white spots (Koplik spots) in your mouth.

In three to five days, you may develop the measles rash—flat red spots that usually start on the face, and then spread down the body towards the feet.

Common complications of measles are ear infections and diarrhea. More severe complications can include pneumonia, swelling of the brain, and other conditions that can lead to hospitalization.

Are you or a family member showing signs of measles? Call the Military Health System Nurse Advice Line at 800-TRICARE (874-2273). Describe your symptoms to a registered nurse, who can advise you on what to do next.

Preventing measles

Your best defense against measles is getting vaccinated. Most people who got their vaccination have protection against measles for life, as described by the CDC.

The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine protects against measles as well as mumps and rubella. This vaccine is available to those older than 12 months old.

The measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella, or MMRV, vaccine protects against these illnesses as well as chickenpox. This vaccine is only available to children 12 months old through 12 years old.

Both the MMR and MMRV vaccines are administered in two doses. Children under age 12 should get the first dose between 12 and 15 months old, and the second between 4 and 6 years old. (Children may also get the MMRV second dose three months after the first dose.)

Older children, teenagers, and adults should get one or two doses of the MMR vaccine if they don’t have evidence of immunity. (Note: You’re considered immune if you were born before 1957, since it’s likely you were infected naturally.) Doses should be given at least 28 days apart.

TRICARE covers age-appropriate doses of these vaccines, as recommended by the CDC. You don’t need a referral or other approval to get these vaccines. As described in the TRICARE Pharmacy Program Handbook, you can get these vaccines at no cost, as long as you:

Go to a military hospital or clinic.

Go to a TRICARE retail network pharmacy. Make sure the person who gives you the vaccine is a pharmacist. If another type of provider gives you a vaccine at a retail pharmacy, you may have out-of-pocket costs.

See a TRICARE-authorized civilian provider. However, if you get other services at the same time, you may have to pay copayments or cost-shares. These costs vary based on your health plan.

If you live overseas, you can get vaccinated at your local military hospital or clinic or by a TRICARE-authorized civilian provider.

Do you have more questions about the measles or getting an MMR or MMRV vaccine for yourself or your child? Talk to your healthcare provider or contact the MHS Nurse Advice Line.",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/measles.png,N,0.0,2025-04-18 21:56:27.507781

Cmdr.
Clara Pangco, laboratory department head at Naval Hospital Twentynine Palms in Twentynine Palms, California.
She is one of hundreds of military lab professionals who offer critical services and vital information to service members and families.
“All service members have Individual Medical Readiness requirements, which include specific immunizations, physical examinations, and medical evaluations,” he said.
Gibson said, “It’s an honor to serve our beneficiaries, and we strive to provide them with world-class health care service.”","Defense Health Agency military medical laboratory professionals play a crucial role in supporting warfighter readiness, said U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr. Clara Pangco, laboratory department head at Naval Hospital Twentynine Palms in Twentynine Palms, California.

She is one of hundreds of military lab professionals who offer critical services and vital information to service members and families. “Lab teams are part of patients’ health care teams and assist providers in making clinical decisions,” said Pangco.

“We provide relevant information to help treat and diagnose,” she said. “From a warfighting readiness standpoint—we ensure service members are ready to deploy and can meet the demands of combat operations.”

It’s fulfilling and rewarding work, noted Pangco. “I love everything about laboratory science and its management, as we get to play scientists, investigators, and problem solvers every day,” she said, noting that their work is often behind the scenes.

“The laboratory result a patient or provider sees is but a small percentage of the work we do,” Pangco continued. “Day in and day out, we make sure the result is always accurate and reliable by ensuring we adhere to strict quality assurance requirements such as equipment maintenance, calibration, and quality control.”

Like the Twentynine Palms team, warfighter readiness is a priority for the lab team at Yokota Air Base in Tokyo, according to U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Cordy Herring, Yokota Air Base lab officer. “All service members have Individual Medical Readiness requirements, which include specific immunizations, physical examinations, and medical evaluations,” he said. “The lab collects, tests, and ships samples for IMR testing to ensure people are medically ready for deployment. “We also run several programs contributing to readiness,” said Herring, “including a frozen blood program, an expeditionary blood program, a laboratory biological defense team, and a walking blood bank team.”

In addition, the Yokota Air Base lab team supports clinical operations. “The team examines tissues and bodily fluids and provides information to clinical teams to help determine overall health and treatment plans for our patients,” explained Herring. “We also provide blood products for hemorrhaging patients to save lives.”

The team collects forensic samples for alcohol-related incidents, aircraft mishaps, and also sends samples to assist with Department of Defense investigation processes. “We are always striving for continuous improvement,” Herring added.

These improvement efforts were showcased during a recent visit from the Air Force Blood Program and the Food and Drug Administration. “The visit resulted in the lab being named as one of the best within Japan’s DOD military hospitals and clinics,” said Herring. “The FDA was very impressed. We received a flawless inspection, acknowledging our safe blood practices and our commitment to care.”

Preventing Disease and the Spread of Infection

Lab professionals also help conserve service member strength by working to prevent disease and infection, said William Gibson, supervisory microbiologist at Madigan Army Medical Center at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington. “Our lab tests over 100,000 specimens per year from beneficiaries on the West Coast, including Alaska, to the Midwest,” said Gibson. “The microbiology laboratory’s scope includes bacteriology, immunology, molecular microbiology, mycology, and blood parasitology. “We are currently working on several projects including cervical cancer screening through HPV testing,” he continued.

“We started HPV primary screening on April 7, 2025—this is a national guideline supported practice that is both workflow optimization and fiscally efficient,” said Gibson. “This summer, we intend to offer HPV self-collection testing, which has the potential to increase access to care.”

Communicable disease reporting is another ongoing project. “Infections are a fact of life. Everyone will be personally impacted by one throughout their lifespan,” he said. “Our active duty force travels the global and are exposed to a myriad of pathogens in which we must be able to provide education for prevention, prophylactics, diagnostics, and treatment for the world’s diseases. “We are looking to make sure that the reporting systems used to trace certain infections contain all the applicable test results across the DHA enterprise,” said Gibson. “This helps ensure the DHA, especially Epidemiology and Infection Control staff, have accurate data to react to things like outbreaks and facilitate an operational picture regarding medical intelligence.”

Delivering for Beneficiaries

Herring said the lab is needed. “Whether taking care of our patients, consoling a child when they are crying about getting blood collected, providing information to commanders to make decisions on careers, detecting possible biowarfare agents, or ensuring we can take care of our populace with blood programs—the lab is involved in operations,” he said.

This is all made possible through teamwork. “The team works hard together,” said Herring. “They excel in all duties and leave programs better than they found it. We take care of each other, support each other through the stressful times, and celebrate our wins. We’re proud of how much we have grown, how much we have accomplished.”

Pangco had praise for the staff at Twentynine Palms. “I am blessed with a great team,” Pangco said. ""Our recent successful FDA and College of American Pathologists reinspection was a testament of their hard work and dedication. The inspectors expressed noteworthy commendations. It was an all-around team success."" Ultimately, caring for beneficiaries is at the heart of the work of every lab professional.

Gibson said, “It’s an honor to serve our beneficiaries, and we strive to provide them with world-class health care service.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/8852987.jpg,N,1.0,2025-04-19 00:56:36.622418

Tennessee ranks among the top states for its percentage of uninsured residents. In Davidson County, about 12.3% of people lacked insurance in recent years.

There are approximately 4,147 primary care physicians currently in direct patient care across the state. However, access isn’t evenly distributed—the population per physician ranges from as low as 135 to over 14,000 across different counties. This makes it essential to choose a provider that’s both accessible and included in your health insurance coverage.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

New York, New York--(Newsfile Corp. - April 18, 2025) - Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Zynex, Inc. (""Zynex"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: ZYXI) and reminds investors of the May 19, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills."" The report claimed Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers.""

These include Beneficiary Counseling and Assistance Coordinators. You can find them at any military hospital or clinic.

Before you reach out to a BCAC, it’s important to first contact your regional contractor for help with TRICARE issues. Most TRICARE questions and concerns—such as those about enrollment, claims, referrals, or provider networks—can be handled directly through them. If you've already reached out to your contractor and still need help, a BCAC is your next step. They can take a deeper look at your issue and help guide you toward a resolution.

To get help, start by contacting the appropriate resource:

Questions about TRICARE eligibility or updates to a military service record: Contact your Service Personnel Component or the DMDC/DEERS Support Office (800-538-9552).

Questions about enrollment, claims, provider networks, or referrals: Contact your regional contractor first.

So, when should you get in touch with a BCAC? Read below to learn more.

What does a Beneficiary Counseling and Assistance Coordinator do?

BCACs can explain your TRICARE plan and how your benefit works. They work closely with regional contractors and claims processors to help resolve your concerns.

BCACs can address TRICARE-related questions, including:

Enrollment

Referrals and pre-authorizations

Claims processing delays

Covered services

The Military Health System Nurse Advice Line

Getting healthcare services outside the military hospital or clinic

“You may have questions or concerns about TRICARE enrollment, coverage, or costs that haven’t been resolved through traditional channels. BCACs are people you can contact, and even meet with in person,” said Calvin Keller, health systems analyst, Benefit Education, at the Defense Health Agency. “They’re committed to answering your questions and addressing your concerns.”

For example, you may have a question about your TRICARE eligibility or enrollment as shown in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. Maybe your record shows “No healthcare coverage plan” and you believe this is an error. After reaching out to the DMDC/DEERS Support Office, a BCAC can:

Explain the different messages you see in your DEERS record

Provide information on eligibility requirements

Guide you on how to follow up with your sponsor’s Service Personnel Component

BCACs don’t determine or fix TRICARE eligibility—but they can be a valuable resource in navigating the process.

Why reach out to a BCAC?

If you feel lost after trying to resolve issues with your regional contractor or service, there are still other TRICARE experts who can help. Consider reaching out to a BCAC. BCACs will work with you to understand your concerns and explore possible solutions.

Who can get help from a BCAC?

Do you still have questions after contacting your regional contractor? Any TRICARE beneficiary can visit or call a BCAC, even if you don’t regularly get care at a military hospital or clinic, or live far from one.

How do I find a BCAC?

You can meet with a BCAC in person by walking into their office. You don’t need an appointment. If you can’t get there in person, you can give them a call.

Each military hospital or clinic has contact information for their BCAC. Find their information online on the Find a Military Hospital or Clinic page. Or check out the Customer Service Community Directory. You can also ask the hospital staff for their office location if you’d like to meet in person.

What’s the difference between a BCAC and a patient advocate?

While both are there to support you, BCACs and patient advocates have different roles. BCACs help with TRICARE benefits. Patient advocates help with concerns or questions about healthcare services you received at a military hospital or clinic.

They can:

Explain the Patient Bill of Rights and Responsibilities and give you a copy

Explain military hospital or clinic policies, procedures, and operations

Mediate concerns between you and your medical team

At right is John Vinson, CEO of the Arkansas Pharmacists Association, who also supported the policy. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)

Arkansas became the first state in the nation to prevent healthcare conglomerates from operating drugstores here when Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed House Bill 1150 on Wednesday.

State law already regulates what pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) pay to reimburse independent pharmacies, but pharmacists have complained that the companies violate the law. The state has also fined four PBMs a total of $1.47 million for paying Arkansas pharmacies below the legally required amount for prescription drugs.

PBMs negotiate prescription benefits among drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and health insurance providers, and the biggest ones also own pharmacies and insurers. The Federal Trade Commission released an interim report in July 2024 saying these conglomerates are eliminating competition and increasing drug prices at the expense of patients.

HB 1150 headed to Sanders’ desk April 9 after clearing the Senate with a bipartisan 26 votes, six days after it passed the House with 89 votes. The bill generated hours of discussion and public comment in the House and Senate committees on Insurance and Commerce this month.

“These massive corporations are attacking our state because we will be the first in the country to hold them accountable for their anticompetitive actions,” Sanders said in a statement Wednesday.

CVS Health issued a statement last week urging Sanders to veto HB 1150, calling it “misguided policy.” The organization, which includes the CVS Caremark PBM, issued another statement Wednesday afternoon.

“CVS Health welcomes a good faith discussion with policy makers in Arkansas and across the country on ways to make medicine more affordable and accessible,” the statement said. “Unfortunately, HB1150 is bad policy that accomplishes just the opposite: it will take away access to pharmacy care in local communities, hike prescription drug spending across the state by millions of dollars each year, and cost hundreds of Arkansans their jobs.”

Arkansas has 23 CVS pharmacies that CVS and other opponents of HB 1150 said will be forced to close under the new law. Arkansas Pharmacists Association CEO John Vinson said this is not true and pharmacies can still operate if they detach from PBMs.

Sanders, Vinson and other supporters of HB 1150 have said a lack of sufficient regulation of PBMs has allowed them to monopolize the pharmaceutical industry by setting their competitors’ prices.

OptumRX, Express Scripts and CVS Caremark – the three largest PBMs – are each owned by much larger corporations that each also own a top-10 health insurer. Together they control about 80% of the U.S. prescription market, according to last year’s Federal Trade Commission report.

The legal landscape

Act 1 and Act 3 of 2018 prohibit PBMs from reimbursing their affiliated pharmacies in Arkansas at a higher rate than their competitors, locally owned independent pharmacies. PBMs routinely break these laws, said Vinson and HB 1150’s Republican sponsors, Sen. Kim Hammer of Benton and Rep. Jeremiah Moore of Clarendon.

PBMs have allegedly also violated Act 900 of 2015, which required PBMs to pay pharmacies at least as much as the national average of what drugstores pay wholesalers for drugs. Pharmacies sent the Arkansas Insurance Department (AID) thousands of complaints in 2024, claiming PBMs either illegally paid them below this national average or paid them at or just above this amount, independent pharmacists and AID’s general counsel told lawmakers last year.

This led the Arkansas Legislative Council to require PBMs to include dispensing fees in their reimbursements for prescription drugs. The panel approved the rule a day after its Administrative Rules subcommittee rejected it.

Hammer told the Senate Insurance committee April 8 that the Legislature should not be “rewarding” violators of state law “by letting them stay in business.”

“Congress is pursuing this issue. Why? Because states like Arkansas are not sitting on the sidelines and being quiet about it,” Hammer said. “[If you say], ‘Let’s sit back and wait for Congress,’ like sitting back and waiting for the Lord to come, it ain’t going to happen soon enough.”

After more than a century serving Hammer’s constituents in Benton, Smith-Caldwell Drug Store closed in August 2023 due to financial insolvency and transferred its clients to Walgreens, a national chain that isn’t part of a PBM.

Brad Lawson, a Little Rock-based healthcare supervisor for Walgreens, told lawmakers in December that unfair PBM reimbursements have forced the company to close several locations and plan further closures nationwide.

Walgreens declined to comment Thursday on HB 1150.

Opposition

In an April 4 interview with the Advocate, CVS leaders said the Caremark PBM not only complies with Arkansas law but also reimburses independent pharmacies at a higher rate than its own chain pharmacies. They also said employers whose health insurance plans include CVS will face higher costs.

“Patients are choosing us, they have a choice, and I think we’re not allowing patients to have a choice in this bill,” Chief Pharmacy Officer Lucille Accetta said.

When asked about HB 1150’s potential financial impact on CVS, Accetta and Vice President of External Relations David Whitrap said the losses of pharmacists’ jobs and patients’ access to medication are higher priorities than money.

CVS closed 244 stores between 2018 and 2020 and 900 more stores between 2021 and 2024.

CVS District Leader of Pharmacy Operations Ashley Ellis spoke against the bill at both Insurance and Commerce committee meetings, saying she and her colleagues would lose their jobs if HB 1150 becomes law.

Ellis lives in Greenbrier, represented by Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View. Irvin was in the minority of Senate committee members to vote against HB 1150, and she said she would not vote for a constituent to lose her job.

Hammer said the potential loss of CVS employees’ jobs is “a lie.”

“If they want to argue these local [corporate] pharmacies shouldn’t be going out of business because they get paid adequately, fine,” he said. “Put your money where your mouth is. Prove it. Start paying yourselves like you’re paying these others.”

Several lawmakers said this month that they supported HB 1150 partly because they received emails urging them to vote against it that appeared to be from constituents but turned out to be from lobbyists opposing the legislation. Rep. Richard McGrew, R-Hot Springs, told the House Insurance Committee that CVS clients in his district had not consented to their names being used for this purpose.

Sen. Mark Johnson, R-Ferndale, told the equivalent Senate committee that he received similar misleading emails.

“This is not grassroots opposition to this bill,” Johnson said. “This is astroturf.”

Besides CVS Health, opponents of HB 1150 included the Arkansas Chamber of Commerce, the Navitus Health Solutions PBM, and the Omnicare and Accredo pharmacies.

Omnicare is owned by CVS Health, and Accredo is a subsidiary of Express Scripts.

Mail order concerns

Several PBMs are affiliated with interstate mail-order pharmacy operations, and House Bill 1150 includes mail-order pharmacy permits among those that PBMs would be prohibited from holding.

Opponents of HB 1150 said it would reduce patients’ access to specialty drugs, some of which might only be accessible via mail-order services – including for military members and veterans who receive pharmaceuticals via the Tricare insurance program’s partnership with Express Scripts.

HB 1150 allows the State Board of Pharmacy to issue limited permits to PBMs if they provide “drugs that are otherwise unavailable in the market to a patient or a pharmacy that would otherwise be prohibited” under the law. Hammer told the Senate this will allow Tricare beneficiaries to continue receiving medications while PBMs transition out of Arkansas.

Despite being a veteran on Tricare, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin’s pharmacy services have been moved from one provider to another by PBM interference, he said in January at a news conference announcing HB 1150. He also said he would defend the legislation in court if it were challenged.

On Monday, Griffin was the lead signatory of a bipartisan letter to Congress from attorneys general in 39 states and territories, advocating for the policy in HB 1150 to be enacted federally.

Griffin sued Express Scripts and OptumRX last year, alleging that they used data from drug manufacturers and distributors to maximize their financial gain instead of using it to mitigate the opioid addiction epidemic.

‘Winners and losers’

Irvin was one of nine senators, mostly Republicans, to vote against HB 1150 last week. She disputed the claim that PBMs have a monopoly in the pharmaceutical industry, saying this is only an opinion without a court’s declaration.

Senate Minority Whip Fred Love, D-Mabelvale, was the chamber’s only Democrat to vote against the bill. Love’s district does not have any local independent pharmacies, and his constituents will lose access to medications if corporate pharmacies like CVS close, he said.

“They’ve been talking to me saying, ‘Guess what? This will hurt us,'” Love said. “So we’re going to manufacture a pharmacy desert in southwest Little Rock? That’s not good for my people.”

Irvin also took issue with a statement April 8 from Greg Reybold, vice president of Healthcare Policy at the American Pharmacy Cooperative, that HB 1150 will “take the ball away” from PBMs in Arkansas’ pharmacy industry.

“We’re using the government to say, ‘We’re getting rid of your competition,'” Irvin said. “ It says that we’re denying a permit to be approved for you, but not for you. You’re picking winners and losers.”

GOP Sen. Justin Boyd, a Fort Smith pharmacist and the vice chairman of the Senate Insurance committee, argued that PBMs’ ability to set their competitors’ prices is actually “picking winners and losers.”

Another 2025 Arkansas law that supporters said will increase patients’ access to medication is Act 52, which removed the state’s ban on nonprofit hospitals holding pharmacy permits. The bill, co-sponsored by Irvin, initially failed in the Senate Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee but later passed after being amended.

The Arkansas Pharmacists Association opposed Act 52 before it was amended. Vinson told the Senate Insurance committee that Act 52 will create new pharmacy jobs that could make up for any job loss brought about by HB 1150. Both laws will go into effect in August.

And disruptions in the military's health care program have left some pregnant women with gaps in care.

Here’s what to know today.

A growing resistance to Trump, from Van Hollen to Harvard

Sen. Chris Van Hollen confirmed last night that he has met with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the man that the Trump administration said it mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The meeting comes after Van Hollen, a Democratic senator from Maryland, where Abrego Garcia lived before being deported, traveled to the country this week to push for his release.

Van Hollen shared the news of the meeting in a social media post and said he would provide a full update when he returns to the U.S. He also met this week with human rights groups, local embassy staff members and top Salvadoran officials, including the country’s vice president.

A federal appeals court on Thursday rejected an effort by the Trump administration to put on hold the requirement that it facilitate Abrego Garcia’s release. In the unanimous ruling, the court said the administration was trying to carry out deportations to foreign prisons “without the semblance of due process.”

Van Hollen’s visit to El Salvador and federal courts’ pushback to the Trump administration’s actions on deportations are part of a growing second-term resistance to Trump. Earlier this week, Harvard University refused to yield to a list of Trump demands. In response, the president said he will freeze billions of dollars in federal funding, and his administration threatened to stop foreign students from enrolling the Ivy League school.

Meanwhile in Montana, a crowd swelled for a rally at which Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez vowed to “fight oligarchy” in the Trump administration. And across the country, Democratic leaders are getting a “massive earful” from their base over those upset with a lack of resistance to the administration’s actions, one person said.

While the actions are still far from a full-fledged revolt, Democrats are trying to harness anti-Trump energy as the party looks ahead to next year’s midterm elections. They’re seeing small-dollar donations ticking up, and state and Congressional elections are beginning to take shape. But angst within the party and disagreements about which issues to focus on could present some complications.

Florida State University shooting leaves 2 dead

The Florida State University community is reeling after a shooting at the Tallahassee campus left two people dead and at least six injured. The suspect in custody was identified as 20-year-old Phoenix Ikner, the son of a sheriff's deputy who is believed to be an FSU student, Leon County Sheriff Walt McNeil said yesterday afternoon. One former classmate says Ikner harbored white supremacist views.

The gunman got out of an orange Hummer and opened fire near the student union just before noon. McKenzie Heeter, a junior at FSU, was outside the building when she said she saw a person “shoot in my direction” with a rifle. Heeter added, “I think he was shooting and he missed. So he goes back into his car and grabs a pistol, then he turns and shoots the lady in front of him. That’s when I just started running.”

The two people who died in the shooting were not FSU students, authorities said. The six injured victims were in fair condition, Tallahassee Memorial Hospital said last night. Here’s what else we know about the shooting.

Police said the suspected shooter has been hospitalized with serious but non-life-threatening injuries. A gun that was a former service weapon belonging to his mother was found on the scene. Here’s what else we know about the suspect.

U.S. 'will move on' from Ukraine peace efforts if no progress within days, Rubio warns

The U.S. may be ready to “move on” from its efforts to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine if there is no clear progress in the coming days, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Friday.

“We’re not going to continue with this endeavor for weeks and months on end,” Rubio told reporters in Paris after a grueling day of talks among U.S., Ukrainian and European officials in Paris.

“We need to figure out here now, within a matter of days, whether this is doable in the short term, because if it’s not, then I think we’re just going to move on,” he said, adding that President Donald Trump “feels very strongly about that.”

His comments came after Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine’s first deputy prime minister and economy minister said that Kyiv and Washington signed a memorandum that is expected to bring both sides closer to clinching a minerals deal that will allow the U.S. access to Ukraine’s rare earth mineral wealth.

Military insurance snafus disrupt care for pregnant women

Air National Guard member Cortney Frazon was trying to check in for a 20-week ultrasound when she discovered her doctor no longer accepted her insurance. Faced with a crushing out-of-pocket cost, she left. Around the same time, at least two medical providers told Audrey Simmons they couldn’t see her because of ongoing negotiations with her insurance, leaving her with limited options during her high-risk pregnancy.

Both women were supposed to be covered by Tricare, the military’s health insurance program, which has been plagued by widespread disruptions after a change in contracts earlier this year. The disruptions have included canceled appointments, a shrinking network of doctors and snafus that have prevented service members and their families from accessing health care. New and expectant mothers have been caught in the chaos during a critical time.

Four women who recently faced issues with Tricare spoke to reporter Melissa Chan, describing feelings of stress, frustration and fear that have overshadowed their pregnancies. “I feel like the military acts like they’re very family-focused, but I feel pretty abandoned,” one said.

About 16,000 health care providers on the East Coast went unpaid from December 2024 until at least March due to a data error, Humana said.","In the throes of postpartum depression, the incision site from her Cesarean section still tender, a U.S. Navy veteran in Indiana learned she had been dropped by her health insurance.

Some 500 miles away, in Lee’s Summit, Missouri, Air National Guard member Cortney Frazon was trying to check in for a 20-week ultrasound when she discovered her doctor no longer accepted her insurance. Faced with a crushing out-of-pocket cost, she left.

In Kansas City around the same time, at least two medical providers were telling Audrey Simmons they couldn’t see her because of ongoing negotiations with her insurance, leaving her with limited options during her high-risk pregnancy.

The women were all supposed to be covered by the military’s health insurance program called Tricare — a lifelong benefit promised to many who serve, but one that has been plagued by widespread disruptions to service members, their families and the physicians who accept the insurance following a change in contracts that unleashed a cascade of unanticipated consequences.

Top leadership with both the Navy and Air Force have warned that the Tricare upheaval could create enormous problems for service members and their families, from canceled appointments and a shrinking network of doctors to snafus that prevent those who are insured from accessing necessary health care.

“That’s going to have detrimental effects to our family, to our family readiness and possibly to our military readiness,” Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy James Honea testified last week during a congressional hearing on quality-of-life issues for members of the military.

This chaos is particularly urgent and damaging for new and expectant mothers, when health experts say medical and mental health care is crucial. Four women who recently faced issues with Tricare that disrupted their medical care told NBC News that the stress overshadowed their excitement about their pregnancies. It has caused them to question a health system meant to take care of members of the military and their loved ones.

“It’s just so stressful,” said Simmons, who is four months pregnant. “I feel like the military acts like they’re very family-focused, but I feel pretty abandoned.”

The Defense Health Agency, which runs Tricare, said it could not comment on individual cases, citing federal privacy laws, and would not confirm whether the problems detailed by the women were caused by the larger Tricare disruptions.

“The uniformed service members and their families deserve the best health care available and anytime there is a shortfall of any kind we take it seriously and strive to correct it and reduce the chances of it happening in the future,” the agency said in a statement.

With little to no out-of-pocket costs depending on the plan, Tricare is billed as a major perk to those who join the armed forces, especially in the U.S., where the inability to pay for health care and medicine recently hit a new high, a recent survey found. Health care costs are only growing. In 2024, the national average annual health insurance premium for an individual was nearly $9,000, according to KFF, a nonprofit research organization formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Military members who serve at least 20 years, or those who retire for medical reasons, can keep their coverage for life, and so can their spouses. Their children can also stay enrolled until age 21, or 23 if they attend college, said Eileen Huck, acting director of government relations for the National Military Family Association, which advocates for service members and their families.

Tricare serves about 9.5 million people, including active-duty service members, National Guard and Reserve members, military retirees and their families. About a third are active-duty service members or their loved ones, according to the latest data.

In a March news release, Tricare extolled its maternity care benefits and its newly expanded childbirth and breastfeeding support services. In addition to routine doctor visits, ultrasounds and deliveries, Tricare also pays for unlimited doula care during birth, prenatal and postpartum physical therapy, breast pumps and even a third dental cleaning in a 12-month period.

“It is a very valuable benefit,” Huck said. “It is definitely an incentive to join the military and stay in the military, knowing that you and your family will have this health care coverage.”

Simmons, 30, her three young children and her husband, a Missouri Air National Guard member, have been covered for the last three years. She found out in mid-January that she was pregnant, and when she called to make a doctor’s appointment, she was told her OB-GYN couldn’t see her because of ongoing insurance negotiations.

Her concerns grew when her endocrinologist said the same thing, and the hospital where she was initially referred also wasn’t an option. She tried to find a provider she could see. Within 50 miles of her home, only one facility came up — a hospital where she used to work and where she said she and her family had negative experiences.

It was a big change from her previous pregnancy, when she had no trouble finding and booking appointments with in-network providers.

“I’m having to fight with insurance constantly and feeling literally like I have nowhere to go when there’s a problem,” Simmons said. “I almost feel like we don’t have insurance.”

She vented on BabyCenter, a pregnancy-support app with an online forum, and learned she was not alone. About 20 miles away in Lee’s Summit, Frazon wrote on the app that she was also frustrated by the health care system and heartbroken to lose her trusted doctor, too.

Frazon, 35, a heavy equipment operator with the Air National Guard, didn’t know that her OB-GYN had left the network until she arrived for her 20-week ultrasound in February, she told NBC News.

“That’s like the first one they do when you get to see the baby,” she said. “I was super excited about it.”

After two miscarriages, Frazon hoped the ultrasound, a scan of her baby’s anatomy that shows growth and development, would ease her nerves. But when she checked in for her appointment, she said the receptionist told her she’d have to pay out of pocket for the visit because the office no longer accepted Tricare. (The health care provider told NBC News it’s working to finalize an agreement with a new Tricare contractor.)

“I had to have them tell me multiple times because I wasn’t processing it,” Frazon said.

She chose not to pay out of pocket — or come back. She said it hurt to lose a physician she had built a five-year relationship with, who understood her health history and prior complications, but she could not afford the full costs.

Frazon said she called Tricare for a list of other providers within 30 miles.

“They gave me two,” she said. Frazon booked with one and had the scan done.

The Defense Health Agency outsources Tricare operations, relying on two companies to manage health care benefits in its two U.S. regions. Much of the wider trouble began Jan. 1, when a company called TriWest Healthcare Alliance took over West Coast management and took on six additional states that were once part of the East Coast region managed by a different contractor, Humana Military.

Tricare is honoring referrals made under the previous contractor through the end of June, the Defense Health Agency said in a statement. And providers, including hospitals that were considered in-network under the last contractor, are being treated as in-network until then.

The transition was a “huge undertaking,” but the Defense Health Agency said it took “painstaking steps” to limit potential interruptions.

The new contract was meant to “improve health care delivery, quality, and access” for U.S. beneficiaries, the agency said.

That’s not what has happened. About 16,000 health care providers on the East Coast went unpaid from December 2024 until at least March due to a data error, Humana said. That forced many to drop Tricare patients altogether, reduce their hours or even consider closing their clinics. On the West Coast, federal officials said beneficiaries have been struggling with long wait times at call centers and delays with processing new referrals for outpatient specialty care.

Humana said it fixed the data issue in March. TriWest referred questions to the Defense Health Agency.

Civilian providers are increasingly critical to Tricare’s network, after funding shortages reduced availability at military facilities. The longer the disruptions go on, the more concern grows that civilian providers may drop off, Honea, the senior Navy leader, said during his House testimony last week. The Defense Health Agency confirmed to NBC News that providers have left the West Coast region but would not say how many.

In the meantime, there’s been finger-pointing, with providers telling some of the pregnant women that Tricare issues were to blame and the Defense Health Agency saying some providers were failing to honor the referral waivers.

Another issue is Tricare demanding repayment of previously paid claims. In Nevada, a Navy veteran and his wife said Tricare had rescinded over $100,000 in medical claims it had approved and paid years ago. While officials still have not said what prompted the reversals, the couple said Tricare resolved the issue after NBC News published an article about their plight in March, ensuring they did not owe anything.

The disruptions meant that Marine Corps Sgt. Savannah Harper, 27, had trouble getting prenatal care in January after she transferred from a California base to one in Hawaii.

When she went to a new medical center for prenatal care, she said she was told she didn’t have a referral on file and couldn’t be seen.

Harper said she repeatedly called Tricare for help, enduring wait times of up to 90 minutes with no resolution.

By early February, she was a full month overdue for her 20-week ultrasound. “I could feel her moving, so I knew she was OK generally, but I didn’t know what limbs she had,” she said. “It was very, very nerve-wracking.”

Desperate, she said she tried to see an Army OB-GYN at a military hospital. After 30 minutes of waiting, she said they told her to call her insurance. Harper said she stormed up to the hospital’s labor and delivery unit and burst into tears. “My emotions were everywhere,” she said.

She said providers there gave her an ultrasound and a referral to get further care off-base. She said she called a list of civilian physicians and took the first one who had an opening.

“It’s been very scary,” said Harper, who is due in mid-May.

Early and consistent health care during pregnancy is critical and can help prevent complications for both the mother and the fetus, according to Dr. Noha Ahmed, a resident OB-GYN at MedStar Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C.

Each step matters, as does the timing. Blood tests done around 10 to 13 weeks of pregnancy can detect chromosomal abnormalities, while a 20-week anatomy scan, a major milestone, identifies whether the fetus and its organs are growing adequately, Ahmed said.

Around 25 weeks, a screening can determine risks for gestational diabetes. In the last trimester, Ahmed said, weekly visits are recommended.

“Pregnancy is not a benign condition. It takes a really big toll on the mother,” Ahmed said.

The Navy veteran from Indiana who found out that Tricare had dropped her after she gave birth had no problem enrolling last year in the maternity program run by Humana. In an email reviewed by NBC News, a case manager welcomed her to the program in September, when she was six months pregnant. She delivered the baby on Christmas Eve.

The health care was a bright spot in an otherwise troubling end to her service. She had retired from the military in 2017 because of post-traumatic stress disorder, developed after she said she was raped by another sailor. Her certificate of release from active duty, which NBC News reviewed, shows she was honorably separated under disability retirement — so she was eligible for Tricare.

“The one consolation I had walking away was at least I have my health care so I can start over,” the woman said. NBC News is withholding her name because she said she was a victim of sexual assault. “I feel robbed.”

In January, when she went to a local military office with her marriage certificate, separation papers and her baby’s birth certificate to add her newborn daughter as a dependent, she said she was told she was no longer eligible for insurance, over what she believes was a recordkeeping mistake.

She insisted she should get health care coverage; she had a letter from the Department of Veterans Affairs, which NBC News reviewed, confirming she had a permanent disability connected with her military service.

Soon after, she said she got a call canceling her six-week postpartum appointment because the doctor’s office had been notified that she was uninsured.

She also had to cancel her mental health appointments to treat her postpartum depression and anxiety and begin to ration the medication she had left. She got what she thought was norovirus — vomiting, chills and fatigue — but didn’t see a doctor.

And she struggled with breastfeeding, as many new mothers do. Under Tricare she would have had access to breastfeeding counseling and a dozen other postpartum services.

“I feel like I have failed her,” she said of her baby girl. “This anxiety is worse than it had to be. It’s constant.”

Amid all this, Tricare sent a series of letters, which NBC News reviewed, requesting more than $15,700 in refunds from her medical providers for 66 claims from February 2024 until after she gave birth.

The letters said the providers were responsible for repaying Tricare, and “should there be a need for the beneficiary to make a payment, you will be contacted directly by your provider.” She’s waiting to hear if she’ll need to pay.

In its statement to NBC News, the Defense Health Agency suggested the veteran reach out to customer service.

But she’s long past that. She cobbled together temporary insurance for her baby under a separate Veterans Affairs program, and her husband’s regular enrollment period opened recently, allowing them all to get coverage under his civilian job. The benefits kicked in on April 1.

The first thing she did was book appointments: one for her baby’s four-month check-up, one to see about the painful lumps at her incision site, and another to address her deteriorating mental health.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250417-pregnant-women-military-insurance-tricare-cover-se-219a-08b126.jpg",N,-1.0,2025-04-18 05:56:27.335039

Military Families Feel Financial Burden Military families from every branch have shared their growing concerns about the rising financial burden of maintaining healthcare coverage for their young adult dependents.
Many families have shared that the high cost of TRICARE Young Adult forces them into a difficult waiting game—hoping their child will become eligible for their own employer-based insurance.
A Cost Too High TRICARE Young Adult isn’t just expensive—it’s out of reach for many.
Each story is a stark reminder that military families deserve better and, at the very least, have better plan options.","Milestones are a part of the military family journey. We see service member promotions, military spouse achievements, and kindergarten and high school graduations—and for those with young adult dependents, we may also see college graduation! What should be a time of joy can quickly shift to concern when families realize that health coverage for their graduates may be interrupted.

Regular TRICARE plans cover young adult dependents only until age 21 or up to age 23 if they’re enrolled in college, with coverage ending on their graduation date. After age 23 and through age 26, maintaining TRICARE coverage beyond that point requires families to enroll their young adult dependent into TRICARE Young Adult (TYA), a premium-based health plan.

However, costs for TYA have skyrocketed over the last decade. Similar to regular TRICARE coverage, there are two plan options: TYA Prime and TYA Select. In 2025, TYA Select carries a premium of $337 per month, while TYA Prime’s monthly premium is currently $727 a month per young adult dependent—a staggering 250% increase since 2015!

The cost of TYA premiums is per dependent, which many families feel is unsustainable. One Air Force retiree detailed this exact scenario and said, “Both of our kids are in college. They can’t afford $337/month each. But because they both work to help pay for school, they don’t qualify for assistance like ‘BadgerCare’ [Wisconsin Medicaid]”.

Military Families Feel Financial Burden

Military families from every branch have shared their growing concerns about the rising financial burden of maintaining healthcare coverage for their young adult dependents. Their stories reflect deep frustration and a strong sense of unfairness—especially when compared to civilian families, whose children can stay on health plans until age 26 without any additional cost.

Many families have shared that the high cost of TRICARE Young Adult forces them into a difficult waiting game—hoping their child will become eligible for their own employer-based insurance. In the meantime, they’re left straining their own finances or scrambling to find alternative coverage.

“My son was on the five-year plan for college and turned 23 in December before graduating in May last year. We had to pick up TYA for the remaining six months and then more while he waited for job-based insurance.” — Army spouse

“We had to switch off TRICARE to private insurance to keep our son on (who was still in college for his master’s degree) because he aged out. Now that he’s graduated, he’s still eligible to remain on our private insurance, and we’re keeping him on to give him a little saving money before he starts paying for insurance himself. I’d rather be on TRICARE, but we’ll be in the same boat in 2 years with our youngest. —Army spouse

Their message is clear: TRICARE’s age requirements for coverage is an undue burden for military families.

A Cost Too High

TRICARE Young Adult isn’t just expensive—it’s out of reach for many.

“It’s a hardship on the parents who have to pay out of pocket.” — Marine spouse

“We need something better than TYA. Paying almost $800/month per child is not helpful.” — Military retiree

“Our son just graduated and is a full-time graduate student. We had to find other coverage because he’ll be 23 soon, and we can’t afford TRICARE prices.” — Army spouse

These are the lived experiences of families who have already sacrificed so much in service. Each story is a stark reminder that military families deserve better and, at the very least, have better plan options.

We’re Amplifying These Voices on Capitol Hill

NMFA continues to support legislation that would align TRICARE coverage with civilian plans and extend dependent coverage until age 26 without additional costs.

This isn’t just about policy—it’s about fairness, stability, and peace of mind for families who have earned it.

We’ve shared these stories in Congressional briefings, through advocacy campaigns, and in direct conversations with lawmakers. But your voices are our most powerful tool.

It’s time for TRICARE to align with civilian healthcare standards by extending coverage for young adult dependents through age 26. Our military-connected families should not be forced to shoulder additional healthcare costs simply because of their service. They deserve the same peace of mind and support afforded to their civilian peers.

She described the gaps that can exist in veterans' medical coverage and how Medicaid can provide a safety net.
He takes care of veterans with disabilities and veterans who have been injured during service.
The Institute found that over 47,000 veterans access health coverage through Medicaid, including nearly one in 13 veterans in Virginia.
In a statement to 13News Now, Wittman said: “No one has proposed or voted on cuts to Medicaid.","HAMPTON, Va. — ""When a veteran reaches out their hand for support, oftentimes the only hand that's extended is Medicaid.""

Virginia Delegate Jackie Glass is a Navy veteran, and she said the safety net provided by Medicaid is critical for veterans.

""The thing about service is there's a level of certainty with it. You join, you know that you're serving, you're going to be taken care of. You've gotten to a better place where you get out, you feel a high level of certainty on most things. What we're seeing now puts so much uncertainty in the eyes of people who I know have seen much worse, and it's heartbreaking,"" Glass said.

She described the gaps that can exist in veterans' medical coverage and how Medicaid can provide a safety net.

""The VA doesn't fill all the gaps, and quite frankly, not a lot of veterans choose to use the VA. Not a lot of veterans have access to Tricare in the way that I'm fortunate to have access to, so they stop getting prescription meds, they stop getting the care that they're seeking. It is life or death for some folks, so you go broke trying to stay healthy.""

Glass was one of six members of Thursday's roundtable discussion in Hampton discussing these issues.

Tony Hedgepeth is a veteran and member of SEIU Virginia 512, as well as a Medicaid-funded home care provider. He takes care of veterans with disabilities and veterans who have been injured during service.

""When we hurt, we hurt. When we start taking away some of the fundamental things that we're promised, we hurt,"" said Hedgepeth, ""People have been injured, they need their equipment, they need their ongoing care, and if you're denied that, what's left of them? What are their options? That's what we're here to combat.""

Freddy Mejia from The Commonwealth Institute joined the roundtable as well, providing data from a new report unveiling the impact of potential cuts to Medicaid on veterans and military families. Mejia reported that over 56,000 individuals -- including active duty members, some veterans, and their families -- are dually enrolled in Tricare and Medicaid. He said Tricare has some limitations in terms of what they provide, including children who need home and community-based services.

Medicaid is able to pick up where Tricare ends. The Institute found that over 47,000 veterans access health coverage through Medicaid, including nearly one in 13 veterans in Virginia.

Mejia said these individuals may be in the ""sandwich generation"" taking care of their parents and young children, and if any cuts to Medicaid happens, those individuals would lose coverage.

Speaking before the roundtable began, Congressman Bobby Scott (D, VA-03) said the Energy and Commerce Committee is tasked with finding $880 billion in cuts under the most recent budget resolution. Medicaid is one of the programs included under the Energy and Commerce jurisdiction.

""Technically, it doesn't mention Medicaid, but the CBO (Congressional Budget Office) points out there aren't $880 billion worth of programs in the Energy and Commerce jurisdiction without going deeply into Medicaid,"" Scott said.

This comes days after Scott's fellow Virginia representatives, Jen Kiggans and Rob Wittman, joined nine other Republican colleagues in advocating to preserve Medicaid coverage for vulnerable populations as Congress considers budget reconciliation legislation.

In a statement to 13News Now, Wittman said:

“No one has proposed or voted on cuts to Medicaid. Medicaid is an indispensable lifeline for our nation’s most vulnerable, including people with disabilities, seniors, and expectant mothers. That’s why we must act now to strengthen the program. To preserve Medicaid, we need to focus on rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse within the system. This issue is personal for me since I was adopted at 8 months old out of Children's Home Society of Virginia in Richmond. My birth mother’s choice to put me up for adoption gave me more opportunities than she felt she could provide. I want to fix our broken Medicaid system so we can ensure vulnerable members like my birth mother get the care they need.”

Asked about the coalition, Scott said, ""This letter on Medicaid suggests that they're not going to vote for Medicaid cuts. Unfortunately, that's not the case. If you read the letter, they say they're not going to cut Medicaid for 'vulnerable populations' or this population or that population. But it doesn't rule out cuts in Medicaid.""

Scott went on to say about the letter from 11 Republican lawmakers: ""The fact of the matter is they voted twice to cut Medicaid because we had the budget framework. CBO said it guaranteed that Medicaid would have to get cut. We'll have to see as the budget goes on what the numbers are on line items, but the CBO said the budget framework requires massive cuts on Medicaid.""",https://media.13newsnow.com/assets/WVEC/images/697e478d-5339-42b4-b8c8-fa58914a02c6/697e478d-5339-42b4-b8c8-fa58914a02c6_1140x641.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-17 19:56:23.905884

NEW YORK, April 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Zynex, Inc. (""Zynex"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: ZYXI) and reminds investors of the May 19, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills."" The report claimed Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex further revealed ""Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims."" Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military.

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Zynex's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

As a part of the new contracts, in light of the TriWest Healthcare Alliance takeover, TRICARE is making it easier for you to keep your TRICARE Prime coverage. While a patient’s distance from military hospitals or clinics used to require waivers if they had a Prime plan, there is no longer a restriction, and most families can continue to see their PCM.

TRICARE Prime Travel Restrictions Lifted

TRICARE Prime patients no longer need a waiver to keep their coverage and receive care at a military hospital or clinic that doesn’t fit the traditional distance requirements.

Under the new TRICARE contracts, beneficiaries can keep their current primary care manager (PCM) or can choose to change. Patients who move to a location outside that access standard for primary care can choose to receive their care at a DoD facility, or they can keep their primary care manager without having to secure a waiver.

To help everyone transition, TRICARE is providing letters to those affected with the details and steps to switch if they choose that option.

""This new approach will help prevent unnecessary coverage gaps and ensure families keep access to their PCMs,"" said DHA management and program analyst Shane Pham.

Why TRICARE Prime Is Changing

This change comes about under the new management contracts that TRICARE continues to navigate.

The DoD is working to get more military families into military hospitals and clinics as private healthcare facilities continue to gain ground in the market.

While many are pushing for more choice and options involving the private healthcare sector, the VA still needs to maintain enough patients to remain a viable option for military families.

According to a DoD memo in 2023, the goal is to increase the patients going to military healthcare facilities to 3.3 million by 2027, which would be a 7% increase.

“The last thing that a family or that service member needs is to be worried about whether their family is getting adequate or high-quality care,” said Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Dr. Stephen Ferrara.

Increasing Patient Satisfaction

TRICARE has been paying attention to what patients feel with these moves, as the data collected from satisfaction surveys have shown that many are willing to keep their primary care doctors, even if they have to drive over 30 minutes to do so, but have no desire to switch physicians.

Therefore, the TRICARE Prime change will allow beneficiaries who live over 30 minutes from their principal care management to continue their coverage.

Adult patients who are on the Prime coverage will be contacted by a TRICARE regional contract and offered options to continue their healthcare plan. According to the Defense Health Agency, beneficiaries who meet the criteria will receive a letter notifying them that their homes are outside of the coverage range.

If they don't respond to the letter, they will remain with their current primary care managers at their military treatment facility.

Actions TRICARE Prime Beneficiaries Need to Take

If a TRICARE Prime beneficiary moves more than 30 minutes from their PCM, their TRICARE regional contract will contact all adult patients in the houshold via phone, email, mail, or text, explaining options for continuing health coverage.

For those with a TRICARE Prime plan, you’ll have 90 days to decide what you want to do. While you aren’t required to move on from Prime, there is still an option to choose coverage under TRICARE Select or the U.S. Family Health Program, provided it’s available near you.

Failure to do so for patients who have moved over 100 miles from their TRICARE Prime Service Area will result in losing coverage. Furthermore, if you go to a military hospital or clinic, you can only receive care if there’s space.

It’s also important to make sure that your personal info in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) is up to date and accurate for the DoD.

NEW YORK, April 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Zynex, Inc. (""Zynex"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: ZYXI) and reminds investors of the May 19, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills."" The report claimed Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex further revealed ""Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims."" Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military.

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Zynex's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine protects against measles as well as mumps and rubella.
This vaccine is only available to children 12 months old through 12 years old.","You may have heard about the ongoing measles outbreak in the U.S. As of April 10, there have been 712 confirmed cases in 2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While most of these cases are in Texas and New Mexico, cases have been rising across the country.

Anyone who isn’t protected against measles can get the illness—and children are especially at risk of getting seriously sick. You may be wondering how to keep your family safe.

“Measles is more than just a rash; it can lead to severe illness, and it’s extremely contagious—you can catch it just from being in the same room as an infected person,” explained Dr. Eric Deussing, Public Health Emergency Officer for the Defense Health Agency. “So, it’s important to take steps to keep you and your loved ones protected and learn how to recognize potential symptoms. Two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine provide the best protection against measles.”

Here’s what you need to know.

What is measles?

Measles is a highly contagious illness that can cause serious complications. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes—sometimes, this happens up to four days before they’re even showing symptoms.

People of any age can get serious cases of measles. But the following groups are at increased risk for complications:

Children younger than age 5

Adults older than age 20

Pregnant women

People with weakened immune systems

Recognizing measles signs and symptoms

Measles symptoms usually appear between seven and 14 days after infection.

Initial symptoms typically include:

High fever (sometimes above 104 degrees)

Cough

Runny nose

Red, watery eyes

Two to three days after the start of symptoms, you may see tiny white spots (Koplik spots) in your mouth.

In three to five days, you may develop the measles rash—flat red spots that usually start on the face, and then spread down the body towards the feet.

Common complications of measles are ear infections and diarrhea. More severe complications can include pneumonia, swelling of the brain, and other conditions that can lead to hospitalization.

Are you or a family member showing signs of measles? Call the Military Health System Nurse Advice Line at 800-TRICARE (874-2273). Describe your symptoms to a registered nurse, who can advise you on what to do next.

Preventing measles

Your best defense against measles is getting vaccinated. Most people who got their vaccination have protection against measles for life, as described by the CDC.

The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine protects against measles as well as mumps and rubella. This vaccine is available to those older than 12 months old.

The measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella, or MMRV, vaccine protects against these illnesses as well as chickenpox. This vaccine is only available to children 12 months old through 12 years old.

Both the MMR and MMRV vaccines are administered in two doses. Children under age 12 should get the first dose between 12 and 15 months old, and the second between 4 and 6 years old. (Children may also get the MMRV second dose three months after the first dose.)

Older children, teenagers, and adults should get one or two doses of the MMR vaccine if they don’t have evidence of immunity. (Note: You’re considered immune if you were born before 1957, since it’s likely you were infected naturally.) Doses should be given at least 28 days apart.

TRICARE covers age-appropriate doses of these vaccines, as recommended by the CDC. You don’t need a referral or other approval to get these vaccines. As described in the TRICARE Pharmacy Program Handbook, you can get these vaccines at no cost, as long as you:

Go to a military hospital or clinic.

Go to a TRICARE retail network pharmacy. Make sure the person who gives you the vaccine is a pharmacist. If another type of provider gives you a vaccine at a retail pharmacy, you may have out-of-pocket costs.

See a TRICARE-authorized civilian provider. However, if you get other services at the same time, you may have to pay copayments or cost-shares. These costs vary based on your health plan.

If you live overseas, you can get vaccinated at your local military hospital or clinic or by a TRICARE-authorized civilian provider.

Do you have more questions about the measles or getting an MMR or MMRV vaccine for yourself or your child? Talk to your healthcare provider or contact the MHS Nurse Advice Line.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2504/8979896/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-17 17:56:23.980873

Managed by the Defense Media Activity, the awards honor outstanding work from government civilian journalists, photographers, graphic designers, videographers, and public affairs professionals.

First-Place Awards, Top Spot in Prestigious Categories

MHS civilians earned first place in eight categories, with Douglas Stutz at Naval Hospital Bremerton taking first for best information story about U.S. Navy Lt. Jane W. Njenga ensuring forces are medically ready when facing tropical diseases.

“We’ve had the honor to cover less-than-ideal subjects which still needed to be shared, including suicide and remembering loss on Memorial Day. Njenga’s commitment in the Military Tropical Medical Program offered us the opportunity to share how investing the time and effort can help save lives in future conflicts,” said Stutz.

When asked what drove him to enter the competition, Stutz said, “We submitted content to help highlight and hopefully increase focus on our valued Navy Medicine team of Navy Medical Corps, Medical Service Corps, Nurse Corps, Dental Corps, and especially our enlisted Hospital Corps and our support staff. Every one of them is a subject matter expert. They may not openly realize it, but we believe that each of our staff has a tremendous amount of value and insight to tap into, helping to share who, what, where, when, and why we do our work.”

Additional winners included Bernard Little from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center who won the prestigious Civilian Writer of the Year award, while Jorge Gomez from Irwin Army Community Hospital was named Civilian Videographer of the Year.

“I’m honored to have been recognized as the Civilian Writer of the Year among a very talented group of writers,” said Little. “I want people to know that the staff and care at Walter Reed is second to none. I want people to read the stories that I write and consider coming to Walter Reed for their care if they don’t. For those who do, I want them to feel pleased they are receiving their care here and continue to receive their care here, feeling secure and confident that they are receiving the best care anywhere.”

Brandon Henry from the Uniformed Services University won two top prizes—first place in both animation and multimedia product categories. Thomas Balfour, also from USU, won first place for his featured photo.

The university is no stranger to these achievements. “We’re very proud of the incredible talent we have here at USU,” said Sharon Holland, acting vice president for external affairs and director of alumni affairs. “Our writers, graphic designers, photographers, and multimedia staff have consistently been recognized for their work, either at the local level, the MHS level, the Department of Defense level, and sometimes all three. We’re thrilled to be part of a community that values excellence in telling the military health story.”

In similar categories, Thomas Cieslak from Naval Health Clinic Cherry Point won first in photojournalism, and Justin Moeller from Blanchfield Army Community Hospital took first in the picture story category.

Not only did MHS lead the competition with the most first-place wins, MHS secured the most second and third place finishes of any agency.

Honoring Creativity and Impact While Advancing Mission Readiness

The awards recognize communications professionals for more than just the quality of their products. They are honored for their role in advancing warfighter readiness and telling the military health story in creative, meaningful ways, said Richard H. Breen Jr., director of communications and public affairs for the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs and the Military Health System. “The work of the MHS is beyond health care–it’s about ensuring that every service member is fit to fight, that our medical teams are trained and ready, and that our families receive the care they deserve. The awards capture the essence of this mission in one article, frame, photo, or video.”

“Winning or placing in any category at the DMMA is a testament to the MHS team’s creativity, precision, and ability to translate complex health topics into messages that resonate across the force,” said Derik W. Crotts, communication strategist with the MHS. “Their work directly supports warfighter readiness by ensuring the right information reaches the right people at the right time.”

Karen Roberts, director of the Defense Health Agency Director’s Communications and Public Affairs Division, agrees. “These communicators represent DHA’s deep well of talent and the commitment shared by all of our communication professionals who work hard to highlight the high-quality health care our military hospitals and clinics deliver to millions of service members, retirees, and their families,” she said.

On Feb. 18, 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the intention of lowering costs and reducing barriers to in vitro fertilization. The order gives resources to military families who currently face the crippling costs of infertility treatments that go uncovered by TRICARE insurance.

The executive order requires the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy to submit a list to the president within 90 days consisting of policy recommendations on protecting IVF access and reducing out-of-pocket and health plan costs for IVF treatment.

“My Administration recognizes the importance of family formation, and as a Nation, our public policy must make it easier for loving and longing mothers and fathers to have children,” the order states. “Therefore, to support American families, it is the policy of my Administration to ensure reliable access to IVF treatment, including by easing unnecessary statutory or regulatory burdens to make IVF treatment drastically more affordable.”

Julie Eshelman, founder of Building Military Families Network, thinks the executive order is a positive first step that will hopefully lead to a broader range of options for military families struggling to conceive.

“We’re making progress,” Eshelman said. “I definitely don’t think it goes far enough because it’s just an executive order. But we’re thrilled that this is something he is considering. We’re making these incremental steps toward the end goal.”

Eshelman started Building Military Families Network after she and her husband, Andrew, a major in the Active Guard Reserve assigned to the James Madison University Army ROTC program, experienced infertility. They learned firsthand the financial and logistical barriers American families face when pursuing IVF treatment, suffering multiple miscarriages while paying tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket. The Eshelmans were finally successful after years of struggle when Julie gave birth to their daughter, Millie, in 2021.

Like most American health insurance, TRICARE does not cover the cost of IVF unless infertility is due to a service-connected injury or illness. Service members and their families receive coverage for diagnostics and treatment of injury or illness of the reproductive system, as well as diagnostic services for causes of infertility such as semen analysis, hormone evaluation and chromosomal studies. But IVF can cost between $15,000 and $30,000 for a single cycle, and most people require multiple cycles due to inconsistent success rates.

Eshelman, who won the Fort Leavenworth Military Spouse of the Year award in 2022, is optimistic that even if Trump’s executive order doesn’t result in immediate change, progress may be imminent on the legislative front. A bill mandating TRICARE coverage for IVF had bipartisan support in both houses of Congress last year but did not make it into the final version of the National Defense Authorization Act.

“That was a little bit of a heartbreak because we got so close,” Eshelman said. But she believes the country is on the precipice of real change in regard to infertility treatment coverage. “It is a marathon, and we’re in it for the long haul to try and get this done.”",https://militaryfamilies.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9829-2-scaled.jpg,N,-1.0,2025-04-17 14:56:19.259128

What Happened?

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled “How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills.” The report claimed Zynex engaged in an “oversupplying scheme” by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to “bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could.” The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were “kicking the company out of network.”

On this news, Zynex’s stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue “shortfall” in the quarter “due to slower than normal payments from certain payers.” Zynex further revealed “Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.” Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military.

On this news, Zynex’s stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

What Is The Lawsuit About?

The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company’s practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

If you purchased or otherwise acquired Zynex securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than May 19, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Cmdr.
Clara Pangco, laboratory department head at Naval Hospital Twentynine Palms in Twentynine Palms, California.
“All service members have Individual Medical Readiness requirements, which include specific immunizations, physical examinations, and medical evaluations,” he said.
“I am blessed with a great team,” Pangco said.
Gibson said, “It’s an honor to serve our beneficiaries, and we strive to provide them with world-class health care service.”","Defense Health Agency military medical laboratory professionals play a crucial role in supporting warfighter readiness, said U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr. Clara Pangco, laboratory department head at Naval Hospital Twentynine Palms in Twentynine Palms, California.

She is one of hundreds of military lab professionals who offer critical services and vital information to service members and families.

“Lab teams are part of patients’ health care teams and assist providers in making clinical decisions,” said Pangco.

“We provide relevant information to help treat and diagnose,” she said. “From a warfighting readiness standpoint—we ensure service members are ready to deploy and can meet the demands of combat operations.”

It’s fulfilling and rewarding work, noted Pangco.

“I love everything about laboratory science and its management, as we get to play scientists, investigators, and problem solvers every day,” she said, noting that their work is often behind the scenes.

“The laboratory result a patient or provider sees is but a small percentage of the work we do,” Pangco continued. “Day in and day out, we make sure the result is always accurate and reliable by ensuring we adhere to strict quality assurance requirements such as equipment maintenance, calibration, and quality control.”

Like the Twentynine Palms team, warfighter readiness is a priority for the lab team at Yokota Air Base in Tokyo, according to U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Cordy Herring, Yokota Air Base lab officer.

“All service members have Individual Medical Readiness requirements, which include specific immunizations, physical examinations, and medical evaluations,” he said. “The lab collects, tests, and ships samples for IMR testing to ensure people are medically ready for deployment.

“We also run several programs contributing to readiness,” said Herring, “including a frozen blood program, an expeditionary blood program, a laboratory biological defense team, and a walking blood bank team.”

In addition, the Yokota Air Base lab team supports clinical operations.

“The team examines tissues and bodily fluids and provides information to clinical teams to help determine overall health and treatment plans for our patients,” explained Herring. “We also provide blood products for hemorrhaging patients to save lives.”

The team collects forensic samples for alcohol-related incidents, aircraft mishaps, and also sends samples to assist with Department of Defense investigation processes.

“We are always striving for continuous improvement,” Herring added.

These improvement efforts were showcased during a recent visit from the Air Force Blood Program and the Food and Drug Administration.

“The visit resulted in the lab being named as one of the best within Japan’s DOD military hospitals and clinics,” said Herring. “The FDA was very impressed. We received a flawless inspection, acknowledging our safe blood practices and our commitment to care.”

Preventing Disease and the Spread of Infection

Lab professionals also help conserve service member strength by working to prevent disease and infection, said William Gibson, supervisory microbiologist at Madigan Army Medical Center at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington.

“Our lab tests over 100,000 specimens per year from beneficiaries on the West Coast, including Alaska, to the Midwest,” said Gibson. “The microbiology laboratory’s scope includes bacteriology, immunology, molecular microbiology, mycology, and blood parasitology.

“We are currently working on several projects including cervical cancer screening through HPV testing,” he continued.

“We started HPV primary screening on April 7, 2025—this is a national guideline supported practice that is both workflow optimization and fiscally efficient,” said Gibson. “This summer, we intend to offer HPV self-collection testing, which has the potential to increase access to care.”

Communicable disease reporting is another ongoing project.

“Infections are a fact of life. Everyone will be personally impacted by one throughout their lifespan,” he said. “Our active duty force travels the global and are exposed to a myriad of pathogens in which we must be able to provide education for prevention, prophylactics, diagnostics, and treatment for the world’s diseases.

“We are looking to make sure that the reporting systems used to trace certain infections contain all the applicable test results across the DHA enterprise,” said Gibson. “This helps ensure the DHA, especially Epidemiology and Infection Control staff, have accurate data to react to things like outbreaks and facilitate an operational picture regarding medical intelligence.”

Delivering for Beneficiaries

Herring said the lab is needed.

“Whether taking care of our patients, consoling a child when they are crying about getting blood collected, providing information to commanders to make decisions on careers, detecting possible biowarfare agents, or ensuring we can take care of our populace with blood programs—the lab is involved in operations,” he said.

This is all made possible through teamwork.

“The team works hard together,” said Herring. “They excel in all duties and leave programs better than they found it. We take care of each other, support each other through the stressful times, and celebrate our wins. We’re proud of how much we have grown, how much we have accomplished.”

Pangco had praise for the staff at Twentynine Palms.

“I am blessed with a great team,” Pangco said. ""Our recent successful FDA and College of American Pathologists reinspection was a testament of their hard work and dedication. The inspectors expressed noteworthy commendations. It was an all-around team success.""

Ultimately, caring for beneficiaries is at the heart of the work of every lab professional.

Gibson said, “It’s an honor to serve our beneficiaries, and we strive to provide them with world-class health care service.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2502/8852987/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-04-17 12:56:39.489628

If they now live more than 30 minutes but less than 100 miles away, they won't have to do anything to keep their Tricare Prime coverage and primary care manager.
If patients have moved more than 100 miles away from a Tricare Prime Service Area, they must decide within 90 days to switch to another plan.
""The Defense Health Agency to their credit has worked diligently with me, with the contract, to have those bills paid as quickly as possible.
But as we are continuing through this transformation, we are finding more and more places that we are challenged [to find] health care providers,"" Honea said.","Editor's note: This article by Patricia Kime originally appeared on Military.com, a leading source of news for the military and veteran community.

Beneficiaries who live within 100 miles of a military hospital or clinic but at least 30 minutes away by car no longer need to request a waiver to stay with Tricare Prime, the Defense Department's managed-care health program.

Under the next-generation Tricare contracts that went into effect Jan. 1, patients who move to a location outside that access standard for primary care can choose to receive care at the DoD facility or, if they already receive care there, keep their primary care manager without seeking a waiver.

According to the Defense Health Agency, beneficiaries who meet the criteria will receive a letter notifying them that their homes are outside the access-standard measure, but if they don't respond, they will remain with their current primary care managers, or PCMs, at their military treatment facility.

[TELL MOAA: Have You Faced TRICARE Access Barriers?]

Those who want to change primary care managers, however, can do so by following instructions in the letter.

""This new approach will help prevent unnecessary coverage gaps and ensure families keep access to their PCMs,"" said Shane Pham, a DHA management and program analyst, in a news release last week.

The change was among the requirements of the new contracts, known as T-5, which were issued to TriWest Healthcare Alliance in the Tricare West Region and Humana Military in the Tricare East Region on Jan. 1.

[UPDATED MONTHLY: MOAA's TRICARE Toolkit]

The allowance also coincides with an effort at the Defense Department to bring family members and military retirees back into military hospitals and clinics to ensure that the facilities have enough patients to maintain provider proficiency and curb the rising costs of private-sector care.

According to a memo issued Dec. 6, 2023, by then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks, the DoD hopes to increase the number of patients seen at military treatment facilities by 7% by the end of 2026, or a total of 3.3 million patients.

In a speech to uniformed and civilian federal health officials in March, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Dr. Stephen Ferrara said the DoD is pursuing the efforts in order to create a high-functioning medical system.

""The last thing that a family or that service member needs is to be worried about whether their family is getting adequate or high-quality care,"" Ferrara said.

According to Tricare officials, the decision to drop the drive time waiver was made based on patient satisfaction surveys showing that many beneficiaries are willing to drive more than 30 minutes to keep their primary care doctors and would prefer not to switch physicians.

If a Tricare Prime beneficiary moves more than 30 minutes from their PCM, their Tricare regional contract will contact all adult patients in the household by phone, text, mail and email to provide options for continuing their health coverage.

Patients will have 90 days to decide what to do. If they now live more than 30 minutes but less than 100 miles away, they won't have to do anything to keep their Tricare Prime coverage and primary care manager. Or they can switch health plans -- to Tricare Select or the U.S. Family Health Program, if it is available in their region.

If patients have moved more than 100 miles away from a Tricare Prime Service Area, they must decide within 90 days to switch to another plan. They will be dropped from Tricare Prime after 90 days and will be able to be seen at a military hospital or clinic only if space is available.

Defense Health Agency officials urge all beneficiaries to ensure that their addresses are updated in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System, or DEERS, and they also should check the email addresses and phone numbers the DoD has on file for accuracy.

Since the contract changeover Jan. 1, Tricare providers and patients have experienced disruptions to patient care and payments, resulting in patients having to switch providers or delay care and prompting providers to take out loans to pay staff while they wait for reimbursements.

The problems have caught the eye of lawmakers on Capitol Hill as well as military leadership, including the services' top enlisted leaders.

During a hearing last week before the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees military construction, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy James Honea said he personally has received complaints from providers about the reimbursement delays.

""The Defense Health Agency to their credit has worked diligently with me, with the contract, to have those bills paid as quickly as possible. But as we are continuing through this transformation, we are finding more and more places that we are challenged [to find] health care providers,"" Honea said.

Last month, Republican Reps. John Rutherford and Aaron Bean of Florida wrote to David Smith, the acting DHA director, asking him to explain the delays and fix them.

""It would be unacceptable for military families to lose access to critical care coverage. This crisis must be immediately rectified,"" they wrote.",https://insurancenewsnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/inn-social-default.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-17 11:56:42.187886

I have written the president, Elon Musk, and the head of Veterans Administration and given them my recommendations for improving VA. VA should not be in the mortgage business. Military personnel should be able to get a form from their command or issued along with their discharge certificate which they can take to any mortgage lender.

Education benefits should be managed by the states and the schools participating in the program.

Expand vets' access to local medical professionals, the same ones which provide medical coverage to military retirees under Tricare, so they don't have to travel any distance to a VA facility or wait because VA is understaffed.

Only one government agency should negotiate with drug manufacturers, not several like Tricare, VA, Medicare, Medicaid, etc. VA's list of meds is often incomplete.

VA clinics and hospitals should be for military-specific issues like PTSD, prostheses, etc. Frequently the specialists a vet is seeing at a VA facility are not VA docs, but those from a local university or major health-care provider in the community. Most VA clinics do not have specialists, usually just generalists, therefore requiring the vet to be referred elsewhere and often out of the immediate area.

The entire system needs to be reviewed.

Narcissistic king's tale

Imagine this bedtime story: There once was an arrogant narcissistic king who believed the country in which he lived treated him unfairly. Unjustly. He became so very mad that the trajectory of his life became a narcissistic bullet-ride straight to punish all who lived in The Land.

The king first concocted the most beautiful set of words the world would ever know or speak. Then he gathered groups of men and women who rejoiced and glowed in his shadow and basked in his privilege, money and power so they could learn how to use those beautiful words, say them, believe them. And they did.

Soon, millions and millions of people of all colors and in all walks of life went forth spreading those beautiful words--words that didn't have to have meaning or truth as long as they spread like covid and like incurable cancer, hid fact from fiction and truth from lies.

After a short time had passed the king sensed he had a full sovereign buy-in and that it was time to inflict punishment upon the Land. In one big breath, he tugged at the string that held his plan together. The markets and all that was attached came loose.

Throwing back his head, the king spoke out loud: ""So what!""

Betraying their oath

Where are Sen. Tom Cotton, Sen. John Boozman, and Rep. French Hill? The Trump regime is making every Arkansan less safe every day. The regime is thumbing its nose at the rule of law. Our allies are treated like enemies, and dictators who threaten freedom everywhere are being given whatever they want. Public health and science are being devastated. The Department of Justice is Trump's tool of vengeance.

The civil rights of everyone who is not white, Christian, male and straight are disappearing. Immigrants, and even citizens, who have committed no crimes are being detained and deported without due process.

Our elected legislators have sworn to uphold the Constitution and protect the fundamental rights of every person. But they are silent. They are complicit. They are too afraid of us to even show up at a town hall and listen to the people who elected them.

They work for us, but they are doing nothing to protect us. They are betraying us and their oath of office.

Senator Boozman, Senator Cotton, Congressman Hill: Do your jobs!

More than medicine

As a pharmacist at Econo-Mart Pharmacy in Batesville, I appreciated Nicki Hilliard's message in Sunday's Perspective section, which reminded Arkansans of all the essential services pharmacists can provide.

As a new mom, I understand how scary it is to deliver a baby in Arkansas (the state with the second-highest infant mortality rate in the country and one of the lowest maternal health standings in the country).

Fortunately, as a pharmacist, I am in a fantastic position to help other mothers in the state navigate the process of having and caring for their babies and themselves through pregnancy, family planning and beyond.

In small rural towns like mine, where specialized health care can be hours away, your neighborhood pharmacy can be the most accessible point of care. We're not just the folks who fill your prescriptions. We're helping pregnant women navigate which medicines are safe, answering calls from new parents with questions, consulting on contraceptive options, and giving vaccines to whole families. We're here to offer guidance, listen, and look out for the well-being of our community.

Pharmacists in Arkansas are trained and ready to help combat the maternal health crisis in our state. We can check blood pressure, screen for postpartum depression, consult on and prescribe birth control, and more. We're here to support moms and families.

I want my fellow small-town Arkansans to help spread the word and make sure everyone knows that their local pharmacist is more than just a friendly face behind the counter--we can be part of the solution to a healthier community with healthier women, moms and babies. Pharmacists across Arkansas are ready to help turn our maternal health stats around, one conversation, one screening and one patient at a time.

Regardless of eligibility, patients who seek care at military facilities after interpersonal violence should be treated as emergencies, the memo said.

Kageleiry said that he has seen civilian employees receive test kits at military facilities.","KAISERSLAUTERN, Germany — Defense Department civilian employees and contractors abroad can no longer get rape test kits done at military medical facilities, a decision that attorneys say will likely make it easier to get some evidentiary exhibits levied against accused service members excluded at court-martial.

The Military Health System said the recently issued guidance is meant to clear up confusion around who can receive the forensic evidence collection tests under existing policy.

It requires non-Tricare beneficiaries, which would include most civilian workers who aren’t married to service members, to seek testing at foreign clinics, which may have different standards for processing evidence.

The March 13 memo from the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs states that military health care providers only can treat civilians who say they were sexually assaulted in emergency situations — where life, limb or eyesight are put at risk.

“Forensic healthcare examination or follow-up care is not included in the definition on limited emergency services,” the memo states.

The memo also says military facilities must establish a process that ensures non-Tricare beneficiaries are stabilized and transferred to a civilian facility should they request a forensic exam.

Regardless of eligibility, patients who seek care at military facilities after interpersonal violence should be treated as emergencies, the memo said.

About 35,000 civilian employees support 172,000 active-duty service members stationed overseas, according to Defense Department data from December 2024, with the largest civilian populations living in Germany, Japan and South Korea.

Proper evidence collection can be an important part of a victim’s legal argument in the event they accuse a service member of sexual assault and the case leads to a court-martial.

The U.S. military has detailed protocols for the handling of evidence after an assault allegation, including rules about the chain of custody. Outside the military, collection methods vary by country.

A foreign test kit may be easier to discredit in court compared with one collected on a U.S. base, said retired Lt. Col. Will Helixon, a former special victims prosecutor who now works as a civilian military defense lawyer in Wiesbaden, Germany.

“Any skilled defense lawyer is going to be able to ask the questions that would exclude a lot of that evidence,” Helixon said in an interview.

Some nations, particularly in parts of the Middle East and Africa, also view the concept of sexual assault very differently, which can dissuade victims from seeking help off base.

Defense Department employees already face challenges when it comes to accessing health care in their host nations.

Medical facilities overseas offer limited care for those who aren’t active-duty service members, providing care for a fee depending on capacity. Services offered can vary vastly from month to month.

In Japan, DOD-affiliated civilians and families cite language barriers, complex billing and differences in approach to care as common hurdles, according to a recent report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office.

Pete Kageleiry Jr., a retired lieutenant colonel and former judge advocate who now works as a private military defense lawyer in Virginia, said the memo raises questions about the reliability of evidence.

Kageleiry said that he has seen civilian employees receive test kits at military facilities. The memo is a step backward compared to recent improvements the military has made to its handling of sexual assault, and it’s likely to impact overseas cases, he said.

“I know from experience that these cases arise in every environment, like a contingency operation,” Kageleiry said. “There’s civilians with the force everywhere.”

Peter Graves, a spokesperson for the Military Health System, said forensic evidence collection policies were developed for the treatment of service members and their dependents, and do not include testing for people who are not insured by Tricare.

“There are significant gaps in policy and processes that contribute to risk, revictimization, and confusion when persons from outside the system present to (military health facilities) after a sexual assault,” Graves said in a statement. “This is compounded in overseas locations where host nations may not provide or recognize (sexual assault forensic exams).”

“The Department will continue to explore potential policy changes that mitigate risks associated with providing (such exams) to these persons,” Graves said.",https://www.stripes.com/incoming/nvdb4r-180425testkitsphoto01.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/180425TESTKITSphoto01.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-17 09:56:52.529416

NEW YORK, April 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP , a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Zynex, Inc. (“Zynex” or the“Company”) (NASDAQ: ZYXI) and reminds investors of the May 19, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See .

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled“How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills.” The report claimed Zynex engaged in an“oversupplying scheme” by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to“bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could.” The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were“kicking the company out of network.”

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue“shortfall” in the quarter“due to slower than normal payments from certain payers.” Zynex further revealed“Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.” Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military.

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On Monday, April 14, the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) convened the first meeting of the Protect Access to Health Care Act Stakeholder Advisory Committee, responsible for advising DHCS on developing and implementing components of Proposition 35.

The California Medical Association (CMA) co-chaired the coalition that put Prop. 35 before the voters in November 2024. The initiative provides a dedicated, ongoing source of funding to increase access to health care and increase Medi-Cal reimbursement rates.

During the first advisory committee meeting, Linnea Koopmans, Chief Executive Officer of Local Health Plans of California – and a key member of the Prop. 35 coalition – was elected chair of the committee.

Though Prop. 35 was overwhelmingly supported by voters this past November, the state has been slow to begin implementation.

“After three years of work, it’s incredibly rewarding to see Prop. 35 moving from concept to implementation,” said CMA Chief of Staff Janice Rocco, who testified during the meeting. “Our priority now is to act swiftly—so we can get the 2025 dollars flowing and begin delivering on the promise of meaningful payment reform.”

While this first meeting was largely procedural, the committee has committed to holding its next meeting in May. CMA will remain engaged to ensure physician payment updates are implemented without further delay to make access to care a reality for California’s 15 million Medi-Cal enrollees.

Facts and Stats on Suboxone and Drug Addiction in Middle Tennessee

Facts and Stats on Suboxone and Drug Addiction in Middle Tennessee

Suboxone use statistics in Middle Tennessee reveal both progress and ongoing challenges in the fight against opioid addiction. As of 2023, Tennessee had a buprenorphine dispensing rate of 10.4 per 100 people, with 131 treatment facilities prescribing Suboxone or similar medications.

Despite 1,007 certified providers for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD), the state faced an estimated 70,000 people affected by OUD, creating a significant treatment gap. In 2016, 67 deaths were linked to buprenorphine, highlighting the need for careful oversight. However, a 2019 JAMA study showed nearly 75% of adults using buprenorphine took it as prescribed. These figures suggest that while Suboxone is widely used and often safely managed, access to care remains a major issue across Middle Tennessee.

Why Suboxone Is Commonly Used in Recovery Programs

Suboxone is commonly used in recovery programs because it eases opioid withdrawal symptoms and reduces cravings, making it easier for you to focus on healing. It’s typically prescribed and used under the close supervision of a medical expert to ensure it’s safe and effective.

As part of medication-assisted treatment in Tennessee, Suboxone allows you to stabilize physically while addressing the psychological aspects of substance use disorder. When combined with counseling, support groups, and other intervention strategies, Suboxone can be a powerful tool for your addiction recovery. If you’re considering Suboxone treatment in Tennessee, it’s important to work with trusted providers who understand how to use this medication as part of a comprehensive recovery approach.

How Suboxone Helps Manage Substance Addiction Symptoms

How Suboxone Helps Manage Substance Addiction Symptoms

Suboxone helps manage substance addiction symptoms by reducing cravings and suboxone withdrawal effects. It contains buprenorphine, which alleviates physical discomfort, and naloxone, which discourages misuse. Taken under medical supervision, Suboxone stabilizes your system so you can focus on the psychological aspects of recovery. If you’re battling opioid addiction, Suboxone can provide essential support.

How Suboxone Targets Opioid Use Disorder (OUD)

How Suboxone Targets Opioid Use Disorder (OUD)

Suboxone targets Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) by combining buprenorphine, which reduces cravings and lessens withdrawal symptoms, with naloxone to prevent misuse. This dual-action approach helps stabilize your brain chemistry, allowing you to manage your addiction safely. Used as part of a comprehensive treatment plan, Suboxone can make it easier for you to focus on long-term recovery from opioid addiction.

Why Suboxone Works for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) Recovery

Suboxone effectively treats Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) because it helps you manage withdrawal symptoms, reduce cravings, and support long-term recovery. By combining buprenorphine and naloxone, Suboxone promotes wellness, minimizes symptoms, and decreases the risk of overdose. Below, we’ll explore how Suboxone supports these essential aspects of recovery.

Minimizes Symptoms During Detox and Recovery

Minimizes Symptoms During Detox and Recovery

Suboxone minimizes symptoms during detoxification and recovery by helping to ease withdrawal. It stabilizes your brain chemistry, reducing cravings and discomfort. This makes the detoxification process more manageable and lessens the severity of symptoms like anxiety, pain, and insomnia. By minimizing these challenges, Suboxone increases your chances of staying on track during your recovery.

Promotes Wellness and Daily Functioning

Promotes Wellness and Daily Functioning

Suboxone promotes wellness and daily functioning by stabilizing your physical and mental health. It balances your brain’s chemistry, allowing you to focus on rebuilding your life. With fewer cravings and a clearer mind, you can engage in work, social activities, and therapy, all while maintaining your recovery progress and improving your overall quality of life.

Decreases Risk of Overdose in Opioid Recovery

Decreases Risk of Overdose in Opioid Recovery

Suboxone decreases the risk of overdose during opioid recovery by preventing the misuse of opioids. The naloxone component in Suboxone blocks the effects of any opioids you might try to misuse, while the buprenorphine helps reduce cravings and withdrawal. This combination reduces the likelihood of relapse and overdose, making it a safer option for your recovery.

How Much Is Suboxone Treatment Without TRICARE East Coverage?

The cost of Suboxone treatment can vary significantly if you do not have TRICARE East coverage. Outpatient rehab programs in Tennessee average $1,698. In contrast, residential rehab programs typically have a much higher price tag, with costs averaging about $56,600 for a 30-day stay.

These expenses can be a significant barrier to treatment, but there are options to reduce costs through insurance coverage and other resources. Give us a call to learn more about how we can help you access the care you need.

TRICARE East typically covers Suboxone treatment as part of its comprehensive approach to opioid addiction recovery. Reach out to Freeman Addiction Recovery Center to better understand your insurance coverage and get help with treatment costs.

Statistics Into Suboxone Use in Tennessee

Statistics Into Suboxone Use in Tennessee

According to SAMHSA, in Tennessee, 131 substance use treatment facilities prescribe Suboxone or other medications combining buprenorphine with naloxone.

In 2023, the buprenorphine dispensing rate in Tennessee was 10.4 per 100 people, according to the CDC.

The Tennessee Department of Health found 67 deaths associated with buprenorphine in 2016.

In 2020, Tennessee had 1,007 providers capable of prescribing buprenorphine for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD), but an estimated 70,000 people were affected by OUD, making the patient-provider ratio 70:1, The Tennessean reported.

A 2019 study published in JAMA revealed nearly 75% of U.S. adults who used buprenorphine in the past year followed their prescriptions as directed. Among those who did misuse buprenorphine, most had also used prescription opioids that were not prescribed to them.",https://www.freemanrecoverycenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Veteran-in-Individual-therapy.jpeg,N,1.0,2025-04-16 22:56:31.395838

Dismal Q4 Results Prompts Multiple Downgrades

On April 15, 2025, RBC Capital Markets reportedly further reduced its price target for Zynex stock to $5 per share. This marks the second downward revision in as many months and represents a significant erosion from RBC’s initial $11 per share target, effectively cutting its valuation outlook by approximately 55%.

The latest adjustment from RBC Capital analyst Shagun Singh follows a disappointing fourth-quarter 2024 earnings report on March 11 that revealed a year-over-year revenue decline of approximately 2%, landing at $46.0 million. The company also swung to a net loss of $0.02 per share, a stark contrast to the $0.04 profit reported in the same period a year prior, despite a stable gross profit margin of 78%.

Singh, who also downgraded Zynex's rating to ""Sector Perform"" from ""Outperform"" last month, cited a lack of clarity surrounding the company's operational and commercial prospects following the recent financial disclosure.

A significant factor weighing on Zynex is the temporary suspension of payments from Tricare, its largest customer, as the insurer conducts a review of past claims. The company has also declined to provide financial guidance for the current year and has initiated a workforce reduction of roughly 15%. Singh previously flagged the potential for a ""domino effect"" stemming from the Tricare situation, further eroding investor confidence.

The payment woes with Tricare appear to be intertwined with more serious allegations leveled against Zynex in a newly filed securities class action.

Zynex Securities Class Action Alleges ""Oversupplying"" Scheme

The securities class action lawsuit, Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., et al., filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, alleges that Zynex engaged in a practice of ""oversupplying"" customers with products, notably electrodes, which purportedly inflated revenue figures. The complaint contends that this practice drew the scrutiny of insurers, including Tricare, and that Zynex failed to adequately disclose the potential for adverse consequences such as network exclusions and potential government penalties. The class action seeks to represent investors who purchased Zynex securities between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

The truth allegedly began to emerge through a June 4, 2024 report by the medical journal STAAT, which detailed an alleged ""oversupplying scheme"" involving excessive shipments and inflated billing. The report also indicated that insurers were moving to exclude Zynex from their networks.

The lawsuit then points to Zynex's March 11, 2025, announcement of its weak fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results as the moment the alleged truth was revealed. During the earnings call, Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard attributed the revenue shortfall to ""slower than normal payments from certain payers"" and the Tricare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman’s Investigation

Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. “The recent developments, including the lowered outlook and the specifics of the class action, underscore the serious concerns surrounding Zynex's disclosures. Our investigation is focused on ensuring accountability for any potential wrongdoing that may have harmed investors,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Inpatient military mental health treatment offers a way to heal that acknowledges the experiences of service members and veterans.
Tricare Rehabs can help you find inpatient mental health treatment programs that will give military personnel a sense of security in their recovery.","Inpatient mental health treatment means 24/7 care in a structured, hospital-like or residential environment. For military personnel these programs are designed with their unique experiences, traumas and culture in mind. Unlike outpatient care where you can go home after therapy sessions, inpatient care provides round the clock monitoring, medical supervision and a focused healing environment.

This type of care is recommended for those experiencing severe mental health symptoms, co-occurring disorders (like PTSD and substance use), suicidal ideation, or those who haven’t responded well to outpatient therapy. It’s also used as a stepping stone when proceeding to more long-term outpatient treatment after completing initial levels of care.

The military experience is unlike any other. Service members go through rigorous physical training, strict discipline, prolonged separation from loved ones, and the constant possibility of combat. These factors can lead to a range of mental health challenges including:

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)

Depression and Anxiety Disorders

Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)

Moral Injury

Substance Use Disorders (SUDs)

Adjustment Disorders

Suicidal Ideation

Traditional mental health treatment may not always resonate with military members. They may feel misunderstood, stigmatized, or reluctant to open up in civilian therapy settings.

Inpatient military mental health treatment programs are built around cultural competence and understanding of the military mindset—values like honor, duty, loyalty, and resilience are recognized and incorporated into therapeutic approaches.

Entering inpatient treatment is a big step and for many military members, whether they have been referred by a medical provider or are taking this step on their own. In most cases, they are starting this chapter after months or even years of struggling in silence.

Here are some signs inpatient care might be necessary:

Intense PTSD symptoms that interfere with daily life

Severe depression or anxiety that doesn’t improve with outpatient care

Suicidal thoughts or behaviors

Substance misuse that’s spiraling out of control

Unable to manage daily life, relationships, or responsibilities

Recent crisis or mental health emergency

Co-occurring mental and physical health issues including chronic pain or TBI

In many cases inpatient care is the safest and most effective environment to stabilize and start meaningful recovery.

What to Expect in an Inpatient Military Mental Health Program

While no two programs are the same, most inpatient military mental health treatment centers follow a structured, evidence-based approach. Here’s what you can expect:

1. Comprehensive Assessment

Upon admission individuals undergo a full physical, psychological and psychiatric evaluation. This includes a review of medical history, trauma history, any past treatments, current symptoms and risk factors. The goal is to create a personalized treatment plan that addresses the individual’s unique needs.

2. 24/7 Supervised Care

One of the hallmarks of inpatient treatment is around-the-clock supervision by medical professionals, psychiatrists, and therapists. This ensures safety and allows for immediate intervention if a crisis arises. It’s especially important for those who are at risk of self-harm or struggling with severe PTSD flashbacks, dissociation, or panic attacks.

3. Individual and Group Therapy

Therapy is the core of inpatient treatment. Patients participate in one-on-one sessions and group therapy. These may include:

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)

Prolonged Exposure Therapy

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)

Moral Injury Repair Therapy

Trauma-Informed Therapy

4. Family Involvement

Military culture emphasizes loyalty and unit cohesion—and family is often part of that unit. Many inpatient programs offer family therapy, education sessions, or structured visits to involve loved ones in the healing process. This can be key in rebuilding trust, communication, and support systems after mental health has disrupted relationships.

5. Medication Management

In some cases, psychiatric medication is part of the treatment plan. Whether it’s antidepressants, mood stabilizers, or medication to assist with sleep, all prescriptions are closely monitored and adjusted based on the individual’s response and needs.

6. Holistic and Experiential Therapies

Many modern inpatient facilities incorporate holistic approaches like:

Mindfulness and meditation

Yoga and physical fitness

Art or music therapy

Equine-assisted therapy

Adventure or wilderness therapy

These modalities can help veterans reconnect with their bodies, manage stress, and access emotions in nonverbal ways.

7. Transition and Discharge Planning

From day one clinicians begin planning for what comes next. Whether it’s stepping down to outpatient care, entering a sober living home, or returning to duty (if applicable) a personalized aftercare plan ensures continuity and reduces the risk of relapse or regression.

So how does someone start this journey? Access points can vary based on whether someone is active duty, a veteran or a military family member.

For Active Duty Service Members

Most military personnel can access inpatient care through their branch’s medical facilities or TRICARE-approved civilian programs. They may need to go through their base’s behavioral health clinic or receive a referral from a primary care provider or command.

In emergencies, service members can be hospitalized immediately without a referral. Confidentiality and career concerns are common fears but there are safeguards in place. In fact, seeking help is now widely promoted as a sign of strength, not weakness.

For Veterans

Veterans can access inpatient mental health care through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or community-based programs that partner with the VA. The VA offers a range of inpatient options including:

PTSD residential treatment

Substance use rehabilitation

Dual diagnosis programs

Crisis stabilization units

Some nonprofit organizations and private providers also offer veteran-focused care that accepts VA benefits or other forms of coverage.

For Military Families

While spouses and children of service members may not need the same kind of military-specific mental health treatment they too face unique pressures. Inpatient options are more limited but can sometimes be accessed through TRICARE-authorized facilities or community mental health centers.

Despite the growing awareness and advocacy around mental health in the military, stigma still prevents many from seeking the help they need. The idea that admitting to mental health struggles could hurt one’s career, reputation, or perceived strength runs deep. But here’s the truth: taking action and seeking treatment—especially inpatient care when it’s needed—is one of the bravest most proactive steps a person can take.

Leaders across branches are working hard to normalize mental health care and ensure policies support rather than punish service members who seek help. Initiatives like embedded behavioral health units, peer support programs, and command-level training are creating safer environments for honest conversations.

The Long-Term Benefits of Inpatient Treatment

While inpatient treatment is intensive the benefits can be life-changing. Here’s what many military members and veterans gain:

Improved symptom management and emotional regulation

Better relationships with family, peers, and themselves

Greater insight into their triggers and coping strategies

Reintegration support for transitioning to civilian life

Connection to peers who understand the military mindset

A foundation for lifelong recovery and wellness

Healthy coping skills and mechanisms

For some inpatient care is the first time in years—or ever—that they feel seen, understood, and supported.

Service members are strong, sacrifice and resilient. But even the strongest need help sometimes. Inpatient military mental health treatment offers a way to heal that acknowledges the experiences of service members and veterans. It’s not just about managing symptoms – it’s about rebuilding lives, restoring hope and redefining what it means to be strong.

We want to make sure none of our valued readers miss out on this groundbreaking opportunity!","We came across a bullish thesis on GRAIL, Inc. (GRAL) on Value Investing Subreddit Page by mike-some. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on GRAL. GRAIL, Inc. (GRAL)’s share was trading at $25.93 as of April 15th.

Grail, the undisputed leader in multi-cancer early detection (MCED), was spun off from Illumina in June 2024 following antitrust pressures in Europe, despite Illumina acquiring it for $8 billion in 2020. The spin-off, which left Illumina with a 14.5% stake, included a $775 million cash infusion—enough for a 2.5-year runway—making Grail’s current market cap roughly equal to its net cash. Its flagship product, Galleri, is a breakthrough blood test capable of detecting up to 50 types of cancer—many of which have no routine screening options—using machine learning to identify cancer-specific methylation patterns in cell-free DNA. Initial results from the PATHFINDER study were promising, and three major trials are underway: the 140,000-person NHS-Galleri trial in the UK, the 20,000-person PATHFINDER II trial with Medicare, and the REFLECTION study via the VA, which led to Tricare coverage for at-risk individuals over 50. The NHS and Medicare trials, with results expected in late 2025 and 2026, could trigger broad reimbursement approval. A successful Medicare rollout alone—at a $300 reimbursement per test, 30% adherence, and one test every two years—could drive $2.25 billion in sales, implying an $11 billion valuation at 5x sales. That’s a potential 14x return from today’s levels, with minimal market awareness.

GRAIL, Inc. (GRAL) is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 28 hedge fund portfolios held GRAL at the end of the fourth quarter which was 25 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of GRAL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Charleston City Paper is an award-winning weekly newspaper in Charleston, S.C.","The Charleston City Paper

It’s a good thing Dr. Edward Simmer is a psychiatrist.

Any other kind of physician might have been baffled last week when the S.C. Senate Medical Affairs Committee voted 12-5 to reject his gubernatorial nomination to lead the state Department of Public Health.

After all, his credentials are nothing short of spectacular: 30 years as an active duty Navy doctor. Chief medical officer of TRICARE, where he oversaw care for millions of service members, veterans and families. And since 2021, the director of the former state Department of Health and Environmental Control and then interim director of public health right here in South Carolina, garnering valuable state experience and winning the trust of Gov. Henry McMaster, who nominated him last November.

So, yes, most doctors are probably mystified by the committee’s rejection. But not Simmer, who sat patiently as one senator after another condemned his record of recommending — not mandating, just recommending — masks and vaccines during the Covid pandemic that killed 19,000 people in the Palmetto State.

As a trained mental health professional, he must have known exactly what was going on: The inmates were running the asylum.

“What you’re asking us to do is have confidence in your judgment to do this job,” said hard right Sen. Matt Leber (R-Charleston), after attacking Simmer for supporting voluntary masking and vaccination. “And the history of it, uh, I’m not confident.”

Simmer, ever the gentleman throughout the hearing, respectfully reminded the senator that under his leadership, the state consistently followed the best available science — even when it was at odds with the advice coming from federal officials.

That’s why Palmetto State schools were allowed to reopen in August 2020, well before most. And it’s why our public health authorities did everything in their power to help S.C. businesses keep their doors open throughout the crisis.

But Republicans on the committee made it clear that they weren’t going to be dragged into a tedious conversation about facts and science. Humbug! Not when the only medical research S.C. public health officials should ever concern themselves with was published and peer reviewed by the states in 1787.

“We didn’t have all the information,” Sen. Tom Fernandez (R-Dorchester) told Simmer. “We had the United States Constitution, we had personal liberty, we had personal freedom. That’s the best information at any time of any emergency.”

Of course, Fernandez offered no evidence that Simmer had ever violated the Constitution. But no matter. Vibes, not substance, were the order of the day when Simmer faced these lemmings and accusers.

To his credit, McMaster stood by his man after the vote, urging the full Senate to override the committee.

“I remain resolute in my support of Dr. Ed Simmer and am hopeful that the full Senate will see through the falsehoods and mistruths being spread about his service to our state and nation,” McMaster said in a social media post.

Still, the prognosis for Simmer’s nomination is grim, with one senator suggesting he’d be better off looking for work in the Department of Mental Health.

Which, inevitably, put us in mind of the most famous words ever uttered about the Palmetto State, offered by Charleston attorney James L. Petigru on the eve of secession in 1860.

“South Carolina,” he noted, “too small for a republic, but too large for an insane asylum.”

The CAM and the M18A2 indicated the possible presence of mustard agent; the one-color detector paper turned brown denying presence of mustard agent, and the three-color detector paper changed colors but did not confirm mustard agent.
The container would be useful to the United Nations efforts because if the container did contain chemical warfare agent, it would demonstrate Iraq's forward deployment of bulk chemical warfare agent.

[185] M256 chemical warfare agent detector kit In the field, the M256-series chemical warfare agent detector kit is simply referred to as the M256 kit.","In early August 1991, personnel from Passive Barriers Limited, a British explosive ordnance firm, discovered a storage tank believed to contain chemical warfare agent next to the perimeter wall of the Kuwaiti Girls' School in Kuwait City, Kuwait. Witnesses described the tank as emitting brown vapors through two bullet holes in the tank. Initial field tests suggested the possible presence of mustard agent, but the results were inconclusive. American and British military personnel conducted four operations in August 1991 to determine if the tank contained chemical warfare agent and to permanently seal the holes in the tank.

Maj. Jonathan Watkinson, commander of the 21st Explosive Ordnance Disposal Squadron, British Royal Engineers, commanded joint British and American operations to identify the contents of the tank. He used several types of chemical warfare agent detection equipment including a Chemical Agent Monitor, both one- and three-color chemical warfare agent detector papers, and an M18A2 chemical warfare agent detection kit. The Chemical Agent Monitor registered 8 bars, a positive result, for mustard agent. The chemical warfare agent detector papers and the M18A2 kit produced inconclusive results. After Major Watkinson's initial tests, two Fox nuclear, biological, and chemical reconnaissance vehicles sent to the girls' school initially alerted for the possible presence of the chemical warfare agents mustard and phosgene. MM-1 initial alerts, however, do not verify the presence of chemical warfare agents. The Fox crews took additional steps, known as spectrum analyses, that disproved the initial results of mustard and phosgene but indicated the presence of an unknown substance.

To confirm the presence or absence of chemical warfare agents in the tank, a British sampling team extracted liquid from the tank for laboratory analysis. The samples remained in the custody of the sampling team or an authorized individual until delivered to the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment at Porton Down, United Kingdom. The United Nations had designated the laboratory at Porton Down as a preeminent authority to analyze samples of chemical warfare agents sent from Iraq. Scientists at the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment produced an initial report on the laboratory analyses of the samples taken from the tank. Their 1991 initial report stated that the samples were consistent with the tank containing nitric acid and there was no evidence of any chemical warfare agent in the tank.

In 1994, the tank found at the Kuwaiti Girls' School became a focus of government and media scrutiny in the U.S. and the United Kingdom when veterans and the general public feared possible exposure of soldiers to chemical warfare agents. The American public and Gulf War veterans suspected Iraq's chemical warfare agent inventory could be a possible cause of reported undiagnosed illnesses in Gulf War veterans. A contemporary press article that appeared in the British newspaper, The Sunday Observer, reported the 1991 discovery of a container full of mustard agent in Kuwait City, Kuwait. The U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs launched an investigation to determine if in fact the tank contained a chemical warfare agent, thus possibly exposing military personnel. The Senate committee reviewed documentation and interviewed U.S. military personnel who participated in the testing or sampling of the tank's contents at the Kuwaiti Girls' School. Although some of the initial results of Major Watkinson's field tests using various types of chemical detection equipment supported the Senate committee's conclusion that a chemical warfare agent may have been present in the tank, laboratory and Fox vehicle analysis did not. Despite the laboratory evidence to the contrary, the Senate committee disagreed with the DOD and concluded publicly that chemical warfare agent had been present in the storage tank. In the United Kingdom, parliamentary questions born out of the U.S. Senate committee's declaration have repeatedly been raised.

In 1997, the DOD commenced a joint investigation with the Ministry of Defence in the United Kingdom. This investigation revealed new evidence confirming the tank did not contain a chemical warfare agent, but most likely contained nitric acid. This evidence included copies of the two Fox vehicles' MM-1 mobile mass spectrometer tapes produced at the tank site on Aug. 9, 1991. Chemical experts at the Edgewood Research, Development, and Engineering Center, mass spectrum experts at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the manufacturer of the MM-1 mobile mass spectrometer all analyzed the mass spectrometer tapes produced at the tank site. They concluded definitively that the tank did not contain chemical warfare agent, but indicated the presence of nitric acid.

The liquid samples extracted from the tank at the Kuwaiti Girls' School provide physical evidence that the tank did not contain chemical warfare agent, but did contain nitric acid, most likely inhibited red fuming nitric acid. We acknowledge that the tank probably did not contain pure nitric acid, but more likely contained a mixture of nitric acid and other unknown substances or contaminants as a result of exposure to the environment (for example, water, sand, and pollutants). The tank emitted brown-colored fumes, indicating the tank contained red fuming nitric acid, which is composed of nitric acid, water, and several forms of nitrogen oxide. We also believe the tank contained an inhibitor due to the lack of corrosion of the tank as described by eyewitnesses. However, because the liquid sample was not tested specifically for an inhibitor, we cannot confirm with certainty what inhibitor, if any, was in the tank. Therefore, we conclude that the tank contained nitric acid-most likely inhibited red fuming nitric acid. This chemical is an oxidizer used in Seersucker missiles that were maintained at the girls' school.

In March 1998, the DOD, in cooperation with the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence, published the initial report of our investigation of a suspicious metal storage tank, believed to contain chemical warfare agent, discovered next to the perimeter wall of a girls' school in Kuwait City, Kuwait, following the Gulf War. Although we have not received any new evidence concerning this investigation, the Presidential Special Oversight Board reviewed the narrative and recommended that we amend and republish it as a final report after incorporating additional clarifying information. Consequently, this report provides more detail and a more accurate discussion of the events at the Kuwaiti Girls' School and the evidence about the tank's contents.

1. Location and Identification of the Kuwaiti Girls' School

In early March 1991, Coalition forces in Kuwait explored the Al Badawiyah Girls' Sciences School in the Al Badawiyah suburb of Kuwait City at coordinates 2904N4806E (Universal Transverse Mercator grid TN18832039).[2] (Figure 2).[3] The Al Badawiyah Girls' Sciences School has several different names: The Sabahiyah High School for Girls[4] and the Ansarieh Banat Kebeed School.[5] The school falls within the Sabahiyah municipality and the Badawiyah district and thus may also be known by locality.[6] In 1997, the school was named the Al Nasser School for Secondary Curriculum (Figure 3). Since that time, the United Kingdom (UK) Parliament, the United States (US) Senate and Department of Defense, and the media have referred to the building as the Kuwaiti Girls' School. Thus, for consistency, this report refers to it as the Kuwaiti Girls' School.

2. Iraq's Use of the Kuwaiti Girls' School as Missile Maintenance Facility

During the Gulf War, Iraq used the Kuwaiti Girls' School as a missile test and maintenance facility. A March 29, 1991, initial intelligence report stated Coalition forces found six Chinese-made Seersucker missiles, mistakenly referred to as Silkworm missiles, inside the building at the Kuwaiti Girls' School. (Figures 4 and 5). The report also noted the presence of missile test carts, cabling, two abandoned Soviet missile transport trucks next to a truck-mounted crane 100 meters west of the school, and a Chinese generator positioned 600 meters west of the school.[7] The initial intelligence report did not refer to any missile fuel or oxidizer storage tank near the school, but photography taken on March 1, 1991, does show the tank at the school (Figure 6).

3. Clearance of Unexploded Ordnance in Kuwait

Although the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency assessed before Operation Desert Storm that Iraq was ""likely to have a CW [chemical warfare] warhead for its Silkworms,""[8] the missiles discovered at the Kuwaiti Girls' School had conventional, high explosive warheads.[9] A report on captured military hardware dated September 12, 1991, stated that 30 Silkworm warheads to be sent to the United States in September/October of 1991 would be available for evaluation.[10] The Terra Group, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, received 19 warheads, nine warheads went to the Naval Warfare Center, China Lake, California, and the last two went to the Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technical Center at Indian Head, Maryland.[11] According to the head of security for the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, the paperwork for all 19 warheads indicated they were all high explosive, not chemical-filled. A representative from the Naval Warfare Center, China Lake, California, reported the nine warheads his organization destroyed were all high explosive warheads. A representative from the Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technical Center at Indian Head, Maryland, indicated that he had not heard of warheads for Iraq's Silkworms that could carry chemical warfare agents. He also reported the two warheads sent to Indian Head were conventional, high explosive warheads.[12]

Following the expulsion of Iraq's military forces from Kuwait, the government of Kuwait began to rebuild the infrastructure damaged during Iraq's occupation. To help the Kuwaiti government coordinate this mission, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers established the Defense Reconstruction Assistance Office (DRAO) and the Kuwait Emergency Recovery Office (KERO). However, unexploded ordnance located throughout Kuwait impeded the reconstruction efforts. The government of Kuwait issued contracts to Coalition nations to clear unexploded ordnance within Kuwait. They divided the country into six sectors to distribute the work among Coalition forces, specifically the UK, US, France, Egypt, Bangladesh, and Pakistan.[13]

Each country approached the ordnance disposal mission slightly differently. Egypt, Bangladesh, and Pakistan assigned the duties to their own soldiers, while France the UK and the U.S. used contractors to accomplish the task.[14] The United Kingdom retained Royal Ordnance, a British firm specializing in explosive ordnance, to clear its sector. In turn, Royal Ordnance hired British soldiers trained in ordnance disposal from the UK MoD.

In early August 1991, a British explosive ordnance firm, Passive Barriers, was subcontracted by Brown and Root International Inc., an American firm hired by the U.S. government to manage reconstruction projects in the sector designated to the US for infrastructure repair. As the Kuwaiti Girls' School fell within the U.S. sector of responsibility, Brown and Root were responsible for its repair. According to the Brown and Root supervisor, the protocol for the reconstruction effort called for Passive Barriers to clear the area before Brown and Root commenced work. While clearing the area around the Kuwaiti Girls' School, Passive Barriers personnel discovered the storage tank next to the exterior side of the perimeter wall surrounding the Kuwaiti Girls' School (Figure 7). Passive Barriers notified Brown & Root management, who then asked KERO to send someone to survey the tank and identify its contents so that it could be disposed of safely.

Assigned to support the KERO, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers safety officer conducted the initial inspection of the tank. His inspection revealed rust-colored fumes emitting through two holes in the tank (Figure 8), an amount he equated to that of a heavily smoking cigar. A bullet had pierced the tank, had broken in half on entry, and part of the bullet remained at the exit hole.

The safety officer reported that he heard that the tank contained mustard agent, but recalled thinking at the time the fumes smelled like nitric acid. He tapped the tank to determine the fill level; it was approximately one-third full. Despite not wearing protective gear and being close to the fumes, the safety officer reported no symptoms of exposure to chemical warfare agent. The rust color, the acid smell of the fumes, and his lack of symptoms akin to mustard agent exposure led the safety officer to believe the tank likely contained nitric acid.[15] The safety officer was the only person who identified the acid smell of the fumes. After the safety officer's inspection, all other inspections of the tank were conducted wearing protective clothing and respirators.

The safety officer verbally reported the findings of his inspection, conveyed his belief the tank contained nitric acid, and relinquished his pictures of the tank to the DRAO operations officer, but did not prepare a written report of his inspection.[16] Maj. Gen. Patrick Kelly, the DRAO commander, visited the tank site and ordered an inspection of the tank. He also requested Kuwait's Army Chief of Staff send a team to secure the area.[17]

Concerns about the possibility that the tank contained chemical warfare agent and an overlap in responsibilities resulted in four separate related operations to test the contents of the tank. The operations consisted of the following:

Maj. Watkinson's initial tests;

the Fox vehicle testing; and

sampling of the tank's contents; and

field tests of the liquid from the tank on the protective clothing.

Following this final operation, the holes in the tank were permanently sealed.

Communication regarding each of the operations was limited for several reasons. The same individuals did not participate in all four operations, and often these individuals were not aware of the other operations. An abbreviated listing of the major individuals and organizations involved in testing the tank's contents is at Tab E. Because of the multiple actions at the tank, some individuals ended their involvement with limited information and unanswered questions about the exact nature of the tank's contents. For graphical representations of what each participant knew about the events as well as a timeline, see Tabs F and G. Also, the sectors delineated for ordnance clearing did not correspond to the boundaries used for reconstruction efforts. The Kuwaiti Girls' School, while in the sector assigned to the U.S. for reconstruction, was in the British sector for ordnance clearing.[18] Therefore, the British commanded all operations to test the tank's contents with assistance provided by U.S. forces. The multi-national participation in these operations ultimately affected the promptness in which information flowed to participants.

On Aug. 5, 1991, Kuwaiti military officers tasked the British firm, Royal Ordnance, to examine the tank at the Kuwaiti Girls' School. On loan to Royal Ordnance specifically to conduct ordnance disposal operations, the 21st EOD Squadron, British Royal Engineers, commanded by Maj. Jonathan Watkinson, set out to investigate the tank. At the same time, a U.S. Brigadier General in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, tasked the commanding officer of the U.S. 146th EOD Detachment to investigate the tank, and expressed concern that the tank ""possibly contained mustard agent.""[19] In 1997, Maj. Watkinson described this assignment:

I attended a meeting on the 5th of August [1991] with the Kuwaiti Ministry of Defence which was a regular meeting, between Kuwaiti Army Officers and various agencies in Kuwait, who were involved in EOD operations. It was at that meeting that I first became aware of the container, because one of the Kuwaiti officers specifically asked Royal Ordnance if they could investigate it. A member of the Royal Ordnance management team was at that meeting and they immediately referred the problem to me to investigate, which I subsequently did...[20]

On Aug. 5, 1991, the commanding officer of the U.S. 146th EOD Detachment reported that he accompanied Maj. Watkinson to the Kuwaiti Girls' School to examine the tank and search the site for additional tanks and other suspicious items.[21] However, Maj. Watkinson does not recall any U.S. personnel being present during his initial testing of the tank, nor does he mention any U.S. personnel in his post-operation report. Maj. Watkinson's report mentions only the Bomb Disposal Engineer with him at the school on this occasion.[22]

At the Kuwaiti Girls' School, Maj. Watkinson located the metal storage tank outside the perimeter walls of the school. Maj. Watkinson described the tank as having a capacity of approximately 2000 liters.[23] No one informed Maj. Watkinson or any other individual sent to the school of the earlier assessment by the safety officer that, based on the color and smell of the fumes, the tank may have contained nitric acid.

Dressed in full individual protective clothing (Figure 9), Maj. Watkinson conducted several tests of the fumes emitting from the tank. He used several chemical warfare agent detectors including a Chemical Agent Monitor (Figure 10), British one-color detector paper (Figure 11), and an M18A2 kit (Figure 12).[24] Following standard practice, he limited the number of persons in the contaminated area, so the Bomb Disposal Engineer maintained radio contact at a safe distance from the tank and fumes.[25]

Maj. Watkinson first used the Chemical Agent Monitor to test the vapors. The CAM is a portable, hand-held instrument used to monitor the presence of nerve or blister agents.[26] Maj. Watkinson obtained a positive result for the presence of mustard agent when he used the CAM to test the vapors. It reflected eight bars, the highest possible reading for the presence of mustard agent. Maj. Watkinson did not know about a U.S. message dated Feb. 19, 1991, stating, ""Fuming nitric acid will drive the CAM to eight bars on the mustard scale."" This message originated following field tests where CAMs tested wreckage from a Scud missile that impacted near Hafir Al Batin, Saudi Arabia. The report warned operators that fuming nitric acid might cause the CAM to register a false positive for blister agent.[27]

After the CAM indicated the possible presence of mustard agent, Maj. Watkinson then tested the fumes with one-color detector paper. The paper produced no response. One-color detector paper is designed to analyze liquids, so we would not expect it to react when exposed to a vapor. Next, Maj. Watkinson extracted a small liquid sample from the tank by inserting a piece of wire through one of the bullet holes in the tank. He then wiped the wire on the one-color detector paper. If the liquid was a chemical warfare agent, the British one-color detector paper should have turned blue. However, the liquid turned the detector paper brown, a negative response for chemical warfare agent. The U.S. three-color detector paper also changes colors in the presence of chemical warfare agents: blister agent turns the paper red, G-series nerve agent turns the paper yellow, and V-series nerve agent produces a green color. When Maj. Watkinson tested the liquid on the three-color paper, the paper turned pink, which he believed signified a positive result for mustard agent.[28] Maj. Watkinson testified that ""Both the one color and three color detector paper changed color, but the colors weren't entirely appropriate with the color that I would have expected. So, that was a positive result, but with question marks.""[29]

The inconsistency in the test results using the CAM and detection papers led Maj. Watkinson to retest the tank's contents using an M18A2 chemical warfare agent detection kit. The M18A2 kit is a portable kit designed to test both liquid and vapors. Maj. Watkinson extracted vapors from the tank through glass tubes using a rubber bulb. He described the method he used with the M18A2 kit:

The M18A2 kit has glass tubes that contain sort of a cotton wool type substance, which is impregnated with certain chemicals. Obviously there are a whole series of different tubes, which are designed to detect for different agents. One can go through those tubes in sequence, in order to eliminate various chemicals and decide what it is you've got. I didn't go through that process fully, because I got a reading with the CAM and therefore I narrowed straight in on the H [mustard] agent.[30]

Maj. Watkinson tested the vapor six times using the M18A2 kit. In the presence of a chemical warfare agent, the kit shows distinctive color changes, specifically blue for mustard agent.[31] Four tubes changed colors to blue immediately; the remaining two tubes turned yellow initially, but turned blue some hours later.[32] Maj. Watkinson stated that, although the M18A2 detector kit produced a positive result, they were not as conclusive as he would have liked.[33]

1. Maj. Watkinson's Injury

While testing the sample extracted from the tank, Maj. Watkinson inadvertently came into contact with the liquid.

There was some of the liquid on the wire, which I then wiped onto the detector paper. I can only assume that in the process of doing that, I got some of the liquid onto the back of my thigh, and it went through my suit... It wasn't something that I was immediately aware of. In fact, it wasn't until I got back to the camp that evening that I noticed I'd been burnt. But it wasn't particularly painful; it was more a question of being uncomfortable.[34]

Maj. Watkinson noted that the burn on his thigh was just a red mark approximately 4 centimeters by 2.5 centimeters[35] and did not blister.[36] He received medical attention for the burn on Aug. 9, 1991, four days after he sustained the injury. According to the medical report, the burn did not blister but turned very red. The burn responded well to treatment with sulphadiazine cream[37] and completely healed within 7 to 10 days.[38] Maj. Watkinson provided the following statement about his injury:

The significance of the injury is...relevant, because I was dressed in all the full NBC [nuclear, biological, and chemical] protective equipment, and I at the time couldn't understand how I managed to get burned on a part of my body where there was no joint in the NBC clothing. The implication was that the chemical had gone through the NBC suit. This was a bit of a concern, because obviously our NBC suit was designed to protect us and clearly on this occasion it hadn't.[39]

Maj. Watkinson sealed both bullet holes with industrial silicone filler and plaster of paris bandages. He then checked the tank again for leaks using the CAM but found none.[40]

2. Maj. Watkinson's Initial Report

Despite conducting several tests using a CAM, an M18A2 kit, and one- and three-color detector paper, Major Watkinson was unable to identify with certainty the substance in the tank. The CAM and the M18A2 indicated the possible presence of mustard agent; the one-color detector paper turned brown denying presence of mustard agent, and the three-color detector paper changed colors but did not confirm mustard agent. Major Watkinson summarized the results of the initial test of the tank's contents as follows:

As far as I'm concerned, the CAM test was positive. It was eight bars on H. [mustard]. Both the one-color and three-color detector paper changed color, but the colors weren't entirely appropriate with the color that I would have expected. So, that was a positive result, but with question marks. The M18A2 detector kit gave test results, which again could have been interpreted as positive, but wasn't as conclusive as one would hope.[41]

Following his initial testing activities, Maj. Watkinson met with Kuwaiti and British military personnel, Col. John Macel, the Chief of the U.S. Office of Military Cooperation in Kuwait, and the chief of staff for U.S. Task Force Victory, Lt. Col. Donnie Killgore, to determine an appropriate course of action for disposition of the tank and its contents. The initial proposal was to transport the tank to an isolated location in the desert and destroy it. However, it was known that a United Nations chemical weapons evaluation team was in Iraq to inventory and assess Iraq's chemical weapons capability. The container would be useful to the United Nations efforts because if the container did contain chemical warfare agent, it would demonstrate Iraq's forward deployment of bulk chemical warfare agent. It was agreed to arrange for a UN team to take samples from the tank.[42]

At the same meeting, Lt. Col. Killgore suggested the Fox nuclear, biological and chemical reconnaissance vehicles assigned to the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment test the tank's contents. Although the CAM and other chemical detection kits indicated the possible presence of a chemical warfare agent, the Fox vehicle's MM-1 mobile mass spectrometer is able to identify 60 known chemical warfare agents by their molecular composition and weight of ions.[43] Lt. Col. Killgore believed the Fox vehicle could more accurately assess the presence of chemical warfare agent in the tank.[44]

After Maj. Watkinson reported the results of his initial field tests, the commander of the U.S. 146th EOD Detachment received information that raised doubts that the tank contained mustard agent when representatives of the Kuwaiti Ministry of Defence and various agencies conducting ordnance disposal discussed the possibility that the tank may contain a highly reactive industrial chemical. Also, the 146th EOD commander showed a picture of the tank to an Egyptian EOD officer, reportedly trained in Soviet rocketry. The Egyptian officer told the commander that the tank at the Kuwaiti Girls' School was the same type used by the Soviets to store rocket fuel, but this conclusion was not documented.[45] Colonel Macel stated that he never received an EOD incident report or other assessment to suggest the tank did not contain chemical warfare agent.[46] As a result, the individuals conducting tests of the tank's contents were not aware of the possibility that the tank may have contained either industrial chemicals or rocket fuel.[47]

The Headquarters, Task Force Victory,[48] tasked the U.S. 54th Chemical Troop to send two Fox vehicles to support the 21st EOD Squadron, British Royal Engineers, at the Kuwaiti Girls' School.[49] Maj. Watkinson commanded the joint operation since the school was in the British sector for ordnance disposal. Capt. Michael F. Johnson, commander of the U.S. 54th Chemical Troop, directed the Fox vehicle operations.[50] Together, they received a mission brief on the previous field test results from Col. Macel, who was then briefed on the Fox vehicle capabilities. This operation was the first joint U.S. and UK chemical warfare agent detection operation using the Fox vehicles, so American and British personnel conducted mission rehearsals to minimize any operational differences.[51]

U.S. and UK forces arrived at the tank site on Aug. 9, 1991.[52] UK forces consisted of Maj. Watkinson, a Bomb Disposal Officer, a Bomb Disposal Engineer, and additional British soldiers who formed a command post and decontamination team. U.S. forces included Capt. Johnson, two Fox vehicles and crew, a decontamination unit, Task Force Victory's Chief of Staff, Lt. Col. Donnie Killgore, and Col. John Macel. A medical team was also present in case of an emergency.

During this operation, only the Fox vehicle crewmembers, the Bomb Disposal Officer, and the Bomb Disposal Engineer proceeded beyond the hot line, a designated line that separated the active operations area from the decontamination area (Figures 13 and 14). All other soldiers observed the operation from the safety of the incident command post or ICP approximately 200 meters north-northeast (upwind) of the hot line. Incident command post personnel did not wear protective suits during this operation.[53]

According to Maj. Watkinson, the Bomb Disposal Officer and the Bomb Disposal Engineer unsealed the bullet holes to extract liquid from the tank. Upon doing so, large quantities of vapor escaped from the holes for approximately two minutes before subsiding.[54] This suggested that the vapor pressure inside the tank had increased significantly since Maj. Watkinson sealed it two days earlier.

Using a long piece of rubber catheter tubing, the Bomb Disposal Officer and the Bomb Disposal Engineer extracted three liquid samples from the tank. The men transferred the samples into separate glass vials. They placed two vials in two separate brown glass bottles, one per bottle, in a steel ammunition box filled with fuller's earth, closed the ammunition box, and placed it next to the tank. They transferred the third sample to a stainless steel dish for Fox MM-1 analysis.[55] The liquid sample set aside for the MM-1 tests evaporated quickly. According to Maj. Watkinson,

One of the problems we were having was that the liquid, when put onto a stainless steel kidney tray, was evaporating quite quickly, and we hadn't anticipated this .… But nevertheless, mustard gas as I have dealt with it, seen it, and understand it, is fairly viscous, and I wouldn't have expected it to evaporate as quickly as it did. So, in my mind the rapid evaporation of the chemical was another indicator that suggested that this may not be mustard gas.[56]

While extracting the liquid from the tank, both the Bomb Disposal Officer and Bomb Disposal Engineer got some of the liquid on their rubber protective gloves. They noticed heat penetrating through their gloves and considered this a result of an exothermic chemical reaction-a release of heat due to contact between the liquid agent and the rubber gloves. The two men returned to the decontamination area and changed their gloves before continuing with the operation.[57]

Before the MM-1 tests began, the Fox crews severed communications between the two vehicles (vehicle C-23 and vehicle C-26) so as not to bias the test results.[58] Each crew maintained contact with Capt. Johnson. Because the third liquid sample evaporated, the Bomb Disposal Officer and Bomb Disposal Engineer extracted from the tank a fourth liquid sample and transferred it to the stainless steel dish.[59] Fox vehicle C-23 tested the sample first. C-23's MM-1 initially alerted to the possible presence of the choking agent phosgene. The MM-1 operator conducted another test-again the MM-1 initially alerted for the possible presence of phosgene.[60] The C-23 MM-1 operator then performed a spectrum analysis and printed the results to a hard copy tape for later analysis. With radio communications still disengaged, vehicle C-26 performed similar procedures. C-26's MM-1 initially alerted to the possible presence of phosgene as well as mustard agent. The C-26 MM-1 operator performed a spectrum analysis and printed the results. The hard copy tapes of the spectra results from both vehicles' MM-1s indicated the presence of an unknown substance (not phosgene or mustard).

After the Fox crews completed the MM-1 tests, the Bomb Disposal Officer and Bomb Disposal Engineer sealed the holes in the tank using luting, a quick drying putty, and plaster of paris strips. Once the plaster of paris hardened, they used a mixture of super tropical bleach and water to decontaminate the tank and the immediate area.[61]

An American sergeant first class, assigned to the 54th Chemical Troop, directed the Fox vehicle decontamination. He, along with the Bomb Disposal Officer, the Bomb Disposal Engineer, and the two British soldiers, formed the decontamination team.[62] The team, in protective garments, used CAMs to check the Fox vehicles for contamination, then proceeded to decontaminate the vehicles. The Bomb Disposal Officer and Bomb Disposal Engineer carried their equipment and the ammunition box to the emergency personnel decontamination station (EPDS) for decontamination. They sealed the box inside three large clear plastic bags with a label on the outer plastic bag. According to the Bomb Disposal Officer, they destroyed all the protective garments and other non-durable equipment used during the operation.[63]

Figure 13. Maj. Watkinson's sketch of UK and U.S. elements during the Fox testing. Figure 14. Photograph of Fox vehicle testing taken by a U.S. Army officer in charge of decontamination operations, 54th Chemical Troop. (Reprinted by permission).

While decontaminating the Bomb Disposal Officer and Bomb Disposal Engineer, the British lance corporal in charge of the EPDS felt a burning sensation on his right wrist. The lance corporal believed some of the liquid from the tank penetrated through his protective gear, so he decontaminated himself and removed his individual protective gear. The Bomb Disposal Officer described the circumstances of the injury sustained by the British lance corporal:

I was watching the EPDS party finishing the task from the CP [Command Post]. At the point when only the IC [lance corporal in charge] of the EPDS was left to decontaminate and undress himself he fainted (this I believe was due to the heat and the time spent in IPE [individual protective equipment]). Myself and another went to his assistance pouring vast quantities of water and decontaminant on his bare skin (arm), which was blistering. He was taken to a local … hospital [21st Squadron Medical Center]…[64]

In his report dated Jan. 4, 1994, Capt. Johnson stated that a British soldier (the British lance corporal) came into contact with a small amount of liquid from the tank while decontaminating the sampling team. The soldier reacted immediately, suggesting that the liquid penetrated the inner glove, suit and outer glove of his protective garments. According to Capt. Johnson, ""within one minute, we observed that the soldier had a small blister forming on his wrist the size of a stick-pin head. Five minutes later, the blister reached the size of a (US) half-dollar coin""[65] (Figure 15). Capt. Johnson's report indicated that the British soldier went into shock almost immediately, presumably due to extreme pain. An on-site medical team treated the lance corporal for a 3-mm blister on his wrist and heat stress.[66]

A doctor admitted the British lance corporal into the medical facility at Beteal Camp for one night. His medical report describes the injury and treatment he received:

The burn on his wrist was 0.5 x 1.0 cm in diameter, comprising an area of erythema with a centralized pinhead erupted zone. This injury is compatible with a variety of chemical or thermal insults ranging from contact with household disinfectants to perhaps more potent corrosive agents. The lesion did not propagate further, and responded quickly to silver sulphadiazine 1% (flamazine). The patient fully recovered from his heat exhaustion the following day and was fit to return to duty.[67]

Although the doctor said he had fully recovered, the lance corporal reported he did not return to duty until the following week. The lance corporal reported, ""the scab on my right wrist took some two to three weeks to heal, but a red mark remained for three to four months."" Furthermore, ""no one came to debrief me about the operation and I was not told about the likely effects of my exposure to the agent in the tank. During my time there, no tests were taken to see if I had been exposed to mustard agent. I was told not to speak to anyone about the incident.""[68] U.S. personnel who witnessed the events leading to the British lance corporal's injury reported that they received no information regarding his treatment or diagnosis.

Capt. Johnson provided the Fox MM-1 tapes to Lt. Col. Killgore, and all U.S. forces except the 54th Chemical Troop departed the area. The 54th Chemical Troop and the British 21st EOD Squadron guarded the tank and ammunition box to prevent any tampering with the samples in the ammunition box (Figure 16). The 54th Chemical Troop conducted its after-action review to recount events and evaluate operational procedures and equipment performance. Several hours later, military police from Task Force Victory arrived and took over the security detail of the tank and samples. The 54th Chemical Troop returned to Camp Doha where the results of the Fox vehicles' detection of chemical warfare agent were discussed with the regimental commander.[69]

After examining the Fox tapes, Lt. Col. Killgore decided that a laboratory with more sophisticated capabilities should analyze the Fox tapes. Upon his return to headquarters, he contacted the U.S. Army's Chemical Research, Development, and Engineering Center at Edgewood, Maryland. He faxed a copy of the Fox tapes and a description of the sampling and testing operations to CRDEC.[70] The Program Manager for NBC Defense Systems reportedly analyzed the Fox tapes;[71] however, we could locate neither the original fax from Lt. Col. Killgore nor the subsequent analysis of the tapes.

On Aug. 9, 1991, personnel at the United Nations Special Commission on Iraq in Bahrain were contacted by Maj. Watkinson and asked to inspect the tank at the Kuwaiti Girls' School.[72] In response, a British chemical weapons evaluation team arrived at the school to obtain samples from the tank.[73] The United Nations was not involved in the testing of the tank or taking any of the samples, and provided the following statement:

Although it is possible that the people involved in taking samples were at one time temporary UNSCOM inspectors, UNSCOM was not involved in the taking of samples from the tank at the Sabahiyah Girls' School in Kuwait. Chemicals in Kuwait are clearly not part of UNSCOM's purview, although UNSCOM does have interest in the contents of the tank as they probably originated from Iraq.[74]

On Aug.10, 1991, members of the sampling team met with British ordnance disposal personnel, Col. Macel, Lt. Col. Killgore, Maj. Watkinson, and a Kuwaiti army ordnance officer. Maj. Watkinson and Lt. Col. Killgore briefed the sampling team on earlier tests,[75] and provided the team with copies of the Fox tapes.[76] The sampling team interviewed key personnel, including Maj. Watkinson, the Bomb Disposal Officer, the Bomb Disposal Engineer, and the British lance corporal injured following the Fox vehicle tests.[77] The sampling team, accompanied by Col. Macel, Lt. Col. Killgore, Maj. Watkinson, and members of the 21st EOD Squadron, then traveled to the Kuwaiti Girls' School to collect the liquid samples from the tank.[78]

Upon arrival at the Kuwaiti Girls' School, the sampling team leader prepared the equipment needed for the operation. He labeled four tubes from a Sampling and Identification of Biological and Chemical Agents (SIBCA) kit in sequential order (Tab I). The tubes contained XAD-4 resin, a substance used by inspection teams to transport samples of chemical warfare agents.[79] The sampling team leader and another team member, along with Maj. Watkinson, put on full individual protective clothing before they approached the tank and ammunition box.[80]

The two sampling team members withdrew a sample from one of the bottles contained in the ammunition box using a glass syringe with a four-inch stainless steel internal tube. Then the sampling team selected one of the pre-prepared tubes containing XAD-4 resin at random and injected the sample into it through the rubber seal.[81] The first sample reacted violently when introduced into the tube, breaking both the tube and the syringe. The sampling team leader reported,

The original sample we were trying to take was onto an adsorbent, which is designed to take up chemical weapon agents. My theory, to which I still adhere, is that the nitric acid components reacted very quickly with the adsorbents and they gave off a gas, which just gave an enormous overpressure. So, the overpressure actually exploded the syringe.[82]

The violent reaction of the liquid sample on the XAD-4 resin caused doubts about the earlier assessment that the tank contained chemical warfare agent by the sampling team leader. The sampling team leader noted, ""Chemical warfare agents in general are not actually very reactive chemicals. They have specific organic receptors on which they have their effect. So, they're not reactive. Our sampling kit was designed to deal with CW agents, which, as I say, are not reactive, whereas, this of course was obviously a very reactive chemical.""[83] He later discussed the events at the school with colleagues in Bahrain, which further convinced him that the liquid in the tank most likely was fuming nitric acid.[84] The sampling team leader also reported:

My description of the liquid in the bottle was that it was of very low viscosity. Mustard is a very high viscosity liquid, similar to engine oil. On top of that, of course I had the descriptions of the injuries that [the British soldier] and Major Watkinson had suffered, and these were again inconsistent with mustard derived burns, but were wholly consistent with a powerful acid, such as nitric.[85]

When the tube broke during the sampling operation, a small amount of liquid agent possibly contaminated their protective gear. As a precaution, the sampling team conducted personal decontamination using hypochlorite solution and fuller's earth.[86] They withdrew from the contaminated area near the tank and went to the area established for personal decontamination. The team took a different approach the second time. Hoping to reduce the pressure in the tubes, they first removed the rubber seals from the screw top of the pre-prepared tubes and then placed a liquid sample onto the resin. The sampling team successfully deposited two samples in the tubes numbered 1 and 3.[87]

While observing the sampling team's activities, Maj. Watkinson noticed brown vapors once again escaping through the bullet holes in the tank. Once the sampling team completed its activities, Maj. Watkinson and the Bomb Disposal Engineer attempted to reseal the tank. Two members of the sampling team remained clothed in individual protective equipment to assist Maj. Watkinson. Maj. Watkinson removed the previous seals from the tank and used plaster of paris and chewing gum (no silicone sealant was available and the gum has similar properties to silicone sealant) to make new seals. After they resealed the tank, Maj. Watkinson, the Bomb Disposal Engineer, and the two sampling team members returned to the decontamination area.[88]

The sampling team sealed the liquid samples in suitable containers for transport (Figure 17) and established a chain of custody for control of the samples. The sampling team leader, Maj. Watkinson, and Col. Macel signed the seals on the containers to verify the samples were indeed those taken from the Kuwaiti Girls' School. The sampling team flew to Bahrain with the two tubes containing samples from the tank. The samples were treated as forensic evidence, so a signatory accompanied the samples at all times.[89] The sampling team relinquished custody of the samples to an individual from the UK Consulate to ship the samples to the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment, Porton Down, UK,[90] the laboratory responsible for analyzing samples of chemical warfare agents collected in Iraq.

1. 1994 Investigation by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs

In January 1994, Capt.Johnson noted the absence of a formal report on the participation of the 54th Chemical Troop in the events at the Kuwaiti Girls' School. He stated, ""he was concerned that it was possible that the history of my unit's chemical detection actions with the 21st EOD Squadron, British Royal Engineers, was not properly documented. I had not seen any official or unofficial record of those actions.""[110] Captain Johnson drafted a report for training purposes at the US Army Infantry School, Fort Benning, Georgia. His report focused on lessons learned in nuclear, biological, and chemical defensive operations during the Gulf War. He also described in detail the Fox vehicle operations at the Kuwaiti Girls' School. The U.S. Army Infantry School reviewed and authorized Capt. Johnson's report for use in future course instruction.[111]

The same year, the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs began investigating allegations of chemical warfare agent use during the Gulf War. In Senate hearings held later that summer, the events at the Kuwaiti Girls' School became a focus of public attention. After reviewing Captain Johnson's report, Senate investigators focused on three key issues:

the validity of the tests;

the physical characteristics of the liquid in the tank; and

the injury sustained by the British lance corporal during the sampling operations.

The committee staff highlighted the fact that multiple tests of the tank's contents by multiple types of chemical detection equipment initially produced positive results for chemical warfare agent. The Senate committee reported a total of 21 separate tests on the liquid in the tank.[112] It appears the committee counted the Fox alarms and their corresponding MM-1 mobile mass spectrometer spectrum analyses as separate tests.

Table 1 illustrates the type and number of tests conducted at the Kuwaiti Girls' School in August 1991, their respective results, and comments on the results.

Date of Test Type of Detector # of Tests Outcome Test Results Comments Aug. 5, 1991 Chemical Agent Monitor 2 Registered 8 bars on scale for mustard agent 8 bars is a very positive test, but field tests indicate nitric acid could cause false positive response for mustard agent. [113] Aug. 5, 1991 One-Color Detector Paper 2 Negative response One-color detector paper turns blue in the presence of mustard agent; the tank's liquid turned the paper brown. [114] Aug. 5, 1991 Three-Color Detector Paper 3 Pink; pink/orange, both possibly positive for mustard agent Paper should have turned red for mustard agent. IRFNA may cause a false positive for blister agent based on the theoretical reaction between the inhibitor and the dyes in the paper, but RFNA used in laboratory tests did not cause this reaction. [115] Aug. 5, 1991 M18A2 6 4 turned blue and 2 initially turned yellow but eventually turned blue According to Major Watkinson, the M18A2 tubes produced inconsistent responses for the presence of chemical warfare agent. [116] Aug. 9, 1991 MM-1 mobile mass spectrometer used on Fox Vehicles 4 Alarms received for mustard agent and phosgene

Spectra disproved these agents but identified an unknown substance with atomic mass unit 46 at 100% relative intensity, indicative of nitric acid[117] See later discussions.

In testimony before the Senate committee, scientists from the U.S. Army Chemical Research, Development and Engineering Center confirmed the earlier laboratory assessment by the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment that the tank contained nitric acid. U.S. experts compared the mass spectrometer tapes to the mass spectrum of nitric acid, and the spectrum reportedly matched nitric acid in all four categories and in the correct proportions. However, this statement was incorrect; in truth, only a single peak, not three or four, would register for nitric acid on the Fox vehicle's MM-1. The American scientists assessed that the tank did not contain mustard agent or phosgene oxime.[118] The Fox MM-1 tapes (which we had not located at the time of the Senate investigation and the committee did not review) clearly show alarms only for mustard and phosgene agents, not phosgene oxime (Tab H).

U.S. DOD representatives provided the Senate committee inaccurate information on the laboratory procedures and test results of the liquid samples by the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Chemical/Biological Matters mistakenly reported that the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment analyzed pieces of the individual protective equipment worn by the injured British lance corporal.[119] In reality, the decontamination team burned the protective gear worn by the injured British lance corporal along with all other used individual protective equipment in accordance with standard procedures. Thus, the only tests of the tank's contents on the protective garments were those field tests conducted while on site at the Kuwaiti Girls' School.

In his report dated Jan. 4, 1994, Maj. (formerly Captain) Johnson stated that neither he nor any members of his unit had sufficient time to review the Fox tapes before relinquishing them to Lt. Col. Killgore.[120] Maj. Johnson stated he believed the tank most likely contained phosgene oxime, a blister agent, not phosgene, a choking agent, because of the severe burn and resulting blister sustained by the British lance corporal following the Fox vehicle tests.[121] In their final report, the committee accepted Maj. Johnson's theory and determined the British lance corporal's immediate reaction and burn due to contact with the liquid was consistent with exposure to phosgene oxime.[122] However, according to Lt. Col. Killgore, the tapes indicated the presence of phosgene and mustard, not phosgene oxime.[123]

DOD representatives strongly believed the tank did not contain chemical warfare agent, but rather inhibited red fuming nitric acid, but lacked the evidence to prove or disprove the initial test results. At the time of the Senate committee hearings, it appeared that there was no plausible explanation for the presence of inhibited red fuming nitric acid at the school, and the disposition of the tank was unknown. The DOD could not locate the original MM-1 mobile mass spectrometer tapes nor the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment's 1991 initial report on the laboratory analysis of the samples. The Senate committee maintained that chemical warfare agent was present in the tank.[124]

All evidence presented by the British and U.S. military contradicting the possible presence of chemical warfare agent in the tank was dated 1994, rather than 1991,[125] raising concerns of a biased analysis. However, both the Senate committee and the DOD were unaware that the release of official information in the UK is governed by the non-statutory Code of Practice.[126] Under these provisions, the British government is obliged to provide information on its policies, actions and decisions; however, there is no commitment to the disclosure of pre-existing documents. Consequently, the British responded to the DOD's requests for information using information from original documents, but copies of the originals were not provided. The UK provided documents dated 1994, but when compared to the source documents dated 1991, the text is virtually identical. Unaware of these guidelines in the UK policy of public disclosure of information, the DOD could not convince the Senate committee that chemical warfare agent was not present in the tank.

Finally, the Senate committee raised questions regarding awards issued by the Department of Defense to members of the 54th Chemical Troop for discovering chemical warfare agents in Kuwait. If a chemical warfare agent was not present at the Kuwaiti Girls' School, as indicated by the initial report prepared by the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment, then the DOD should not have made the awards. Reporters and authors suspicious of the Department's conclusions cited this apparent contradiction.[127]

2. 1997 Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses Investigation

In May 1997, President Clinton established the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses to ensure an independent, open, and comprehensive examination of health concerns related to veterans service in the Gulf War. The Presidential Advisory Committee concluded the tank at the Kuwaiti Girls' School contained chemical warfare agent based on multiple positive detections reported by veterans and the lack of any contemporary analysis to the contrary.[128] In July 1997, officials from the UNSCOM testified before the Presidential Advisory Committee that inspections of Iraq's chemical weapons program produced no evidence that Iraq moved chemical weapons into Kuwait.[129] In September 1997, the DOD provided additional evidence that Iraq used the Kuwaiti Girls' School as a missile test and maintenance facility. The British also provided copies of the Fox tapes produced at the Kuwaiti Girls' School.[130] Despite the new evidence, the Presidential Advisory Committee did not amend its May 1997 conclusion that the tank contained a chemical warfare agent.

3. Public Attention in the United Kingdom

The UK press reported on the Senate committee investigation in October 1994. Articles in the British newspapers, Evening Standard and The Times, reported on the discovery of the tank and subsequent sampling operations at the Kuwaiti Girls' School. During the U.S. Senate investigation, Major Watkinson's initial report suggesting the liquid in the tank might be mustard agent was inappropriately released. The UK Ministry of Defence had not approved the public release of this document. The articles also quoted Maj. Johnson's testimony to the U.S. Senate committee on the Fox vehicle operations. He testified that the Fox vehicles initially alerted for mustard and phosgene oxime; in fact, the initial alerts were for mustard and phosgene. The British government responded to the press articles, stating that Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment analyzed the liquid samples and the results were consistent with the presence of nitric acid; there was no evidence of chemical warfare agents. However, on Nov. 12, 1995, The Mail on Sunday published an interview with a former British sergeant assigned to the 21st EOD Squadron during the Gulf War.[131] The sergeant served as the Bomb Disposal Engineer during operations to extract samples from the tank. He stated the tests at the Kuwaiti Girls' School indicated the presence of mustard agent. He questioned the letter to Parliament from the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment (CBDE) Porton Down, dated Jan. 25, 1995. He believed the letter asserted that CBDE Porton Down conducted laboratory tests on the injured British lance corporal's individual protective equipment. In fact, the letter simply referred to ""damage to the NBC suit material"" and stated that samples collected in Kuwait City were provided to CBDE Porton Down for analysis.[132] Anecdotal reports referenced damaged protective garments, but these reports referred to the field tests on the suit material conducted by the commanding officer of the 3rd Troop of the 21st EOD Squadron. The samples referred to in the CBDE Porton Down letter were the liquid samples deposited on XAD-4 resin.

The British press articles generated further concern by British members of Parliament regarding the presence of chemical warfare agent at the Kuwaiti Girls' School. The unresolved questions and confusion concerning the four separate testing operations prompted the DOD and the UK Ministry of Defence to conduct a joint review of the events related to the discovery, testing, and disposal of the tank. Investigators from the DOD Office of the Special Assistant for Gulf War Illnesses, the British Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Unit, and analysts from the U.S. intelligence community worked together to address the issues of concern. Obtaining contemporary information about the testing and analysis of the liquid in the tank was a priority. In addition, it was important to determine whether the equipment used in the testing and sampling operations would register a false positive in the presence of a strong oxidizer such as inhibited red fuming nitric acid. Investigators interviewed thirty-one people who were involved directly with the discovery, testing, and disposal of the tank in 1991, at least 13 members of various UK government agencies and 15 members of various U.S. government agencies, the United Nations, representatives of the government of Kuwait and three non-governmental organizations.

1. 1997 Laboratory Analysis of Inhibited Red Fuming Nitric Acid

During the initial stages of this investigation in early 1997, we did not have the original Fox vehicle MM-1 tapes produced at the Kuwaiti Girls' School. Information printed on the Fox MM-1 tapes, specifically spectra data, would have been invaluable in attempts to identify the substance in the tank at the Kuwaiti Girls' School. However, since this information was unavailable, the U.S. Army Soldier and Biological Chemical Command, previously called the Chemical and Biological Defense Command, conducted laboratory tests to determine if inhibited red fuming nitric acid (IRFNA) could cause the MM-1 mobile mass spectrometer to false alarm. Unable to obtain a sample of the inhibited red fuming nitric acid used in Iraq's Seersucker/Silkworm missiles, scientists used laboratory-grade red fuming nitric acid in its place.[133] Red fuming nitric acid lacks an inhibitor (e.g., hydrogen fluoride or hydrogen iodine), which impedes corrosion of the container. During the laboratory tests, a MM-1 initially alerted for the nerve agent cyclosarin when exposed to laboratory-grade red fuming nitric acid.[134]

The Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses expressed concern regarding the disparity between these 1997 laboratory results and the results from 1991 tests at the Kuwaiti Girls' School.[135] At the Kuwaiti Girls' School in 1991, two Fox vehicle MM-1s alarmed for the possible presence of chemical warfare agents, mustard and phosgene, when they tested liquid samples from the tank. Nevertheless, the DOD concluded in 1997 the tank at the Kuwaiti Girls' School contained red fuming nitric acid. The project manager, NBC Defense Systems at the U.S. Army Chemical and Biological Defense Command, attributed the conflicting test results to the use of laboratory-grade red fuming nitric acid instead of the inhibited red fuming nitric acid believed to be in the tank. In addition, the possibility of a chemical warfare agent coexisting in the tank with red fuming nitric acid was viewed as extremely unlikely because red fuming nitric acid was used as a preferred decontaminating substance in mustard laboratory and production facilities before the Gulf War.[136] U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and DOD analysts also expressed concern the tank's contents were not pure due to contamination from the corrosive effects of inhibited red fuming nitric acid on the sampling tube or plunger used to take samples. Other environmental factors, such as the temperature and humidity, may have produced condensation in the tank, which would have altered the composition of the liquid contents in the tank. It is also possible that unknown contaminants entered the tank via the bullet holes. The tank's exposure to the environmental conditions and possible contaminants could not be duplicated in the 1997 laboratory tests, and may account for the variance between the MM-1's alerts for different substances than those represented on the Fox tapes from the 1991 operation at the Kuwaiti Girls' School. In addition, the tank's exposure to the environment could account for the increased pH level of the tank's contents. The pH level of nitric acid is approximately 1.0. However the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment's test results in 1991 showed pH levels of 2.0 and 2.2. It is known that nitric acid will absorb water vapor rapidly[137] and it is possible that changes in humidity and temperature in the tank over an unknown period could have altered the pH level of the tank's contents.

2. 1997 Analysis of the Fox MM-1 Tapes

During discussions with the UK Ministry of Defence in July 1997, we discussed our difficulty in locating the original Fox MM-1 tapes from the Kuwaiti Girls' School. We learned that the Ministry of Defence kept a copy of the MM-1 tapes (at the Chemical Biological Defence Establishment). The UK Ministry of Defence provided copies of the MM-1 tapes to our office and we resubmitted them to the U.S. Army Chemical and Biological Defense Command for analysis.

The MM-1 operator can print certain information about the chemicals displayed on the MM-1 screen (e.g., a list of ion masses and intensities) on a paper tape for record keeping and further analysis. Because every chemical has a characteristic combination of ions, known as a spectrum,[138] the MM-1 is able to identify chemicals by examining the spectrum. However, because the MM-1 makes initial detections using only a portion of a chemical's entire spectrum and looks for only a limited number of possible chemical warfare agents, it can sound false alarms for chemical warfare agents in the presence of similar ion patterns from other types of contaminating substances. Therefore, a second step in the analysis process is required to more definitively identify the sample where the entire library of known chemical warfare agents stored in the MM-1's memory is compared to the sample's spectrum.[139]

If a properly performed MM-1 spectrum analysis identifies a chemical warfare agent, the MM-1 operator and the Fox commander can be confident, although not assured, that the chemical warfare agent is present. Further analysis of the spectrum tape printout by a mass spectrometry expert, comparing the spectrum results to an established database of compounds, can increase the confidence level of the detection. Conversely, if the spectrum analysis does not identify one of the chemical warfare agents contained in the MM-1 library, the MM-1 operator and the Fox commander can be confident that any chemical warfare agent displayed during the initial alarm is not present. When the MM-1 cannot match any of the compounds stored in its library to the substance being analyzed, it indicates ""unknown"" on the operator's screen and the MM-1 tape printout.[140]

The MM-1 tapes from Fox vehicle C-23 (Figure 18) show that at 12:50 PM (August 9, 1991), the MM-1 alerted to the possible presence of the choking agent phosgene (CG). Following the initial alert for phosgene, the C-23 MM-1 operator initiated a spectrum analysis. The result, printed on the MM-1 tape at 12:51 PM, was ""unknown""-this substance not only was not phosgene, it was not any substance in the MM-1 library. A second initial alert for phosgene (Figure 18) occurred at 13:22 (1:22 PM), followed by spectrum results of ""unknown"" at 13:23 (1:23 PM) and 13:25 (1:25 PM). The complete MM-1 tape (Tab H) also shows detailed spectrum results printed at 13:27 (1:27 PM), 13:29 (1:29 PM), and 13:30 (1:30 PM).

The MM-1 tapes from Fox vehicle C-26 (Figure 19) show spectrum results at 12:51 PM also indicating an unknown substance. The MM-1 operator printed the results to the MM-1 tape and used that information to program the unknown substance into the MM-1's memory; he named the substance ""Extra Subst A1."" From 12:53 p.m. to 1 p.m., C-26's MM-1 initially alerted to the possible presence of phosgene three times and to the extra substance A1 15 times. At 1:00 p.m. another spectrum analysis indicated ""unknown."" The MM-1 operator printed the results to the MM-1 tape and used those results to program this unknown substance into the MM-1's memory; he named this substance ""Extra Subst A2."" The complete C-26 MM-1 tapes (Tab H) show at 1:02 p.m. the MM-1 alerted to the possible presence of A1, A2, phosgene (CG), and S Mustard (HD)-a blister agent; from 1:03 p.m. to 1:39 p.m., initial alerts continued for various combinations of all of the above substances; however four additional spectra indicated A2 twice and unknown twice.

A thorough understanding of the MM-1 and mass spectrometry is necessary to comprehend the MM-1 tapes, so experts at the U.S. Army's Chemical and Biological Defense Command (now known as the Soldier and Biological Chemical Command), the U.S. Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and Bruker Daltonics, the MM-1 manufacturer, analyzed the MM-1 tapes from both Fox vehicles at our request.

Bruker Daltonics provided the following assessment of the MM-1 tapes:

The tape shows that the system passed its automatic test on start-up indicating there were no major system failures. Approximately thirty minutes later, the system indicates an initial alarm that phosgene may be present.... Immediately, as called for to confirm the alarm in SOP [standard operating procedure], a spectrum is taken ... and the search of the 60 compound library indicates that the compound is unknown (not in the library of agents). Furthermore … the complete spectra in these tapes do not confirm the presence of CWA [chemical warfare agent]….[141]

In their analysis of the MM-1 tapes, NIST experts stated, ""After examining the tapes from two Fox vehicles ... it is clear that there is no mass spectral evidence confirming the presence of either of the two CW agents reported (phosgene and HD).""[142]

The U.S. Army Chemical and Biological Defense Command's NBC defense systems project manager stated,

None of the initial warnings for either phosgene or mustard agent were verified by the MM-1 mass spectrometers located in either of the two Fox NBC reconnaissance vehicles that were at the site. Personnel followed … [a] scenario that included a second sample analysis and comparison to an internal library. In every retest, the MM-1 reported the spectrum analysis as ""unknown."" In the cases where the crew renamed this ""unknown"" as an 'extra substance' in the library, the MM-1 identified the spectra as that ""extra substance.""[143]

After examining the MM-1 tape spectra, all three of the expert agencies offered explanations regarding the initial alerts for the possible presence of the chemical warfare agents.

Bruker Daltonics noted:

[The MM-1] assign[ed] the unknown compound a concentration ... approximately 200 times as intense as the ions used to initially alarm for phosgene.... The most intense ion in the spectrum is mass 46 (100%).... For vehicle C-26, it appears from the spectrum at 12:51, that this system may have both hydrocarbon background and calibration compound. In this spectrum [mass] 69 is actually larger than the mass 46 (100% versus 62.3%).... At 13:01, mass 46 is now 100% ... the complete spectra in these tapes do not confirm the presence of CWA in the tank in question, but rather [are] consistent with the independent analysis that the brown oily liquid was in fact fuming nitric acid.[144]

In his analysis, the NBC defense systems project manager, wrote:

Ion mass 46 at 100% intensity was reported on every MM-1 tape, except one, and is identical to trials conducted at CBDCOM [Chemical/Biological Defense Command] using research grade red fuming nitric acid (RFNA).… The tapes from one of the Fox NBC reconnaissance vehicles indicate a mass 69 ion with 100% intensity. While this is a deviation from all other analyses that had mass 46 at 100%, it is easily explained. Coupled with the presence of other specific ions in significant amounts, this duplicates other known incidents of the fluorocarbon calibration gas escaping into the analysis system. Each of the three tapes from the MM-1 on this vehicle contains the presence of these peaks, indicating sample contamination with calibration gas. Subtraction of the calibration gas results in spectra which are similar to those of the other vehicle where ion mass 46 is the major component in the sample.[145]

Lastly, NIST experts stated, ""the general finding that the largest peak is m/z 46, the principal peak in nitrogen dioxide, is consistent with the introduction of red fuming nitric acid into the mass spectrometers of both vehicles.""[146]

The MM-1's inability to identify the presence of nitric acid (in any form) in the tank is because nitric acid or red fuming nitric acid, with or without an inhibitor, is not considered a chemical warfare agent. The MM-1s aboard Fox vehicles C-23 and C-26 did not identify nitric acid in the liquid samples because its library only contains the formulation of chemical warfare agents and nitric acid was not one of the chemical compounds stored in the libraries of either MM-1. Thus, following spectrum analyses, both vehicles' MM-1s indicated the spectrum results as unknown.

In summary, experts at the U.S. Army's Chemical and Biological Defense Command, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and Bruker Daltonics carefully analyzed the MM-1 tapes from both Fox vehicles at the Kuwaiti Girls' School on Aug. 9, 1991. Their analyses are similar-all told us that despite initial alarms from Fox vehicles C-23 and C-26 for the possible presence of phosgene and HD mustard, the MM-1 spectra show that these chemical warfare agents were not present in samples from the tank at the Kuwaiti Girls' School. They all indicated that nitric acid, in some form, was partly responsible for the false alarms.

Attempts to identify the contents of the tank found at the Kuwaiti Girls' School proved difficult because of conflicting or contradictory indicators. Maj. Watkinson conducted numerous field tests on the vapors emitting from the tank and the liquid contents. Some were positive for mustard chemical warfare agent-the Chemical Agent Monitor produced an eight bar positive result for the presence of mustard and some of the M18A2 kit tests produced the signatory blue color change indicating mustard presence. However, the test with the one-color paper failed to identify a blister agent presence. The three-color paper tests and the remaining M18A2 tests were less definitive but implied a blister agent was there. The results were sufficient for Maj. Watkinson to suspect a possible presence of mustard agent. Further inspection of the tank and its contents by the Fox vehicles reinforced this perception among many participants who tested the tank because one vehicle's MM-1 mass spectrometers alerted to mustard agent and phosgene and the other alerted to phosgene. Although subsequent spectrum analyses by these same vehicles revealed the substance was not a chemical warfare agent but an unknown substance, the Foxes' initial alerts were best remembered.

In 1994, the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs investigated the events at the Kuwaiti Girls' School and highlighted the positive detections of chemical warfare agents by multiple chemical warfare agent detectors. Consequently, the Senate committee concluded that the tank contained chemical warfare agent. In 1997, the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses concurred with the Senate committee's findings based on the multiple positive detections reported by veterans and the lack of contemporary evidence to the contrary.

However, despite these pronouncements and the initial results of the detectors, much more convincing evidence refutes a conclusion of a chemical warfare agent presence. Maj. Watkinson's initial test with one-color paper denied its presence. He also noted that the high vapor pressure in the tank, the speed with which the small sample evaporated from the testing pan, the low viscosity of the liquid, and the liquid's ability to quickly penetrate his individual protective clothing were uncharacteristic of a mustard agent. Rust-colored vapor is also abnormal for mustard. Additionally, the Army Corps of Engineers safety officer, unprotected by chemical protective clothing or mask, approached close enough to the tank to smell the contents and report the smell of nitric acid. That he experienced neither blister agent nor choking agent reactions supports the probability that the tank contained something other than these agents.

There were other indicators that the tank did not contain chemical warfare agents. The high volatility of the liquid as the soldiers attempted to capture samples resulted in the violent reaction with the XAD-4 resin causing the glass capture tube to shatter. The XAD-4 resin was designed for the capture of chemical warfare agents and the reaction was atypical. The liquid heated and melted the gloves of sampling team members. However, chemical protective gloves are made of butyl rubber impermeable to chemical warfare agents. The tests conducted by the commanding officer of the 3rd Troop, 21st Explosive Ordnance Disposal squadron on the individual protective clothing showed that the liquid burned through the material within three minutes-again, an uncharacteristic property of a chemical warfare agent. Finally, the liquid caused an immediate blister on the wrist of a British lance corporal. Neither mustard nor phosgene would cause such an injury so fast. Although phosgene oxime might cause such a response, phosgene oxime presence was speculation based on the end result (blisters), but other substances like nitric acid could have the same result. No evidence of phosgene oxime came to light in this investigation.

Although one Fox vehicle gave initial alerts for phosgene and mustard chemical warfare agents, and the other alerted to phosgene only, their more definitive spectrum analyses proved that those agents were not present. Instead they showed that a substance unknown to the Fox was present. In 1997, experts at the U.S. Army's Chemical and Biological Defense Command, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and Bruker Daltonics, the manufacturer of the MM-1 mobile mass spectrometer, reviewed the Fox mass spectrometry tapes including full spectrums produced at the Kuwaiti Girls' School. All three experts concluded that chemical warfare agent was not present in the tank, and stated that nitric acid, in some form, was partly responsible for the initial alarms. Laboratory tests by the U.S. Army's Soldier Biological and Chemical Command revealed that laboratory-grade red fuming nitric acid will cause the MM-1 to false alarm for the presence of chemical warfare agent. Although the tests were unable to duplicate the alerts for phosgene and mustard, the experts concluded the difference was due to their inability to exactly replicate the liquid in the tank. In any case, the complete spectra on the tapes indicate the Fox vehicles detected a nitric acid compound, not a chemical warfare agent.

Finally, the evidence that weighs most heavily in our assessment is the contemporaneous testing of samples of the contents of the tank at the Kuwaiti Girls' School. These samples, taken under standard procedures by trained personnel, transported under chain-of-custody control, and evaluated by the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment, Porton Down, a laboratory designated by UNSCOM for expert chemical warfare agent analyses, showed no evidence of any chemical warfare agent. Instead, the 1991 report results showed that laboratory analysis of the samples was entirely consistent with the contents of the tank being nitric acid. Furthermore, since the chemical properties of nitric acid would not allow a chemical warfare agent to coexist in the tank, chemical warfare agent was not present.

In our 1998 report we initially believed that IRFNA was definitely present in the tank. However, because the laboratory did not conduct additional tests to determine other possible substances or contaminants in the tank, we cannot be certain of the nature of the nitric acid. Witnesses reported rust-colored vapors emitting from the bullet holes in the tank, which implies the substance may have been a red fuming nitric acid. We also believe an inhibitor was in the tank because witnesses did not report any evidence of corrosion of the tank.

The physical evidence, the Fox mobile mass spectrometry tapes, and the laboratory analysis of the liquid samples provide more compelling and more corroborating arguments than do the initial detector alerts. Furthermore, we conclude that the tank definitely contained a form of nitric acid, most likely inhibited red fuming nitric acid. Consequently, we assess the liquid in the tank at the Kuwaiti Girls' School was definitely not a chemical warfare agent.

AC

A blood agent. Chemical Name: Hydrogen cyanide[147]

Blister agent

A blister agent is a chemical warfare agent that produces local irritation and damage to the skin and mucous membranes, pain and injury to the eyes, reddening and blistering of the skin, and when inhaled, damage to the respiratory tract. Blister agents include mustards (HD, HN, HQ, HT, and Q), arsenicals like lewisite (L), and mustard and lewisite mixtures (HL). Blister agents are also called vesicants or vesicant agents.[148 , 149]

Blood agent

A blood agent is a chemical warfare agent that is inhaled and absorbed into the blood, carrying the agent to all body tissues where it interferes with the tissue oxygenation process. The brain is especially affected. The effect on the brain leads to cessation of respiration followed by cardiovascular collapse. Examples of blood agents are AC and CK.[150]

Chemical Agent Monitor (CAM)

A CAM is a hand-held, soldier-operated device that is used to monitor chemical warfare agent contamination on soldiers and equipment. The CAM may give false readings when used in enclosed spaces or when sampling near strong vapor sources (e.g., in dense smoke). Some vapors known to give false readings are aromatic vapors (perfumes, food flavorings, some aftershaves, peppermints, cough lozenges, and menthol cigarettes when vapors are exhaled directly into the nozzle), cleaning compounds (disinfectants, methyl salicylate, menthol), smokes and fumes (exhaust from some rocket motors, fumes from some munitions), and some wood preservative treatments (polychlorinated biphenyls or PCBs).[151]

Chemical and Biological Defense Command (CBDCOM)

CBDCOM was a US Army command with a mission to provide research, development, and acquisition for nuclear, biological, chemical (NBC), and obscurant equipment for the US Forces: to act as the Army NBC defense commodity command; to provide management of joint service NBC defense material; to provide US chemical stockpile management and safe storage; to provide installation management; to prepare for and respond to chemical biological emergency events/accidents; provide weapons of mass destruction (chemical or biological) domestic preparedness support; to conduct emergency remediation/restoration actions at chemical sites; to provide successful planning, management, and execution of treaty responsibilities; and to provide demilitarization support. The Chemical and Biological Defense Command merged with the Soldier Support Command to form the Soldier and Biological Chemical Command.[152]

Chemical warfare agent (CWA)

A chemical warfare agent is a chemical substance used in military operations to kill, seriously injure, or incapacitate through its physiological effects. Excluded are riot control agents, herbicides, smoke, and flame. Included are blood, nerve, blister, choking, and incapacitating agents.[153]

Chromatography

A process in which a chemical mixture carried by a liquid or gas is separated into its individual components.[154]

CK

A blood agent. Chemical Name: Cyanogen chloride[155]

Contaminant

A substance that, when present in the absence of a chemical warfare agent or the presence of chemical agent at the blank level causes a false positive when otherwise a true negative would have resulted[156]

CX

Phosgene oxime (see urticant and blister agent) Chemical Name: Dichloroformoxime[157]

Cyclosarin

A nerve agent known as GF. Chemical Name: O-Cyclohexyl-methylfluorophosphonate[158]

Detection Paper

Detection paper works because certain dyes are soluble in chemical warfare agents. Normally, two dyes and one pH indicator are mixed with cellulose fibers in a paper without special coloring (unbleached). When the paper absorbs a drop of chemical warfare agent, it dissolves one of the pigments. Mustard agent dissolves a red dye and nerve agent a yellow dye. In addition, VX nerve agent causes the indicator to turn to blue—which, together with the yellow, will become green or green-black. Detection paper can thus be used to distinguish between three different types of chemical warfare agents. A disadvantage with the papers is that many other substances can also dissolve the pigments. Consequently, detection papers should not be located in places where drops of solvent, fat, oil, or fuel can fall on them. Drops of water cause no reaction.[159]

Distilled Mustard

A blister agent known as HD. Chemical name: Bis-(2-chloroethyl) sulfide[160]

Dyspnea

Difficult or labored respiration.[161]

Enzyme

Any of the numerous complex proteins that are produced by living cells and catalyze specific biochemical reactions at body temperatures.[162]

Erythema

Abnormal redness of the skin due to capillary congestion.[163]

Explosive ordnance disposal (EOD)

The detection, identification, on-site evaluation, rendering safe, recovery, and final disposal of unexploded explosive ordnance. It may also include removal of explosive ordnance that has become hazardous by damage or deterioration.[164]

These agents affect the functioning of all bodily systems, including the eyes, nose, throat, lungs, and muscles. The G-series nerve agents include tabun (GA), sarin (GB), soman (GD), and cyclosarin (GF). The normal sequence of symptoms is a running nose, tightness of the chest, dimness of vision and pinpointing of the eye pupils, difficulty breathing, drooling and excessive sweating, nausea, vomiting, cramps, involuntary defecation and urination, twitching, jerking and staggering, headache, confusion, drowsiness, and coma. Cessation of breathing and death follow.[172]

GulfLink

A World Wide Web site maintained by the Office of the Special Assistant to the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness) for Gulf War Illnesses, Medical Readiness, and Military Deployments (www.gulflink.health.mil).

HD

HT

A blister agent known as mustard-t mixture. Chemical name: HD: Bis-(2-chloroethyl) sulfide T: Bis [2(2-chloroethylthio) ethyl] ether[179]

Hydrocarbon

A hydrocarbon is an organic compound containing only carbon and hydrogen and often occurring in petroleum, natural gas, coal, and bitumens.[180]

Incapacitating agent

An incapacitating agent is a chemical warfare agent that produces a temporary disabling condition (physiological or psychological) that persists for hours to days after exposure has ceased.[181]

L

A blister agent known as lewisite. Chemical Name: Dichloro-(2-chlorovinyl)arsine[182]

Lute

To seal or cover (as a joint or surface) with lute. [183]

M18/M18A2 Chemical Agent Detector Kit

The M18 and improved M18A2 kits are portable, expendable items capable of surface and vapor analyses. The M18A2 kit is designed primarily for detecting dangerous concentrations of vapors, aerosols, and liquid droplets of chemical agents. Distinctive color changes indicate the presence of a chemical warfare agent.[184]

M19 Sampling and Analyzing Kit

The M19 kit is a portable, expendable item used to identify chemical agents, perform the preliminary processing of unidentifiable chemical or biological warfare agent samples, and delineate contaminated areas.[185]

M256 chemical warfare agent detector kit

In the field, the M256-series chemical warfare agent detector kit is simply referred to as the M256 kit. The M256 kit is a portable, expendable item capable of detecting and identifying hazardous concentrations of blister, blood, and nerve agents. The M256 kit is used after a chemical warfare agent warning to test for and confirm the presence and type of chemical warfare agent, and to determine if it is safe to unmask. The M256A1 kit has replaced the M256 kit. The only difference between the two kits is that the M256A1 kit will detect lower levels of nerve agent. US forces used both the M256 kit and the M256A1 kit during the Gulf War.

Some smokes, high temperatures, standard US decontamination solution number two (DS2), and petroleum products may cause false readings. Results may be inaccurate when sampling is performed in smoke from burning debris.[186]

M81A chemical alarm

The M8A1 is an automatic chemical agent detection and warning system designed to detect the presence of nerve agent vapors or inhalable aerosols. The M8A1 will automatically signal the presence of the nerve agent in the air with both an audible and visual warning. The US military fielded the M8A1 to replace the wet chemical M8 detector—which eliminated the M229 refill kit, the logistic burden, and associated costs. The M8A1 operates in a fixed, portable, or vehicle mounted configuration.[187]

Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP)

Mission oriented protective posture (MOPP) is a flexible system used to direct the wearing of chemical protective garments and mask—a system that balances mission requirements with the chemical warfare agent threat. Wearing chemical protective garments and mask provides soldiers protection against most known chemical warfare agents, biological agents, and toxins.

At MOPP Level 0 soldiers carry their protective mask while their remaining MOPP gear must be readily available (e.g., within the work area, fighting position, living space, etc.) At MOPP Level 1, soldiers wear their overgarment and carry the rest of their MOPP gear. At MOPP Level 2, soldiers wear their overgarment and overboots while carrying the mask with hood and gloves. At MOPP Level 3, soldiers wear their overgarment, overboots, and mask with hood, but not the gloves. At MOPP Level 4, soldiers wear all their MOPP gear.[188]Commanders can raise or lower the amount of protection through five levels of MOPP. In addition, commanders, under certain situations, can exercise a mask-only option.[189]

MM-1 mobile mass spectrometer

The MM-1 mobile mass spectrometer is the primary chemical warfare agent detector in the Fox reconnaissance vehicle. During Operation Desert Storm, the MM-1 monitored against a target list of approximately ten selected chemical warfare agents most likely to be present, based on intelligence reports of the suspected chemical warfare agent threat. To speed the initial search, the sampling probe operates at 180ï¿½ C and the MM-1 looks for only four ion peaks of each detected chemical warfare agent and attempts to match the target list of chemicals against the pattern and ratio of these peaks. If an initial match is made with these four ion peaks at a pre-determined intensity and relationship, the MM-1 sounds an alarm. However, this first alarm does not confirm the presence of a chemical warfare agent, since there are many chemicals that have similar ion peaks and many combinations of chemicals that may yield ion patterns similar to those in the target list. Consequently, the MM-1 can falsely indicate the presence of dangerous chemical warfare agents. To more conclusively determine what chemical is present, the operator must lower the sampling probe temperature to 120ï¿½ C, re-acquire a sample of the suspected substance, and run a spectrum analysis with the MM-1 against all the detection algorithms stored in the MM-1 chemical library. For more detailed analysis later, the complete ion spectrum of the suspected sample can be printed on a paper tape.[190]

Mustard

A group of agents that includes the sulfur mustards (H and HD) which are chlorinated thioethers, and the nitrogen mustards (HN-1, HN-2 and HN-3) which are considered derivatives of ammonia. Mustards can penetrate skin and a great number of materials. These materials include wood, leather, rubber and paints. Because of their physical properties, mustards are very persistent under cold temperature conditions. [191]

m/z

m/z represents mass-to-charge ratio. A mass spectrum (e.g., what is seen on the MM-1 screen) represents the detection of ion fragments with a specific m/z. Each vertical line on the X-axis represents a fragment of a particular mass to charge ratio. The intensity of the lines (measured along the Y-axis) represents the count (the number of fragments detected with that ratio).[192]

Nerve agents

Nerve agents are highly toxic and among the deadliest of chemical warfare agents. Nerve agents may be absorbed through any body surface; the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract, and through the gastrointestinal tract when ingested with food or water. They affect the nervous and the respiratory systems and various body functions. Nerve agents include the G-series and V-series chemical warfare agents such as G-agents Tabun (GA), Sarin (GB), Soman (GD), and GF. A V-agent is VX. Detailed descriptions of nerve agents are found in US Army Field Manual 3-9.[193]

pH

A chemistry measurement of acidity and alkalinity, the pH scale ranges from 0 to14, with 7 as the neutral point. A substance with a pH lower than 7 is acidic, while a pH above 7 is alkaline.[194]

Pulmonary Edema

Abnormal accumulation of fluid in the lungs.[195]

Q

A blister agent, known as sesqui-mustard, Q is a more effective chemical warfare vesicant than sulfur mustard (H). It produces symptoms consistent with blister type agents, with about five times stronger skin activity than distilled mustard (HD). The fact that it is in solid form at room temperature with a very low vapor pressure hinders its effective use as a chemical warfare agent. Combining sesqui-mustard (Q) with distilled mustard (HD) to form sulfur-mustard/sesqui-mustard (HQ) helped to eliminate this problem. Chemical name: Ethylene bis (2-Chloroethyl) sulfide, or 1,2-Bis (2-chloroethylthio) ethane[196]

Riot control agent

A riot control agent is a chemical that produces transient effects that disappear within minutes after exposure and rarely require medical treatment. Riot control agents are effective in quelling civil disturbances and in some military operations, in preventing unnecessary loss of life.[197]

Sarin

A nerve agent known as GB. Chemical name: Isoproyl methylphosphonofluoridate[198]

Soldier and Biological Chemical Command (SBCCOM)

In an update shared by Military Health System Communications, Stephen Ferrara, who was appointed in January and is currently fulfilling the responsibilities of the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, emphasized readiness as a “strategic imperative to ensure warfighter dominance, survivability, and resilience.” “Readiness cannot be secondary,” Ferrara said.

In an update shared by Military Health System Communications, Stephen Ferrara, who was appointed in January and is currently fulfilling the responsibilities of the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, emphasized readiness as a “strategic imperative to ensure warfighter dominance, survivability, and resilience.”

“Readiness cannot be secondary,” Ferrara said. “You cannot do readiness at the last minute. You cannot cram for readiness. When it comes to mission success, readiness is everything.”

Ferrara, who was deployed four times as an active-duty surgeon in the U.S. Navy, noted that the Military Health System is the only health care system in the country that “goes to war.”

“When America’s sons and daughters go downrange and go into harm’s way, we honor the pact we made with them and with their parents, that should they become ill or injured, they will receive prompt and effective medical attention anywhere in the world,” Ferrara said. “That is the trust that we have. That’s something that our adversaries don’t always have, and it gives us an incredible strategic edge.”

READ MORE: Video: Pentagon cuts $5.1 billion in ‘wasteful spending’ in new wave of DOGE cuts

Ferrara explained that his top priorities for the Military Health System include providing high-quality, accessible, and sustainable care, increasing the lethality of America’s warfighters, and sustaining the medical force’s skills. Ferrara said, “We have to support the warfighter, sustain our skills and strengthen our chain.”

“If we support, sustain and strengthen, that is how we build a system that will fight and win because fundamentally, this is what our job is: to fight and win,” Ferrara added. “We do this by having a ready medical force so we can provide strong battlefield care and keep guns in the fight.”

According to the Defense Department, Ferrara said part of his job is demonstrating to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth how the Military Health System aligns with the Trump administration’s emphasis on “force lethality.” Ferrara explained that the Military Health System “optimizes warfighter performance” by ensuring the readiness of military service members and the individuals responsible for providing service members with medical care and recovery.

“It starts with maintaining the ready medical force,” Ferrara stated. “We must ensure that every member of the team — from the surgeon who wields a scalpel, to the logistician who procured the scalpel; from the nurse who transfuses the blood, to the team who runs the blood bank — is at the top of their game. A team ready to go downrange to fight and win.”",https://americanmilitarynews.com/wp-content/uploads/travel-medicine-2018.jpg,N,1.0,2025-04-16 11:56:20.140115

I introduced a bill to stop federal employees from using taxpayer-funded time for union activities, supported legislation to ensure only American citizens vote in our elections, and backed efforts to remove businesses tied to foreign adversaries from operating on U.S. military bases. I also enjoyed meeting with students and local leaders up in Washington D.C. and across the Sixth District who are working to make our community stronger. I’ll keep fighting for our shared conservative values in Washington.

Standing Up for Taxpayers

Federal employees are hired to serve the American people, not to engage in union activities on the taxpayers’ dime. “Official time” was established under the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act to allow federal employees to represent labor unions while remaining on the federal payroll. However, it has grown into an unaccountable and costly practice that diverts resources away from the core functions of government.

In 2016 alone, federal employees spent 3.6 million hours on union-related activities, costing taxpayers a staggering $177.2 million. Taxpayers shouldn’t be footing the bill for federal employees to conduct union business instead of fulfilling their official duties.

That’s why I was proud to join Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) in introducing the No Union Time on the Taxpayer’s Dime Act. This bill would end the use of official time and ensure your taxpayer dollars are used responsibly, increasing accountability across the federal workforce. Public funds should serve the American people, not private interests. I’ll keep fighting to hold Washington accountable and make sure your hard-earned money is spent wisely.

Advancing President Trump’s America First Agenda

Last week, the House passed a budget resolution that moves us one step closer to delivering on President Trump’s America First agenda and the promises we made to the American people. With this resolution now in place, House Republicans are ready to get to work alongside our Senate counterparts to craft a reconciliation bill that reflects the conservative priorities we were sent here to deliver. This process will require close coordination with the White House to ensure the final product secures our border, strengthens our national defense, unleashes American energy, and preserves the Trump tax cuts that have helped so many hardworking families across Virginia.

I’ll continue working with my colleagues to advance a budget that cuts wasteful spending, protects taxpayer dollars, and puts America first. I joined Fox Business’ Mornings with Maria to discuss the importance of this budget resolution and our work to advance the America First agenda.

Ensuring Only Americans Vote in American Elections

The right to vote is a foundational principle of our republic, and its integrity must be protected. Currently, federal law states that it is illegal for foreign nationals or noncitizens to vote in U.S. federal elections or donate with regards to federal, state, or local elections in order to protect the integrity of our elections. However, noncitizens continue to unlawfully register to vote, diluting the votes of American citizens and potentially allowing foreign interference in our elections. Over 8.8 million illegal immigrants have crossed the border under President Biden, including 394 on the terrorist watchlist. In Virginia, more than 1,500 noncitizens were found on our voter rolls. We must protect the integrity of our elections and ensure only American citizens are casting a ballot.

That’s why I proudly supported the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which passed the House last week. This commonsense legislation requires proof of citizenship when registering to vote and requires states to remove non-citizens from their voter rolls. Our elections should be decided by the American people, and only the American people. This bill strengthens election integrity, defends against foreign interference, and restores trust in our democratic process.

Legislative Update: Protecting Our Military Bases from Foreign Adversaries

The Chinese Communist Party has no business operating on U.S. military bases, but right now, they are. GNC, the well-known vitamin and supplement retailer, was purchased in 2020 by Harbin Pharmaceuticals, a company directly tied to the Chinese Communist Party. Shockingly, GNC operates over 80 storefronts on American military installations, including here in Virginia. These stores have direct access to our servicemembers, their families, and sensitive base environments, creating serious risks for data collection, surveillance, and foreign influence.

That’s why I’m proud to co-sponsor the Military Installation Retail Security Act, led by Rep. Pat Harrigan. This important legislation would prohibit companies owned or influenced by hostile foreign governments like China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea from operating physical storefronts on U.S. military bases. It would also require a full review of all retail stores on base to identify any foreign ties.

This is a commonsense step to protect those who protect us. Our military communities should never be vulnerable to the influence of foreign adversaries, and I’ll keep working to ensure their safety and security.

Casework Update: Delivering for our Military Families

One of the most rewarding parts of my job is helping folks across the Sixth District when they’re having trouble with a federal agency, especially our military families.

Recently, a family from Frederick County reached out to my Winchester office after running into problems with Tricare processing a home birth claim from last April. After weeks of trying to fix the issue on their own, they turned to my office for help.

My staff worked directly with Tricare to get the problem resolved. The hang-up came from a missing digit in a code on their paperwork, which prevented the claim from being processed. After working through the issue, Tricare was able to enhance the image of the claim and process it successfully, giving this family the peace of mind they had been waiting for.

Whether it’s dealing with Tricare, the VA, Social Security, or any other federal agency, my office is here to help you cut through the red tape and get answers. If you need assistance, don’t hesitate to reach out to one of my district offices. We’re ready to help.

Celebrating Palm Sunday and Holy Week

Over the weekend, we celebrated Palm Sunday — marking the beginning of Holy Week and a time to reflect on Christ’s sacrifice and love for us all. Wishing everyone in Virginia’s Sixth District a blessed and meaningful week ahead.

“They took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.” — John 12:13

Wishing a Blessed Passover

This past Saturday marked the beginning of Passover, a sacred time of reflection and celebration for Jewish families across Virginia’s Sixth District and around the world. As families gather this week to observe this important holiday, I want to wish all those celebrating a blessed and joyful Passover. Chag Sameach!

Thank you for the opportunity to serve as your Congressman. If my office can ever be of assistance, please contact my Washington office at (202) 225-5431.",https://virginianreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Clinenews.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-16 09:56:22.000974
