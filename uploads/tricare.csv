Arkansas ran face-first into this reality at the end of July, when federal judge Brian Miller temporarily blocked Act 624, which would have prohibited pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from owning pharmacies in the state. Finding in favor of PBM plaintiffs CVS Health and Express Scripts, Judge Miller said the law appears to discriminate against out-of-state businesses in violation of the Constitution’s Commerce Clause. Miller determined that the pharmacies would face irreparable harm if Act 624 were enforced, including unrecoverable economic losses and disruptions to patient access to medications, particularly for TRICARE beneficiaries, seniors, and those with complex conditions.

The ruling is significant as other states like Vermont, Texas, and New York are considering similar PBM restrictions. This means that the outcome of this case could influence policies across the country.

PBMs negotiate the cost of drugs with insurance plans and drug manufacturers, working to help patients get the best price possible for their prescriptions. They are third party negotiators that work with insurance plans and drug manufacturers to help patients get better prices for their prescriptions. However, they’ve been coming under intense bipartisan scrutiny for supposedly driving prices up instead. President Donald Trump and several GOP-led states have been making headlines this year for going after PBMs. But it was Joe Biden’s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that really got the game going just as Biden was leaving office. In January, the FTC published a report finding that PBMs charged significant markups for specialty drugs — findings that were skewed from the outset by focusing on specialty drugs with high R&D costs — a few months after the agency sued the nation’s three biggest PBMs.

With gridlock freezing congressional action, states are taking matters into their own hands. That is why Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed Act 624 into law back in April, which bans PBMs from owning pharmacies with a troubling exemption: Walmart.

While Walmart isn’t named, the law exempts any pharmacy that “exclusively services the employees and dependents of the pharmacy employer while utilizing the affiliated pharmacy benefits manager in this state.” Walmart, which is based in Arkansas, is the largest employer in the state, and it appears the original law was rewritten to give Walmart a pass.

If this sounds like a monopoly in the making to you, that’s because it very likely is. Walmart is not a PBM, but it does technically operate pharmacies affiliated with PBMs. And the corporation has announced plans to expand its pharmacy operations in the state while competitors like CVS get pushed out — not because of fair market competition, but because the government has stepped in to pick winners and losers via sweeping legislation.

This issue extends far beyond Arkansas, as 39 mostly Democratic state and territory attorneys general signed a letter asking Congress to prohibit PBMs from owning or operating pharmacies. States are also looking for other ways to control PBMs, but another recent federal injunction in Iowa raised similar constitutional issues. In this case, U.S. District Court Judge Stephen Lochner argued that Iowa’s law overstepped the bounds of state law, getting in the way of ordinary Americans accessing the healthcare they need. He stated that the law violated the First Amendment’s protections for commercial speech.

There’s no denying drug prices in the United States are far too high. We pay nearly three times more for prescription drugs than any other developed country. But the solution can’t be to deny constitutional rights to those we blame for the problem — or, frankly, anyone else.

PBMs have taken a lot of heat in recent years for the rising costs of drugs. But studies indicate that they really do keep drug costs down. A report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that PBMs lowered costs on drugs for Medicare Part D by 20 percent. Another report claims PBMs save consumers over $1,000 each year.

Stacie Dusetzina, professor of health policy and an Ingram Professor of Cancer Research at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Department of Health Policy, testified at an FTC public listening session, “Without PBMs, it is likely Americans would pay more for their medications than they currently do…It’s important to recognize that rebates do lower overall spending on prescription drugs, so we should value rebates that are negotiated.”

In short, these companies keep us from paying even more for drugs, but we’re still watching politicians turn them into convenient scapegoats for inflated drug costs.

Yes, we have to do something about skyrocketing drug costs, but the solutions we enact must uphold the Constitution. Trampling down the rights we all hold dear is a slippery slope that will only cause more pain — and inevitably higher drug prices. More competition is better; granting monopolies will drive costs up. Some refer to this kind of preferred treatment in the marketplace as “crony capitalism,” but it’s not capitalism at all, it's the government dictating market conditions.

The problem is the issue is so complex that people don’t understand it. They want to put a superficial band-aid on the problem instead of getting to the root of the disorder. While we all agree that most issues are better regulated by the states than by the federal government — federalism — that’s not the only part of the Constitution. States can make bad laws that violate other parts of the Constitution. Trampling on the Constitution to grant monopolies to preferred corporations reeks of socialism.",https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2020/77/5e5b54f0-aa46-4ed1-aeb2-ebff01d2f8ee.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-11 13:56:23.077776

Banning PBMs from owning pharmacies would bring affordability, access and better care back to Louisiana.","As a cancer patient covered by my husband’s TRICARE health insurance, I read Rob Maness’ July 11 guest column opposing pharmacy benefit manager reform with disappointment. His argument misses the reality for families like mine.

He claims that Louisiana's proposed ban on PBMs from owning pharmacies would create barriers for veterans to access prescriptions. But PBMs already create barriers by dictating ultra-low reimbursement rates to local independent pharmacies, preventing them from participating in TRICARE. That means patients like me and my husband, a retired veteran, are forced to use PBM mail-order services whether we want to or not. Mail order might sound convenient, but it often leads to delays, lost medications and zero personal care. I’ve experienced this danger firsthand.

Maness tries to scare us by saying reform will close pharmacies and displace veterans. What’s more likely is that locally operated pharmacies and non-PBM chains will expand when unfair competition from powerful, vertically integrated PBMs is removed. When PBMs own pharmacies, they set reimbursement rates to favor themselves while underpaying competitors, driving them out of business. Banning PBMs from owning pharmacies would end this conflict of interest, keeping locally operated pharmacies open and thriving.

Here in Louisiana, independents have always served rural and underserved communities where big chains refuse to go. They provide personalized care, deliver medications and work hard to ensure no one goes without. The idea that only PBM chains can serve patients is false and insulting to the small-business pharmacists working daily to keep Louisianans healthy.

PBMs use their ownership of pharmacies to manipulate the system. They underpay locally operated pharmacies, force veterans into their mail-order programs and overcharge TRICARE while pocketing the difference. That isn’t about access and quality care. It’s about greed.

Banning PBMs from owning pharmacies would bring affordability, access and better care back to Louisiana.

MHSRS, a four-day event which takes place annually at the Gaylord Palms Resort & Conference Center, provided personnel with multiple forums to demonstrate the impact NMR&D research has on the DoD warfighter.

Over 100 NMR&D personnel attended MHSRS this year, including military, civilian and contractor research, medical and support personnel. Attendees participated in a range of conference activities, speaking at 26 breakout sessions, presenting 95 research posters across three poster sessions and engaging with stakeholders and potential collaborators throughout the Military Health System.

“This year’s MHSRS was an outstanding demonstration of how the talented scientists of Navy Medicine Research and Development work together to field medical solutions in support of Joint Force health and readiness,” said Capt. Franca Jones, commander, Naval Medical Research Command (NMRC). “This year’s symposium highlighted extensive collaborations between commands in NMR&D, other service laboratories, and industry and academia.”

“MHSRS is really an opportunity to help our junior researchers understand our military medical research environment,” said Capt. William Howard, commanding officer of Naval Medical Research Unit (NAMRU)-Dayton. “We also use it as an opportunity for our seasoned researchers to remain calibrated and find opportunities. We try to maximize our participation for the benefit of our command as well as for military research in general.”

During the opening plenary session, two NMR&D commands were recognized. Justin Handy, from the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory (NSMRL) in Groton, CT, received the Outstanding Research Accomplishment for a Military Team award on behalf of the Naval Psychological Readiness and Human Performance team. The team was recognized for their work to improve submariner and nuclear-operator screening, career prediction, and individual coaching, which fosters readiness, professional development, leadership, team performance, and retention within the Submarine Force.

Dr. Doug Jones, Dr. Timothy Dunn, and John Marciano, from the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC) in San Diego, CA, received the Warfighter Medicine Research Public Communication Award for their work raising public awareness of their DOD-sponsored medical research in the area of arctic performance.

“Dr. Jones, Dr. Dunn, and their team of top scientists work diligently in the background to help our sailors and soldiers do their jobs in the harshest of environments.” Said Dr. Ken Earhart, NHRC scientific director. “It’s exciting and immensely rewarding when the world takes notice, recognizing their individual achievements, showcasing the real-world impact of their important research, and offering inspiration to others to pursue careers in STEM.”

Three NMR&D poster presentations were recognized during the final awards ceremony, out of over 1400 posters from throughout the three poster sessions. Dr. Sabrina Snyder, from NAMRU San Antonio, was awarded first place for her poster on the survival analysis of a dental self-healing composite, and Dr. Kayla Septer, from NMRC, was awarded second place, for her poster on the antigenic characterization of currently circulating seasonal influenza strains. Lt. Cmdr. Daniel Crouch, from NHRC, was given an honorable mention for Poster Session 2 for his presentation on using anomaly seasonality decomposition and artificial neural network modeling to predict febrile respiratory illness among U.S. military recruitment populations.

Dr. Elliot Dirr, of NAMRU-Dayton, was also recognized during this ceremony, getting third place in the Young Investigators competition, for his presentation on how the partial pressure of oxygen and nitrogen impacts the development of noise-induced hearing loss.

“This year we had two oral presentations, nine posters and two session chairs, and we’re especially proud of Dr. Elliott Dirr for his win in the young investigators category,” said Howard. “Our command cultivates the mindset of starting all research endeavors with the needs of the warfighter, and I know that is reflected in our contributions to military medical research.”

With over 3500 registrants this year, MHSRS presents a unique opportunity for researchers and leadership to meet with future collaborators in the Military Health System.

NMR&D is led by NMRC, and is comprised of NSMRL, NHRC, and NAMRU Dayton, San Antonio, INDO PACIFIC, EURAFCENT, and SOUTH.

MHSRS is the DoD’s premier scientific meeting that focuses specifically on the unique medical needs of service members. This annual educational symposium brings together healthcare professionals, researchers, and DoD leaders for four days of critical learning, intensive idea sharing and relationship building.

NMR&D, a global collective of eight commands, conducts research in support of Navy, Marine Corps and joint U.S. warfighter health, readiness and lethality, across a broad spectrum of activity from basic science in the laboratory to field studies in austere and remote areas of the world to investigations in operational environments. NMR&D studies infectious diseases, biological warfare detection and defense, combat casualty care, environmental health concerns, directed energy health effects, aerospace and undersea medicine, medical modeling, simulation, operational mission support, epidemiology and behavioral sciences.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2508/9249732/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-11 10:56:12.781301

web posted August 11, 2025

We don't get to pick and choose who gets to enjoy constitutional rights and who doesn't. They apply to all of us — even the large healthcare companies everyone seems intent on crusading against these days. Sometimes it comes down to freedom of choice versus monopolies, and restricting certain healthcare related businesses while granting monopolies to others isn't fixing the problems, but creating new ones.

Arkansas ran face-first into this reality at the end of July, when federal judge Brian Miller temporarily blocked Act 624, which would have prohibited pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from owning pharmacies in the state. Finding in favor of PBM plaintiffs CVS Health and Express Scripts, Judge Miller said the law appears to discriminate against out-of-state businesses in violation of the Constitution's Commerce Clause. Miller determined that the pharmacies would face irreparable harm if Act 624 were enforced, including unrecoverable economic losses and disruptions to patient access to medications, particularly for TRICARE beneficiaries, seniors, and those with complex conditions.

The ruling is significant as other states like Vermont, Texas and New York, are considering similar PBM restrictions. This means that the outcome of this case could influence policies across the country.

PBMs negotiate the cost of drugs with insurance plans and drug manufacturers, working to help patients get the best price possible for their prescriptions. They are third party negotiators that work with insurance plans and drug manufacturers to help patients get better prices for their prescriptions.

However, they've been coming under intense bipartisan scrutiny for supposedly driving prices up instead. President Donald Trump and several GOP-led states have been making headlines this year for going after PBMs. But it was Joe Biden's Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that really got the game going just as Biden was leaving office. In January, the FTC published a report finding that PBMs charged significant markups for specialty drugs — findings that were skewed from the outset by focusing on specialty drugs with high R&D costs — a few months after the agency sued the nation's three biggest PBMs.

With gridlock freezing congressional action, states are taking matters into their own hands. That is why Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed Act 624 into law back in April, which bans PBMs from owning pharmacies with a troubling exemption: Walmart.

While Walmart isn't named, the law exempts any pharmacy that ""exclusively services the employees and dependents of the pharmacy employer while utilizing the affiliated pharmacy benefits manager in this state."" Walmart, which is based in Arkansas, is the largest employer in the state, and it appears the original law was rewritten to give Walmart a pass.

If this sounds like a monopoly in the making to you, that's because it very likely is. Walmart is not a PBM, but it does technically operate pharmacies affiliated with PBMs. And the corporation has announced plans to expand its pharmacy operations in the state while competitors like CVS get pushed out — not because of fair market competition, but because the government has stepped in to pick winners and losers via sweeping legislation.

This issue extends far beyond Arkansas, as 39 mostly Democratic state and territory attorneys general signed a letter asking Congress to prohibit PBMs from owning or operating pharmacies. States are also looking for other ways to control PBMs, but another recent federal injunction in Iowa raised similar constitutional issues. In this case, U.S. District Court Judge Stephen Lochner argued that Iowa's law overstepped the bounds of state law, getting in the way of ordinary Americans accessing the healthcare they need. He stated that the law violated the First Amendment's protections for commercial speech.

There's no denying drug prices in the United States are far too high. We pay nearly three times more for prescription drugs than any other developed country. But the solution can't be to deny constitutional rights to those we blame for the problem — or, frankly, anyone else.

PBMs have taken a lot of heat in recent years for the rising costs of drugs. But studies indicate that they really do keep drug costs down. A report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that PBMs lowered costs on drugs for Medicare Part D by 20 percent. Another report claims PBMs save consumers over $1,000 each year.

Stacie Dusetzina, professor of health policy and an Ingram Professor of Cancer Research at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Department of Health Policy, testified at an FTC public listening session, ""Without PBMs, it is likely Americans would pay more for their medications than they currently do…It's important to recognize that rebates do lower overall spending on prescription drugs, so we should value rebates that are negotiated.""

In short, these companies keep us from paying even more for drugs, but we're still watching politicians turn them into convenient scapegoats for inflated drug costs.

Yes, we have to do something about skyrocketing drug costs, but the solutions we enact must uphold the Constitution. Trampling down the rights we all hold dear is a slippery slope that will only cause more pain — and inevitably higher drug prices. More competition is better; granting monopolies will drive costs up. Some refer to this kind of preferred treatment in the marketplace as ""crony capitalism,"" but it's not capitalism at all, it's the government dictating market conditions.

The problem is the issue is so complex that people don't understand it. They want to put a superficial band-aid on the problem instead of getting to the root of the disorder. While we all agree that most issues are better regulated by the states than by the federal government — federalism — that's not the only part of the Constitution. States can make bad laws that violate other parts of the Constitution. Trampling on the Constitution to grant monopolies to preferred corporations reeks of socialism.

I don’t have direct advice for the work around but something that may help you with one, if it helps you get a diagnosis that requires it. Have you been diagnosed with a metabolic disorder? Ever had your genetics pulled for obesity genes? I had the best doc dive down the rate obesity genetics pool, and discovered I had a specific genetic mutation. This diagnosis requires I take glp1 for life, the only other medication that tears it nearly killed me for some reason.

TFL is not just for the 65+ crowd. I am the spouse of a young retiree and I am on TFL because I am disabled and get SSDI and Medicare. I am in my late 40s. I was able to get approved for Mounjaro based on a history of high A1C even though the high numbers were the side effect of being on steroids.

It is actually extremely common for retiree benefits to be reduced as a cost cutting measure because their budget line is usually smaller. The corporate world does it all the time. Especially with government health insurance, they have to keep within the allotted budget so all those bureaucrats can get their usual kickbacks.

CALL TO ACTION: Help a Warrior, Father, and Advocate Get Life-Saving Care

SFC David Hong has spent his entire adult life serving others—on the battlefield, at home, and in the veteran community. Now, he needs our help.

David was born in Brazil, immigrated to the U.S. in 1983, and proudly joined the U.S. Army in 2009 as a Religious Affairs Specialist (56M). He deployed to Korea and Afghanistan, and beyond his military service, he’s a devoted husband and father of three, including a child with special needs who inspired his advocacy for military families facing similar challenges.

In July 2022, during a routine colonoscopy, David’s life changed forever—he was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer.

Since then, he’s fought like hell through multiple surgeries, 24 rounds of chemotherapy, and now, the cancer has returned to his liver. His providers gave him 2-5 years to live—but they underestimated David’s will to fight.

David was offered a chance: A cutting-edge, FDA-approved, non-invasive treatment called histotripsy—which destroys tumors in the liver using sound waves, with minimal risk and quick recovery. The procedure is 85-95% effective and could give David a chance at more time with his family and to continue serving others.

But here’s the kicker: TRICARE denied the procedure for a third time yesterday, even against his doctors’ recommendations (see denial in comments).

At HunterSeven, we fight for our warriors, and we were stunned to see how much advocacy had already been done on David’s behalf—to no avail. So we’ve decided: we’re just going to get it done.

We need to raise $45,000 to fund this life-saving procedure.

No red tape. No delays. Just action.

Please help us give David the fighting chance he’s earned.

They said Medicare Advantage ""stretches out the payment time, is the hardest to deal with, and that surprises me,"" Kaine said.
A member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Kaine plans to ask colleagues to look at reforming Medicare Advantage.
The sharpest political question came from 10-year-old Catherine, who told Kaine she wants to be president when she grows up.","After wrapping up a six-day swing through the state at a roundtable with kids at a Richmond YMCA day camp, Sen. Tim Kaine said Friday that his road trip brought unexpected bad news: yet another federally funded health insurance program that's stinting Virginians.

This one is Medicare Advantage, the managed care plans for older Americans.

Kaine said it was distressing to learn of problems with Medicare Advantage in the wake of cuts to Medicaid, the coverage that mainly covers children in low-income families and people with disabilities, along with the end of the enhanced tax credits that make Obamacare coverage affordable for hundreds of thousands of Virginians.

""I was hearing about it from the providers that of all the payers, Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, the VA (Veterans Administration) TRICARE (coverage for the military and military dependents), the worst payer is Medicare Advantage,"" he said.

They said Medicare Advantage ""stretches out the payment time, is the hardest to deal with, and that surprises me,"" Kaine said.

""For some of the individuals, they also are submitting claims and getting it turned down and having to submit them again or taking a long time to get a preauthorization, to see a specialist ... you've got to get a preauthorization,"" he said.

A member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Kaine plans to ask colleagues to look at reforming Medicare Advantage.

Virginians' experiences - in this case, the arrests by masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Charlottesville - have already sparked legislation. He and Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., are sponsoring a bill that would bar federal agents from hiding their faces and require them to display names and their agency when enforcing immigration law.

""You know, having tried a lot of cases in courthouses, I know who are in courthouses, people who are pretty emotional. They're often there for tough, challenging circumstances,"" he said, speaking after the session with the campers at the Northside Family YMCA.

""When I read about the Charlottesville situation, I felt people coming in, not identified as law enforcement with masks, trying to grab people, not only is it going to wreak havoc on the people who are there, who are already in emotional situations, but ... not knowing who they were, you could see something bad happen,"" he said.

YMCA campers

At the roundtable with the YMCA campers - ""I think they were the youngest I've met with yet,"" - Kaine earned a ""wow"" from the 8- to 10-year-olds when he said he's the first Richmonder to serve in the U.S. Senate since the 1830s.

He fielded questions about his office, his first job - as a 13-year-old camp counselor with the Y in Johnson County, Kansas, with a $25 paycheck at the end of the summer - his birthday and famous people he's met.

He also got the advice that Congress needs to do something to get kids more snacks.

Kaine told the campers he was most proud of a bill he and Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, joined forces on to raise the minimum age for buying cigarettes and other tobacco products from 18 to 21.

""The CDC (Centers for Disease Control) said that bill saved 350,000 lives,"" he said.

The sharpest political question came from 10-year-old Catherine, who told Kaine she wants to be president when she grows up.

The question: ""Do you get to make the rules?""

Well, he said, there's convincing 50 other senators, sometimes 59 others, getting a majority in the House of Representatives and then convincing a president to sign the bill into law.

""You have to really work to persuade people,"" he said.",https://insurancenewsnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/inn-social-default.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-09 04:56:08.269465

Why egg freezing may still make sense, even without coverage Military life is unpredictable.
For many women in the military, freezing eggs can be a way to create flexibility down the line.
Bottom line According to TRICARE, egg freezing for non-medical reasons is not covered under standard benefits.
Programs like Cofertility’s Split offer a path to free egg freezing when you donate half your eggs to another family.","If you’re an active-duty service member or spouse and thinking about freezing your eggs, you’re not alone. Many women in the military are interested in preserving their fertility, especially given the demanding nature of military life. Between deployments, relocations, and irregular schedules, starting a family may not be a priority right now—but that doesn’t mean you want to close that door entirely.

In this article, we’ll walk through how egg freezing works for military personnel, what TRICARE does and doesn’t cover, which military hospitals offer reproductive services, and how egg sharing programs like Cofertility’s can help bridge the gap if you're looking to freeze your eggs for personal (non-medical) reasons. We’ll also get into what to expect logistically, how to time your cycle, and what options exist if you don’t qualify for military benefits.

What TRICARE covers—and what it doesn’t

Let’s start with the basics. According to TRICARE, the health plan for active-duty service members, retirees, and their families, elective egg freezing is not covered under standard military insurance benefits. That means if you’re freezing your eggs for non-medical reasons—like delaying parenthood, focusing on your career, or preserving your options—you’ll have to pay for it out of pocket. This includes all parts of the process: medications, monitoring, the egg retrieval procedure, and long-term storage.

TRICARE does cover fertility preservation (including egg retrieval and storage) if your fertility has been impaired by a serious or severe illness or injury related to your service. This includes things like combat injuries that affect your reproductive organs or chemotherapy received during active duty. In these cases, coverage is provided through the Supplemental Health Care Program, which falls under a different category of military healthcare and applies to both male and female service members.

To qualify under this medical exception, you must:

Be an active-duty service member

Have a Category II or III illness or injury sustained during active duty

Be unable to conceive or carry a pregnancy without assisted reproductive technology (ART)

If you meet those criteria, TRICARE will cover services like egg retrieval, sperm retrieval, IVF, and intrauterine insemination. And according to TRICARE, if you paid out of pocket for any of these services after March 8, 2024, you may be eligible for reimbursement.

Where you can get fertility care in the military system

Even though TRICARE doesn’t generally cover elective egg freezing, some military hospitals do offer ART services at a significantly reduced cost. These services are available to eligible service members and beneficiaries on a first-come, first-served basis, depending on availability.

As of now, eight military hospitals offer reproductive endocrinology and infertility care through their graduate medical education programs:

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (Bethesda, MD)

Tripler Army Medical Center (Honolulu, HI)

Womack Army Medical Center (Fort Liberty, NC)

Madigan Army Medical Center (Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA)

Brooke Army Medical Center (Fort Sam Houston, TX)

Naval Medical Center San Diego (San Diego, CA)

Naval Medical Center Portsmouth (Portsmouth, VA)

Wright-Patterson Medical Center / 88th Medical Group (Greene County, OH)

While these programs prioritize care for service members with qualifying medical conditions, some do accept elective patients on a limited basis. Costs are often significantly lower than in the civilian market, but availability is highly variable, and waitlists are common.

Why egg freezing may still make sense, even without coverage

Military life is unpredictable. You might be deployed overseas with short notice, move across the country every few years, or find yourself in leadership roles that demand your full attention. Fertility doesn’t hit pause while you or your spouse serves—and unfortunately, egg quality declines with age regardless of your fitness level or overall health.

For many women in the military, freezing eggs can be a way to create flexibility down the line. It gives you more reproductive options, especially if you’re not ready (or able) to start a family during your service years. Even if you don’t end up using those eggs, having them stored offers a sense of security.

How Cofertility’s Split program fits in

If you’re interested in egg freezing but can’t afford the costs out of pocket—and don’t qualify for ART coverage through TRICARE—Cofertility’s Split program may be a great option. Through this program, you can freeze your eggs for free if you qualify and donate half of the eggs retrieved during your cycle to a family who needs them.

Here’s what’s covered through Split:

All fertility clinic fees

Medications and monitoring

Egg retrieval procedure

Storage for your half of the eggs for up to 10 years

In exchange, the other half of your eggs are donated to intended parents who are ready to grow their family. You’ll never be asked to pay for anything out of pocket, and you’ll receive personalized support from our team throughout the process.

Eligibility and what to expect

Unfortunately, not everyone will be eligible for Split. Like all egg donation programs, Cofertility requires certain medical and personal criteria, including:

Age 21–33

No smoking or significant reproductive health issues

Willingness to undergo genetic testing and psychological screening

Ability to provide a biological family medical history

If you were adopted or donor-conceived and don’t have access to your biological family’s health history, that may affect your eligibility. If that’s the case, you might consider freezing your eggs through our Keep program, where you keep 100% of your eggs and pay out of pocket, but get access to discounts and dedicated support.

How to time your cycle around military life

Timing is one of the biggest concerns for active-duty service members. An egg freezing cycle typically takes about two weeks of daily hormone injections, during which you’ll need to visit the clinic several times for bloodwork and ultrasounds. Then comes the egg retrieval itself, which is a minor surgical procedure with a short recovery time.

If you’re on active duty, here are a few ways to make it work:

Plan around a block of leave or light-duty status

Schedule during a stateside posting or training pause

Coordinate with your supervisor for time off (how much you share is up to you)

Stay near one of our partner clinics for the duration of your cycle

We understand that flexibility is limited in the military, but we’ve seen it work when there’s advance planning and support in place.

Privacy and confidentiality

Understandably, many service members want to keep their fertility planning private. With Cofertility, all of your care is coordinated through private clinics—not the military medical system. Your participation in the Split or Keep programs is confidential and never reported to TRICARE or your command.

That said, if you’re requesting leave or modified duty to attend appointments, you may need to give some explanation. Some choose to share openly, while others keep it general and simply say it’s for a medical procedure. Either is completely fine.

What if you’re based overseas?

If you’re currently stationed abroad, your options are more limited. While some countries offer fertility care for military personnel at allied clinics, elective egg freezing is unlikely to be available through TRICARE or DoD channels. In most cases, you’ll need to wait until you're back in the U.S. to start the process—or coordinate a trip home during leave.

Bottom line

According to TRICARE, egg freezing for non-medical reasons is not covered under standard benefits. ART services, including egg retrieval, are only available to service members who sustained a qualifying injury or illness during active duty that impairs fertility. However, eight military hospitals do offer ART services at reduced cost, and may accept elective patients when space allows.

If you don’t meet the medical criteria but still want to freeze your eggs, you’re not out of options. Programs like Cofertility’s Split offer a path to free egg freezing when you donate half your eggs to another family. For many women in the military, this can be a way to take control of their reproductive future without waiting for policy to change.

Military service asks a lot—and family planning often gets pushed to the back burner. But if you’re thinking ahead, egg freezing might help create the space you need to build the life you want, when the time is right. We're here to help you explore that, every step of the way.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63249acdcafd34297596984a/68964cddf6c63ad007cf1987_pexels-matthew-hintz-834554-9845005.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-08 21:56:06.961444

With TRICARE, you have access to health care services that can help your child start the year healthy and ready to learn.

Getting your child’s health care needs taken care of before school starts helps ensure they’re ready to focus on learning. TRICARE covers the essential services that parents need to check off their back-to-school list.

School physicals and health requirements

Most schools require a physical exam before your child can attend classes. TRICARE covers school physicals when required for enrollment.

Review your school district’s physical requirements early. Each state has different rules about when children need physicals and what the exam must include.

Important note: TRICARE doesn’t cover sports physicals. If your child plans to join a sports team, you’ll need to pay for this exam out of pocket.

Immunizations

Schools require up-to-date vaccines to protect all students from serious diseases. Check your school district’s immunization requirements before the school year starts.

TRICARE covers age-appropriate vaccine doses for children, as described in the TRICARE Pharmacy Program Handbook. You can get these vaccines from:

Any TRICARE-authorized provider

Many participating retail network pharmacies

Military pharmacies

Keep your child’s immunization records in a safe place. Schools will ask for proof of vaccines before your child can attend classes.

Vision

Children need clear vision to succeed in school. TRICARE covers eye exams, but the frequency depends on your family’s status. TRICARE covers:

Annual eye exams for children of active duty service members

One eye exam every two years for children of retired service members with TRICARE Prime

Schedule your child’s eye exam before school starts. This gives you time to get glasses or address any vision problems.

If you have vision coverage through Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program or another health plan, be sure to check your plan’s coverage policy.

Dental care for children

Good dental health helps children focus on learning instead of being distracted by tooth pain.

You may qualify for dental coverage through the TRICARE Dental Program. If you’re eligible, you can enroll your child at any time during the year.

Other dental options may also be available to your family. Visit TRICARE Dental Care to learn more about dental coverage options.

Supporting your child’s mental health

Some children feel excited about returning to school, while others feel nervous or scared. These feelings are normal, especially when children:

Meet new friends and teachers

Start at a new school

Move to a different grade level

Watch for signs that your child is having trouble adjusting. Many children feel better once they get involved in school activities. However, TRICARE covers mental health services if your child needs extra help during this transition.

Daily healthy choices

You can help your child make healthy choices every day by:

Packing nutritious lunches and snacks

Making sure your child gets enough sleep

Encouraging physical activity

Talking about school safety

These habits help children stay alert and ready to learn throughout the school day.

College students and TRICARE

If your child is heading to college this fall, they can keep TRICARE coverage until their 23rd birthday or until they graduate, whichever comes first, as long as they:

Are a full-time student at an approved institution of higher education

Have a TRICARE sponsor who provides more than 50% of their financial support

You must update your child’s student status in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System to maintain their coverage. Health care plan options for college students depend on where they live.

After college, they may qualify to purchase TRICARE Young Adult coverage.

Act now

Don’t wait until the last minute to prepare for the school year. Here are some steps to get started:

Check your child’s immunization records

Schedule needed physicals and eye exams

Review your school’s health requirements

Update information in DEERS if needed

Does your child have a prescription (for example, an inhaler) they need to bring to school? Work with a military pharmacy to get the correct prescription labels. Note: The military pharmacy will ask for your child’s DOD ID.

Additional resources

TRICARE offers many programs and resources to help military families. Visit TRICARE or contact your regional contractor for more information about:

Managing chronic conditions at school

Dental care programs

Mental health services

Resources for children with deployed parents
