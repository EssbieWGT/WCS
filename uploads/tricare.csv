The Maxillofacial Restoration Program is fulfilling our fundamental responsibility to our warfighters, getting them back to full readiness so they can return to the fight.","SAN DIEGO — When Army Spc. Grant Dickerson felt a sharp pain in his jaw after drinking something cold during a deployment earlier this year, he expected a routine dental issue. Instead, an X-ray revealed a dark lesion in his lower jaw.

U.S. Army Lt. Col. Christopher Chang, an oral maxillofacial surgeon at Evans Army Community Hospital in Fort Carson, Colorado, where Dickerson was stationed, ordered additional 3D imaging to determine the nature of the lesion.

""We saw a very large growing tumor,"" said Chang.

The diagnosis was a central giant cell granuloma, which is a benign but aggressive tumor that forms within the bone and grows. It threatened not only Dickerson’s health but his ability to continue serving in the Army.

For his family, the word “tumor” was alarming.

“As a mom, when I heard the word tumor, I was just in shock,” said Jennifer Dickerson. “I think I was just scared and afraid that it could be cancer.”

His father, Craig Dickerson, recalled preparing for the worst while focusing on next steps. “Everybody always goes worst case,” he said. “But we worried, and we just said, let’s work through the process, see where we end up.”

The process meant surgery to remove the tumor that had destroyed two-thirds of Dickerson’s lower jaw and rebuild the damaged portion.

“As much as I would like to do the surgery here, it takes a surgeon who has specialized training in doing microvascular surgery,” said Chang. “It also requires the support staff to be knowledgeable and to be able to manage a patient like that after the surgery in recovery, in the ICU.”

Ultimately, Chang chose to refer Dickerson to Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) where surgeons with their Maxillofacial Restoration Program have been treating patients requiring comprehensive facial restoration since November 2020.

“He reached out and did the biopsy and the initial workup,” said U.S. Navy Cmdr. Daniel Hammer, a maxillofacial surgeon and director of NMCSD’s Maxillofacial Restoration Program. “We worked as a team between Colorado and San Diego.”

The goal was to restore not only Dickerson’s jaw, but also his medical readiness.

According to Hammer, the damage the tumor had done was so extensive that had Dickerson been hit in the face, he would likely have broken his jaw.

“My hope for Grant with this surgery is that he keeps going with his career,” said his mother. “He wants nothing more than to be in the Army, to be a Soldier.”

Standard reconstructive surgery for a tumor the size of Dickerson’s typically requires a long, multi-stage recovery. After surgeons remove the jaw and transplant bone, patients typically wait 18 months to two years before they can receive dental implants and teeth.

For a service member, two years of limited function—unable to eat solid foods or deploy—can mean a medical separation. The Maxillofacial Restoration Program team has changed that timeline dramatically.

""The primary goal for Dickerson was a return to duty,"" said U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr. Kyu Choi, chief resident of oral maxillofacial surgery. “He wanted to continue to serve his country, and he wanted to return to the job he had left behind at Fort Carson. After a long discussion, we consented him for the one-time, one-surgery to restore everything.”

Instead of spreading surgeries out over years, the jaw-in-a-day procedure consolidates them into a single surgery that takes place in one day.

""Really, the big difference between jaw-in-a-day and traditional reconstruction is that you get your dental rehabilitation immediately,"" Hammer said. ""The bone, the teeth, and your function—so your speech and swallowing—all come back that same day.”

Cross-Service Collaboration

Before surgery could take place, a significant amount of coordination was required to ensure the procedure went smoothly. Through virtual surgical planning, the teams coordinated across state lines. They used scans of Dickerson’s mouth and 3D imaging to map the surgery and fabricate custom titanium guides before Dickerson even arrived in California.

“All the pre-op appointments, all the planning was done virtually on video communication,” said Chang.

Lt. Cmdr. Aaron Barto, a maxillofacial prosthodontist at NMCSD and member of the Maxillofacial Restoration Program team, gathered digital scans, photos, and Dickerson’s CT images.

“Using that information, we can actually virtually plan the surgery, the implants, and the teeth before the patient ever comes into the OR,” Barto said.

The seamless collaboration between Evans Army Community Hospital and NMCSD showcases how the Defense Health Agency (DHA) is integrating healthcare delivery across the military health system. By streamlining processes and removing traditional barriers between services and facilities, DHA enables providers to deliver coordinated care to warfighters like Dickerson regardless of location or branch of service.

""We worked as a team,"" Hammer noted. ""We were able to be so collaborative between the Army and the Navy and the entire military health system.""

Restoring Form and Function

The surgery involved a complex series of steps orchestrated by NMCSD’s multidisciplinary Maxillofacial Restoration Program team. First, surgeons harvested a section of the fibula from Dickerson’s leg and shaped it to match his jawline using the pre-planned guides.

“The next step is the inset, and that’s where we take our rebuilt jaw and we use metal plates to connect it to the patient’s mouth so that it fits in place,” said U.S. Navy Cmdr. Samuel Frasier, department chair, ear, nose, and throat at NMCSD and one of Dickerson’s surgeons.

Once the bone was set, the team performed microvascular anastomosis, which means they connected blood vessels together using a microscope to ensure the transplanted tissue would thrive. Finally, they placed the dental implants, immediately restoring Dickerson’s ability to smile and chew.

The day after Dickerson’s surgery, he was up walking. Within a week, he was discharged from the hospital and eating without a feeding tube.

Hammer attributes the program’s success to the nine integrated clinical care pathways that include pain management, speech and physical therapy, and mental health support, which focuses not on reconstruction, but on restoration of the whole patient.

“Reconstructive success is finite,” said Hammer. “I did a procedure. I got a good outcome. Patient’s okay. Moving on. But if your outcome is longitudinal in process, and it is as audacious as restoring the overall health of the patient rather than myopic of one procedure, that is how we restore form, function, and purpose.”

The ultimate goal for NMCSD’s Maxillofacial Restoration Program is the comprehensive restoration of health, especially for warfighters so they can get back into the fight. By reducing recovery time from years to months, the Maxillofacial Restoration Program does more than treat patients—it preserves the force.

“What Cmdr. Hammer and his team are doing at NMCSD demonstrates the true potential of our integrated military health system,” said Rear Adm. Kevin Brown, director of Defense Health Network Pacific Rim, which has oversight of NMCSD. “When we can turn what traditionally would be a career-ending diagnosis into a months-long recovery with full return to duty, we're fundamentally changing the equation for military readiness. This level of clinical innovation and collaboration across services is exactly what our warfighters deserve.”

A Return to Duty

Dickerson’s results speak for themselves. Within a month of his surgery, he was walking, speaking, and swallowing.

“The fact that Grant, after 30 days following his surgery, is able to function at this level is amazing,” said Chang. “I have no doubt that he’s going to fully recover in a short amount of time and be able to do the job that he loves.”

A diagnosis that leads to having two-thirds of your lower jaw removed is devastating, said Hammer. “But our hope is that his diagnosis, his experience, his recovery is just a chapter in his life, and not his story.”

Today, Dickerson is back with his unit and well on his way to a full recovery, supported by the teams in San Diego, Evans Army Community Hospital, and a military health system committed to improving health and building readiness, ensuring warfighters receive the care they need, when they need it.

“This case exemplifies what we strive for every day at Naval Medical Center San Diego—delivering world-class care that not only heals our nation’s heroes but ensures they are ready to meet the mission,” said NMCSD Director Capt. Elizabeth Adriano. “Our team has truly innovated by focusing on restoration of the whole patient, not just reconstruction, and they consistently achieve extraordinary outcomes. The Maxillofacial Restoration Program is fulfilling our fundamental responsibility to our warfighters, getting them back to full readiness so they can return to the fight. That's the standard we hold ourselves to, and that's the promise we make to every warfighter who walks through our doors.”

(Dr.) Barrera now serves as the flight surgeon for the 74th Fighter Squadron and as an emergency medicine physician at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia.","It’s 2015, and then-Air Force Senior Airman Laura Barrera’s day off while assigned to the 633rd Medical Group at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia. She received a call to come into her clinic for an unplanned meeting.

She was nervous. Having applied to the Uniformed Services University’s Enlisted to Medical School Preparatory Program, or EMDP2 — she had been waiting for word whether she would realize her dream of becoming a military doctor.

“I came to the desk at labor and delivery, and I saw everyone there that helped me with my application,” she said. “And then my group commander comes in ... he tells me I got in.”

Barrera was accepted into the intensive, pre-medical program that charts enlisted service members on a course to become military physicians through a partnership with George Mason University. The program offers mentoring and Medical College Admission Test preparation while allowing students to maintain their current rank, pay, and benefits while going to school full-time.

For Barrera, the mentoring had already started.

“I had fantastic, enlisted supervisors and leadership that helped review my package. They made sure I had everything to apply,” she said. “I have been lucky in my career to always have leadership that has looked out for me and has always pushed me forward and helped me up.”

Striving for the sky

Growing up in the wide-open spaces of Wyoming, Barrera had two older brothers, Erik and Hugo, that had enlisted in the U.S. Navy.

“I saw my brothers serve, and they got deployed right away after 9/11,” she said. “I looked up to them highly.”

She joined the U.S. Air Force, enlisting as a flight medicine tech in the reserves for four years while getting her bachelor’s degree from Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia. When she began active duty service, Barrera worked as a technician in the labor and delivery ward with the 633rd Medical Group at Joint Base Langley-Eustis where she learned her true calling: patient care.

“I really enjoyed working with patients, and I knew what I wanted to do to progress my career more,” she said. “It took time for me to understand and realize what it means to take care of patients.”

At 27 years old, Barrera thought she was “too old” for medical school. While discussing her career path with a military physician — who shared with her that he was in his mid-30s with five children when he started medical school — another doctor popped his head into the office and said, “Do you know about the EMDP2 program?”

“I looked it up,” Barrera said. “I was like, ‘I can do this.’”

From enlisted service member to medical student

She relocated to Manassas, Virginia, and started classes at George Mason University, taking on tough coursework to include “biochemistry, organic chemistry, anatomy, and physiology — every topic relevant for us to get into medical school,” she said. “The first year is preparation for all the classes in order to get into medical school. During the whole time period, you're also doing MCAT prep.”

While school was challenging, Barrera said top-notch professors in the program made the work fulfilling.

“The professors that taught us are phenomenal. They're some of the best people that I could have ever asked to teach us how to do medicine, how to prepare. I think it's a fantastic school. While you’re in school, the program prepares you to be not just a doctor, but a leader in the military.”

She also met fellow enlisted service members in the program, bonded in service and their unique path to a medical career.

“There were 12 of us military members from different branches. We would help each other study, and we were together all the time.”

When Barrera was ready to take the MCAT exam, she was embarking on another milestone — having a baby.

“I was eight months pregnant taking the exam,” she said. “It was stressful, but I got through it.”

Barrera was accepted into medical school at USU’s F. Edward Hebert School of Medicine in 2017 in Bethesda, Maryland. They started on their academic journey rooted in friendship and service.

“We would carpool from Manassas, Virginia, to Bethesda every single day while we were in medical school. We basically became a family,” she said. “These people are still my best friends. We all visit and talk to each other. Every year we take a picture together because we served together.”

After graduation and receiving her commission to the rank of captain, Barrera started her residency in emergency medicine — all the while aiming high for her military career goals.

“I knew I also wanted to do flight medicine, and the operational emergency medicine program partners with Virginia Commonwealth University,” she said. “I wanted to be more operational within the Air Force, so it was important to understand how we truly take care of our patients — I knew emergency medicine could teach me that.”

While in the emergency room at VCU Medical Center in Richmond, Virginia, the work mirrored the multiple, urgent tasks she experienced while deployed.

“I was forced to learn how to take care of all different patients and figure out what each person needed,” Barrera said. “I had an appendectomy in one room and then within 10 minutes, I’d get called over for a trauma injury.”

“Even when it was scary, it’s like ‘I can do this. I can take care of these people,’” she added. “It forces you to think on your feet, figure out the triage process, and then your resources, which is highly useful to the military.”

Flight surgeon and family doctor

In 2025, Air Force Capt. (Dr.) Barrera now serves as the flight surgeon for the 74th Fighter Squadron and as an emergency medicine physician at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia. She enables airmen to stay in peak health to continue their service in the air.

“I am a squadron physician that's embedded in the squadron with the airmen. I fly with the C-130's to understand the stuff that they see, the stuff that they go through, what happens when they're on a flight,” she said.

She considers her squadron her family, and she takes care of theirs on the ground.

“My patients are not just my patients — they’re also my friends. I know that what I'm doing is really impacting them and all the things that they do,” Barrera said. “Since I'm emergency medicine, I can help their families. I can see children if there’s an urgent care need, like a fever. It's like being the family doctor of your family, but it's a squadron.”

“I like being the one that people depend on.”

Barrera also has her own family — her husband and nine-year-old daughter — who she credits with supporting her every step of the way to her unique path to military medicine.

“My family is No. 1. I wouldn't have been able to do any of this without my husband, John Maurice. He has been a rock,” she said. “I have gone through a lot of mom guilt, having been deployed, but he’s never made me feel any less of a person for missing a birthday or holidays.”

While it was a challenging route from enlisted airman, to student, to primary care physician for the U.S. military’s top pilots, Barrera says the reward is worth it.

“It is hard, but it's hard for a reason. Nothing in life that's good is easy,” she said. “There are so many paths to medicine, but the program makes physicians true leaders in what they do and the patients that they care for.”

“The rewarding part is actually having that connection with the patients and being passionate about taking care of them.”

“The pharmacy directly supports the mission of the 6th Air Refueling Wing by ensuring the health and readiness of the wing’s personnel,” said Staff Sgt. Zoie Annulis, 6th MDSS noncommissioned officer in charge of pharmacy operations. “By providing timely and accurate pharmaceutical care, we help maintain the physical well-being of aircrew, support staff and their families—allowing them to perform their critical roles effectively.”

Multiple facilities and a large team reflect the hundreds of thousands of beneficiaries these pharmacies support. However, supporting so many patients comes with challenges.

“One of the most challenging aspects of the job is balancing the demands of providing excellent patient care while managing operational efficiency, especially during high-demand periods,” Annulis said.

The team overcomes those challenges by leveraging advanced technology solutions that improve accuracy, communication and resource management.

According to the pharmacy team, one key to its success is a robotic automated dispensing system. The system reduces manpower strain by completing 60% to70% of the unit's workload allowing Airmen to focus on quality of care while maintaining high output.

Despite advances in automation, the 46-member unit still responds to supply chain issues.

Hailey Weiner, a pharmacist with the 6th MDSS, said a recurring challenge is receiving specific medications in a timely manner.

However, the 6th MDSS continues to provide patients with quality care by offering TRICARE-covered medication alternatives when available.

Beyond technology and prescription access, the pharmacy provides services that have a direct and meaningful impact on patients at MacDill and across the greater Tampa area.

“We help patients save money on prescriptions and avoid high retail pharmacy copays,” Weiner said. “Our operations are particularly beneficial for the elderly population who are on fixed incomes by allowing them to access medications at no cost.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2511/9395606/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-08 12:57:20.673745

Background: The Military Health System offers geographically distributed SARS-CoV-2 incidence estimates to support critical national pandemic surveillance, but this has not been previously assessed. The objective was to identify confirmed, probable, and possible SARS-CoV-2 infections with laboratory and clinical evidence and compare cumulative incidence to the general United States population. Methods: An observational, retrospective epidemiologic study using medical records from the United States Military Health System (inclusive of active duty) collected from outpatient and inpatient facilities worldwide, both United States Military and non-military treatment facilities. Direct standardization to the general US population was used to calculate sex-adjusted cumulative incidence, stratified by age, for ten Health and Human Services regions for active duty and non-active duty beneficiary populations, with Spearman’s rho correlations for age and region strata. Results: Among Military Health System beneficiaries, 2,219,987 cases were identified, with 27.4% laboratory-confirmed cases alongside 35.0% probable and 37.6% possible cases identified using clinical ICD-10-CM evidence. Peaks in cases occurred November 2020-January 2021, August 2021-September 2021, and January 2022. Age-stratified and sex-adjusted cumulative incidence across ten geographical regions reflected these temporal patterns among both active duty (90% of age and region-specific correlation coefficients >0.7) and non-active duty beneficiaries (80% of age and region-specific correlation coefficients >0.7). Cumulative incidence was higher among active duty beneficiaries compared to the United States general population, particularly those ages 18-49 years, with adjusted cumulative incidence ratios consistently greater than 1. The cumulative incidence ratios for non-active duty beneficiaries were more consistent and closer to 1.

Admits Dispensing More Insulin to Patients Than They Needed and Receiving Ineligible for Reimbursements

December 8, 2025 – United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Jay Clayton, Special Agent in Charge of the New York Regional Office of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General (“HHS-OIG”), Naomi D. Gruchacz, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the Northeast Field Office of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (“DCIS”), Christopher M. Silvestro, and Special Agent in Charge of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Office of the Inspector General (“OPM-OIG”), Derek M. Holt, announced that the United States has filed and settled a healthcare fraud lawsuit against national retail pharmacy chain CVS PHARMACY, INC. (“CVS”). The settlement resolves allegations that, from 2010 through 2020, CVS violated the False Claims Act in connection with its billing and dispensing of insulin pens to patients enrolled in Government healthcare programs (“GHPs”), including Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Specifically, the Government alleges that CVS improperly requested and received GHP reimbursement for premature refills, dispensed more insulin pens than patients needed according to their prescriptions, and falsely under-reported the days-of-supply of insulin that its pharmacies dispensed.

Under the settlement approved by U.S. District Judge John G. Koeltl, CVS agreed to pay a total sum of $37.76 million, with $24,446,240 to be paid to the United States and the remainder to be paid to various states. As part of the settlement, CVS also admitted and accepted responsibility for certain conduct alleged by the Government in its complaint, including that GHPs paid CVS substantial amounts for insulin pen refills that were ineligible for reimbursement and CVS pharmacies dispensed more insulin to GHP beneficiaries than they needed.

“CVS engaged in a decade-long practice of repeatedly prematurely refilling insulin prescriptions for patients and improperly billing government healthcare programs for more insulin than patients needed,” said U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton. “These programs rely on pharmacies to follow appropriate refill schedules and to accurately report the amount of medicine dispensed, which CVS pharmacies frequently failed to do. This settlement reflects our continued commitment to holding pharmacies to account, enforcing rules designed to keep costs down, and protecting taxpayer dollars.”

“Companies that participate in federal health care programs are required to obey laws meant to protect the integrity of program funds, including the responsibility to bill only for services and supplies eligible for reimbursement,” said HHS-OIG Special Agent in Charge Naomi D. Gruchacz. “Working closely with our law enforcement partners, HHS-OIG will continue to investigate allegations of improper billing to safeguard our taxpayer-funded federal healt​hcare system and the millions of enrollees who rely on its programs.”

“Investigating false claims against TRICARE, the healthcare system for military members and their families, is a top priority for the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the criminal investigative arm of the Department of Defense’s Office of Inspector General,” said DCIS Acting Special Agent in Charge Christopher M. Silvestro. “This announcement underscores our commitment to working with our law enforcement partners and the Department of Justice to protect TRICARE against unwarranted and fraudulent expenses.”

“Knowingly submitting claims for medically unnecessary insulin refills exploits benefits that federal employees rely on to manage their health, increasing the cost of care and wasting taxpayer dollars,” said OPM-OIG Special Agent in Charge Derek M. Holt. “We thank our agents, law enforcement partners, and the Department of Justice for their dedication to investigating and pursuing these improper billing practices that undermine the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.”

Insulin pens (hard plastic, pen-shaped cases containing syringes filled with insulin solution) are a common way for diabetic patients to self-administer insulin. During the relevant period, manufacturers frequently distributed insulin pens in five-pen cartons with each pen containing 300 units (3 mL) of insulin solution. Insulin prescriptions must set forth the “directions for use,” which typically designate both how much insulin to administer and the frequency and/or timing of when to administer it.

When pharmacies seek reimbursement from GHPs for insulin pens, they are required to report, among other data, the “quantity dispensed” and the “days-of-supply.” The “quantity dispensed” means the total amount of medication dispensed to a patient when the pharmacy fills the prescription, and the “days-of-supply” refers to the number of days that the quantity dispensed is expected to last if taken as directed by the prescriber. Typically, pharmacists calculate days-of-supply by dividing the total quantity of medication dispensed by the patient’s “daily dose,” i.e., the amount of medication that the prescriber directs the patient to use each day.

GHP plans, and pharmacy benefit managers (“PBMs”) working on their behalf, typically set limits on the days-of-supply that a pharmacy may dispense when filling prescriptions (such as a 30-day supply), and reject reimbursement claims for fills that exceed those limits. GHPs and PBMs also deny reimbursement for prematurely refilled prescriptions—refills dispensed before the beneficiary would have consumed a substantial portion of the previously-dispensed quantity of medication if taken as prescribed. PBMs use automated processes to review claims for reimbursement submitted by pharmacies and deny claims that are submitted too far in advance of the expected refill date. The ability of PBMs to detect and reject reimbursement claims for premature refills depends on pharmacies complying with their obligations to accurately report days-of-supply data.

Dispensing insulin in full cartons containing five pens can exceed applicable days-of-supply limits, resulting in claim rejections. PBMs developed rules to address reimbursement when dispensing medications like insulin in the smallest commercially-available container would exceed the days-of-supply limit. Some PBMs required pharmacies to seek an override of the limit and then to resubmit the claim reporting the accurate days-of-supply actually dispensed so the PBM could verify when the next refill would be needed. Other PBMs permitted pharmacies to submit claims reporting the maximum days-of-supply allowed, even if that number was lower than the actual supply dispensed. Importantly, however, those PBMs still required pharmacies to track and use the actual days-of-supply dispensed to determine when patients would actually need a refill. All PBMs prohibited pharmacies from seeking reimbursement for premature refills, regardless of container size.

As alleged in the Government’s Complaint:

From January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2020 (the “Covered Period”), CVS violated the FCA by knowingly submitting, or causing to be submitted, false claims to GHPs for reimbursement for insulin pens where CVS: dispensed more insulin to GHP beneficiaries than was specified by their prescriptions and refilled GHP beneficiary prescriptions substantially before GHP beneficiaries needed the refills; falsely under-reported the days-of-supply for the insulin refills, which often prevented PBMs from detecting that the refills were premature; and failed to comply with applicable rules when refilling insulin prescriptions requiring pharmacies to calculate refill dates using the actual days-of-supply dispensed.

To fill insulin prescriptions as quickly as possible and to ensure that reimbursement claims for insulin pens were not rejected, CVS instructed its pharmacy staff simply to report the maximum days-of-supply allowed under the beneficiary’s plan when dispensing full insulin pen cartons, which was often lower than the actual days-of-supply dispensed. Many CVS pharmacies did not internally document and use the actual days-of-supply dispensed to determine when patients could next refill their prescription. To the contrary, CVS’ dispensing software calculated refill dates automatically based on inaccurate days-of-supply data reported to the PBM. As a result, CVS pharmacy staff repeatedly refilled prescriptions prematurely, dispensing substantially more insulin to GHP beneficiaries than they actually needed and substantially sooner than they needed it according to their prescriptions. As a result, some GHP beneficiaries accumulated large quantities of unused insulin, which was both wasteful and potentially dangerous as insulin can expire.

CVS management was well aware that it was over-dispensing insulin. PBMs conducted periodic audits of CVS pharmacies and repeatedly found violations of the dispensing rules, including reporting invalid days-of-supply data, refilling insulin pen prescriptions too soon, and dispensing insulin pens in excess of the quantities authorized by the prescription. PBMs issued chargebacks to CVS based on these violations. For several years, CVS management knew that insulin pens were among the drug products most frequently subject to chargebacks for premature refills. Yet, despite these audit findings, CVS failed to take necessary steps to address this long-standing problem during the Covered Period.

Under the settlement, CVS admitted, among other things, that:

During much of the covered period, many CVS pharmacies did not break open insulin pen cartons when dispensing insulin pens. As a result, at times, CVS pharmacies dispensed amounts of insulin that exceeded applicable days-of-supply limits. When a claim for reimbursement was rejected for exceeding the limit, some CVS pharmacies did not obtain overrides and re-submit the claim listing the actual days-of-supply dispensed as required by some PBMs. Instead, CVS pharmacies often reported the maximum days-of-supply allowed under the beneficiary’s insurance plan for insulin pens when resubmitting the claim, which was lower than the actual days-of-supply dispensed. While certain PBMs allowed this practice because the carton was the smallest commercially-available container for the medication, CVS pharmacies at times did not adhere to the appropriate refill intervals for patients that were to be based on the actual days-of-supply dispensed.

During much of the covered period, CVS customers with insulin-pen prescriptions who enrolled in CVS’ optional auto-refill program received automatic prompts notifying them that their refilled prescriptions were available to be picked up. CVS’ auto-refill logic calculated prescription refill dates based on the days-of-supply data recorded by pharmacy staff and sent customers refill notifications based on those dates. When pharmacy staff recorded days-of-supply numbers that were lower than the actual days-of-supply dispensed, the system would at times calculate refill dates for patients that were premature. As a result, some CVS pharmacies dispensed insulin pen refills to GHP beneficiaries before the beneficiaries needed more insulin and before the GHP plan or PBM would have approved such refills for reimbursement.

At times during the covered period, GHPs and the payors working on their behalf paid CVS substantial amounts for insulin pen refills that were ineligible for reimbursement, and CVS pharmacies dispensed more insulin to GHP beneficiaries than they needed.

In connection with the filing of the lawsuit and settlement, the Government joined five private whistleblower lawsuits that had previously been filed under seal pursuant to the False Claims Act.

Mr. Clayton praised the outstanding investigative work of the HHS-OIG, DOD-OIG, OPM-OIG, the Department of Veterans Affairs OIG, and the U.S. Postal Service OIG.

This case is being handled by the Office’s Civil Frauds Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorney Pierre Armand is in charge of the case.

The Board has conditionally approved FF and FX’s five-year volume production plan, including the target of 400,000-500,000 cumulative production and sales, contingent upon securing the necessary financing, as well as more support and agreements with strategic partners.

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF.

“Today I would like to share two major bits of progress first: I will start with the fact that I am proud to announce that the FX Super One First Pre-Production Vehicles Roll-off Ceremony is scheduled for December 21 at our manufacturing facility in Hanford, CA! We have reached a critical state of readiness: the full set of components for the first several pre-production vehicles have arrived on site. With nearly 3,000 parts per vehicle now in hand, we will formally launch production tomorrow.

This milestone carries significance in six areas:

1. It marks the near completion of the Bridge Closure for our Bridge strategy, covering a closed loop of supply chain, testing, logistics, customs clearance and production. This further validates the feasibility and strategic value of the Bridge model, across tariff adaptation, ICTS compliance, cost management, operational efficiency, and so on.

2. It marks that the Hanford factory has entered the FX pre-production phase. Our production, industrialization, supply chain, and Bridge systems are now forming a closed-loop synergy.

3. It could provide a replicable, fast-track mass production framework for the scalable deployment of future FX models.

4. It represents a new breakthrough in the Company’s business and supports improvements in our capital position and capital market expectations.

5. It could empower the global expansion of China's automotive supply chain and unlock its value within the U.S.— the world's highest-value market.

6. It could fill a structural gap, tap the blue-ocean segment in the U.S., and generate incremental value in the U.S. market, including job creation and contributions to manufacturing reshoring.

The second bit of progress is that the Board has conditionally approved FF and FX’s five-year volume production plan, including the target of 400,000-500,000 cumulative production and sales, contingent upon securing the necessary financing, as well as more support and agreements with strategic partners. This could help us build a solid foundation for our strategic advancement and stockholder value maximization.

On EAI flywheel—other FFAI updates this week:

S5 Capital Markets and Finance — FF attended UBS’s Global Industrials and Transportation Conference in Florida — a major platform for global capital, industrial and mobility sectors. During the event, we held in-depth discussions with multiple institutional investors, providing a systematic overview of our strategy and core business progress.

Turning to S6 Middle East — Following the delivery of the very first Super One to global icon Andrés Iniesta — coinciding with the UAE’s 54th National Day — our Middle East team brought FF 91 and FX Super One across all seven Emirates, where the “Twin Stars” shined across the region. Next, the Middle East team will speed up assembly ramp up and keep pushing for the assembly and delivery of the FX Super One AIHER variant and the potential battery electric variant, so that more users can be among the first to experience the unique value of First Class EAI-MPV and have the region truly enter the era of AI-powered luxury mobility.

Finally, our issues, reflections, and solutions — Since the FX Super one Initial Product Launch on July 17, we know that our stockholders, investors, and users have been eagerly waiting updates on our milestones and our business vision for the next few years. Our goal has always been to share a roadmap that is clear and executable. Due to complex review cycles and approval procedures, we have not been able to share these details as quickly as intended. This experience has underscored the need for us to improve our internal synergy and operational efficiency.

With our Five-Year Plan closing in on approval, the path could soon be clear for us to share our key milestone goals and forward-looking business plans. We will begin releasing these updates soon and look forward to your continued attention. That’s it for today. I’ll see you at the Hanford factory on December 21.”

HONG KONG and SHANGHAI and FLORHAM PARK, N.J., Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HUTCHMED (China) Limited (“ HUTCHMED ”) (Nasdaq/AIM:​HCM; HKEX:​13) today announces that following the contract renewal with the China National Healthcare Security Administration (“NHSA”), the updated National Reimbursement Drug List (“NRDL”) effective on January 1, 2026 will continue to include ELUNATE ® , ORPATHYS ® and SULANDA ® . In addition, TAZVERIK ® will be included in the first edition of the National Commercial Health Insurance Innovative Drug List (“Commercial Insurance Drug List”).

ELUNATE ® (fruquintinib) is included for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial cancer with Mismatch Repair proficient (pMMR) tumors that have failed prior systemic therapy and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation, in combination with TYVYT ® (sintilimab injection). It is also renewed for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have previously received fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, and those who have previously received or are not suitable for receiving anti-VEGF therapy or anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy (RAS wild-type).

ORPATHYS ® (savolitinib) is included for treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with MET exon 14 skipping alteration.

SULANDA ® (surufatinib) is renewed for the treatment of patients with unresectable; locally advanced or metastatic; progressive non-functional, well-differentiated (G1 or G2) pancreatic and non-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.

TAZVERIK ® (tazemetostat) is included in the Commercial Insurance Drug List for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma with EZH2 mutation who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. In July 2025, the NHSA issued the 2025 Adjustment Work Plan for the NRDL and the Commercial Health Insurance Innovative Drug List, announcing the establishment of the new Commercial Insurance Drug List. This list, together with the NRDL, forms a key component of China’s multi-level medical insurance system. This new list focuses on medicines with high innovation and significant clinical value that fall beyond the scope of basic medical insurance, including certain high-cost oncology drugs, gene therapies, and rare disease therapies, enabling reimbursement through commercial health insurance products such as high-limit medical insurance, inclusive health plans (“Huiminbao”) and group health insurance. This multi-layered reimbursement framework enhances patient access to breakthrough treatments while supporting the sustainable development of China’s innovative pharmaceutical sector.

About NRDL

The government in China has placed great importance on improving the affordability of drug treatments for the public. As of end of 2024, 1.33 billion people in China had basic medical insurance coverage, representing around 95% of the entire population.

LOS ANGELES, CA, Dec. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Immix Biopharma, Inc. (“ImmixBio”, “Company”, “We” or “Us” or ”IMMX”), a global leader in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis, today announced positive phase 2 NXC-201 results in an oral presentation at ASH 2025 presented by Heather Landau, MD, of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. NXC-201 demonstrated a complete response (CR) rate of 75% (15/20) (at s/u IFE(-) level) by independent review committee. In four out of five pending patients, MRD negativity in bone marrow predicts future complete response, potentially increasing future CR rate to 95%. NEXICART-2 final readout and BLA submission are planned for 2026.

“In the larger patient set Phase 2 results presented today at ASH, we are thrilled to see complete response rates continue to improve in NEXICART-2. These excellent results demonstrate the potential of NXC-201 to address the significant unmet medical need in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis,” said Ilya Rachman, MD, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of Immix Biopharma. Gabriel Morris, Chief Financial Officer of Immix Biopharma, added, “This exciting Phase 2 milestone brings us one step closer to delivering this promising therapy to patients upon planned BLA submission in 2026.”

ASH Presentation Results – Phase 2

Prior to NXC-201 treatment, all patients were exposed to an anti-CD38 antibody and a proteasome inhibitor. Median prior lines of therapy was 4 (range: 1-10). All patients had baseline relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis organ involvement. After NXC-201 treatment, complete responses (CRs) were observed in 75% (15 out of 20 patients) (at s/u IFE(-) level) by independent review committee. In four out of five pending patients, minimum residual disease (MRD) negativity in bone marrow predicts future complete response, potentially increasing the future CR rate to 95%. Downstream clinical improvement, including organ responses, were observed in 70% of evaluable patients (7/10). No neurotoxicity was observed. Only low-grade cytokine release syndrome has been observed with a median duration of 1 day. The ASH presentation contains clinical data as of November 13, 2025.

Current treatments typically result in a 10% or lower complete response (CR) rate in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis according to Zanwar, et al 2024, indicating a high unmet medical need.

SLS009 in combination with AZA/VEN achieved a 46% overall response rate across all cohorts, a 58% overall response rate in patients with one prior line of therapy, and encouraging survival outcomes in heavily-pretreated AML-MR following prior VEN-based treatment

Median overall survival (mOS) of 8.9 months in the least pretreated patient cohort; across all cohorts, mOS was not yet reached in patients with one prior line of therapy vs historical benchmark of approximately 2.5 months

SLS009 30 mg IV twice weekly added to AZA/VEN was safe and feasible, with no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed

Study expansion to evaluate SLS009 plus AZA/VEN in newly diagnosed AML with high-risk features is planned for Q1 2026

NEW YORK, Dec. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SELLAS Life Sciences Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: SLS) (“SELLAS’’ or the “Company”), a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel therapies for a broad range of cancer indications, today announced that clinical data from its ongoing Phase 2 study of SLS009, a highly selective CDK9 inhibitor, in combination with azacitidine (AZA) and venetoclax (VEN) for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with myelodysplastic syndrome-related changes (AML-MR) after prior VEN-based treatment were presented today at the 67 th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition, being held December 6 – 9, 2025, in Orlando, Florida.

In this Phase 2 expansion study, R/R AML-MR patients (N = 35 evaluable) were studied in three separate cohorts (cohorts 3-5) who were previously treated with VEN-based regimens and either relapsed and/or were refractory to VEN and were then treated with SLS009 plus AZA/VEN. The median age of participating patients was 69 years, and 98% of patients had ELN adverse-risk AML, with the most frequent mutations being ASXL1, RUNX1, TP53, and SRSF2.

SLS009 in combination with AZA/VEN demonstrated clinically meaningful activity in patients with R/R AML-MR, and among the 35 evaluable patients, the overall response rate (CR+CRi+MLFS) was 46%, including 29% achieving CR/CRi. Patients harboring ASXL1 or TP53 mutations achieved response rates of 48% (19% CR/CRi) and 57% (29% CR/CRi), respectively. The median overall survival (mOS) was exceedingly higher than the expected 2.6 months in this R/R AML patient population, and in the least pretreated cohort, mOS reached 8.9 months. Across all cohorts, patients with one prior line of therapy experienced the greatest benefit, with a 58% response rate and mOS not yet reached. No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) or treatment-related deaths were observed, and the combination was well tolerated.

“These results further reinforce the therapeutic potential of SLS009 to overcome resistance to venetoclax-based regimens by suppressing the expression of MCL-1, a key mechanism of resistance to BCL-2 inhibition in AML,” said Dr. Dragan Cicic, Senior Vice President and Chief Development Officer of SELLAS. “The combination of SLS009 with azacitidine and venetoclax demonstrates encouraging activity in a heavily pretreated population with adverse-risk AML-MR, including those harboring ASXL1 and TP53 mutations. We are particularly encouraged by the strong responses in patients with limited prior therapy and look forward to expanding this combination regimen into newly diagnosed AML with high-risk features.”

All three dose groups (50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg) showed impressive monotherapy efficacy, with VGPR+ (very good partial response or better) of ≥70% despite limited follow-up; evidence shows that these responses are expected to deepen over time

Across all dose groups, 95% (19 of 20 patients) of all evaluable VGPR+ patients achieved minimal residual disease negative status

Data featured in an ASH oral presentation; LINKER-MM4 is the first clinical trial to evaluate a BCMAxCD3 bispecific monotherapy in NDMM and is part of a broad clinical development program evaluating Lynozyfic-based regimens in earlier lines of treatment

Regeneron to host virtual ‘Regeneron Roundtable’ investor event to discuss its multiple myeloma development program on Wednesday, December 10 at 8:30 a.m. ET

TARRYTOWN, N.Y., Dec. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced encouraging data from the Phase 1/2 LINKER-MM4 trial evaluating Lynozyfic™ (linvoseltamab) in adults with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) who were transplant eligible or ineligible were shared in an oral presentation at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting. These data build on results from a broad clinical development program evaluating Lynozyfic in early lines of treatment, including precursor conditions, as monotherapy and in combination with standard-of-care or novel agents.

“The treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma often relies on complicated combinations of quadruplet or triplet regimens, each with its own toxicities, in order to achieve rapid and durable responses, which can be incredibly burdensome for these patients,” said Robert Orlowski, M.D., Ph.D., Deputy Chair, Professor of Medicine, and Director of Translational Myeloma Research in the Departments of Lymphoma/Myeloma and Experimental Therapeutics at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and the lead investigator for the LINKER-MM4 trial. “As the first to evaluate a BCMAxCD3 bispecific monotherapy in this setting, LINKER-MM4 seeks to understand whether frontline intervention with a single agent can deliver strong efficacy, enabling the simplification and potentially greater tolerability of these regimens. Lynozyfic monotherapy is already achieving MRD negativity rates comparable to quadruplet regimens but earlier in the treatment course, and these compelling results are expected to deepen with longer follow up. These results underscore Lynozyfic’s potential as a foundational component of frontline treatment regimens for multiple myeloma – or even a monotherapy regimen – for both transplant-eligible and transplant-ineligible patients.”

LINKER-MM4 is an ongoing, open-label Phase 1/2 trial investigating Lynozyfic in adults with NDMM. During a Phase 1A (dose escalation) cohort, patients were treated with a step-up dosing regimen followed by 50 mg, 100 mg or 200 mg doses of Lynozyfic. The lowest (50 mg) and highest (200 mg) tolerated doses were selected for further evaluation in the Phase 1B (dose-expansion) cohort. Among the 45 treated patients in both Phase 1A and 1B, 28 were transplant eligible, and 17 were transplant ineligible.

Across all dose levels (n=45), there was a 1.2 months median time to onset of response (range: 1-4.5 months). All three dose groups (50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg) showed impressive efficacy, with a VGPR+ (very good partial response or better) of ≥70% with limited follow-up. Evidence shows that these responses are expected to deepen over time. Across all dose groups, 95% (19 of 20 patients) of all minimum residual disease (MRD) evaluable VGPR+ patients achieved MRD negative status at 10 -5 sensitivity.

Across all dose levels, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were cytokine release syndrome (CRS; all Grade 1: 44%) and neutropenia (any Grade: 38%; Grade 3/4: 33%). Among other adverse events of special interest, one patient in the 50 mg cohort experienced Grade 1 immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Infections occurred in 84% of patients (Grade 1/2: 51%; Grade 3: 33%) with the majority occurring within the first three months of treatment and the rate of infections decreased over time. There were no ≥Grade 4 infections, Grade 5 TEAEs or dose-limiting toxicities. Ten patients elected to undergo an autologous stem cell transplant, all of whom had an acceptable CD34+ stem cell yield post-induction (range: 2.5-11.5 x 10 6 /kg).

A broad clinical development program investigating Lynozyfic in early stages of the disease is underway. This includes the Phase 2 portion of the LINKER-MM4 trial evaluating Lynozyfic at the recommended 200 mg dose, as well as LINKER-MM6 (EMN39), a trial evaluating a combination of daratumumab, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (DRd) followed by Lynozyfic monotherapy compared with continued DRd in transplant-ineligible NDMM.

The use of Lynozyfic described above is investigational, and its safety and efficacy has not been evaluated by any regulatory authority for this indication.

About Multiple Myeloma

As the second most common blood cancer, there are over 187,000 new cases of MM diagnosed globally every year, with more than 36,000 diagnosed and 12,000 deaths anticipated in the U.S. in 2025. The disease is characterized by the proliferation of cancerous plasma cells (MM cells) that crowd out healthy blood cells in the bone marrow, infiltrate other tissues and cause potentially life-threatening organ injury. Despite treatment advances, MM is not curable, and while current treatments are able to slow progression of the cancer, most patients will ultimately experience cancer progression and require additional therapies.

About Lynozyfic

Lynozyfic was invented using Regeneron’s VelocImmune ® technology and is a fully human BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody designed to bridge B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) on MM cells with CD3-expressing T cells to facilitate T-cell activation and cancer-cell killing. Lynozyfic is approved to treat certain adults with R/R MM: in the U.S. after four lines of therapy and in the European Union after at least three prior therapies.

In the U.S., the generic name for Lynozyfic in its approved indications is linvoseltamab-gcpt, with gcpt as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the U.S. FDA. Outside of the U.S., the generic name of Lynozyfic in its approved indications is linvoseltamab.

Lynozyfic is being investigated in a broad clinical development program exploring its use as a monotherapy as well as in combination regimens across different lines of therapy in MM, including earlier lines of treatment, as well as plasma cell precursor disorders. These potential uses are investigational, and their safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.

In addition to LINKER-MM4 , ongoing trials include:

LINKER-MM1: Phase 1/2 dose-escalation and dose-expansion trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities and anti-tumor activity of Lynozyfic monotherapy in R/R MM

LINKER-MM2 : Phase 1b, open-label trial evaluating Lynozyfic in combination with other cancer treatments in patients with R/R MM

LINKER-MM3 : Phase 3 confirmatory trial evaluating Lynozyfic monotherapy compared to the combination of elotuzumab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone in R/R MM

LINKER-MM5: Phase 3 trial evaluating Lynozyfic monotherapy or in combination with carfilzomib compared to standard of care combination regimens in patients with R/R MM

LINKER-MM6 (EMN39): Phase 3 trial, in collaboration with the European Myeloma Network, evaluating daratumumab, lenalidomide and dexamethasone induction followed by Lynozyfic monotherapy compared to continued daratumumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone in NDMM who are transplant-ineligible

Phase 1 trial evaluating Lynozyfic in combination with a Regeneron CD38xCD28 costimulatory bispecific in R/R MM

LINKER-SMM1 : Phase 2 trial evaluating Lynozyfic monotherapy in high-risk smoldering MM

LINKER-MGUS1 : Phase 2 dose-ranging trial evaluating Lynozyfic monotherapy in high-risk monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance and non-high-risk SMM

LINKER-AL2 : Phase 1/2 trial evaluating Lynozyfic monotherapy in R/R systemic light chain amyloidosis

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR U.S. PATIENTS

What is the most important information I should know about LYNOZYFIC?

LYNOZYFIC may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, including Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and infusion-related reactions (IRR), or neurologic problems.

Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and infusion related reactions (IRR) . CRS is common during treatment with LYNOZYFIC and can also be serious or life-threatening. Tell your healthcare provider or get medical help right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of CRS or IRR, including:

fever of 100.4ºF (38ºC) or higher

fast heartbeat

chills or shaking

dizziness or light-headedness

trouble breathing

Neurologic problems. LYNOZYFIC can cause neurologic problems that can be serious or life-threatening. Tell your healthcare provider or get medical help right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of neurologic problems, including:

headache

agitation, trouble staying awake, confusion or disorientation, seeing or hearing things that are not real (hallucinations)

trouble speaking, writing, thinking, remembering things, paying attention, or understanding things

problems walking, muscle weakness, shaking (tremors), loss of balance, or muscle spasms

numbness and tingling (feeling like “pins and needles”)

burning, throbbing, or stabbing pain

changes in your handwriting

seizures

Due to the risk of CRS and neurologic problems, you will receive LYNOZYFIC on a “step-up dosing schedule” and should be hospitalized for 24 hours after the first and second “step-up” doses.

During the “step-up dosing schedule”:

For your first dose, you will receive a smaller “step-up” dose of LYNOZYFIC on Day 1 of your treatment.

For your second dose, you will receive a larger “step-up” dose of LYNOZYFIC, which is usually given on Day 8 of your treatment.

For your third dose, you will receive the first treatment dose of LYNOZYFIC, which is usually given on Day 15 of your treatment.

Your healthcare provider may repeat one or both of the “step-up” doses depending on side effects or if your treatment is delayed.

Before the “step-up” doses and the first two treatment doses of LYNOZYFIC, you will receive medicines to help reduce your risk of CRS and IRR. Your healthcare provider will decide if you need to receive medicine to help reduce your risk of side effects with future doses.

LYNOZYFIC is available only through the LYNOZYFIC Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) due to the risk of side effects of CRS and neurologic problems. You will receive a Patient Wallet Card from your healthcare provider. Carry the LYNOZYFIC Patient Wallet Card with you at all times and show it to all of your healthcare providers. The LYNOZYFIC Patient Wallet Card lists signs and symptoms of CRS and neurologic problems. Get medical help right away if you develop any of the signs and symptoms listed on the LYNOZYFIC Patient Wallet Card . You may need to be treated in a hospital.

Your healthcare provider will monitor you for signs and symptoms of CRS and neurologic problems during treatment with LYNOZYFIC, as well as other side effects, and may treat you in a hospital if needed. Your healthcare provider may temporarily stop or completely stop your treatment with LYNOZYFIC if you develop CRS, neurologic problems, or any other severe side effects.

If you have any questions about LYNOZYFIC, ask your healthcare provider.

Before receiving LYNOZYFIC, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:

are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. LYNOZYFIC may harm your unborn baby. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you become pregnant or think that you may be pregnant during treatment with LYNOZYFIC.

Females who are able to become pregnant:

Your healthcare provider should do a pregnancy test before you start treatment with LYNOZYFIC.

You should use an effective form of birth control (contraception) during treatment with LYNOZYFIC and for 3 months after your last dose of LYNOZYFIC.

are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known whether LYNOZYFIC passes into your breast milk. Do not breastfeed during treatment with LYNOZYFIC and for 3 months after your last dose of LYNOZYFIC.

Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take , including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.

How will I receive LYNOZYFIC?

LYNOZYFIC will be given to you by your healthcare provider by infusion through a needle placed in a vein (intravenous infusion).

After the “step-up dosing schedule”, the treatment dose of LYNOZYFIC is usually given 1 time each week for 11 doses, and then 1 time every other week for 5 doses. After these doses and based on how your disease responds, your healthcare provider will decide if you are able to receive LYNOZYFIC less often (every 4 weeks) or will continue to have every other week treatment.

Your healthcare provider will decide how long you will receive treatment with LYNOZYFIC.

If you miss any appointments, call your healthcare provider as soon as possible to reschedule your appointment. It is important for you to be monitored closely for side effects during treatment with LYNOZYFIC.

What should I avoid while receiving LYNOZYFIC?

Do not drive, or operate heavy or potentially dangerous machinery, or do other dangerous activities for 48 hours after completing each of your “step-up” doses or at any time during treatment with LYNOZYFIC if you develop new neurologic symptoms, until the symptoms go away.

93% overall response and 76% complete response rates with median progression-free survival of 18 months in patients with large B-cell lymphoma in the 3L+ setting

83% overall response and 61% complete response rates in cohort comprised predominantly of patients with primary refractory large B-cell lymphoma in the 2L setting

Manageable safety profile appropriate for outpatient administration; no high-grade CRS and ≤ 5% of patients with Grade ≥ 3 ICANS following dexamethasone prophylaxis

Lyell management will host an investor webcast with presenting author and ronde-cel investigator Sarah M. Larson, MD, Associate Professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, at 8:30 AM ET on Monday, December 8 th

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Dec. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lyell Immunopharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: LYEL), a clinical-stage company advancing a pipeline of next-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies for patients with cancer, today announced new clinical and translational data from the ongoing clinical trial of rondecabtagene autoleucel (ronde-cel, also known as LYL314) in patients with large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL), which were presented today in two oral presentations at the 67 th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition. As of the data cutoff date of September 5, 2025, ronde-cel continued to demonstrate robust clinical responses with a manageable safety profile appropriate for outpatient administration. A 93% overall response rate, a 76% complete response rate, and median progression-free survival of 18 months were reported for patients with relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) LBCL in the third- or later-line (3L+) setting. Patients evaluated in the second-line (2L) setting (94% with difficult-to-treat primary refractory disease) achieved an 83% overall response rate and a 61% complete response rate, and 70% of patients with a complete response remained in complete response at 6 months or longer.

Ronde-cel is an autologous dual-targeting CD19/CD20 CAR T-cell product candidate in pivotal development for patients with R/R LBCL. Ronde-cel CAR T cells are designed to have enhanced antitumor activity through a proprietary manufacturing process that enriches for CD62L-positive cells to produce a CAR T-cell product with a higher proportion of naïve and central memory T cells. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted ronde-cel Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation for the treatment of patients with R/R LBCL in the 3L+ and 2L settings.

“These data from the ongoing clinical trial showing high rates of durable complete responses along with a manageable safety profile in patients with high-risk large B-cell lymphoma represent the potential of ronde-cel to improve patient outcomes,” commented Sarah M. Larson, MD, Associate Professor, Department of Medicine, Medical Director, Immune Effector Cell Therapy Program, Division of Hematology/Oncology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. “The two pivotal trials underway, including the first-of-its kind head-to-head CAR T-cell trial, are expected to provide a comprehensive and robust evaluation of the potential for ronde-cel to demonstrate differentiated benefit over approved CD19 CAR T-cell therapies.”

Sixty-nine CAR T-cell naïve patients with R/R LBCL received ronde-cel as of the data cutoff date for the presentation. The efficacy evaluable population, defined as those patients with Day 84 assessments or prior disease progression or death, consisted of 47 patients (29 in the 3L+ and 18 in the 2L settings). Imaging assessments were performed locally by the sites. Patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were consistent with a high-risk, heavily pre-treated patient population, particularly as compared to historical trials of CD19 CAR T-cell products: median ages of 64 and 65 years with 20% (9/45) and 21% (5/24) of patients being 75 years or older in the 3L+ and 2L settings, respectively; and primary refractory disease in 49% (22/45) and 92% (22/24) of patients in the 3L+ and 2L settings, respectively.

Patients Evaluated in the 3L+ Setting

There were 29 efficacy-evaluable 3L+ patients with R/R LBCL (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, Grade 3B follicular lymphoma, or transformed follicular lymphoma) with a median follow up time of 12 months as of the data cutoff date. In these patients:

The overall response rate was 93% (27/29 patients), with 76% (22/29) of patients achieving a complete response

72% (13/18) of patients with complete response remained in complete response at 6 months or longer

Median progression-free survival was 18 months

Patients Evaluated in the 2L Setting

There were 18 efficacy-evaluable patients enrolled in the 2L setting with a median follow-up time of 9 months as of the data cutoff date. Of these efficacy-evaluable patients, 94% had primary refractory disease. In these patients:

The overall response rate was 83% (15/18 patients), with 61% (11/18) achieving a complete response

70% (7/10) of patients with complete response remained in complete response at 6 months or longer

The median duration of complete response was not reached

Safety Data

In 69 patients, including patients from both the 3L+ and the 2L cohorts, a manageable safety profile appropriate for outpatient administration was observed. No Grade 3 or greater cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was observed in any patient. Twenty-five of the 69 patients received protocol-directed dexamethasone prophylaxis (10 mg/day for 3 days). One case (4%) of Grade 3 or greater ICANS was reported in a patient with high disease burden; no case of Grade 2 ICANS was reported.

In all 69 patients, as of the data cutoff date, low rates of Grade 1 (32%) or Grade 2 (29%) CRS were reported; ICANS rates were reported as follows: Grade 1 (9%), Grade 2 (3%), and Grade 3 or greater (12%) of patients. The median time to complete resolution of all reports of ICANS was 4 days. Cell pharmacodynamic data demonstrated robust CAR T-cell expansion and persistence that were similar in patients with or without dexamethasone prophylaxis. No deaths were determined to be related to ronde-cel administration.

Pivotal Clinical Trials

Lyell has initiated two pivotal clinical trials of ronde-cel: PiNACLE – H2H and PiNACLE.

PiNACLE – H2H is a Phase 3 head-to-head CAR T-cell therapy randomized controlled clinical trial of ronde-cel versus investigator’s choice of either lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) or axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) in patients with R/R LBCL receiving treatment in the 2L setting. Patients randomized to ronde-cel will be treated with a dose of 100 x 10 6 CAR T cells; patients in the control arm will be treated as per the product label. The primary endpoint of the trial is event-free survival and the trial is expected to enroll approximately 200 patients per arm (N = 400) with R/R LBCL, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, high grade B-cell lymphoma, Grade 3B follicular lymphoma, or transformed follicular or transformed mantle cell lymphoma who have not previously received CAR T-cell therapy. Patients may be treated with ronde-cel in either the inpatient or outpatient setting. More information about the PiNACLE – H2H trial can be found on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT07188558) here .

PiNACLE is a single-arm trial of ronde-cel that is enrolling up to 120 patients receiving treatment in the 3L+ setting. This registration trial is a seamless expansion of the 3L+ cohort from the Phase 1/2 trial. The dose is 100 x 10 6 CAR+ cells and the primary endpoint is overall response rate. Patients may be treated with ronde-cel in either the inpatient or outpatient setting. More information about the PiNACLE trial can be found on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05826535) here .

Ronde-cel Translational Data

Translational data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial showed that ronde-cel manufactured with CD62L enrichment achieved robust expansion and high expression of memory-related genes after infusion in patients with LBCL. An evaluation of ronde-cel and published data for CD19 CAR T-cell products demonstrated that ronde-cel had a higher proportion of CD62L-positive T cells with a higher proportion of memory-cell phenotype prior to infusion (ronde-cel, N = 34; axi-cel, N = 110 and tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel), N = 31). In addition, ronde-cel had up to a three-fold higher expansion in patients after infusion compared to the expansion of approved CD19 CAR T-cell products. The product memory-cell phenotype was positively correlated with expansion. Peripheral blood samples collected from patients one month after infusion (N = 9) also had a higher proportion of CAR T cells with a memory phenotype compared to cells from axi-cel-treated patients (N = 4). Ronde-cel CAR-positive T cells collected from patients one (N = 7) and two months (N = 3) after infusion demonstrated sustained capacity to proliferate, kill tumor cells over 72 hours, and secrete cytokines (N = 3).

The clinical data were highlighted in an oral presentation by Sarah M. Larson, MD, Associate Professor, Department of Medicine, Medical Director, Immune Effector Cell Therapy Program, Division of Hematology/Oncology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA. Translational data were presented in a separate oral presentation by Akil Merchant, MD, Associate Professor and Co-Director of the Lymphoma Program at the Samuel Oschin Cancer Center, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA.

Conference Call Details

Lyell’s management will host an investor conference call and webcast to review these data at 8:30 AM ET on Monday, December 8th. The webcast registration link can be accessed here . A replay of the event and presentation materials will be available on the Investor page of the Lyell Website following the end of the event.

Poster outlines clinical benefit with acceptable safety profile across 9 tested dosing regimens

Accelerated step-up dosing and higher dosing frequency is feasible and results in increased exposure

Six of eight responders presented with low bone marrow blast counts at baseline, supporting further investigation in this patient population most likely to benefit from MP0533

ZURICH-SCHLIEREN, Switzerland and CONCORD, Mass., Dec. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ad hoc announcement pursuant to Art. 53 LR Molecular Partners AG (SIX: MOLN; NASDAQ: MOLN), a clinical-stage biotech company developing a new class of custom-built protein drugs known as DARPin therapeutics (“Molecular Partners” or the “Company”), has today announced it will present updated data from a Phase 1/2a trial of the multispecific T-cell engager MP0533 in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in a poster at the 67th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition, taking place December 6-9, 2025, in Orlando, Florida.

The poster outlines the latest results of this multicenter, open-label study evaluating MP0533 for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/AML (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05673057 ). Data from cohorts 8 and 9 show that densified MP0533 dosing appears tolerable and leads to markedly improved serum exposure in treatment cycle 1, with encouraging preliminary antitumor activity.

“The results in patients with higher frequency dosing regimens of MP0533 are very encouraging. I am happy to see the clinical benefit of MP0533 in a mutation-agnostic manner in R/R AML patients, in particular those with lower disease burden. The data indicate that MP0533 has the potential to significantly improve treatment options for patients with AML and I support investigating MP0533 in a Phase 2 setting to confirm its safety and activity in earlier lines as consolidation addition to existing backbones,” said Prof. Courtney DiNardo, M.D., Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston, Texas, and co-chair of the MP0533 dose escalation review committee (DERC).

As of the data cut-off of September 1, 2025, 54 patients had been treated with MP0533. Eight of 48 evaluable patients achieved a response, with five reaching composite complete responses (3 complete responses, CR, and 2 CR with partial hemotologic recovery) and three reaching morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS). Six of the 8 responders, and 11 of 14 patients who achieved a reduction in bone marrow blasts of more than 50%, presented with less than 20% bone marrow blast at baseline, indicating that patients with low disease burden are most likely to benefit from MP0533. One patient in cohort 8 has been in complete remission for over a year, and one patient in cohort 9 is on the trial since 4 months. Cohort 10, which aims at reaching the same target dose as cohort 8 while exposing patients to more drug over time, is ongoing with data expected in 2026.

“The Phase 1/2a trial with MP0533 is making good progress, with the densified dosing regimen showing to be feasible, with an acceptable safety profile, and resulting in clinical benefit. The results warrant further exploration of MP0533’s potential, both in the R/R and front-line AML settings in combination with standard of care, and several consortia have approached us expressing interest in conducting such studies. We are actively engaging with potential partners and continue our dialogue with key opinion leaders and regulators to shape the next phase of development of our innovative T-cell engager for patients,” said Philippe Legenne, M.D., CMO of Molecular Partners .

MP0533 is a novel tetra-specific T cell-engaging DARPin designed for selective and broad killing of AML cells in a mutation-agnostic manner. MP0533 simultaneously targets three tumor-associated antigens CD33, CD123, and CD70 on AML cells as well as the immune activator CD3 on T cells. AML cells commonly co-express at least two of the three target antigens, whereas most healthy cells only express one or none. MP0533 binds with increasing avidity as the number of its target antigens present increases, thereby preferentially binding to AML cells over healthy cells. This unique mode of action is designed to enable T cell-mediated killing of AML cells while preserving a therapeutic window that minimizes damage to healthy cells.

About DARPin Therapeutics

DARPin (Designed Ankyrin Repeat Protein) therapeutics are a new class of custom-built protein drugs based on natural binding proteins that open new dimensions of multi-functionality and multi-target specificity in drug design. The flexible architecture, intrinsic potential for high affinity and specificity, small size and high stability of DARPins offer benefits to drug design over other currently available protein-based therapeutics. DARPin candidates can be radically simple, with a single DARPin unit acting as the delivery vector to a specific target; or multispecific, with the possibility of engaging more than five targets, and combining multiple and conditional functionalities in a unique DARPin drug candidate. The DARPin platform is designed to be a rapid and cost-effective drug discovery engine, producing drug candidates with optimized properties and high production yields. DARPin therapeutics have been clinically validated across several therapeutic areas and developed through to the registrational stage.

To sum it up, if you go with Tricare Prime, you will need a diagnosis code on the authorization from your PCM for every little thing. For example, I work at a GI and colorectal clinic, and if a patient with Prime comes in for hemorrhoids and then also mentions wanting to be seen for constipation, then the patient will need an updated Tricare authorization to include the diagnosis code for constipation. Hopefully that makes sense. With Tricare Select, there is typically some copay, but you do not need a referral/authorization to go to the doctor so long as the practice accepts Tricare Select.

There are certain times you may need to file your own claims with WPS Government Services, the TFL contractor. Here’s what you need to know about when to file claims when you have Medicare and TFL.

“Always prepare to show your Medicare card along with your military ID card at any medical appointment for a smooth claims process,” said Anne Breslin, TRICARE For Life program manager, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency.

Who files my claims?

In most cases, your provider files your health care claims with Medicare first. Medicare pays its share and sends the claim to WPS for processing and payment of TRICARE’s portion of the claim.

Sometimes, you’ll need to file your own claim with WPS. This happens when:

TRICARE is your primary insurance.

Medicare doesn’t cover the service.

You have other health insurance.

What you need for filing claims

When you file a claim, include:

Patient’s Request for Medical Payment (DD Form 2642)

Medicare Summary Notice

Your OHI explanation of benefits (if you have OHI)

Provider’s bill with all required information

Required information on bills

Make sure your provider’s bill shows:

Your name

Provider’s name and address

Date and place of service

Description of services

Charges for each service

Diagnosis

Filing deadlines

You have one year from the date of service to file claims in the U.S, as described in the TRICARE For Life Handbook. Send claims to the WPS mailing address.

Filing claims overseas

When you get care overseas, TRICARE pays first (unless you have OHI). Medicare doesn’t pay for overseas care.

You must submit proof of payment with all overseas claims. This can be:

Credit card receipts

Canceled checks

Credit card statements

Provider invoices showing payment

File overseas claims where you received care. You have three years from the date of service to file these claims.

How do I get help?

WPS (U.S. claims): Call 866-773-0404.

This fall, Virginia Tech is debuting an AI-powered essay reader. The college expects it will be able to inform students of admissions decisions a month sooner than usual, in late January, because of the tool's help sorting tens of thousands of applications.

BizSense Beat is a weekly collaboration between VPM News and Richmond BizSense that recaps the region’s top business stories.

This week, BizSense’s Jonathan Spiers joins host Lyndon German to discuss unexpectedly rejected plans for a proposed housing development in Henrico County’s Three Chopt District.

Lyndon and Jonathan also talk about the likely exclusion of a 93-acre plot — the former Best Products headquarters near Interstate 95 and Parham Road — from Henrico’s next post–GreenCity development plan.

Don’t forget—the deadlines for Airmen and Guardians to sign up for 2026 health, dental, and vision benefits are quickly approaching.

Tricare open season ends Dec. 9 for health care coverage starting Jan. 1. Open season for Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program ends Dec. 8.

Tricare offers two main health plan options: Tricare Prime and Tricare Select, according to Tricare’s Open Season page.

Tricare Prime: For individuals and families that prefer a primary care manager, or PCM, to oversee their care and want predictable costs. No deductible; just co-payment for most services. No copayments for active-duty family members. Referrals are required for most specialty care.

Tricare Select: Offers more flexibility for Airmen and Guardians. There’s no PCM and participants can see any Tricare-authorized provider they choose. No referrals are necessary for primary care and most specialty care. There is an annual deductible as well as co-payments or cost shares.

Airmen and Guardians living in the Atlanta, Ga., or Tampa, Fla., metropolitan area may want to consider signing up for the Tricare Prime Demo, an option designed to offer more options for eligible participants than the standard Tricare Prime plan, the Defense Health Agency announced in May. Interested participants have until Dec. 9 to sign up through Tricare Open Season. Coverage starts Jan. 1.

The Tricare Prime Demo plan, managed by CareSource Military & Veterans, doesn’t require participants get referrals to see network providers and offers virtual health services and a 24/7 nurse advice line, according to the May announcement. Go to the TRICARE Prime Demo to check eligibility and view details.

For dental and vision, the eligibility for the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program, or FEDVIP, has expanded to include “certain retired uniformed service members, active-duty family members, and survivors,” according to benefeds.gov. The site allows enrollees to check their eligibility, compare premiums and benefits, and estimate in-network and out-of-network service costs.

Airmen and Guardians may also consider opening a health care or dependent care flexible spending account, or FSA, during Tricare Open Season depending on their family’s needs. The Internal Revenue Service allows participants to contribute up to $3,400 pre-tax income into a healthcare FSA each year to cover expenses such as co-payments, vision and dental exams, eyeglasses, and braces, according to fsafeds.gov. But participants can only carry over up to $680 from one plan year to the next.

A dependent care FSA allows participants to use pre-tax income to pay for eligible dependent care services such as preschool, summer day camp, before or after-school programs, and child or adult day care. The IRS allows participants who are single, head of household, or married couples filing joint tax returns to contribute up to $7,500 per year, according to fsafeds.gov. Participants who are married, filing separate tax returns can contribute up to $3,750 per year.

The Air Force Aid Society announced plans in June to streamline the application process for financial aid to offer more assistance to Airmen and Guardians manage the costs of health care, child care and other expensive necessities.

Through the Department of Defense, Tricare offers health plans to uniformed service members, retirees and their families. CareSource Military and Veterans President Holly Joers explained to Becker’s how the insurer is getting in on the action.

So far, the plan has taken one big step to ease administrative burden and boost care access: Eliminating referrals for in-network care.

In Tricare Prime, members often have to work with their primary care manager — their main provider — to get a referral for specialty care, get that referral approved by a regional contractor and then wait to hear back before they can book an appointment. CareSource evaluated whether any legal obstacles stood in the way and decided to axe the process.

“It was a no-brainer,” Ms. Joers said. “This makes sense to us. Can we do it logistically? Yes. Are there any barriers statutorily? No.”

She said CareSource chose Tampa as an initial market because of its healthcare infrastructure, a military base that draws service members and a retiree population. Integrated Home Care Services will act as one of the plan’s partners in Florida. The insurer will also offer the plan in Atlanta. Ms. Joers noted that both areas have “strong military and veteran communities, robust healthcare infrastructure and a wide variety of population needs.”

As for other insurers considering entering the Tricare market, Ms. Joers sees an opportunity.

“We’re hearing a lot from the government now about wanting to bring more commercial entities into the space,” she said.

In terms of what next steps Ms. Joers sees for CareSource’s Tricare push, she said she is “expecting there to be an opportunity to compete for more locations, so we’re excited to be able to do that and just continue to build on this managed care, integrated care model.”",https://www.beckerspayer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/payer-og-image.png,N,1.0,2025-12-05 20:56:43.608573

MEADE, Md.– Fort Meade Medical Department Activity (MEDDAC) leaders and staff celebrated the newest DAISY Award for Extraordinary Nurses honorees during a ceremony held at the Fort Meade MEDDAC Headquarters on Fort Meade, Maryland, Dec. 5, 2025.

Virginia Peters, Lynnette Petty, and Army Spc. Steven Miller were selected from 35 nominations to receive the award.

The DAISY award, which stands for Diseases Attacking the Immune System, recognizes nurses who provide exceptional care and compassion by collecting nominations from patients, families, and co-workers.

Leaders at the ceremony emphasized the impact and importance of the award in the nursing profession.

“The DAISY award is a special award because it reminds us of why many of us joined this profession in the first place,” said Army Lt. Col. Derral W. Prowant, Kimbrough’s chief nursing officer. “Healing is more than medicine. It is connection, trust, and presence.”

“The DAISY Award is so special because it’s not a top-down award,” said Army Col. Louis Magyar III, Fort Meade MEDDAC’s deputy commander for nursing. “To be recognized by our patients–by the people that we care for and that they’ve entrusted us to care for them–is probably one of the most [important] recognitions that you could ever receive as a healthcare provider,” Maygar added.

Peters, a registered nurse at the Dunham Army Health Clinic, Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania, was nominated by a patient after Peters provided thorough patient support during appointments, addressed concerns, and enhanced the patient’s understanding with a home medical device. Peters made the patient feel valued and cared for throughout the process. “She is undoubtedly one of the best nurses that I have ever experienced,” according to the patient.

Petty, a licensed practical nurse at Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center, Fort Meade, Maryland, was nominated by a grateful patient who highlighted Petty’s “outstanding professionalism,” sharing that she “immediately took actions” and even escorted them to the pharmacy to secure a time-sensitive prescription. The patient called her support “above and beyond” and credited her “compassion and determination” for resolving the issue.

Miller, a combat medic specialist at Kirk Army Health Clinic, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, was nominated by a patient who commended Miller for being “an exceptional medic” whose professionalism and thorough review of hospital notes and history showed “the absolute intent of getting me [the patient] help.” The patient added that he is a credit to his profession and to Kirk Army Health Clinic.

The DAISY Award is part of an international program that celebrates nurses who go above and beyond to provide exceptional patient care. Nominees are selected based on patient, family, and staff submissions describing meaningful moments of clinical excellence and compassion.

Winners received a certificate, pin, and “The Healer’s Touch” serpentine stone sculpture, which is hand-carved by artists of the Shona Tribe in Zimbabwe who hold their traditional healers in high esteem.

The DAISY Foundation was established in November 1999 by the family of J. Patrick Barnes who died Age 33 of complications of an autoimmune disease known as Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura.

NEXT allegedly paid doctors in Texas and Arkansas thousands of dollars in kickbacks disguised as consulting fees and medical director fees. However, in reality, the department said these payments were actually offered to induce the doctors to order NEXT laboratory tests.

The company also allegedly paid commissions to certain independent contractor marketers based on the volume and value of referrals to ensure that doctors order NEXT laboratory tests.

The anti-kickback statute prohibits offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce referrals of items or services covered by Medicare, Medicaid and other federally funded health care programs, per the DOJ. This law aims to ensure that medical providers’ judgments are in their patients’ best interests.

“This settlement shows DOJ’s commitment to rooting out illegal kickback schemes that have no place in our federal health care programs,” said Assistant Attorney General Brett A. Shumate of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Department is committed to pursuing these important investigations and health care fraud enforcement across the board.”
