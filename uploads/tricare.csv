This study assessed whether statin use after lung cancer diagnosis is associated with overall survival among MHS beneficiaries with lung cancer. METHODS: This study was based on the Military Cancer Epidemiology (MilCanEpi) database, a database linking the DoD's Central Cancer Registry (CCR) and the MHS Data Repository (MDR). The study subjects were MHS beneficiaries diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Information on statin use was extracted from the database. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) comparing post-diagnosis use of statin relative to non-users. RESULTS: Among the 5096 patients, 864 patients used a statin after NSCLC diagnosis. Compared to individuals who never used statin, increased cumulative use of statin (per one-year of use) among the users conferred a significantly improved survival with an adjusted HR of 0.82 (95% CI=0.75-0.90). In stratified analysis, the survival benefit or its tendency associated with increased cumulative use was observed regardless of age, race, sex, tumor stage, comorbidity index or baseline use. CONCLUSIONS: Post-diagnosis statin use was associated with improved survival among NSCLC patients in a universal healthcare system.

The impact of exposure to morally injurious events on posttraumatic stress symptoms among Israeli combat Veterans: a longitudinal moderated mediation model of moral injury outcomes and dispositional forgiveness

Abstract: Background: Exposure to potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs) during military service can lead to moral injury (MI) outcomes and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). This longitudinal study examined the relationships between PMIE exposure, MI outcomes, and PTSS among Israeli combat veterans, and the potential protective role of dispositional forgiveness in these associations. Method: Participants were 169 Israeli combat veterans who participated in a six-year longitudinal study with four measurement points (T1: 12 months before enlistment, T2: Six months following enlistment- pre-deployment, T3: 18 months following enlistment- post-deployment, and T4: 28 months following discharge). Participants’ characteristics were assessed via semi-structured interviews (T1) and validated self-report measures (T2-T4) between 2019-2024. Results: Approximately 36% of participants reported exposure to PMIEs during service, with 13% exceeding the clinical threshold for probable PTSD at T4. PMIE-Betrayal at T3 was positively associated with MI outcomes of shame and trust violation at T4. The indirect effect of PMIEs on PTSS through MI outcome-Shame depended on forgiveness levels. Among veterans with low forgiveness, higher exposure to PMIE-Betrayal was associated with increased MI shame, which was linked to more severe PTSS. Conversely, for those with high forgiveness, exposure to PMIE-Self and Other was associated with decreased MI shame and subsequently reduced PTSS. Conclusion: Dispositional forgiveness moderates the relationship between PMIE exposure and MI outcomes, particularly shame, which mediates the development of PTSS. These findings highlight forgiveness as a potential target for intervention in treating moral injury and preventing PTSS among combat veterans.",https://www.centreforevidence.org/website/img/og--default.png,N,0.0,2025-11-07 20:22:07.473811

Tricare health plans, critical to many military and retiree households across the U.S., will become more expensive in 2026. The Military Health System’s announcement, made Nov. 7, calls for a 2 to 3 percent increase in most Tricare costs. Prices for prescription drugs are particularly hard hit, and can rise by more than 15 percent. These adjustments affect both the annual registration fees and the deductibles and co-payments.

For many Tricare Prime and Tricare Select users, this means they will face higher costs for annual enrollment and medical services. The monthly premiums for Tricare Reserve Select and Tricare Young Adult members, which have already increased in 2025, are particularly hard hit. The Tricare open enrollment period, during which members can change their health insurance for the coming year, runs from November 10th to December 9th.

The current cost for the Tricare Dental Program will remain unchanged through February 2026. The cost of Tricare depends on which “group” members belong to, which is determined by the date the member first entered military service. Group A includes those who entered the service before January 1, 2018, while Group B includes those who entered after that date.

Active duty families don’t pay annual enrollment fees for Tricare Prime or Tricare Select, but retirees do, and they will see increases next year. Group A retirees enrolled in Tricare Select will see their annual enrollment fee increase from $364.92 to $375 for a family and from $181.92 to $186.96 for an individual.

If you’re a military retiree or a beneficiary who’s hit the age of 65 and probably looking ahead to healthcare options, TRICARE For Life (TFL) might already be on your radar. But what exactly is it, and why should you care? TRICARE For Life acts as a secondary payer to Medicare, meaning it helps cover costs that Medicare doesn’t, like copayments and deductibles. This combination can make a huge difference in out-of-pocket expenses for veterans and their families.

So, who qualifies for TRICARE For Life? Typically, it’s available to Medicare-eligible military retirees, their spouses, survivors, and certain former spouses. The key condition is enrollment in both Medicare Part A and Part B. If you haven’t signed up for Medicare Part B yet, well, you’ll want to get on that fast — it is essential.

Qualifying for this program opens up a lifetime of enhanced healthcare coverage and peace of mind. According to the official TRICARE For Life site, this benefit helps thousands of military families every year, easing the transition into Medicare while keeping healthcare costs manageable. Not to mention, you get access to a nationwide network of providers familiar with military health.

Step-by-Step Application Process: From Gathering Documents to Submission

Applying for TRICARE For Life might seem daunting at first glance, but trust me, once you break it down, it’s straightforward. Here’s a simple walkthrough that’ll have you covered in no time.

Step 1: Check Your Eligibility

Before anything else, make sure you’re enrolled in both Medicare Part A and Part B. TFL works as a supplement to these Medicare parts, so without them, you’re out of luck. Your status as a military retiree, spouse, or survivor should be well-documented from your military service records.

Step 2: Gather Required Documents

Copy of your Medicare card

Military identification and retiree documents

Social Security Number

Proof of residency

Having all these handy ensures a smooth process and speeds up verification.

Step 3: Submit Your Application

The easiest way is through the official TRICARE enrollment portal. Alternatively, you can mail in a paper application, but online is faster and less prone to mishaps. Keep an eye on confirmation emails and save copies of everything you submit.

Step 4: Wait for Approval and Card Issuance

After submission, your application typically processes within a few weeks. You’ll receive a TRICARE For Life card, which you’ll need to present when getting healthcare services.

This video breaks down how Medicare coordinates with TRICARE For Life, providing clear visuals on how and when each part kicks in — a great watch if you want to see the mechanics in action.

Common Pitfalls to Avoid When Applying for TRICARE For Life

Even with a clear guide, some usual headaches can trip up applicants. Here’s what to watch out for to dodge frustrating delays or denials.

Skipping Medicare Part B: Not enrolling in Medicare Part B on time is the quickest way to miss out. TRICARE For Life strictly requires both Medicare Parts A and B.

Incomplete or Incorrect Documentation: Forgetting to include your Medicare card copy or submitting outdated military paperwork can stall your application. Double-check documents before sending.

Missing Deadlines: Keep deadlines in mind for enrolling without penalties. Late Part B enrollment might mean higher premiums and coverage gaps.

Assuming Automatic Enrollment: TRICARE For Life does NOT enroll you automatically when you hit 65 or retire — you need to apply actively.

Paying attention to these details can save you months of hassle.

How to Maximize Your TRICARE For Life Benefits: Insider Tips

Now, onto the fun part: getting the most bang for your healthcare buck with TRICARE For Life. The program is generous but knowing how to navigate its quirks can stretch your benefits further.

Use Medicare-Participating Providers

To avoid surprises, pick providers who accept Medicare assignment. These professionals bill Medicare directly, which means your TRICARE benefits kick in without extra fuss.

Understand When TRICARE Covers Costs

Since TRICARE For Life is secondary payer coverage, it pays after Medicare processes claims. Knowing this helps you anticipate when to file claims or expect bills.

Enroll in Extra Programs

Depending on your health needs, pairing TRICARE with additional programs like the Extra or Standard TRICARE plans can be helpful, especially for services Medicare might not cover fully.

Keep Documentation Updated

Always keep your personal information and Medicare status current with TRICARE to prevent mix-ups in eligibility or billing.

According to My Army Benefits, leveraging both Medicare and TRICARE coverage efficiently is a top strategy for retirees, ensuring fewer out-of-pocket expenses and better healthcare experiences.

Real-Life User Scenarios: Navigating TRICARE For Life in Different Situations

The best way to understand TRICARE For Life might just be through stories from those who live it daily.

Scenario 1: The Newly Retired Veteran

Imagine Jim, who just retired from active duty at 65. He quickly signed up for Medicare Parts A and B and then applied for TRICARE For Life. During his annual checkup, Jim found that the doctor accepted Medicare assignment. Medicare paid first, then TFL covered the rest, leaving Jim with almost no copay. That saved him hundreds annually compared to his previous insurance.

Scenario 2: The Survivor Spouse Handling Paperwork

Linda, a widow of a veteran, struggled initially with getting her paperwork right after her spouse’s passing. She missed a deadline for Part B enrollment, which complicated her benefits temporarily. But after working closely with TRICARE’s support, she got her application approved and learned how to track deadlines going forward.

Scenario 3: Managing Care Overseas

Then there’s Paul, who lives abroad but qualifies for TFL. He discovered that understanding TRICARE’s overseas coverage rules was key to reducing surprises in billing and finding care options that accepted this coverage.

Pentagon data shows nearly 10% of service members cannot be deployed due to dental issues

Department of Health and Human Services did not consult with the military before announcing intention to direct CDC to stop recommending fluoridation of drinking water

Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) released new data from the Department of Defense (DoD) revealing the impact of dental emergencies on military readiness. The new data also makes clear that Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s reported plan to direct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to stop recommending water fluoridation may lead to a substantial rise in dental decay for service members and their families. Senator Warren first pressed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth about this concern in May 2025.

The Pentagon’s responses revealed:

Dental emergencies account for 20-30 percent of all Disease Non-Battle Injuries among deployed service members;

Dental issues leave nearly 10 percent of service members “not medically ready to deploy;”

The military was not consulted by HHS or Secretary Kennedy on the plan to direct the CDC to stop recommending water fluoridation;

Fluoridation has contributed to improved dental readiness across the military; and

Removing fluoridation would likely lead to increased rates of dental decay.

“Our military is already falling short on delivering high quality dental care for our service members, and Secretary Kennedy’s fluoride crusade is threatening to worsen this crisis and hurt our military’s ability to deploy where they’re needed,” said Senator Warren. “Our government should be focused on improving dental health access for our service members, not pushing anti-science conspiracies. I’m going to continue holding Secretary Kennedy accountable for his disastrous policies.”

In 2011, the Department of Defense found that “dental decay continues to be a major problem for military personnel and is a significant reason for personnel to be classified as non-deployable.” President Trump’s Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness recently told Senator Warren that, “dental health issues are often the largest cause of non-deployability within a military unit.” Until now, the extent of the burden of dental issues on military readiness was not known.

In response to the Pentagon’s findings, Air Force Chief of Staff General Kenneth Wilsbach said, “[B]enefits of optimally fluoridated drinking water have been proven repeatedly…The Air Force Surgeon General supports maintaining fluoridated water systems in accordance with the 2013 DoW policy and the AF dental community strongly advocates to continue the policy of optimally fluoridated water on DoW installations.”

Senator Warren has led work to improve servicemembers’ access to health care:

In May 2025, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass), ranking member of the Personnel subcommittee for the Senate Armed Services Committee, pressed Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on the harmful impact that Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kennedy’s work to remove fluoride from drinking water would have on our military readiness.

In December 2024, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) sent a letter to Acting Under Secretary Vazirani raising continued concerns about the Department of Defense’s (DoD) failure to prevent price gouging and overpayments in the military’s TRICARE health program.

In June 2024, Senators Elizabeth Warren, Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), U.S. Representative Buddy Carter (R-Ga.), and 20 other lawmakers sent a letter to Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Dr. Lester Martinez-Lopez and Director of the Defense Health Agency (DHA) Lieutenant General Telita Crosland, raising concerns over Express Scripts’ exclusive contract to administer TRICARE’s pharmacy program, the healthcare system for the military, retirees, and their families.

In July 2023, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren chaired a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Personnel. She called out the Department of Defense (DoD) for wasting billions in taxpayers dollars due to price gouging by defense contractors for services and in health care, and identified opportunities for cost savings when DoD buys personnel-related goods and services.

In July 2023, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III and Director of the Defense Health Agency (DHA), Lieutenant General Telita Crosland, regarding a series of DoD Inspector General (IG) reports finding that the Department of Defense (DoD) is failing to prevent price gouging and overpayments to contractors in the TRICARE health program.

On March 2, 2022, Senator Warren and her colleagues called out drug manufacturers for squeezing American families with rapid and widespread price hikes on prescription drugs.

In February 2022, at a hearing, Senator Warren called out corporations for abusing their market power to raise consumer prices and boost profits.

In May 2020, Senator Warren wrote to the Department requesting clarification on how the Department would prevent profiteering following a recent change to increase payments to contractors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In March 2020, Senator Warren joined her colleagues in urging the FTC to use its full authority to prevent abusive price gouging on consumer health products during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Tricare open enrollment season, when members may change their health insurance coverage for the upcoming year, runs from Nov. 10 to Dec. 9.

The current costs for the Tricare Dental Program will last through February 2026.

Tricare Groups

Costs depend on which Tricare ""group"" members belong to, determined by the date the service member first entered the military. Group A consists of those who entered service before Jan. 1, 2018, while Group B includes those who entered after that date.

Enrollment Fees

Active-duty families pay no annual enrollment fees for either Tricare Prime or Tricare Select, but retirees do, and they’ll see increases in the upcoming year.

Group A retirees enrolled in Tricare Select will see their annual enrollment fee increase from $364.92 to $375 for a family and from $181.92 to $186.96 for an individual. Group A retirees using Tricare Prime will see the enrollment fee for a family plan increase from $744 to $765, while an individual's costs will go from $372 to $381.96 annually.

Retirees in Tricare Group B will see similar increases. The annual enrollment fee for the Prime family plan will rise from $900.96 to $927.00, while the individual plan will go from $450 to $462.96. Enrollment fees for Tricare Select will increase from $1,158.96 to $1,191 for a family and from $579 to $594.96 for an individual.

Deductibles

Annual deductibles -- the amount those using Tricare Select must pay out of pocket before Tricare makes any payments -- will also increase in 2026. Members using Tricare Prime don't pay deductibles.

Group A active-duty family members and retirees will see no changes to the deductible amount.

But a military member with the rank of E-4 or below in Group B will see their family deductible increase from $128 to $132, while families with sponsors E-5 and above in Group B will see their deductible rise from $386 to $397.

Individual military members in Group B will also see their deductibles rise in 2026, from $64 to $66 for E-4 and below, and from $193 to $198 for E-5 and above.

Copayments

Many copayments will also go up in the upcoming year. The cost of a primary care visit for active-duty Tricare Select users with a family in Group A will go from $27 to $28 in 2026, while the primary care copay for Group B family members will stay at $19.

Retirees using Tricare Select will see a primary care visit go from $37 to $38 in Group A and from $32 to $33 in Group B. Those using Tricare Prime will pay $26 for a primary care visit, up from $25.

Premiums

Some Tricare plans are premium-based, and those monthly premiums are going up in 2026.

For reservists, the premiums for Tricare Reserve Select will go from $53.80 per month to $57.88 per month for an individual member and from $274.48 to $286.66 for a family, increases of 7.6% and 4.4% respectively.

Tricare Retired Reserve premiums will increase from $631.26 to $645.90 for an individual, and from $1,513.04 to $1,548.30 for a family.

Premiums for the Tricare Young Adult Program for members' dependents ages 21 to 26 will go from $727 a month to $794 for Prime coverage, a 9.2% increase; and from $337 to $363 for Select, up 7.7%

Catastrophic Cap

The catastrophic cap is Tricare beneficiaries' maximum out-of-pocket cost for all health care provided each year. It limits beneficiaries' liability in the case of a serious illness or injury. Once a beneficiary has hit the cap through copayments or pharmacy charges during the year, Tricare will pay the rest in full.

Group A retirees using Tricare Select will see this cap increase in 2026 from $4,261 to $4,381; and for retirees in Group B, it will go up from $4,509 to $4,635.

While the cap for active-duty family members in Group A who have either Tricare Select or Tricare Prime will remain the same at $1,000 annually, those in Group B will see it increase from $1,288 to $1,324.

To compare plans, start with three easy tools: the TRICARE Plan Finder to see your eligibility, the Compare Plans Tool to review benefits side-by-side, and your 2025 cost information to understand expected expenses. If you’re also considering dental or vision coverage, remember that these come through FEDVIP during Federal Benefits Open Season, which ends one day earlier—Dec. 8.

The CY 2026 monthly premiums for TRICARE Reserve Select, TRICARE Retired Reserve, and TRICARE Young Adult and the quarterly premiums for Continued Health Care Benefit Program will be posted to the tricare.mil/changes web page once announced.

Some TRICARE premiums and copayments will increase in 2026, with pharmacy copayments rising for most US Family Health Plan members.

Check your specific plan: Review your individual plan details for the most accurate information on any potential increases or changes to your monthly premiums or copayments.

Compare plans: Use the BENEFEDS plan comparison tool to compare 2025 and 2026 pricing for your dental and vision plans to make an informed decision about whether to change plans or stay with your current one.

What’s New for TRICARE in 2026

Serving in the Air Force and Army, Dr. Johannigman became one of the nation's most respected trauma surgeons, educators, and medical innovators.

His career has been defined by courage, compassion, and relentless dedication to saving lives. He completed eight combat tours in the Middle East, serving as a trauma surgeon at the Craig Joint Theater Hospital in Bagram, Afghanistan, and as a contracted trauma surgeon at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas.

Dr. Johannigman was instrumental in establishing the Critical Care Air Transportation Team (CCATT) concept, which provides in-flight critical care for wounded service members. Under his leadership, the program achieved a 99 percent survival rate for patients transported from combat zones, setting a global standard for military medicine.

He served as Director of Trauma and Critical Care (IMA to the Department of Defense Health Affairs) and as a liaison to the USAF Center for the Sustainment of Trauma and Readiness Skills (C-STARS) program, where he trained hundreds of physicians, nurses, and medics in advanced trauma systems. Over his career, he authored more than 100 peer-reviewed papers that advanced trauma and critical care protocols worldwide.

Dr. Johannigman's service has been recognized with numerous honors, including the Legion of Merit (2022, Afghanistan deployment), the Bronze Star Medal for combat valor, the Meritorious Service Medal (multiple), the Army Commendation Medal, and the Lifetime Career Achievement Award from the Military Health System Research Symposium in 2015.

Reflecting on his years of service, Dr. Johannigman said, ""Forty-six years of service do not come without sacrifice. There are the obvious ones that come with deployments and witnessing the worst moments of war. But there are also the quiet sacrifices, the ones you carry alone with strength and resolve. You endure them without complaint because the mission and the people you serve are worth it. Service is both a burden and a privilege, and I would choose it again.""

As he transitions into retirement, Dr. Johannigman returns to Cincinnati, Ohio, where his civilian career and teaching legacy continue. The systems he helped build, the colleagues he mentored, and the lives he saved stand as a testament to his lifelong service.

About Dr. Jay Johannigman

Dr. Jay Johannigman, M.D., Colonel (Ret.), served 46 years in the United States Air Force and Army. A trauma and critical care surgeon, he has held leadership positions across military and civilian hospitals and continues to contribute to trauma medicine and education in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Al-Haq’s case, filed on behalf of the Palestinian population in Gaza and the occupied territories, focused solely on exports from the Netherlands to Israel and Dutch commercial ties with settlements.
The proceedings did not concern Dutch imports of Israeli-made weapons or goods from settlements.
The court noted that the Dutch State has already taken several steps, including denying export licenses for military goods if there is a risk they could be used in Gaza.
Aside from that ruling, the court said it did not take into account any developments that occurred after September 3.","The Dutch government is not legally obligated to impose further measures against Israel over its military actions in Gaza or its settlement policy in the occupied Palestinian territories, The Hague Court of Appeal ruled on Thursday.

The ruling came after the Palestinian human rights organization Al-Haq, joined by nine other advocacy groups, appealed to force the Netherlands to act more decisively to prevent what they describe as genocide and serious human rights violations by Israel in Gaza. Al-Haq’s case, filed on behalf of the Palestinian population in Gaza and the occupied territories, focused solely on exports from the Netherlands to Israel and Dutch commercial ties with settlements. The proceedings did not concern Dutch imports of Israeli-made weapons or goods from settlements.

The organizations demanded that the State immediately halt the export of military goods and trained dogs to Israel and take action against Dutch companies engaged in trade with businesses operating in illegal Israeli settlements. They argued that the Netherlands is not only morally but also legally bound under the Genocide Convention to prevent such atrocities.

The Hague Court of Appeal rejected those demands, stating that while it is “plausible that there is a risk of genocide and serious human rights violations,” it is not for the judiciary to dictate which specific measures the government must take in matters of foreign policy.

The court noted that the Dutch State has already taken several steps, including denying export licenses for military goods if there is a risk they could be used in Gaza. “The court must exercise restraint in assessing political decisions,” the ruling said.

Al-Haq also sought to ban the export of trained dogs that could allegedly be used by the Israeli Defense Forces to attack Palestinians. The State denied that claim, and the government’s attorney argued that such dogs are not classified as “dual-use goods,” meaning they cannot be restricted under existing export laws. According to the court, introducing such a ban would require a legislative change, which the judiciary is not authorized to order.

The court further found no sufficient grounds to compel the government to act against Dutch companies trading with entities in illegal settlements, saying there is no evidence that the current discouragement policy is ineffective.

The government’s lawyer also pointed out that other actions have already been taken, including entry bans for two far-right Israeli ministers. The plaintiffs dismissed those measures as “too little too late,” arguing they fail to meet the Netherlands’ international obligations.

The oral hearing took place on September 3, 2025. The court also considered the Supreme Court’s October 3, 2025, decision in the separate “F-35 case,” which involved the export of F-35 fighter jet components to Israel. Aside from that ruling, the court said it did not take into account any developments that occurred after September 3.

The court’s decision leaves in place the State’s current policy, which restricts certain military exports and discourages trade with settlements but stops short of a full embargo or legislative changes sought by the activists.",https://nltimes.nl/sites/nltimes.nl/files/styles/news_article_full_desktop_2x/public/2025-11/Gaza_war_2023_-_2025_IMG_5406.jpg?h=eaab21c9,N,0.0,2025-11-06 20:00:15.390266

Learn how to get your TRICARE-covered flu vaccine today.

When is the best time to get vaccinated?

Generally, September and October are the best months to get the flu vaccine. Getting it too early can limit the effectiveness of the vaccine. However, getting the vaccine later in the flu season still has benefits, since the virus will still be circulating. Flu season usually peaks in February and can continue into May.

According to the CDC, there are some populations who are at higher risk for having complications from the flu. It’s especially important for people in these groups to get the flu vaccine. This group includes:

People aged 65 and older

People with certain chronic medical conditions

Pregnant women

Children younger than 5 years old (and especially children under 2)

Additionally, if you’re a health care worker or live with populations who are at high risk for flu complications, it’s important to get vaccinated.

What version of the vaccine should I get?

There are many different versions of the flu vaccine. Which one you should get depends on your age, health conditions, and preferences. Consult with your provider to determine which version of the vaccine is best for you.

Where can I get vaccinated?

There are three ways you can get these vaccines at no cost, as described in the TRICARE Pharmacy Program Handbook:

Go to a military hospital or clinic.

Go to a TRICARE retail network pharmacy. Make sure the person who gives you the vaccine is a pharmacist. If another type of provider (like a doctor or nurse practitioner) gives you a vaccine at a participating pharmacy, you may have out-of-pocket costs.

See a TRICARE-authorized provider. However, if you get other services at the same time, you may have to pay copayments or cost-shares. These costs vary based on your health plan.

Note: Before getting the vaccine, call to check if you need an appointment and if the vaccine is available. Remember to bring your Uniformed Services ID card.

Recognizing flu symptoms

The most common flu symptoms include:

Fever

Cough

Sore throat

Runny or stuffy nose

Body aches

Tiredness

You can have the flu before symptoms appear, so getting vaccinated can help prevent you from getting the most prominent strains of the influenza virus. Even if you do get sick, the symptoms may be less severe if you’ve received a flu vaccine.

Other steps to prevent spreading the flu include:

Avoiding close contact with people who are sick

Covering coughs and sneezes

Washing your hands often

Avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth

If you do get sick, it’s important to stay home until you’ve been fever-free for 24 hours and your symptoms are improving.

Talk to your provider if you have questions about vaccines. For more information on TRICARE’s vaccine coverage, check out Immunizations.

Air Force Master Sgt. Jason and Latoya Singleton arrived at Yokota four years ago with their son, Jasir, who is on the autism spectrum.

They quickly learned how difficult navigating the Exceptional Family Member Program can be overseas, Latoya Singleton told Stars and Stripes on Sept. 17 at Yokota’s Yujo Community Center. Therapies were limited and providers often didn’t accept Tricare, the Defense Department health insurance plan for military families.

The Singletons pieced together therapies in Tokyo, often paying out of pocket. Over time, they became the “go-to” family for others seeking guidance, she said.

“We were literally paying everything out of pocket for all his therapies,” she said. “Eventually, therapists started referring new families to us and saying, ‘This is the family you want to talk to.’”

This spring, Singleton created Yokota Thrives, a network of nearly 50 families that share resources and push for inclusive base events.

“I wanted to open up a community where people could feel safe,” she said. “There’s still a stigma in the military, especially overseas, that if your child has autism you’ll automatically get sent back. That’s not true. There are a lot of kids here, and they still need resources.”

Kristi Forbes, a registered nurse at Yokota Middle School, said her son has non-verbal learning disability, a new diagnosis not officially on the autism spectrum. She often seeks advice on Yokota Thrives’ Facebook page.

“The group has been very helpful because even though it’s not the same diagnosis that most of the parents are dealing with, there’s a lot of similarities,” she said by phone on Sept. 19.

In the first Defense Department survey across the EFMP between November 2022 and March 2023, only 43% of enrolled members said their families’ needs were “largely met,” while 17% reported they weren’t met at all.

For parents overseas, the hurdles multiply.

“When we first got here, [Applied Behavior Analysis] therapy wasn’t available at all,” Singleton said. “We were driving an hour and a half into Tokyo and paying out of pocket. Now there’s a provider that takes Tricare, so that’s a big improvement.”

Yokota Thrives is pushing for sensory-friendly hours at the library and swimming pool, adjusted lighting at events and better advertisement of EFMP programs, she said. During a July 24 spouses’ luncheon with 374th Airlift Wing commander Col. Richard McElhaney, Singleton discussed her ideas with him and other leaders.

“I talked to them about it, and they were like, ‘You know, that’s a good idea. You know, this is something that we should look into.’”

Later, she met with the Force Support Squadron and EFMP representatives to discuss her overall vision.

“They told me, ‘Our spaces are already EFMP-friendly,’” she said. “But just because the physical space is there doesn’t mean the social aspect works for our kids.”

The USO, for example, gave Yokota Thrives the first hour of its Aug. 20 Summer Splash as a sensory-friendly option. Neurodivergent children played outside with bubble makers and water guns or painted and customized shirts.

“USO cares about all military families,” USO event coordinator Amber Laughton told Stars and Stripes on Sept. 19. “We try our best to do whatever we can do to create that inclusive space and environment.

The Singletons expect Yokota Thrives to continue thriving after they depart Yokota in March.

“Even if there are no events, I want it to continue to be a safe space. A place where you can go for resources,” Latoya Singleton said. “The biggest thing is inclusion, not just existing.”",https://www.stripes.com/incoming/57qnx1-071125yokota-thrivesphoto01.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/071125YOKOTA-THRIVESphoto01.jpg,N,0.0,2025-11-06 09:00:38.933279

For military couples, a legal marriage isn’t just about love — it’s about security, stability, and access to benefits that protect both spouses. Health care through TRICARE, housing through BAH (Basic Allowance for Housing), and family recognition through DEERS (Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System) are all tied directly to your marital status.

But not all marriages are recognized equally by the U.S. military.

While Utah’s online marriage system has made headlines for being fast and fully virtual, many service members are finding out too late that a virtual ceremony doesn’t automatically qualify for military benefits.

This guide explains why, under Department of Defense policy, Utah’s online marriages can cause delays or denials in DEERS, TRICARE, and BAH — and why Get Married Today in California offers the only guaranteed path to full and immediate recognition.

⚖️ What Is a Utah Online Marriage?

Utah County allows couples to get married entirely online — no travel required. You can apply for a license and have an officiant marry you via video conference. It’s quick, affordable, and legally valid under U.S. state law.

For civilian couples, this is often a convenient option. The certificate is valid for name changes, taxes, and even immigration.

However, the military follows a separate recognition standard, and that’s where problems begin.

🪖 The Military’s Legal Standard for Recognizing Marriages

According to DoD Instruction 1000.25 and 1341.2, the military will only recognize a marriage if it is legally valid in the jurisdiction where it took place and both parties were physically present at the ceremony.

Proxy or virtual marriages — even if legal under state law — require proof of consummation before they’re recognized for:

DEERS enrollment

TRICARE health coverage

BAH payments

Military ID card issuance

Overseas dependent sponsorship

This means that a marriage performed online, where neither spouse was physically together, isn’t valid for benefits until consummation occurs and can be proven.

⚠️ Real-World Consequences for Service Members

Many service members discover these rules only after applying for benefits:

TRICARE Denials: The spouse isn’t added to the system until physical presence is proven.

Delayed BAH: Payments are withheld because the marriage is under review.

Command Issues: Units may require additional affidavits or proof.

Stress and Financial Strain: Couples lose months of housing pay and coverage.

For couples preparing for deployment, these delays can create serious hardship.

💒 The California Advantage — In-Person Marriage with Get Married Today

In California, Get Married Today performs fully legal, in-person marriages that meet every DoD requirement for immediate recognition.

When both spouses are physically present, the marriage certificate is automatically valid for:

DEERS Enrollment

TRICARE Activation

BAH and Dependent Pay

SGLI Beneficiary Updates

Command Recognition and Housing Access

You walk away the same day with proof of marriage — ready to update your records on base without delay.

⚡ How Get Married Today Simplifies the Entire Process

Instant Marriage License: Issued on-site by a California Deputy Commissioner of Civil Marriages.

Same-Day Legal Ceremony: In-person and compliant with DoD rules.

Immediate Proof: You leave with documentation to enroll your spouse in DEERS.

Certified Copies: Ready for TRICARE and finance offices within days.

Apostille Option: For overseas commands or foreign spouses.

This process ensures zero risk of rejection or benefit delays.

✈️ Why This Matters for Deployed or Stationed Military Members

If you’re preparing for deployment, you don’t have time for administrative delays. A Utah online marriage may require weeks of review and additional proof, while a California in-person marriage is recognized instantly.

That means your spouse’s healthcare, housing, and dependent status are secured before you leave.

📜 Department of Defense Policies Explained

Key DoD References:

DoDI 1000.25 – Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS)

DoDI 1341.2 – BAH and Dependent Pay Policies

These instructions state that a marriage must be legally valid under state law and involve physical presence. The requirement exists to prevent fraud and ensure documentation integrity across all branches.

🧭 Comparison Chart

🌍 Common Scenarios

Scenario 1: Overseas Military Member

A deployed service member marries online through Utah but can’t add their spouse to DEERS until returning home — months later.

Scenario 2: Active-Duty Couple in California

They complete their marriage through Get Married Today in person. They submit proof to DEERS the next morning — benefits start within 72 hours.

Scenario 3: Mixed Nationality Couple

A U.S. service member and foreign partner marry with Get Married Today and apostille the certificate the same day for use abroad.

For active-duty and reserve military members, marriage isn’t only a personal commitment — it’s the key to unlocking essential protections and benefits. From TRICARE health coverage to Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH), DEERS registration, and SGLI spousal coverage, everything begins once your marriage is recognized by the Department of Defense (DoD).

However, not all marriages are recognized equally.

While Utah’s online marriage system has become a popular way to marry remotely, the DoD does not automatically accept virtual ceremonies where one or both spouses are not physically present.

If you want your marriage to be instantly valid for military benefits, the safest, fastest, and most reliable choice is a same-day, in-person legal marriage in California through Get Married Today.

🪖 Why Military Recognition Is So Important

Military benefits are only activated once your marriage is recorded in DEERS (Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System). That enrollment allows:

TRICARE healthcare to start

BAH payments to increase

Base housing and dependent privileges

Spousal ID card issuance

Access to family support programs

If your marriage is not recognized — which can happen with online or proxy ceremonies — all these benefits are delayed or denied until you provide proof that the marriage is consummated.

⚖️ Utah Online Marriage vs. DoD Recognition

Utah’s system allows couples to apply online and hold a video ceremony anywhere in the world. While legal under state law, it does not satisfy the DoD’s physical presence rule.

The Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 1000.25 explicitly states that, for DEERS and benefits eligibility:

“Both parties must be physically present at the ceremony, or the marriage must be consummated after the ceremony to be recognized.”

That means:

If you marry online and haven’t physically met afterward, your marriage will not count for DEERS or TRICARE.

Proof of consummation must be provided (travel records, photos, affidavits, etc.) before benefits begin.

For service members about to deploy, this can be a serious setback.

✅ The California Advantage: Same-Day Recognition

When you get married through Get Married Today, you meet every federal and military requirement instantly.

California marriages are performed in person, ensuring:

Physical presence is verified and certified.

DEERS acceptance is automatic.

TRICARE coverage starts immediately after enrollment.

BAH and dependent pay are activated the same pay cycle.

SGLI and command records can be updated instantly.

You leave legally married with all the documents you need to prove your status that same day.

⚡ How Get Married Today Works

Marriage License Issued Immediately No need to visit the county clerk — Get Married Today issues your legal license on-site under California Family Code §359.

In-Person Ceremony The officiant performs a legal ceremony with both spouses physically present, satisfying all DoD standards.

Legal Filing and Proof of Marriage You receive same-day documentation to enroll your spouse in DEERS and activate benefits.

Certified Copies and Apostilles Fast options for overseas or international spouses are available through Orange County Apostille.

Guaranteed DoD Recognition Your marriage is valid immediately across all branches — Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, and Space Force.

✈️ For Military Members in a Hurry

Get Married Today is ideal for:

Deployment preparation — secure benefits before leaving.

Leave periods — get legally married while you’re home.

Overseas assignments — apostille certificates available for use abroad.

Dual-national couples — fast recognition for immigration and command sponsorship.

In as little as one hour, you can walk away married, recognized, and fully eligible for military benefits.

🕊️ The Cost of Waiting with Online or Proxy Marriages

Online marriages often create administrative confusion, delayed payments, and denied benefits. California marriages eliminate all those risks.

📘 Legal References Supporting California Marriages

California Family Code §359–360: Authorizes Deputy Commissioners to issue and solemnize marriages.

DoDI 1000.25: Establishes DEERS eligibility and physical presence standards.

DoDI 1341.2: Details dependent benefit eligibility and pay.

TRICARE Policy Manual: Recognizes lawful state marriages for immediate enrollment.

U.S. Department of State: Accepts California marriage certificates for international and federal use.

🪖 Real Case Example

A U.S. Army soldier stationed at Fort Irwin married online via Utah. When he tried to add his spouse to DEERS, the application was held for “proof of consummation.” His spouse couldn’t get TRICARE for nearly two months.

A fellow service member completed a same-day, in-person marriage through Get Married Today in California and enrolled his spouse in DEERS the next day — benefits were active by the end of the week.

The difference? Physical presence.

🌎 Benefits of Apostilled California Marriage Certificates

If you or your spouse are abroad, Get Married Today can provide a California-issued marriage certificate apostilled through Orange County Apostille, ensuring validity in over 120 countries under The Hague Convention.

This is essential for:

Overseas command sponsorship

Spousal visas

Residency and embassy registration

📊 Step-by-Step for Military Benefit Activation

Get legally married in person through Get Married Today.

Receive your official California marriage certificate.

Visit your base DEERS/Personnel Office.

Provide the certificate and both IDs.

Add your spouse to DEERS.

Wait 2–5 business days for TRICARE to activate.

Notify DFAS for BAH and dependent pay adjustment.

The good news? The TRICARE Dental Program covers emergency dental care, as noted in the TRICARE Dental Program Handbook. You’ll pay no cost-share for emergency dental services, no matter your pay grade or location.

“In any emergency, it’s important to act quickly,” said Douglas Elsesser, a program analyst with the Dental Program Branch of the TRICARE Health Plan at the Defense Health Agency. “With a bit of preparation and knowledge, you can do your best to keep any damage to a minimum.”

Keep reading to learn how to prepare for dental emergencies and what to do when they happen.

What is a dental emergency?

A dental emergency requires immediate attention. You need emergency care if you have:

Bleeding that won’t stop

Pain that doesn’t get better with medication

Broken facial bones

Painful swelling in or around your mouth

Gum infection with pain or swelling

Knocked out or broken tooth

How to prepare

Keep your dentist’s contact information with you at all times. Many dentists have emergency numbers you can call after business hours.

Build a dental emergency kit with these items:

Cotton balls and swabs

Dental floss

Dental mirror

Latex or vinyl gloves

Salt

Cold compress

What to do

Call your dentist first. This is the most important step in any dental emergency. If you don’t have a dentist, use the Find a Dentist tool or go to an urgent care center or emergency room.

For severe tooth pain

Rinse your mouth with warm water.

Use dental floss to remove any stuck food.

Apply a cold compress to the outside of your mouth if you have swelling.

Take over-the-counter pain relievers.

For a cracked or broken tooth

Save any broken pieces and rinse them.

Rinse your mouth with warm water.

Apply gauze to bleeding areas for 10 minutes.

Use a cold compress on the outside of your mouth to reduce pain and swelling.

For a knocked-out tooth

Find the tooth and hold it by the crown.

Rinse the root gently with water.

Try to put the tooth back in its socket if possible.

If you can’t put it back, place it in a small container of milk or salt water.

See your dentist within one hour for the best chance of saving the tooth.

For mouth bleeding

Rinse with mild salt water.

Press a damp gauze on the bleeding spot for 15-20 minutes.

Hold a cold compress on the outside of your mouth for 5-10 minutes.

If bleeding persists, go to the emergency room immediately.

When it’s not an emergency

Some dental problems can wait for a regular appointment:

Mild toothache

Small chip or crack

Broken braces (unless bleeding)

Something stuck between teeth

Minor cuts or sores

If you seek emergency dental care, but your dentist determines it’s not an emergency, you’ll pay the cost-shares for the care you receive.

For these issues, call your dentist to schedule an appointment during normal hours.

Emergency room or dentist?

For most dental emergencies like broken or knocked-out teeth, your dentist will treat you in his or her office. Go to the emergency room for serious injuries like broken facial bones.

Emergency rooms can give you pain medication and antibiotics, but they don’t do dental work like fillings or crowns. You’ll still need to see your dentist as soon as possible.

Dental emergencies need quick action. The faster you get help, the better your chances of saving your teeth and avoiding additional problems later. Remember:

Call your dentist.

Follow first aid steps until you can get professional care.

Don’t wait, prompt treatment prevents infection and tooth loss.
