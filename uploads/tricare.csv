Tanya Johnson, Defense Health Agency’s senior enlisted leader, said to a roomful of airmen who were attending the Frontline Supervisors Course at Malcolm Grow Medical Clinics and Surgery Center in Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, Sept. 30.
We must be able to rely on our frontline supervisors to make informed judgments, respond to crises under pressure, and carry out their objectives.
If you're upbeat, you're positive — that’s how your team will behave.” She stressed that U.S. Air Force medical personnel need these vital skills both in battle and in their dedication of warfighter care.
“Air Force medicine exists to project the lethality of the United States Air Force … we must be able to shoot, move, communicate — then medicate.”","“Make your career, your career,” Air Force Chief Master Sgt. Tanya Johnson, Defense Health Agency’s senior enlisted leader, said to a roomful of airmen who were attending the Frontline Supervisors Course at Malcolm Grow Medical Clinics and Surgery Center in Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, Sept. 30.

Johnson participated in a panel of senior enlisted leaders and field-grade officers at the day-long course — attended by top enlisted personnel and officers — to provide leadership advice and answer questions. Course topics throughout the day included administrative writing, supervising civilians, manpower management, standards and discipline, building culture, caring for your people, and additional leadership skills.

Stressing the importance of making supervisors’ leadership journey their own, Johnson said, “If you focus on you, what you want out of your experience, you'll be OK … I'm human too, and we're all walking through this together.”

Training course ensures mission readiness of medical personnel

U.S. Air Force leadership emphasized training such as the Frontline Supervisors Course helps to address potential knowledge gaps across leaders in the military.

“We noticed for frontline supervisors, there were certain things that we expect people to know at a specific rank that a lot of times they didn’t know or had not had the training or exposure to,” said Air Force Master Sgt. Chelsie Evangelista, dental flight chief, Bolling Medical Squadron, Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in Washington, D.C.

Evangelista said ongoing training “isn’t just about checking a box — it’s about staying ready for whatever comes next. We must be able to rely on our frontline supervisors to make informed judgments, respond to crises under pressure, and carry out their objectives. You can’t expect anyone to do well if they don’t have solid foundational and continuous training that reinforces their capabilities and resilience.”

The day also included opportunities to learn from a variety of senior leaders who provided guidance and perspective into their journey at the helm of military health care.

“Our frontline supervisors occupy different lanes and accomplish our mission; it's important that we can have a united front and take pride in our roles as medics, making sure that people are upholding the standards, and then having the necessary tools to be successful,” said Evangelista. “We designed this course to be able to strengthen those capabilities for our frontline supervisors.”

Air Force Senior Airman Isamar Garcia, a mental health technician at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, Washington, D.C., said she participated in the course “to prep me for going into that staff sergeant position in the future, and then hopefully leading my flight.”

“Air Force culture is to lead by example, and I hope to follow that tradition,” said Garcia. “Starting as a young airman in leadership positions, we’re trying to raise ready and capable airmen. We're getting ready for the future.”

Continued knowledge sharing and education, Evangelista said, is critical to mission success.

“Mission begins with readiness, and readiness begins with us. Ongoing training isn’t just a professional responsibility; it’s a strategic imperative. The future of health care leadership hinges on our commitment to lifelong learning.”

Positivity and teamwork at the foundation of Johnson’s leadership

With more than 30 years of military service, Johnson provided anecdotes and leadership advice to those senior leaders and frontline supervisors in attendance.

“Today is a good day to have a good day — that’s how I want you to walk in the door every day,” she said to course participants.

She also emphasized the importance of not only having a team behind you, but one that you can trust. “Having that person who can tell you to take a knee or say those uncomfortable things to you when it begins to get a little too personal” is key to success, she added.

“Manage your expectations,” Johnson said. “Just because someone doesn’t do something one way doesn't mean it is wrong. It is just a different way.”

True leaders recognize that they, too, can continue learning, she stressed.

“Knowledge is another essential element to being an effective leader,” Johnson said. “I have a homework folder where if I hear something that I didn't understand what it was, or I don't know something about it — I will.”

Attitude can make or destroy a team’s morale, she added. “The tone of your flight and your organization is heavily dependent on your attitude. If you’re saying something against leadership or policy, that tone will be the tone of your flight or your department. If you're upbeat, you're positive — that’s how your team will behave.”

She stressed that U.S. Air Force medical personnel need these vital skills both in battle and in their dedication of warfighter care. “Air Force medicine exists to project the lethality of the United States Air Force … we must be able to shoot, move, communicate — then medicate.”",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,0.0,2025-11-17 12:56:27.508202

When my primary care physician referred me to OB/GYN, the Naval Medical Center exercised right of first refusal. However, because I was hospitalized and needed immediate care and Tricare agreed to change my referral to a civilian OB/GYN who was able to see immediately following the hospital visit. The referral now lists my civilian OB/GYN and seems to be covering the entirety of the prenatal care including hospital delivery and postpartum care. It's open enrollment season, and I'm considering switching to Tricare Select to avoid any potential issues (for example, Tricare refusing to cover hospital expenses because the Naval Medical Center exercised right of first refusal). Tricare claims the current referral is valid, but the Naval Medical Center, upon contacting, claimed that they had the original referral and threatened that Tricare wouldn't cover costs of healthcare if I refused to seek it there. I love my current OB/GYN and don't want to switch my care to another doctor at the Naval facility. I would also prefer to not to switch to Tricare Select at this time because of the potential for extra cost in comparison to Tricare Prime.

Could you please advise what's the approximate difference in cost of hospital delivery (this seems to be the biggest difference) between Tricare Prime and Select? My civilian OB/GYN is affiliated with Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla, so I would be giving birth there. The cost of delivery at that facility ranges from $10,000 to $30,000, depending on type of delivery and related complications.

Also, if Tricare were to refuse to cover the costs of Healthcarebecause of failure to seek it at the Naval Medical Center, a valid argument against refusal would be need for the continuity of care, which is an exception to the right of first refusal rule?

There’s the hug at the airport, the flag-waving kids, the tearful reunion in front of a very tired TSA agent. It feels like the end of a feel-good movie; now cue the music and roll credits.

Related: 10 Things you only know if you’ve given birth on Tricare

Except it’s not the end. It’s barely the end of the First Act. Buckle up, buttercup, this blockbuster is showing in homes all around the US of A. Because after the hugs come the hiccups. And the reintegration phase? That’s less Hollywood rom-com and more the “Saw” franchise.

The Fantasy vs. The First Fight

You spent months dreaming of this reunion, planning and plotting, even. They’d walk through the door, and everything would click right back into place. There’d be candles, connection, maybe a celebratory charcuterie board with white wine. Instead, you get: “Why are the knives in a different drawer now, babe?”

Turns out, life kept going while they were gone. You developed systems, survived solo parenting, possibly became fluent in generational culture, or microwaveable meals. Meanwhile, they’ve been living in a world of routine, uniforms, and Meals Ready to Expire (MREs). And now the two of you are trying to merge realities like some Sci-Fi Channel docuseries.

Reintegration: The Remix

There’s a rhythm to solo life. You figure out how to do everything yourself, from bedtime routines to killing spiders with utter confidence (or at least screaming into that vacuum hose with a Viking warrior). Then, suddenly, your partner is back—and so is the negotiation. Who does bedtime now? Are we a “team” again, or do I still lead this household like a stressed-out cruise director? Why are they folding the towels like that? We never fold our towels like that!

Even the intimacy takes a minute. You thought it would be “Fifty Shades of Grey,” but it’s more like a “Band of Brothers” intro. Physically, yes, but emotionally? There’s a hesitancy. You want to pick up where you left off, or shoot for the stars, but there are unspoken miles between you that must be bridged.

Sleep, Sex, and the Silent Treatment

Let’s talk about that first night. You imagine spooning under cozy covers. Instead, you’re jolted awake at 3 a.m. by your partner yelling “Contact left!” in their sleep while flailing like they’re in a tactical burrito.

Time zones, muscle memory, and emotional armor don’t just melt away with a welcome-home cake. And let’s not even get started on the TV remote wars, fridge organization drama, or why the kids are doing push-ups in your living room… and now running laps around the house.

The Little Wins

But then, ever so slowly, there are moments, peaks of sunshine in the overcast clouds. You laugh at a shared joke from three deployments ago. You tag-team a chaotic school morning and high-five like you just won Olympic gold. You finally reconnect—physically and emotionally—and it feels… earned.

You learn each other again. Not who you were, but who you are now. And weirdly, that might be better.

The Long Game

Here’s the truth they don’t put in the reunion videos: reintegration isn’t a week-long vacation. It’s a process. A sometimes clumsy, always evolving, beautifully frustrating process. There might be counseling. There might be silence. There will definitely be a moment when one of you cries into a frozen pizza or dubious leftover Chinese food. But you’re not failing. You’re just adjusting. Together.

So be patient. Give grace. Keep the knives where they are, or move them, just make sure it’s a joint decision this time. Because this messy, beautiful part? It’s where the real story begins.

Algiers – November 2025 – In a stride toward deepening security cooperation, Algeria and the United Kingdom have formalized a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) aimed at bolstering bilateral collaboration in the field of advanced electronic fingerprint analysis. The agreement was signed by the Director General of National Security, Ali Badaoui, and the UK Minister of State for Borders and Asylum Security, Alex Norris, during an official working visit to London.

The signing ceremony, held in the presence of Algeria’s Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Noureddine Yazid, marks a new chapter in the long-standing partnership between the two countries, reinforcing their shared commitment to strengthening police cooperation in response to evolving global security challenges. Badaoui led a high-level delegation comprising senior cadres of the General Directorate of National Security, underscoring the strategic importance Algeria accords to international security partnerships.

The MoU is designed to enhance operational coordination and upgrade the technical skills of Algerian police officers and specialists in the field of electronic fingerprint analysis. It paves the way for advanced training, structured knowledge exchange, and the adoption of cutting-edge methodologies in identity verification and biometric technologies—domains that have become indispensable in confronting contemporary threats.

A core aspect of the agreement involves facilitating the transfer of expertise between both sides, particularly in the areas of digital forensics, identity authentication systems, and data-driven investigative tools. This aligns seamlessly with Algeria’s broader vision of modernizing its security apparatus and integrating advanced technologies to counter crime in all its evolving forms.

During the visit, Badaoui and his accompanying delegation toured the United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency (NCA) in London, where they gained first-hand insight into the British model of crime-fighting and digital investigation. Senior NCA officials provided detailed briefings on the agency’s digital systems, forensic platforms, and mechanisms for criminal data analysis and cross-border information exchange.

In return, Badaoui outlined Algeria’s operational strategy in combating crime—particularly transnational organized crime—highlighting the substantial progress made by the Algerian police in intelligence-based policing, territorial control, and international cooperation frameworks.

Algiers – November 2025 – Algeria has once again underscored its commitment to strengthening the operational readiness and medical resilience of its armed forces, as General of the Army Saïd Chanegriha, Minister-Delegate to the Minister of National Defence and Chief of Staff of the People’s National Army (ANP), supervised on Saturday the inauguration of major new military health infrastructures in the First Military Region. The event, held as part of the commemorations of the 71st anniversary of the outbreak of the glorious November Revolution, stands as a testament to the country’s strategy of coupling military development with advanced, state-of-the-art healthcare capabilities.

According to a communiqué from the Ministry of National Defence (MDN), the ceremony began at the Central Army Hospital in Ain Naadja with a formal reception attended by senior generals and high-ranking officials of the Ministry and the ANP Staff. There, General Chanegriha received an extensive briefing from the Central Director of Military Health Services on the newly completed projects, which form part of a comprehensive program aimed at enhancing the performance, efficiency, and medical quality of military healthcare institutions.

The Chief of Staff then oversaw the operational launch of two new specialized medical services at the Central Army Hospital, both newly equipped with cutting-edge technologies. He inspected the hyperbaric medicine unit, which now offers advanced oxygen-therapy treatments for hypertension and other conditions, as well as the nuclear medicine department, recently modernized with state-of-the-art PET-scan and PET-MRI facilities. These systems, based on high-precision molecular imaging, are designed to enable physicians to detect the precise nature, location, and evolution of diseases, significantly improving diagnostic accuracy.

The MDN clarified that these services were constructed in accordance with international medical standards and equipped with modern, high-performance technologies capable of delivering superior care and contributing to markedly improved patient management.

Later, in Blida, General Chanegriha inaugurated the new Regional Mixed Military University Hospital, a major health facility intended to serve both military personnel and civilians. After a detailed presentation by the hospital’s Director General concerning its structure, capacity, equipment, and highly qualified medical and administrative staff, the General toured its departments to assess the range and quality of the medical and surgical services it provides.

During a subsequent meeting with military health cadres—broadcast via videoconference to personnel across all six Military Regions—General Chanegriha delivered a powerful orientation address. He emphasized that the inauguration of these infrastructures was both a tribute to Algeria’s martyrs and an expression of the nation’s commitment to strengthening the institutional and operational foundations of its armed forces. He urged all personnel to draw inspiration from the sacrifice and dedication of the men and women who shaped Algeria’s glory, calling for work conducted with the highest levels of professionalism, rigor, and devotion.

Central to his message was the affirmation that these achievements reflect the High Command’s unwavering resolve to continuously adapt the military health system to the evolving requirements of the battle corps and to emerging health threats—whether operational, technological, or epidemiological. He highlighted that such progress is a direct result of the attention and guidance of the President of the Republic, Supreme Chief of the Armed Forces and Minister of National Defence.

General Chanegriha stressed that the development of specialized services and advanced medical infrastructure is accompanied by sustained investment in highly qualified human resources—general practitioners, specialists, surgeons, nurses, and technical staff—capable of managing sophisticated medical systems and ensuring top-tier healthcare for military personnel and their families.

The ceremony concluded with the signing of the Golden Books, symbolizing the strategic significance of these new achievements and Algeria’s vision of a modern, resilient, and fully integrated military health system aligned with the nation’s security and development priorities.

Algiers – November 2025 – In an affirmation of the Algerian state’s strategic orientation toward bolstering public services and expanding national energy infrastructure, the Minister of Energy and Renewable Energies, Mourad Adjal, delivered a forceful address at the opening of the First National Forum of Sector Managers on Saturday. His intervention underscored substantial achievements in the electrification and gasification of the country, reflecting what he described as “vast, meticulously executed programs” aimed at ensuring reliable, uninterrupted energy supply for all citizens.

Adjal announced that more than 2.4 million households have been newly connected to the national natural gas network—a figure that marks a considerable leap in the country’s energy development map. Parallel to this, 456,000 additional homes have been linked to the electricity grid. These efforts have propelled Algeria’s electricity coverage rate to an impressive 99 percent, representing over 12.5 million subscribers. Gas coverage has reached 72 percent, now serving more than 8.2 million subscribers nationwide.

Highlighting the sector’s commitment to supporting national food security and rural development, Adjal revealed that more than 100,432 agricultural farms have been connected to the natural gas network. This milestone, he stressed, is transformative for agricultural productivity, cost reduction, and improved living conditions within the farming community.

The minister further detailed advances in the energy transition, notably the completion of 1,000 electric vehicle charging stations across the national territory. This rollout represents a critical step in the shift toward cleaner mobility and aligns with global trends in sustainable transport.

In the realm of vital water infrastructure, Adjal announced that five seawater desalination plants have been connected ahead of schedule to the electricity grid—an achievement that enhances the reliability of the country’s drinking water supply. Studies are currently underway to ensure that three additional desalination plants will be connected in the coming months.

TRICARE approved oral appliances are changing the way veterans sleep — no masks, no hoses, no noise.

If you’ve been battling obstructive sleep apnea and struggling to stay comfortable with CPAP, there’s a better, simpler way to reclaim your nights.

At New England Sleep Health, we proudly provide VA-approved sleep apnea treatment through custom oral appliances — simple, comfortable devices designed to restore quiet, restorative sleep in a natural way.

Whether you’re seeking alternatives for moderate sleep apnea or exploring new methods for treating sleep apnea without machinery, our team is here to help you find the right fit.

We work hand-in-hand with both the VA and TRICARE to make the process seamless and stress-free.

From your home sleep study and sleep apnea diagnosis, to the final fitting of your personalized device, our dedicated care team guides you every step of the way — so you can breathe freely, sleep deeply, and wake refreshed.

Why Veterans Struggle With Sleep Apnea

Many veterans experience chronic snoring, exhaustion, and poor sleep quality due to sleep-disordered breathing. The most common sleep apnea symptoms include loud snoring, pauses in breathing during sleep, morning headaches, and persistent fatigue — signs that your body isn’t getting the oxygen it needs.

When the airway repeatedly collapses during the night, oxygen levels drop, forcing your body to wake up just enough to reopen the airway — sometimes hundreds of times per night.

This cycle prevents deep, restorative sleep and leads to:

Morning headaches and grogginess

Memory lapses and poor focus

Daytime fatigue and mood swings

High blood pressure and heart strain

According to a study of the National Library of Medicine, sleep apnea is among the most commonly diagnosed conditions in veterans, often linked to service-related stress, weight gain, and disrupted sleep patterns.

Oral appliance therapy (also known as dental appliance sleep apnea treatment) uses a custom oral device — similar to a mouthguard — that gently repositions your jaw and tongue to keep your airway open while you sleep.

This proven, non-invasive therapy is an excellent CPAP alternative, especially for veterans who find masks uncomfortable or travel frequently.

Our team provides complete sleep apnea support from testing to treatment — helping you move from restless nights to truly restful sleep.

Benefits include:

Comfortable and lightweight design

No mask, hose, or noise

Covered by TRICARE and VA Community Care

Fully customized for your unique jaw and bite

Easy to travel with and maintain

Clinical studies from the American Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine (AADSM) show that oral appliances are highly effective for mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea, with greater patient comfort and adherence than CPAP therapy.

I assumed that I would be under his insurance until he turned the divorce papers into DEERS, and only then would they stop paying for me.

Turns out I was wrong and they go by the date the divorce was finalized on the decree (Aug). But that doesn’t make sense to me because 1) he was paying for the health insurance, 2) I didn’t get my divorce papers with the date of divorce until a whole MONTH later, so I wouldn’t have known about it until then anyways. 3) they didn’t email me about it until he turned in his papers like October 14th.

Idk I just don’t get how they can do this to me, what do you mean I’m suddenly 6k+ in debt in one phone call?? I don’t know who I can talk to about this, it’s so confusing and the people who are there to help alone the way are miserable, rude, and most just genuinely don’t know much it seems.

What’s even more frustrating is now I’m out of date to get any kind of health insurance. I’m over time to apply for covered California, even the CHCBP thing they have I’m past the 60days. That seems like my only saving grace but I’d have to pay 3600 for 6mo AND pay whatever out of pocket price they have before they’ll help. So if that comes out to more than 8k then it’s just worth it for me beg for payment plans and move on with my life.

I’m just annoyed because I don’t feel I should be on the hook for this. I wish someone would have been there to say, “here are some next steps”.

Tivic Health® Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:TIVC), a diversified immunotherapeutics company, today announced financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and provided a business update.

""Following our discussions at the Military Health System Research Symposium and continued engagement with key government agencies, we are encouraged by the interest in our lead product candidate, Entolimod for acute radiation syndrome (ARS), as a military medical countermeasure and stockpile drug,"" stated Tivic CEO, Jennifer Ernst. ""This quarter, we continued the advancement towards commercial readiness. Starting the cGMP manufacturing process with successful cell line verification was a critical first step to establishing reproducibility and scalability in our drug manufacturing.""

Tivic also completed the transfer of two INDs to Tivic from Statera Biopharma. These two INDs allow Tivic to initiate clinical trials for the use of Entolimod in the treatment of neutropenia and cancer-related conditions.

""Subsequent to the quarter's end, we also reported the compelling findings from Tivic's VNS Optimization Trial. These findings uncovered new insights into vagus nerve stimulation and have led to additional patent filings intended to protect Tivic's prescription device development for commercialization and licensing,"" added Ernst.

About Entolimod

Entolimod is a novel Toll-like Receptor 5 (TLR5) agonist that triggers NF-kB signaling, activating antiapoptotic and cell protective mechanisms. Under the FDA's Animal Rule, Entolimod™ has been the subject of extensive trials for the treatment of acute radiation syndrome (ARS), and has demonstrated robust survival, enhanced GI tract recovery and improved hematopoiesis in animal models. Entolimod has been granted Fast Track Designation for ARS.

About Tivic Health Systems, Inc.

Tivic's dual platform utilizes the body's biopharmaceutical and bioelectronic systems to treat unmet medical needs through targeting the immune system.

Tivic's biologics compounds activate an innate immune pathway to prevent cell death in the bone marrow and epithelial tissues across systems impacted by radiation and age. The company's lead drug candidate, Entolimod™ for acute radiation syndrome, is a novel TLR5 agonist that has been granted Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations and is in late-stage development. In addition to Entolimod™ for ARS, Tivic's pipeline includes and Entolimod™ for the treatment of neutropenia, and lymphocyte exhaustion, and Tivic has the exclusive option to license additional indications, including Entolasta to treat immunosenescence, and chronic radiation syndrome.

Tivic's bioelectronic program has been developing a novel, non-invasive medical device designed to target the neural pathways implicated in many prevalent and debilitating diseases. Early trials show promising signals that Tivic's approach may regulate specific biologic responses, and the company believes its early-stage vagus nerve stimulation device has the potential to deliver clinical outcomes similar to or better than those of surgically implanted devices.

VA - full coverage no cost and can be seen anywhere in the US no matter where you move.

Medicare / Tricare for life full coverage and only cost is Part B. No copays as Tricare becomes secondary and picks up anything Medicare doesn’t cover. Can be seen anywhere in the US you live that takes Medicare. Or if you are on vacation same thing.

Now to the standard vs advantage. Advantage locks you into a certain network provider that is normally local and limited on who you can see.

The “advantage” part is it’s normally cheaper for the normal senior citizen. But again extremely limited in its network. I would recommend sticking with standard. If you will have to coin and choose your battles on VA vs Medicare. Some doctors are better for me at VA. And others are better away from the VA. Good luck.

Tivic's dual platform utilizes the body's biopharmaceutical and bioelectronic systems to treat unmet medical needs through targeting the immune system.

Tivic's biologics compounds activate an innate immune pathway to prevent cell death in the bone marrow and epithelial tissues across systems impacted by radiation and age. The company's lead drug candidate, Entolimod™ for acute radiation syndrome, is a novel TLR5 agonist that has been granted Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations and is in late-stage development. In addition to Entolimod™ for ARS, Tivic's pipeline includes and Entolimod™ for the treatment of neutropenia, and lymphocyte exhaustion, and Tivic has the exclusive option to license additional indications, including Entolasta to treat immunosenescence, and chronic radiation syndrome.

Tivic's bioelectronic program has been developing a novel, non-invasive medical device designed to target the neural pathways implicated in many prevalent and debilitating diseases. Early trials show promising signals that Tivic's approach may regulate specific biologic responses, and the company believes its early-stage vagus nerve stimulation device has the potential to deliver clinical outcomes similar to or better than those of surgically implanted devices.

Electrodiagnostic testing is an extremely valuable tool that provides vital information about the health of your nerves and muscles and is helpful in the evaluation of weakness, numbness, pain and symptoms such as fatigue, cramps, and abnormal sensation. This test is performed by a physician who has had special training to perform such a procedure.

On the day of your test

Bath or shower to remove excess body oils

Do not use any oils, lotions or creams as these can interfere with your test

Wear loose, comfortable clothing but be aware that you may have to change into a hospital gown

Be sure to inform the physician if you are taking blood thinning medication such as Coumadin, have hemophilia or a cardiac pacemaker

There are no meal or activity restrictions before or after the test

About the test

Nerve conduction studies: To perform this test the physician tapes small metal electrodes to the surface of your skin and applies an electrical pulse to one portion of the nerve being tested.

EMG (Electromyographic): A sterile fine “acupuncture-like” needle electrode is gently inserted into the muscle. Needle insertion may cause mild temporary discomfort. The needle is not used for injections and no shocks are given. The needle itself serves as a small microphone that allows the physician to detect if there may be abnormalities

The study takes approximately 60-90 minutes

After the test

You may return to your normal routine immediately

The results are sent directly to the referring physician
