You get to pick your doctor, there’s no need for referrals, and they cover so many options for care. My wife had complications with both pregnancies, resulting in week long stays in the hospital each time with tons of testing and specialty care. I paid for parking, that’s it.

It is so worth it to avoid nonsense like this article is describing.

Tricare as a whole isn't the best that's for sure. But I sure went prime when I was pregnant and I guess I was lucky everyone was covered(I was high risk both times).

Now, as far as using normal Tricare as opposed to prime or select(whatever they call it these days), I will say normal Tricare covered all of my gastric bypass and everything after it, including having to go back in for a bleed.

Now, my husband is on recruiting duty and in MN there are no active bases. So here when have prime remote? But we never have copays unless it's for like plastic surgery or contact fittings.

I’d like to NOT purchase private insurance just to qualify for a VISA considering I have private insurance that DOES cover me… I’m just having a hard time getting apostilled proof.","TL;DR: How can an American apostille a document that is from a private company, considering every state and federal apostille only allows documents that are signed or issued by government agencies?

First off, I’m SO happy I found this forum. It’s helping me get answers and so I hope to contribute to answers and topics to help others. So here’s my newest speedbump, and maybe this will help others in the future if they find it!

I’m retired US military and through some inheritance, and careful saving through my time in the military, have had enough saved to apply for the Golden Visa (while my wife continues to work a full time job until she’s ready to leave). I have a retirement, some disability, and we look forward to spending our retirement time in Portugal.

As part of the AIMA appointment, they require an apostilled private health insurance showing that I am covered in Portugal (as I can’t be covered by the public system… fair). My Tricare coverage (tricare overseas) covers everything we need, for the duration of my lifetime. But in the US, as far as I can tell, you cannot apostille documents that are not issued by a government agency. I can apostille marriage certificates, FBI background checks, etc, because they are all signed by government agencies.

Tricare, is a private company, contracted by the government. THey also don’t have a pdf policy, you can only search online to get answers, so it’s hard to ‘prove’ that they cover the necessary things.

Any advice? I’d like to NOT purchase private insurance just to qualify for a VISA considering I have private insurance that DOES cover me… I’m just having a hard time getting apostilled proof.

For aspiring mental health professionals eager to care for those who serve, the https://deploymentpsych.org/ (CDP) at the Uniformed Services University (USU) offers a rare and transformative experience — the https://deploymentpsych.org/the-summer-institute. Since 2015, this immersive program has helped future psychologists and social workers chart a course toward impactful careers supporting military service members, veterans, and their families. This year’s three-day session, held July 15–17 on USU’s Bethesda, Maryland campus, once again drew top students from across the country to learn, connect, and envision their future in military behavioral health.

The Summer Institute: Born from Necessity, Shaped by Evolution

The Summer Institute addresses a critical national shortage of mental health providers and highlights those career opportunities within the framework of military populations. Part of the design was, “How do we create a program that helps to highlight a career option in terms of serving military populations as an active duty behavioral health officer?"" explains Dr. Timothy Rogers, Pathways Program associate director.

The program began with a focus on psychology students preparing for internships, but over the years it has expanded to include first-year doctoral students, providing them with early exposure to the knowledge and skills needed for military careers. This strategic evolution allows students to explore military behavioral health as a potential career path well before they begin advanced training.

To make the program more accessible, the Summer Institute was streamlined from five days to three. Along with this change, the curriculum shifted its focus from how to perform the job to what the job entails. By consolidating previously scattered information on military and civilian opportunities, the program gives participants a clearer picture of the field, helping them determine whether this unique career path aligns with their aspirations and talents.

And new this year, the Summer Institute expanded in 2024 to include a track for social workers. This expansion underscores CDP's commitment to a ""total force concept"" for career paths, encompassing not just active duty but also other uniformed services and civilian opportunities within the DoD and VA. This inclusion strives to help with the high demand for mental health services and the challenges for access to care that can arise within the Military Health System. Rogers emphasizes, ""there's a high demand and there's a real need and we need really good clinicians to help take care of our service members and veterans and family members in all of our communities.""

Distinguished Speakers and Diverse Perspectives

This year's three-day program includes both a psychology and social work track. Both tracks share a foundational curriculum, beginning with a welcome and overview by Rogers. Afterwards, guests attend a distinguished session on the importance of military mental health with retired Lt. Gen. Raymond “Scott” Dingle, the U.S. Army’s 45th Surgeon General, and retired Command Sergeant Major Diamond D. Hough, the 20th Command Sergeant Major of the Army Medical Command.

Participants in both tracks will gain an in-depth understanding of military culture through sessions tailored to their fields. Psychology students will learn from Dr. Debra Nofziger, a former active-duty Army psychologist, while social work students will hear from Dr. Katrice Byrd and Ms. Allison Hannah, both military behavioral health social workers with the CDP. Additional presenters — ranging from early-career professionals sharing insights on first assignments to seasoned experts discussing long-term career growth and broader industry trends — round out the program. While both tracks feature recruiter presentations and training directors’ panels, students will also join together for collaborative activities, then break into discipline-specific sessions for more focused learning.

Beyond Seminars: Offering Mentorship and Resources

The Summer Institute goes beyond simply offering an overview — it provides concrete, practical guidance for building a career in military behavioral health. Students gain insider perspectives on the application process, including how to navigate the complexities of recruiting and the Medical Examination Processing Station (MEPS). The CDP also equips participants with long-term career tools and strategies. Suggestions include tailoring class projects toward military psychology topics and seeking clinical training experiences that align with military needs. As Rogers explains, the program is designed to be “a platform for people to learn,” filling a gap in education where few programs offer in-depth insight into this specialized career path.

Proven Impact and Future Vision

The program’s impact is clear in its consistently high satisfaction ratings and the large proportion of alumni who go on to military internships or related roles. Since its launch 10 years ago, more than 548 students from over 130 doctoral programs in 34 states, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico have taken part in the Summer Institute. This year alone, 56 participants completed the program.

Looking ahead, the initiative will expand into three distinct events: the Summer Institute, focused on active-duty careers; a fall event highlighting other uniformed career paths such as the Public Health Service or Coast Guard; and a winter institute dedicated to civilian opportunities within the DoD and VA. To broaden reach, the fall and winter programs will be held virtually, making them accessible to an even wider pool of future professionals.

""I'm always excited to work with students,"" Rogers shares, ""always excited to help them to realize that working with our military population can be extremely rewarding"". He concludes, ""there are real problems that need real solutions and we need people who are well trained to meet that moment"". The Summer Institute is a crucial stepping stone for those ready to meet that moment.",,N,1.0,2026-01-01 11:56:33.964606

Dr. William Kelly isn’t your typical military physician—he’s a game-changer in military medical education. From leading medical students through rotations at military medical centers across the country to pioneering educational innovation, Kelly is transforming the way future military doctors learn. His drive for growth led him to earn a Master’s in Health Professions Education (HPE) from the Uniformed Services University (USU), where he enhanced his teaching strategies and integrated interactive learning techniques, including gamification. His mission? To equip students with the tools they need to become confident, self-sufficient leaders in military medicine.

Kelly, a professor of Medicine and clerkship director at USU’s F. Edward Hebert School of Medicine, also serves as a pulmonary physician at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Whether in the classroom or at the bedside, his leadership helps shape the next generation of military physicians, ensuring they receive the education, training, and experience necessary for success.

“I’ve been fortunate to learn from exceptional mentors and students,” Kelly says. “The HPE program appealed to me as a way to solidify my teaching methods, delve deeper into leadership and educational theories, and refine my research practices,” he adds.

Dr. Steven Durning, HPE department chair and director of the Center for Health Professions Education (CHPE) at USU, explains that CHPE offers certificate and degree programs for active-duty and civilian health professionals at U.S. military treatment facilities. These programs enhance academic leadership, educational research, and teaching skills through primarily online asynchronous learning, designed for busy healthcare professionals. To date, more than 450 learners have graduated, with over 300 currently enrolled.

Kelly’s research focuses on assessment, test-taking skills, and interactive learning. He recognizes that even brilliant clinicians can struggle with standardized test formats. Through self-regulated learning analysis and coaching, the clerkship equips students with strategies to overcome these hurdles—skills that translate into broader professional success.

""We focus on growing independence,"" Kelly explains. ""Our goal is to help these future leaders and healers transition from the classroom to the demanding world of internship, regardless of their chosen specialty."" His approach involves close collaboration with clinical supervisors and continuous feedback to ensure student success.

Kelly sees his HPE knowledge directly influencing his work as a professor and clerkship director. ""These individuals face unique challenges,"" he acknowledges. ""The HPE program has equipped me with tools to address these challenges, particularly in areas like learner remediation."" He leverages self-regulated learning techniques to help students overcome hurdles and become independent learners.

Kelly’s vision for medical education goes beyond traditional methods. He is a proponent of gamification—integrating game mechanics into learning experiences. His enthusiasm was evident at last year’s Military Health System conference, where he delivered a compelling talk on the subject.

""Learning is serious business,"" Kelly asserts, ""but teaching modalities don't have to be."" He believes educational games can enhance engagement, teamwork, and knowledge retention through repetition and feedback. Kelly has designed and implemented interactive learning programs since 2001. In collaboration with other experts, he helped develop the CHEST Challenge program, initially aimed at pulmonary/critical care fellows in the U.S. and Canada. Today, it includes high-fidelity simulation, live actors, and rigorous assessment methods. Since 2012, Kelly has introduced innovative educational games, such as diagnostic ultrasound training, escape rooms, and live medical knowledge game shows at professional conferences.

For military healthcare professionals considering an HPE degree, Kelly’s advice is: “Go for it!” He emphasizes the program’s ability to refine leadership and teaching skills, while also recognizing the value of the credential. Despite the time commitment, he assures it is manageable alongside a busy clinical schedule.

""The program is incredibly flexible,"" Kelly assures, ""and the benefits far outweigh the investment, especially considering the financial advantage of pursuing it within the military framework.""

Durning says Kelly's dedication and hard work were evident throughout his time in the HPE master’s degree program. “Dr. Kelly flourished in the MHPE program, excelling in all facets and producing an important and timely paper in Academic Medicine entitled Assessment Tools for Patient Notes in Medical Education: A Scoping Review.”

Kelly’s journey is proof that great educators never stop learning. From the bedside to the classroom—and even the game board—he is redefining how military medical students engage with education. His passion for teaching, commitment to innovation, and drive to help students succeed make him a transformative force in military medical education. And with his HPE degree in hand, he is more prepared than ever to shape the next generation of confident, capable military physicians.",,N,0.0,2026-01-01 11:56:36.654092

Surgeons from the Uniformed Services University (USU) and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) have earned national recognition for their dedication to surgical excellence and outstanding patient outcomes. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP®) awarded WRNMMC the prestigious Meritorious Achievement Award for 2023, placing the joint team among an elite group of just 77 hospitals out of 609 eligible participants. WRNMMC received this recognition in November 2024.

Faculty from both the USU and Walter Reed comprise the surgical team. WRNMMC has participated in the NSQIP program for over 10 years, building a long-standing tradition of providing nationally recognized excellent surgical care.

The Meritorious Achievement Award is based on a rigorous evaluation of risk-adjusted data in the July 2024 ACS NSQIP Semiannual Report, which analyzed surgical outcomes across eight key clinical areas. The USU-Walter Reed surgical team’s performance placed them in the top 10% of participating hospitals nationwide, including both Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and private sector hospitals. They also received distinctions of ""exemplary"" in all-case morbidity, all-case urinary tract infection, and all-case surgical site infection. Participation in the ACS NSQIP program requires hospitals to track and analyze surgical outcomes for both inpatient and outpatient procedures, using a data-driven approach to identify areas for improvement and enhance patient safety initiatives. Dr. Eric Twerdahl, associate chair of Surgery for Quality and Outcomes at USU, explains that WRNMMC submits approximately 1,700 cases per year, which NSQIP then compares to the roughly 1 million cases it receives worldwide. Twerdahl describes it as a continuous benchmark of their performance, both amongst their peers in the Military Health System and internationally.

“Being able to compare our outcomes to other hospitals in the country is a tremendous value. And like in most MTFs, that’s where we shine,” he says, adding that at WRNMMC “you have a lower chance of having a complication after surgery than you do at about 90% of the hospitals in America.”

Despite recent infrastructure challenges, the data reflects what’s happening inside the hospital – the expertise, dedication, and resiliency of the USU-Walter Reed surgical team lead to exceptional results. Twerdahl emphasizes that “the credit goes to the individual surgeons, nurses, and surgical technicians,” underscoring that no matter the environment, “the resiliency of military surgeons is being able to get the job done effectively and safely.”",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,0.0,2025-12-31 23:12:16.369242

Opioid overdoses are a serious public health crisis, and the Uniformed Services University (USU), in collaboration with the Defense Health Agency (DHA) Research & Engineering Implementation Science Branch, is tackling this issue head-on with the Opioid Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution (OEND) Program. This initiative focuses on increasing access to naloxone, a life-saving antidote, and educating both providers and patients about its importance.

The Need for Naloxone Access and Education

While many recognize the dangers of opioids and their link to fatal overdoses, awareness of naloxone—an emergency medication that can rapidly reverse an opioid overdose—remains limited. Addressing the opioid crisis requires not only understanding the risks of opioid use but also ensuring widespread knowledge and availability of naloxone. Despite its life-saving potential, naloxone remains historically underprescribed.

One contributing factor is that some prescribers assume their patients are unlikely to misuse opioids. Others may hesitate due to the stigma surrounding naloxone use. However, the reality is that anyone prescribed opioids faces a risk of accidental overdose. Factors such as medication interactions, alcohol consumption, or a weakened immune system can all increase this risk. Since 2019, the OEND program has worked to de-stigmatize conversations about opioid use and expand access to naloxone, ensuring that more people are prepared to prevent overdose deaths.

Creating the OEND Program: A Collaborative Effort

The Defense and Veterans Center for Integrated Pain Management (DVCIPM) at USU, inspired by the Veterans Administration’s Opioid Education and Naloxone Distribution (OEND) program, partnered with the Defense Health Agency (DHA) to tailor the initiative for the Military Health System (MHS). Leading this effort are Dr. Kris Highland, associate professor of Anesthesiology at USU, and retired Army Col. Kevin Galloway, DVCIPM’s director for Strategic Communications and Policy. Galloway also highlights the pivotal contributions of retired Army Col. (Dr.) Chester Buckenmaier III, DVCIPM’s founding director, in shaping the MHS pain management infrastructure.

A key element of OEND is encouraging providers to “co-prescribe” naloxone alongside opioid painkillers for patients with elevated overdose risks, including those on long-term opioid therapy, high opioid doses, concurrent respiratory depressants (such as benzodiazepines), or with a history of behavioral health conditions. This sustained effort has led to an impressive 79.5% compliance rate for co-prescribing naloxone.

How Naloxone Saves Lives

Naloxone is a fast-acting medication that temporarily reverses opioid overdoses by restoring breathing. Administered via IV or nasal spray, it works by binding to opioid receptors, blocking the effects of opioids, and counteracting the respiratory depression that can be fatal. While naloxone can be used by anyone in an emergency, it is not a replacement for professional medical care. Its effects are temporary, and individuals who receive naloxone still require immediate medical attention to ensure their safety and prevent a recurrence of overdose symptoms.

OEND’s Three-Phase Approach

The OEND program is specifically tailored to the MHS to bridge the gap between policy and practice. Highland’s team discovered that despite existing DoD policies promoting naloxone distribution, prescribing rates remained stagnant. While these policies allowed both physicians and pharmacists to prescribe naloxone and outlined opioid safety and pain management guidelines, they lacked the necessary programming and tools to effectively disseminate this information, slowing meaningful change.

To address this, the program was structured into three phases. Phase One began with interviews of clinicians and pharmacists to assess training and resource needs. Collaborating with OEND champions at Madigan Army Medical Center, the team developed targeted tools and training to enhance access to patient prescription history, improve provider-patient discussions about naloxone, and reduce stigma surrounding its use. Training focused on locating opioid prescription history and overdose risk indicators in CarePoint, initiating informed conversations with patients, and addressing stigma among both healthcare providers and patients.

A post-training review of 47 participating clinicians and pharmacists revealed that most regularly worked with patients concerned about opioid risks, and roughly 40% had received direct naloxone information requests from patients or caregivers.

Following the training, prescribers reported increased confidence in normalizing conversations about naloxone and educating patients on its benefits. Open discussions about opioid safety are essential—covering medication storage, access, and disposal, as well as how conditions like sleep apnea and medications such as benzodiazepines can heighten the risk of opioid-induced respiratory depression. ""Patients sometimes forget they've taken their medication and accidentally double-dose,"" Highland explains. ""Or they take their medication as prescribed, have a couple of drinks, and don't realize they've increased their risk of respiratory depression. Many things can happen accidentally. Empowering patients with knowledge for informed health decisions is a key component of OEND,"" Highland emphasizes.

Reaching a Wider Audience

In collaboration with the DHA, the OEND Program launched a dedicated Health.mil page to provide comprehensive resources for patients, caregivers, providers, and trainers. This centralized hub offers opioid fact sheets, infographics, videos, and train-the-trainer handbooks—all in one accessible location. Designed to support prescribers, pharmacists, and OEND champions, the site ensures that critical information is readily available to those who need it. A complementary social media campaign further amplifies the program’s reach, reinforcing the importance of naloxone education and accessibility. As Galloway emphasizes, “What if you had a fire extinguisher but didn’t know what it does?”

An Ongoing Effort

The OEND program remains committed to continuous improvement, ensuring providers have the tools and knowledge to engage patients effectively. “The teaching is different now,” Galloway explains. “We’re no longer just telling medical students to ‘treat the pain, treat the pain.’” While recent data suggests a decline in overdose deaths, Galloway attributes this to a combination of factors, including expanded naloxone access, harm reduction efforts, and greater awareness. He underscores that DVCIPM is not anti-opioid—these medications can be invaluable when prescribed and used responsibly. “The culture [around opioid prescribing] is still in the process of changing, and we’re better than we were, but not quite as good as we need to be,” he says.

Looking ahead, Highland highlights the program’s vision for a “triple risk-reduction kit”—a comprehensive emergency care package combining defibrillators, Stop the Bleed supplies, and naloxone. “We can’t predict where someone will have an overdose event, we can’t predict where there will be a mass casualty event such as a mass shooting, and we can’t predict when and where someone will have a cardiovascular incident that requires a defibrillator,” Highland notes. “So if you were to put those three together, and create awareness around that and create training information on how to use each part of the triple kit, then that would be the new emergency care kit that would be available to people.”",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,0.0,2025-12-31 23:12:06.389513

The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU), in partnership with the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine (HJF), recently hosted the groundbreaking Hospital 2.0 Summit: Creating the Digital Twin on August 11-12, 2025 in Bethesda, Maryland. The two-day event convened 72 thought leaders, innovators, and stakeholders from healthcare, technology, and industry to discuss how to revolutionize hospital operations and patient care using digital twin technologies, machine learning, and process optimization.

The summit aimed to collaborative innovation, explore various digital twin applications, and advance ethical AI integration in healthcare. Attendees and speakers, including representatives from civilian and military healthcare, USU, the Defense Health Agency (DHA), and the DoD Chief Digital and AI Office (CDAO), engaged in discussions on critical topics like data digitization and standardization, overcoming implementation barriers, and incorporating human values into AI tools.

Keynote speaker Dr. Eric Elster, dean of the USU F. Edward Hebert School of Medicine, opened the summit with a presentation on ""The Digital Transformation of Healthcare.” Elster stressed the university's commitment to advancing medical care through digital innovation as well as how he anticipated this technology will impact the future of the MHS, stating, ""Digital twinning will transform hospital care - for providers and patients - and we are excited to be driving innovation that will advance medical care for Warfighters and their families.""

Cmdr. (Dr.) Jacob Cole, assistant dean for Digital Transformation, reflected on the summit's significance, stating ""The Digital Twinning Summit was an important milestone for the Military Health System.” ""By bringing together clinicians, technologists, and leaders, we explored how digital twin technology can help us model complex healthcare environments, improve decision-making, and ultimately deliver better care to service members and their families"" he continued. Cole further emphasized how the summit highlighted the power of collaboration and set the stage for a future where digital innovation is central to readiness and resilience.

The summit focused on defining and applying digital twins. A digital twin is an exact virtual replica of a physical asset, process, or system, continuously connected to its real-world counterpart through data. These models allow for real-time monitoring, scenario planning, and predictive analysis.

Optimizing Hospital Operations: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) SimLEARN program showcased their digital twin application for optimizing patient flow and facility design, particularly for aging infrastructure. Booz Allen Hamilton also presented its work on digital twin prototypes for improving operating room layouts, a critical ""choke point"" in hospitals.

Ethical AI and Human Values: A critical session led by Dr. Amy Summerville of Kairos Research highlighted the importance of incorporating diverse human values into AI decisions. Her presentation, ""Incorporating Human Values in Off-The-Loop Tools,"" emphasized that ""better decisions"" in complex domains like military medical triage require more than just universal AI principles.

USU President Dr. Jonathan Woodson summarized the key takeaways for the Military Health System (MHS), emphasizing that digital disruption in healthcare is here and demands a fundamental re-evaluation of current practices. Woodson stated, ""As much as we have been talking for years about digital technology disrupting healthcare, it is really here. We're going to have to fundamentally rethink some of the ways we thought about doing business, generating information, delivering health care and our old oversight systems given the speed at which AI is being rolled out"". Woodson outlined several crucial steps for the MHS:

Data Systems: Immediately improve data systems across silos and enhance data governance.

Workforce Upskilling: Upskill the MHS workforce to effectively use AI tools and foster trust between functional and technical experts.

Ethical Oversight: Develop rigorous frameworks for post-deployment analysis of AI systems and create standards for their introduction into healthcare.

Collaboration: Foster close collaboration with the DoD Chief Digital and AI Office (CDAO) for data democratization and interoperability.

The summit underscored that while challenges exist, the path forward involves strategic partnerships, continuous learning, and a commitment to leveraging technology for safer, more efficient, and veteran-centered healthcare. The summit is expected to create a shared vision, a roadmap for implementation, and the formation of working groups to tackle specific challenges.",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,0.0,2025-12-31 23:12:11.900150

If you move overseas and you have Medicare Part A, you must also have Medicare Part B to remain eligible for TFL. Even though Medicare doesn’t provide coverage outside the U.S. and U.S. territories, you must continue to pay Medicare Part B premiums.

If you have TFL:

TRICARE is the primary payer for TRICARE-covered services and supplies, unless you have other health insurance.

You can get TRICARE-covered services and supplies from any TRICARE-authorized provider. (In the Philippines, you must get care from a Preferred Provider Network provider or a certified provider.)

If you get covered services from a network provider, your out-of-pocket costs will generally be lower than if you see a non-network provider. Search the overseas provider directory to find a network provider.

You’ll pay TRICARE cost-shares after you meet your TRICARE annual deductible.

You may need pre-authorization for some services.

International SOS is the TRICARE overseas contractor. Contact International SOS for help with finding providers, getting authorizations, filing claims, and more.

TRICARE Plus

Have you moved close to a military hospital or clinic? You may be able to enroll in TRICARE Plus. TRICARE Plus is a health care program offered at some military hospitals and clinics. Contact your local military hospital or clinic to see if they offer the program.

Note: You can’t enroll in TRICARE Plus if you’re enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan health maintenance organization option.

Filling prescriptions

You may have different pharmacy options depending on where you move:

Military pharmacies are located throughout the U.S. You can also find them in some U.S. territories and some locations overseas. Find a military pharmacy near you.

TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery will ship to any address in the U.S. or U.S. territories. This includes APO, FPO, and DPO addresses. There are different rules for using home delivery in other overseas locations.

TRICARE retail network pharmacies are located throughout the U.S. You can also find them in most U.S. territories. Find a network pharmacy near you.

At non-network pharmacies, you’ll have to pay full price for your prescription drugs. Then you can file a claim for reimbursement. Overseas, a non-network pharmacy might be your only pharmacy option. In the Philippines, you must fill prescriptions at a certified pharmacy. Learn more about filling prescriptions overseas.

Your family members

When you have TFL, moving isn’t a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event for you. But moving is a QLE for family members who are enrolled in or eligible for TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select. Your family members should also update their address in DEERS after they move. They’ll have 90 days from the date of the address change to change their TRICARE health plan.

Check out “Your TRICARE Checklist for Moving” for more information and tips for what to do when you and your family move.

VA Health Care Is Not Automatic Separating from active duty doesn't automatically enroll you in VA health care.","You separate from active duty next month. Your Tricare Prime coverage ends. Now what?

Many service members don't sort this out until they're already out and scrambling for health insurance. The confusion costs money and creates gaps in coverage that leave families exposed.

Here's what actually happens with your health insurance when you leave active duty.

Terminal Leave Changes Nothing

While you're on terminal leave, you're still on active duty. Your Tricare Prime coverage continues exactly as it was. No changes, no action required. Don't confuse terminal leave with separation. You separate when your official end of active service date hits, not when you start terminal leave.

Your family stays covered under their current plan during terminal leave, too: Tricare Prime, Tricare Select -- whatever they had before terminal leave started.

TAMP Covers Some Veterans for 180 Days

The Transitional Assistance Management Program gives 180 days of free Tricare coverage after active duty ends, but not everyone qualifies.

You get TAMP if you separate involuntarily under honorable conditions. That includes service members who take voluntary separation pay but can't receive retirement pay. National Guard and reserve members who served more than 30 consecutive days supporting a contingency operation also qualify.

You get TAMP if you were stop-lossed and then separated. You get TAMP if you agree to join the Selected Reserve immediately after active duty with no gap in service.

Check your eligibility in milConnect or talk to your personnel office before you separate. TAMP starts the day after your active duty ends. Your family gets covered, too.

During TAMP, you keep Tricare Select coverage: no premiums, same network, same rules. Prescription coverage continues. If you qualified for active-duty dental benefits, those continue under TAMP.

TAMP ends after 180 days, so on day 181, you're on your own unless you’ve arranged other coverage.

CHCBP Costs Money

The Continued Health Care Benefit Program is Tricare coverage you purchase after TAMP ends or after separation if you don't qualify for TAMP. Coverage lasts 18 to 36 months depending on your situation.

CHCBP gives you the same coverage as Tricare Select: network providers, prescriptions -- the works. But you pay quarterly premiums. For 2025, member-only coverage costs $1,849 per quarter. Family coverage runs $4,621 per quarter.

That's $7,396 per year for individual coverage or $18,484 for family coverage. Compare that to marketplace plans or employer insurance before you sign up.

You must enroll within 60 days of losing Tricare or TAMP coverage. Miss that window, and you can't get CHCBP. The contractor is Humana Military.

Reservists Can Pay for Tricare

If you're joining the Guard or reserve after active duty, you may qualify to purchase Tricare Reserve Select. Monthly premiums for 2025 are $53.80 for member-only coverage or $274.48 for family coverage.

TRS follows Tricare Select rules: same network, same coverage. You pay the monthly premium plus copays and deductibles when you use care.

TRS beats CHCBP on cost: $645.60 per year for individual TRS coverage versus $7,396 for CHCBP individual coverage. If you qualify for TRS, take it.

VA Health Care Is Not Automatic

Separating from active duty doesn't automatically enroll you in VA health care. You have to apply. You can apply as soon as you get your separation orders, but coverage doesn't start until after you separate.

VA health care eligibility depends on your service history, disability rating, income and other factors. Not everyone qualifies for full VA coverage.

The VA Concierge for Care team calls recently separated veterans to help with enrollment. They'll process your application over the phone and schedule your first appointment.

VA health care covers service-connected disabilities. It may cover other care depending on your priority group. But VA coverage alone might not replace Tricare for your family. Spouses and kids generally don't qualify for VA health care.

Don't Let Coverage Lapse

Figure out your health insurance before you separate: TAMP if you qualify; CHCBP or TRS if you don't; employer insurance from your new civilian job; or Health Insurance Marketplace plans if nothing else works.

Gaps in coverage cost thousands when someone gets hurt or sick. Know what you have, when it ends, and what comes next

When veterans transition from active military service to civilian life, many choose to continue their careers in federal government roles. The unique combination of military and federal employment presents an opportunity for veterans to significantly bolster their retirement benefits through a lesser-known yet powerful option: the TriCARE buyback program. This program allows veterans who become federal employees to “buy back” their military service time, counting it toward their federal retirement. This process can reshape their retirement prospects, blending military and federal service into a seamless financial future.

The Basics of Military Buyback: A Hidden Advantage

Military buyback is a little-discussed but invaluable option for veterans who move into federal employment. By purchasing their military service time and adding it to their civilian federal retirement system, veterans can potentially retire earlier and with a higher pension. The Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) and the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) both allow veterans to utilize this benefit, but the key difference lies in how it enhances the veteran’s pension.

Here’s how it works: Veterans who served in active duty have the option to make a one-time payment to “buy back” their years of military service. This payment, often referred to as a military deposit, is based on the amount of basic military pay the veteran received during their years of service, plus a small interest fee if not paid within a set time frame. Once completed, these years of service are credited toward the veteran’s federal retirement, just as if they had worked those years in the federal government.

How TriCARE Buyback Programs Fit into the Federal Retirement Picture

The significance of this buyback lies in how it improves both the veteran’s pension and healthcare benefits. By leveraging TriCARE buyback, federal employees can significantly enhance their overall retirement package. This isn’t just about pensions—it’s about healthcare security and maximizing long-term benefits.

Veterans who are eligible for TriCARE, the Department of Defense’s health insurance program for military personnel, retirees, and their families, may have the opportunity to coordinate their healthcare benefits with their federal civilian benefits. For example, while TriCARE provides ongoing healthcare coverage, federal retirees also have access to the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program. A veteran who buys back military time and retires from the federal workforce may be able to combine the best of both worlds—TriCARE and FEHB—ensuring robust healthcare coverage throughout their retirement.

In addition, veterans can further strengthen their financial security by combining their military buyback with Social Security benefits. While veterans who served under FERS contribute to Social Security, those under CSRS may not. Nonetheless, a military buyback allows veterans under either system to potentially qualify for or increase their Social Security benefits by adding their years of military service to their civilian employment record.

The Financial Impact of TriCARE Buyback

The financial implications of opting for a TriCARE buyback are substantial. The cost to buy back military service is generally affordable, especially compared to the long-term retirement benefits it yields. For many veterans, the amount paid for a military deposit is far outweighed by the increase in pension they will receive.

For example, under FERS, veterans earn 1% of their high-3 average salary for each year of service, or 1.1% if they retire at age 62 or older with 20 years of service. A veteran who buys back four years of military service could significantly increase their retirement income by thousands of dollars annually. This additional income continues for life, meaning the buyback option pays dividends for decades to come.

The buyback also influences retirement eligibility. Typically, federal employees need at least five years of service to qualify for retirement benefits under FERS or CSRS. Veterans who buy back their military time can use those years to reach eligibility faster, potentially shaving years off their time in the workforce and allowing for an earlier retirement.

Eligibility and Timing: A Key Consideration

Timing is critical when it comes to the TriCARE buyback option. Veterans must initiate the buyback process before they retire from federal service, and ideally, they should do so as soon as they enter the civilian workforce. The cost of the buyback increases over time due to the accumulation of interest. Veterans who make their deposit within three years of becoming federal employees can avoid interest entirely. After that, interest begins to accrue on the military deposit, raising the overall cost.

The buyback process involves several steps, starting with obtaining military service records (typically DD Form 214) and working with the federal agency’s human resources office to calculate the amount of the military deposit. Once the deposit is calculated and paid, the service time is credited toward retirement. This process can take time, so starting early ensures that veterans maximize their buyback benefits and avoid unnecessary delays.

TriCARE Buyback and Federal Pensions: A Win-Win Scenario

For veterans weighing the pros and cons of a TriCARE buyback, the decision largely hinges on their long-term retirement goals. By increasing their federal pension, shortening their time to retirement eligibility, and potentially boosting their Social Security benefits, the buyback program offers veterans a significant return on investment.

One of the primary benefits of military buyback is its versatility. Veterans under both FERS and CSRS can utilize the program, though the mechanics differ slightly. FERS employees benefit from a three-part retirement package: a civil service pension, Social Security, and TSP (Thrift Savings Plan) contributions. Buying back military time means a higher pension and earlier retirement, both of which offer a substantial financial advantage. CSRS employees, who do not receive Social Security as part of their retirement, still benefit from an increased pension, making the buyback a valuable option.

Ultimately, the buyback program is designed to reward veterans for their military service by providing an opportunity to maximize the retirement benefits available to them as federal employees. By taking advantage of this program, veterans can ensure that their time in uniform continues to serve them long after they transition to civilian life.

Why TriCARE Buyback Programs Are a Game-Changer for Veterans

The TriCARE buyback option is more than just a financial tool—it’s a pathway to retirement security for veterans. The ability to count military service toward federal retirement offers veterans a distinct advantage over their civilian counterparts. In addition to increasing pension benefits, the buyback helps veterans navigate healthcare options, blending TriCARE and FEHB coverage for comprehensive, cost-effective health benefits.

For veterans under FERS, the buyback also has the added advantage of enhancing Social Security benefits. Military service, when combined with civilian federal service, can boost the number of credits veterans need to qualify for Social Security or increase the amount of their monthly benefit. This can make a significant difference in a veteran’s overall retirement income, particularly if they plan to retire early or have a gap between their federal retirement and when they become eligible for Social Security.

Veterans considering a buyback should weigh the long-term benefits carefully. The process requires an upfront financial investment, but for many veterans, the return on that investment is substantial. By adding valuable years of service to their federal retirement calculation, veterans can retire with more money in their pockets and greater peace of mind about their financial future.

Maximizing Your Federal Retirement with TriCARE Buyback

For veterans who have served their country and continue to serve the federal government, the TriCARE buyback program offers a powerful tool to enhance their retirement. By purchasing their military service time and crediting it toward their federal retirement, veterans can retire earlier, increase their pension, and coordinate healthcare benefits for a more secure future.",https://psretirement.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/article-1728025669.png,N,1.0,2025-12-31 11:11:53.991011

For many military families struggling with infertility, choosing between the two feels like a sacrifice they shouldn’t have to make.","(CNN) — Back in 2017, when my husband was still in the Army, we learned he was unexpectedly deploying right as we were going to start trying to get pregnant. Military families get accustomed to this pattern: You plan and the United States Armed Forces makes you go back to the drawing board.

Inconveniently, he had pre-deployment work travel pop up while I was ovulating, which is how we found ourselves explaining to the staff at a local fertility clinic that we needed to freeze my husband’s sperm so I could do an intrauterine insemination while he was away.

It was incredibly stressful. It was like the clinic had never dealt with a couple in our situation. We didn’t have fertility issues that we were aware of, but I was 37 and it felt like we didn’t have a month to waste. One staff member tried to charge us for a full IVF cycle, at a cost of at least $10,000. Ultimately, after a negotiation, we were able to get the job done a la carte for several hundred dollars.

The IUI didn’t work. Maybe I do have fertility issues, I thought. I wasn’t exactly young for having children.

I remember thinking how I wished I hadn’t switched to my husband’s military insurance, TRICARE. It covered only fertility issues related to “a serious or severe illness or injury while on active duty.” My employer-provided insurance did, though it was more expensive but significantly cheaper than paying for IVF out of pocket.

I should note that having the choice of two insurance options is something many military spouses do not have. My husband was at the end of his military career, and his home base was stationary. The constant moves that usually define military life wreak havoc on a military spouse finding a job, let alone maintaining a career. Military spouses have an unemployment rate four to five times the national average. TRICARE is often their only choice for medical coverage.

More than eight years after my failed IUI, as federal employees have seen an expansion in their fertility benefits, TRICARE still doesn’t offer fertility coverage. A couple of weeks ago, it really looked like it would, which is why as we ring in 2026, I am thinking of the military families struggling to have a baby, for whom this new year will be off to a bitter start.

They were banking on a provision in the massive defense bill signed into law by President Donald Trump just before the holidays that would have given them the same kind of access to fertility coverage that other federal employees have.

The IVF language easily passed out of committees in the House and Senate. But as the bill was buffed and polished into a final version for both chambers to pass and send to Trump’s desk, the IVF provision was stripped from the measure just days before a vote.

It was devastating for military family members like Courtney Deady and her husband, a member of the Ohio Air National Guard, who have been trying to have a baby for a decade.

They’ve spent $100,000 on multiple attempts to conceive by intrauterine insemination and in vitro fertilization.

“It’s the mental health, it’s the travel,” Deady said. “There’s so many other things, such as cryopreservation” of embryos.

Deady has one embryo left for one last round of IVF.

She was counting on the fertility coverage in the defense bill. It seemed like it had a real shot. After all, Trump campaigned on making IVF more accessible, and this was the first National Defense Authorization Act he would sign after he reentered the White House.

Broken campaign promise

On the trail in 2024, Trump had pledged that “under the Trump administration, your government will pay for, or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for, all costs associated with IVF treatment.”

Deady voted for Trump, sold on his IVF promises.

She was buoyed by the executive order he signed in February to ease the financial burdens of fertility treatment and deflated when he signed a defense bill this month that did nothing to ease the financial burdens of IVF for military families.

“It honestly feels, for lack of better terms, more of a slap in the face to a lot of our community when our Congress is receiving a lot of those benefits that we so desperately would love to have on our end,” she told CNN.

Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a combat wounded veteran who battled infertility and ultimately conceived two children through IVF, was the Senate sponsor of the TRICARE coverage provision.

Duckworth blames House Speaker Mike Johnson for removing it last minute from the bill.

“The committees in both chambers support this. There’s nobody opposing this other than Speaker Johnson and his religious views,” she told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”

“The president of the United States … promised on the campaign trail to make IVF available to all Americans, and I can’t think of a better place to make it available than to the men and women of this great nation,” the Illinois Democrat said.

Duckworth sent a letter to Trump with a handwritten note: “Speaker Johnson wants you to become the deadbeat dad of IVF,” a reference to Trump’s description of himself as “the father of IVF.”

Johnson’s home state of Louisiana has some of the most restrictive laws in the country governing IVF, emblematic of the influence of anti-abortion activists in the state.

Louisiana is the only state to prohibit patients and clinics from disposing of unused embryos, requiring they be shipped out of state.

A spokesperson for Johnson’s office told CNN that expanding access to IVF remains a priority.

“President Trump and Congressional Republicans have been working to lower costs and expand access to IVF. The Speaker has clearly and repeatedly stated he is supportive of access to IVF when sufficient pro-life protections are in place, and he will continue to be supportive when it is done responsibly and ethically,” they said in a statement.

Deady, who also works as the community support director of Building Military Families Network, a nonprofit for military families experiencing difficulties with fertility, rejects the position.

“When we’ve — all of our families — have really thought logically and we’ve prayed about it or we’ve done the research to figure out what, ethically, this journey looks like for us and to not have that, it goes to show that there’s a … lack of education when it comes to this realm of reproductive medicine,” she told CNN.

There was bipartisan disappointment in the last-minute yanking of the IVF provision and, in the House, a group of veterans and lawmakers representing significant military communities has already reintroduced IVF coverage in TRICARE.

Republican Rep. Nick LaLota of New York, a Navy veteran, is among them.

“Since 2023, Congress has rightly focused on strengthening military recruitment and retention by increasing troop pay, improving housing, expanding health care, and investing in quality of life for servicemembers and their families. Now, Congress should expand access to IVF, as many civilian employers already do, to build on that progress and help ensure America maintains the most lethal fighting force the world has ever known,” he said in a statement.

Republican Rep. Jennifer Kiggans, who represents a large number of military families in her Virginia district, which includes Virginia Beach and areas around Norfolk, the largest naval base in the country, said that “Military families already sacrifice so much in service to our nation. Access to IVF and fertility care shouldn’t depend on financial means.”

A sacrifice families shouldn’t have to make

I am writing this column with my 7-year-old son fast asleep in his bed, counting my blessings that my failed IUI was my one and only fertility treatment.

After it, my husband returned home from his work trip but deployed before I expected to ovulate again. So, when I realized I was pregnant long after he deployed, it felt like a miracle, especially when my first sonogram showed I was pregnant with twins.

A few weeks after, another sonogram showed I had what’s called “a vanishing twin.” The second embryo had failed to develop. But there was still one. We made it through a large subchorionic hemorrhage of my placenta and a few other difficult moments, including my water breaking a month early while my husband was in Asia on a graduation trip for his eldest child not long after returning from his deployment. Somehow, he made it back for the final minutes of my labor to see our son born.

Not even a year later, my husband deployed again, for longer this time. Military family life was a lot for me to manage, caring for a baby and my young stepson as well, but I can’t imagine not having the chance. Being a military spouse has been one of the best experiences of my life, but nothing surpasses being a mom.

For many military families struggling with infertility, choosing between the two feels like a sacrifice they shouldn’t have to make.
