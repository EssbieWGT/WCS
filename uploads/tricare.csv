What Is TRICARE Prime?
If many of you don’t know, let’s first discuss what TRICARE Prime is.
The nice thing about TRICARE Prime Remote is that it provides the same kind of care and coverage as TRICARE Prime, but with more flexibility to use local doctors in rural or less-populated areas.
How to Enroll and the Cost We know the differences between the TRICARE Prime options, and of course, it’s important to know how to enroll and what the cost is.","In 2026, active-duty, military family members, and retirees living in Atlanta, Georgia, and Tampa, Florida, are going to have access to some new TRICARE Prime options. This is going to be effective at the beginning of 2026, and thanks to the award, that is making this possible, as they are running a three-year demonstration project to provide TRICARE Prime for 146,000 eligible beneficiaries in two cities.

What Is TRICARE Prime?

If many of you don’t know, let’s first discuss what TRICARE Prime is. It is basically a health insurance plan for military members, retirees, and their families.

It’s a lot like a civilian HMO (Health Maintenance Organization), and it is where you get most of your care through a network of approved doctors and hospitals.

One thing, though, the biggest benefit of TRICARE Prime is that it offers low-cost or no-cost care when you use approved providers and follow the rules of the program.

So when you enroll in TRICARE Prime, you’ll pick a Primary Care Manager (PCM), and this can be a doctor at a military clinic or hospital, or it might be a civilian doctor who works with TRICARE, which also becomes your main doctor.

Now, let’s see what TRICARE Prime covers:

Doctor visits for military families

Preventive care, like annual checkups and screenings

Hospital stays for military families

Emergency care for urgent attention

Mental health services

Prescriptions for illness

Specialist referrals from your main doctor

However, there’s just one important thing to know: TRICARE Prime is available only in certain areas, usually close to military bases, and it is not available to retirees and family members ages 65 and older who use TRICARE For Life and Medicare.

What Is TRICARE Prime Remote?

Now let’s talk about TRICARE Prime Remote – it’s a version of TRICARE Prime that is perfectly designed for active duty service members and their families who live far away from military hospitals or clinics, at least 50 miles or one hour away.

The nice thing about TRICARE Prime Remote is that it provides the same kind of care and coverage as TRICARE Prime, but with more flexibility to use local doctors in rural or less-populated areas.

If you’re one who qualifies for TRICARE Prime Remote, you still get assigned a Primary Care Manager, but it will be a civilian doctor instead of someone at a military base, and that doctor becomes your main contact for your health care, just like with TRICARE Prime.

There are just a few things you need to know about TRICARE Prime Remote:

It's only available to active duty members and their families

You must live in a remote area to qualify

You’ll use civilian doctors instead of military hospitals

Retirees and their families are not eligible

Even though the doctors are civilians, the plan still covers almost everything in the same way TRICARE Prime does because you usually don’t pay anything out of pocket, as long as you go to authorized providers.

How to Enroll and the Cost

We know the differences between the TRICARE Prime options, and of course, it’s important to know how to enroll and what the cost is.

If you want to sign up for either program, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Choose a Primary Care Manager: You may choose a military or network provider as your PCM. If you don’t list a PCM on your enrollment form, they'll choose one for you.

Step 2: Complete the Enrollment Application: Enroll all family members on one enrollment form and send enrollment fees (if applicable) with your enrollment form.

Step 3: Get Started with TRICARE Prime: Your regional contractor will notify you when your enrollment is processed. Once enrolled, you can log in to milConnect to download your enrollment card and get your PCM’s name and phone number.

The following are the costs for TRICARE Prime options:

Active Duty Service Members

No out-of-pocket costs

No enrollment fees

No network copayments

No point-of-service fees

Active Duty Family Members*

Minimal out-of-pocket costs

No enrollment fees

No network copayments

Point-of-service fees if using the point-of-service option

Retired Service Members, Their Family Members, and Other Beneficiaries

Annual enrollment fees

Network copayments

Point-of-service fees if using the point-of-service option

There are no deductibles when you stay in the TRICARE Prime network. If you go outside the network without a referral, though, you may have to pay much more.

Why Atlanta and Tampa Are Being Added

Until now, families and retirees in Atlanta and Tampa could not enroll in TRICARE Prime unless they lived on or near a military base, and now, the 2026 change adds these cities to the TRICARE Prime service area, which means there are more people who can now enroll in the low-cost, managed-care plan.

It’s actually a big win for retired military families who want better access to affordable care, as well as our active duty families who are tired of long drives to military clinics.

So, the next step for you is to take time to review your current plan, understand the costs, and get ready for open enrollment when the new TRICARE Prime options become available.

The lives of service members and their families are filled with many unique changes and unexpected events that may result in challenges with mental health.

“At the Department of Defense, we are building a culture where seeking mental health care is not only accepted—it’s fully supported,” wrote Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs at the beginning of May’s Mental Health Awareness Month. “From policy change and digital modernization to prevention programs and peer leadership, the Military Health System is transforming how we identify, support, and treat mental health needs across the force.”

Protecting, optimizing, and addressing mental health needs is vital to the readiness of the military force. Seeking support is a sign of strength and critical to maintaining and improving individual performance. For example, earlier this year the U.S. Air Force published a Mental Health Overview that explains the medical and nonmedical sources of support.

“We are encouraging people to take ownership of their psychological health. We all have a responsibility, and we believe the Mental Health Overview provides clarity on what is available to get you where you want to be,” said U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Elisha Pippin, Air Force Medical Service director of psychological health. “Mental health is the clinical component of a system of helping agencies. Providers are there ready to support the warfighter, to heal and improve so they can get back in the fight.”

Your Connection to Mental Health Resources

The Military Health System is committed to ensuring service members and their families have access to the services they need to take care of their mental health. The MHS Mental Health Hub provides a wealth of resources, important information, and several options to access care for service members, families, and veterans so they can find their footing and get back on track.

The hub offers a comprehensive listing of mental health services available through the MHS, including ways to seek care, tips from experts, and in-depth information on available resources.

You can connect directly to mental health support services near you with one click, as well as access your TRICARE benefit to learn more about your coverage.

Resources Available in the MHS Mental Health Hub:

• Brandon Act, which empowers service members to get the help they need confidentially. Reducing stigma is a key aspect of the Brandon Act, honoring U.S. Navy Petty Officer 3rd Class Brandon Caserta, who tragically died by suicide in 2018. His story spearheaded a DOD policy and congressional bill, passed as part of the FY22 National Defense Authorization Act. Service members can start the referral process by talking to their commander or supervisor.

• Targeted Care, originally a U.S. Air Force initiative that scaled across the entire military health enterprise. This gets you connected to the specific type of care you need after initial evaluation, whether it’s an individual appointment, group therapy or nonmedical support such as a chaplain or a military family life counselor.

• BRAVE, the Defense Health Agency Virtual Medical Center’s Behavioral Health Resources and Virtual Experience, is the enterprise program of tele-behavioral health to supplement care currently offered through more than 40 military hospitals and clinics in the U.S. and overseas. This service connects a service member with a counselor through virtual sessions.

• Real Warriors, the DOD’s public health campaign via social media designed to decrease stigma, increase psychological health literacy, and open doors to access to care by encouraging psychological health help seeking among active duty service members, veterans, and their families.

• inTransition, a free, confidential program that offers specialized coaching and assistance for active duty service members, National Guard members, reservists, veterans and retirees who need access to mental health care when they are:

o Relocating to another assignment

o Returning from deployment

o Transitioning from active duty to reserve component or reserve component to active duty

o Preparing to leave military service

o Any other time they need a new mental health provider or need a provider for the first time.

• TRICARE, the DOD’s worldwide health plan, covers mental health services through its worldwide network of civilian providers. In some cases, once a referral is approved, you can have an appointment within a few days. To set up a mental health appointment through TRICARE, visit: tricare.mil/MentalHealth.

• Uniformed Services University’s Consortium for Health and Military Performance, or CHAMP, offers dozens of fact sheets, articles and infographics to help strengthen your mental health and help you grow from adversity. Got a question on mental health? Send a message to their experts.

• The Psychological Health Resource Center is available 24/7 for service members, veterans, and family members with questions about psychological health topics. Different from a counseling service, the center has trained mental health consultants to help you access mental health care and community support resources in your local area. Call 1-866-966-1020, start a live chat, or visit the resource center.

“Every service member should know help is available, hope is real, and your mental health matters,” wrote Ferrara. “Together, we are building a military where strength includes seeking support–and where no one fights alone.”",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,1.0,2025-05-20 16:56:22.393952

This comprehensive report provides crucial insights into the expanding role of community blood centers in supporting prehospital blood transfusion programs across the United States. It reveals that the number of community blood centers providing blood products for prehospital use has nearly doubled between 2022 and 2024, underscoring the rapid growth and increasing importance of these life-saving programs.

""Community blood centers are playing a pivotal role in the rapid expansion of prehospital blood programs across the nation. Our latest report shows an 89% increase in participating community blood centers over just two years, highlighting their commitment to expanding the availability of blood products and improving patient outcomes. As these programs continue to expand, America’s Blood Centers will keep working with our members, partners, and allies to address the significant barriers that currently prevent many patients from quickly receiving the blood products they need,” said Kate Fry, CEO of America’s Blood Centers.

The report reveals a significant upward trend in community blood center participation in prehospital programs. In 2022, 18 centers provided blood products for prehospital use, with 7 servicing both air and ground ambulance programs. By 2024, this number had nearly doubled to 34 centers, with 18 supporting both air and ground services. The study also highlights a dramatic increase in the supply of specific blood products for prehospital use, particularly Low Titer-O Whole Blood and Type-A Liquid Plasma units.

Based on annual surveys conducted from 2022 to 2024, the report offers valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders in both the blood community and emergency medical services,underscoring the need for sustainable funding models, optimized inventory management, and enhanced donor recruitment strategies to support the growth of prehospital blood programs. The study notes that less than 2% of all emergency management systems carry blood and blood products today, indicating significant potential for future growth if current roadblocks were addressed.

America’s Blood Centers and its members urge Congress to modernize our nation’s approach to prehospital blood transfusions by updating federal insurance program payment polices to provide sufficient reimbursement for prehospital blood transfusions including updating TRICARE payment policy to remove financial barriers and allow for broader adoption of prehospital blood transfusions which supports TRICARE’s mission to improve the health of the military and their families and, in turn, helps support the security of the United States.

Founded in 1962, America’s Blood Centers (ABC) is the national organization bringing together community-based, independent blood centers across North America. These organizations operate in more than 1,100 communities and provide close to 60 percent of the U.S. and a quarter of the Canadian blood supply.

And as with any TRICARE plan, it’s important to know how this program works. You should be familiar with certain terms that can help you make the most of your pharmacy benefit.

One of those terms is prior authorization.

“Prior authorization is a common term in the pharmacy industry,” said U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Leighcraft Shakes, deputy chief, Pharmacy Benefit Integration Branch at the Defense Health Agency. “Prior authorization is a routine process to ensure your prescription drug is medically necessary and cost effective.”

Keep in mind, prior authorization isn’t the same as pre-authorization. Pre-authorization is the process that TRICARE uses to approve medical care.

Note: If you have coverage through the US Family Health Plan, you don’t have coverage through the TRICARE Pharmacy Program. The USFHP has its own pharmacy plan.

Q: How does TRICARE determine which drugs require prior authorization?

A: The Department of Defense Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee meets quarterly to determine which drugs:

• Are included in the TRICARE pharmacy benefit

• Identify those that require prior authorization

• Establish any additional coverage rules that may apply

Drugs that require prior authorization may include but aren’t limited to:

• Prescription drugs specified by the DOD P&T Committee based on clinical appropriateness and widely accepted clinical guidelines

• Brand-name drugs that have generic equivalents

• Drugs subject to age or sex limitations

• Drugs prescribed in quantities that exceed standard limits

Q: What does prior authorization mean for me?

A: Before filling certain prescriptions, Express Scripts, the TRICARE Pharmacy Program contractor, reviews and authorizes the medication based on criteria developed by the DOD P&T Committee. Once approved, your pharmacist can fill the prescription.

Q: How do I know if my prescription needs prior authorization?

A: The TRICARE Formulary Search tool provides information about:

• Drugs that require prior authorization or have quantity limits

• Coverage and copayments

• Pharmacy forms

• Options for filling prescriptions

• Common drug interactions

To find out if your medication requires prior authorization, follow these steps:

1. Use the TRICARE Formulary Search tool to locate your medication.

2. When searching, make sure to include your biological sex and age.

3. Download and print your drug’s prior authorization form.

4. Give the form to your provider to complete and send back to Express Scripts. They can submit prior authorizations via mail, phone call, or fax.

Q: What’s an electronic prior authorization?

A: An electronic prior authorization, or ePA, is a simple, secure way for your provider to submit prior authorization requests. They can electronically submit prior authorizations for prescriptions filled:

• At a military pharmacy

• Through TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery

• At a TRICARE retail network pharmacy

Q: How long does the traditional prior authorization process take?

A: Prior authorization approval takes about 10 days after Express Scripts receives the request from your provider.

Q: What happens if my prior authorization is denied?

A: Express Scripts will notify both you and your provider of the denial, the appeal process, and actions that can be taken to facilitate further review and consideration. Other options include working with your provider to change to a different covered drug or paying out of pocket for your drug.

Q: With the TRICARE Pharmacy Program, where can I go to get my prescription filled?

A: According to the TRICARE Pharmacy Program Handbook, you can fill your prescriptions in several ways, including:

• Military pharmacies

• TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery

• TRICARE retail network pharmacies

• Non-network pharmacies

Military Medical Excellence

The Defense Health Agency (DHA) has proudly announced that 16 U.S. military hospitals have earned an “A” rating in the Spring 2025 Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade.

This recognition underscores the high standards of patient safety and quality care maintained by these facilities, which are crucial for service members and their families.

The Leapfrog Group, an independent national organization, evaluates hospitals based on up to 22 evidence-based patient safety measures.

These include errors, injuries, and infections.

Among eligible military hospitals participating in this assessment, a remarkable 73% received the highest grade, significantly surpassing the national average of 32%.

Commitment to Continued Excellence

This achievement highlights DHA’s ongoing efforts to integrate external safety evaluations into its quality assurance programs.

Dr. Paul Cordts, DHA’s deputy assistant director for medical affairs and chief medical officer, emphasized that these grades validate DHA’s commitment to meeting high standards for patients they serve.

“These most recent Leapfrog Safety Grades continue to validate DHA’s commitment to meeting high standards for the patients we are privileged to serve,”

Strategic Implications

Ensuring top-tier medical care enhances military readiness and resilience.

The U.S. military demonstrates leadership in adopting rigorous safety standards.

Transparent reporting may improve trust among service members and families.

Positive grades could justify increased funding for military medical facilities.

High-quality care supports U.S. humanitarian missions globally.

Diverse Stakeholders

The announcement involves several key stakeholders including the Defense Health Agency (DHA), The Leapfrog Group, Dr. Paul Cordts as a spokesperson on quality and safety matters, as well as U.S. service members and their families who benefit directly from these healthcare services.

Food for Thought

This recognition of military hospitals by The Leapfrog Group not only boosts confidence in the quality of care provided but also aligns with broader government initiatives aimed at improving public trust in federal services through transparency and accountability in healthcare delivery systems across the nation.

This is a success story.” That’s Dan Cnossen, a seven-time Paralympic medalist, former Navy SEAL and keynote speaker at the 2025 Military Health System Conference in Cleveland, Ohio.
“It’s steep, it’s too dark, it’s too rocky.
Speaking on how Ferrara saved his life, Cnossen said, “I owe him more than I can say.
Unparalleled Care, Perspective, and Focus Recalling his experience under the compassionate care of the doctors and nurses throughout the MHS, Cnossen wouldn’t have wanted to receive care anywhere else.","“Your mission is vital. I think you’re going to see in my story that I’m alive here, up on this really high platform, because of the Military Health System. This is a success story.”

That’s Dan Cnossen, a seven-time Paralympic medalist, former Navy SEAL and keynote speaker at the 2025 Military Health System Conference in Cleveland, Ohio.

Cnossen delivered his powerful story of perseverance and overcoming extraordinary challenges to nearly 2,000 conference participants, inspiring the audience with his captivating ability to set goals and shift perspective—even when it feels impossible.

In September 2009, Cnossen led a platoon in Taliban-controlled Helmand Province in Afghanistan. As he and his team moved into position on top of a hill overlooking the platoon’s target compound, everything changed in a flash of an instant.

“We got to the designated point and proceeded up the hill. It was about a 20-minute walk. We got to the top. I remember taking a step, and cautiously taking another step. I paused. Next thing I know, I saw a flash of light under my goggles,” he said.

Cnossen stepped on an improvised explosive device. “I needed my teammates. I remember feeling a rising sense of internal panic. I couldn’t do anything,” he said.

The details, he recalls, are few and far between. “It’s steep, it’s too dark, it’s too rocky. I remember landing on sharp rocks. It was slow and damaging to my body. [My team] dragged me by shoulder straps, rocks cutting into my body like knives. The medic was telling me to stay awake. That was my personal fight. I lack the words to describe this experience in detail. But for my teammates, it’s very tiring to do a body drag. It’s like a 60-second sprint.”

‘I Owe Him More Than I can Say’

As his teammate dragged him down the hill and into a helicopter, Cnossen blacked out. Thanks to the fast action of his team in Helmand, Cnossen was airlifted to Kandahar where a team of U.S. military doctors were ready to act. One of those doctors was Dr. Stephen Ferrara, now the acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs.

Eleven days later, Cnossen awoke from a medically induced coma at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland, now known as Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. His legs were gone, but he was alive.

Speaking on how Ferrara saved his life, Cnossen said, “I owe him more than I can say. He could have gone anywhere in the world to serve, but he accepted the call to serve in Afghanistan.”

A National Hero

A testament to his character, Cnossen recalls the worst part of his experience. Even after losing his legs, shattering his pelvis, and enduring seven-to-10 hours of painful surgeries week after week throughout his two-year recovery, the worse thing, he said, was “dealing with lying in an ICU bed, stuck. The platoon is going to deploy. I’m not there to share the risk. I’m here in this bed and I cannot get out. That was corrosive.”

Cnossen’s inspirational character and commitment to his team and mission were not lost on Ferrara. “We have a national hero and all-around amazing person here. A true American hero in every sense of the word,” said Ferrara of Cnossen during his opening remarks at the conference.

Enduring two years of pain, rehabilitation, and emotional distress, Cnossen did not give up. He made a conscious effort to change his mindset and overcome what many would consider unbearable.

“There’s this notion of perspective,” he said. “The way you look at a moment, there are many angles to look at a scenario. Ultimately, I had to look at the totality of the situation. Challenge yourself—there’s at least one good thing to find. My arms could work. My legs were long enough for prosthetics. My limbs were long enough. Maybe, I’ll get to run. That’s another thing I can look forward to. That was motivating.”

Bringing humor to his story, Cnossen shared that, as a double leg amputee, he would finally be over six feet tall. “Humor can really help,” he said.

Unparalleled Care, Perspective, and Focus

Recalling his experience under the compassionate care of the doctors and nurses throughout the MHS, Cnossen wouldn’t have wanted to receive care anywhere else. “All this care I was getting, this is the best place to be. The prosthetics I’m going to get, they’re the best. There’s no better place to be in this condition,” he said.

By intentionally shifting his perspective and focus, Cnossen found a path forward, first in rehabilitation at WRNMMC and eventually as a Paralympic athlete representing Team USA. He shifted his focus from what was lost to what remained: his functioning arms, his gratitude, and his life. This generated psychological momentum, driving him toward recovery and eventually, athletic excellence.

He also focused on making small steps: getting out of bed, meeting visitors, getting his wheelchair and eventually prosthetics, and just making it through the day. This gave him renewed purpose.

“That bomb in Afghanistan took my legs. Ultimately, it had to be up to me if it would take my life,” he said.

Cnossen was awarded a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star with Valor from the Secretary of the Navy. He is currently training to compete with Team USA in the 2026 Paralympic Games.

His captivating speech kicked off the four-day annual MHS Conference, hosted by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, which convened to share knowledge, advance innovation, and highlight new initiatives within the MHS.

Dr. Christine Bader, an MHS Digital Policy Council member, said the MHS made digital transformation a priority because digital health modernization and innovation are seen as catalysts and enablers for change.","Digital transformation continues to have a significant impact on the way people live and work at a rapid pace, and its influence on health care is no exception. As artificial intelligence capabilities become more widespread and sophisticated, the Department of Defense will respond with agility and flexibility to advance its responsible adoption of AI. Over the past six years, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs has worked to identify the necessary actions to enable advances and adoption of AI and machine learning across military medicine, while ensuring robust strategy, policies, governance, and safeguards are in place.

The Military Health System fosters, protects, sustains, and restores the health of active duty and reserve component forces to support the mission. The MHS has a unique mission supporting 9.5 million beneficiaries composed of uniformed service members, military retirees, and family members. The MHS started an initial artificial intelligence and machine learning inventory in 2018.

In 2019, the MHS started hosting annual workshops specifically geared towards AI and machine learning. An updated inventory was performed in 2023. Since 2024, the MHS’ goal is to focus on strategy, collaboration, and establishing guidelines aligned with the policies of the DOD’s Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office. Leveraging the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences was a natural fit to develop a strategic digital health framework for the MHS.

Digital health experts at USU were charged to lead development of this digital strategy beginning in December 2023. USU is the nation’s federal health professions academy with an emphasis on military health care, leadership, readiness, and public health. The work of the MHS Digital Transformation Executive Committee culminated in March 2025 with the publication of the premier MHS Digital Transformation Strategy. The strategy identifies four distinct lines of effort: invest in the existing digital health infrastructure; develop digital care models and empower digital self-care; develop a digitally competent medical workforce; and integrate AI and data management.

According to Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of defense for Health Affairs, the MHS Digital Transformation Strategy represents a commitment and “is a testament to our unwavering dedication to providing the full spectrum of advanced digital health technologies to improve health outcomes for our warfighters on the battlefield or in garrison and for their families to access person-centric, healthcare tools. It harnesses America’s innate and nearly infinite capacity to innovate, enabling us to drive and master the future.”

Digital transformation refers to the process of integrating digital technologies, data analytics, and innovative processes into healthcare delivery, aiming to significantly improve the quality, efficiency, and accessibility of medical services, often including elements like telehealth, electronic health records, and patient portals, allowing for more personalized and data-driven patient care.

Susan Orsega, deputy assistant secretary of defense for Health Services Policy and Oversight, said “digital transformation in health care has created a culture of innovation and change across the medical community, and the MHS is no different.”

“Our medical teams are working to understand how digital tools can positively impact our beneficiaries’ health and military mission success,” she said. “As we continue to traverse the future of military medicine, we know digital tools can have a great influence on access to care, better patient outcomes, disease diagnosis, and prevention at home and abroad.”

To bring the strategy to life and support implementation, Ferrara chartered the MHS Digital Policy Council in March 2025. Led by Orsega, the council provides strategic implementation, guidance, and oversight of data governance and AI policy and ensures all MHS health data integration and digital adoption activities are transparent, mutually supporting, and shared across the components of the MHS.

The scope of their oversight includes the safe, secure, and trustworthy development and use of AI within health care, the enhancement and acceleration of enterprise data management, and the review and monitoring of developing data analytic platforms. The council is an integrator comprised of representatives from Health Affairs, USU, Defense Health Agency, and the military departments.

Dr. Christine Bader, an MHS Digital Policy Council member, said the MHS made digital transformation a priority because digital health modernization and innovation are seen as catalysts and enablers for change.

“The integration of digital health offers opportunities to increase operational readiness, improve clinical outcomes, enhance quality and safety, reduce risks, and fortify the resilience of the total force and all DOD beneficiaries,” said Bader, who currently serves as deputy director of the General Ronald H. Griffith Institute for Military Medical Professionalism and special assistant to the dean of the Daniel K. Inouye Graduate School of Nursing at USU.

According to Allen W. Middleton, a senior advisor to the president of USU, transforming the MHS into a digital health force multiplier is not an option, but necessary to ensure mission success across the DOD.

“Failing to embrace digital transformation will hinder the MHS’s ability to effectively support the National Defense Strategy, deliver the joint capabilities needed by the armed services and combatant commands, and provide quality care to the total force and DOD beneficiaries,” said Middleton. “A tightly integrated system, critical to which is digital transformation, is essential for the MHS to remain effective. If the MHS does not evolve into a digital health system, it risks falling behind in providing optimal health care, potentially jeopardizing the health and readiness of military personnel and their families.”

USU President Dr. Jonathan Woodson understands the value of digital health and its benefit to patients—saving the lives of service members and getting them back to the fight as quickly as possible. But equally as important is transforming how future military doctors and nurses are learning and shortening training times through adaptive learning and digital tools.

“USU is harnessing cutting edge AI technologies to revolutionize medical education, optimizing learning efficiency, engagement, and exam performance,” said Woodson. “These AI-driven innovations enhance curriculum, personalize interactive tutoring, provide high-fidelity exam preparation and medical-interviewing simulations. I think we will be able to accomplish moving students through the curriculum in three years.”

The transformation of digital health will continue to drive success on the battlefield, in military hospitals and clinics, and in MHS training and education venues for the next decade and beyond. With the support of innovative leaders and forward-thinkers throughout the organization in healthcare delivery, operational medicine informatics and teaching those skills at USU and at military hospitals and clinics will ensure they have the tools necessary to support the health and operational medicine needs of tomorrow.",,N,1.0,2025-05-20 14:56:41.164827

The MSCE is designed to foster operational and strategic medical collaboration between allied nations working to address common health security challenges.

“MSCE is more than an exchange—it is a strategic platform to shape the future of multinational medical engagement,” said U.S. Army Col. Larry J. McCord, CENTCOM command surgeon. In the face of evolving health threats and increasing operational demands, he added, MSCE provides a critical, real-time opportunity to connect, exchange insights, and align efforts across the medical domain to promote interoperability and improve continuity of patient care. Throughout the event, McCord encouraged participants to actively explore how their collective experiences can advance interoperability, training, and health across the region.

“As the premier developer of combat medical solutions for the Department of Defense, OPMED greatly appreciated the opportunity to participate in this exchange,” said U.S. Army Col. Owen L. Roberts, OPMED’s program manager. “We are laser-focused on rapid, mission-driven innovation—delivering agile, user-informed capabilities that respond to the urgent needs of those we serve. The MSCE was an opportunity to foster enhanced regional partnerships.”

McCord opened the event by challenging the attendees with five major operational tasks for the CENTCOM AOR: Maximizing capabilities in limited resource environments by better leveraging partner nations to provide healthcare solutions; utilizing information technology and innovative solutions to improve survivability rates; enabling real-time digital visualization of medical assets, patient management, and medical logistics to allow commanders to make risk-informed decisions; effectively responding to the changing character of drone warfare; and improving how the Joint Force works with partner nations in strategically critical regions.

“It was especially critical for us to hear directly from CENTCOM about the operational challenges they face,” said Roberts. “OPMED, with the rest of the Joint Service medical enterprise, is dedicated to finding solutions to these problem sets. This includes equipping commanders with a medical common operating picture to enhance situational awareness and decision-making.”

Meeting discussions focused on prolonged care in austere and resource-limited environments, with an emphasis on novel oxygen-generating or whole blood solutions that provide additional capabilities above freeze-dried and frozen plasma, Roberts said. Another key topic was electronic warfare and the ability of adversaries to use drones to target known electronic signals. As new medical capabilities are fielded—particularly those that generate data—they must avoid creating unique electronic “fingerprints” that can rapidly become real-time targets.

The conversation also addressed a major operational pivot—the transition from human-led patient evacuation to drone-enabled and autonomous evacuation solutions, potentially combined with remote monitoring of patients. This shift is seen as critical to maintaining pace with evolving battlefield conditions and will require aggressive support.

According to Roberts, the MSCE discussions reinforced the paradigm shift to Large-Scale Combat Operations, with an emphasis on prolonged field care. This requires aligning investments with new medical capabilities that can be fielded within 24 to 36 months. Overall, the session set the tone for forward-looking innovation driven in part by OPMED’s public-private partnerships, with an emphasis on delivering “tomorrow’s technology, today’s solution.”

OPMED rapidly provides effective medical solutions for the Joint Force, focusing on tailored acquisition to meet Service needs. The aim is to enhance lethality and survivability while promoting sustainable function and mobility, all while ensuring adaptability and affordability in battlefield medicine.

Lovell Government Services will serve as a Recovery Force Health Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) vendor, distributing the company’s HeelP.O.D. pressure off-loading device to these customers through federal contracting systems.

Pressure injuries are one of the most prevalent and costly hospital-acquired conditions in the U.S. Sacral pressure injuries are the leading cause of hospital-acquired pressure injuries, with heel ulcers ranking as the second leading cause. Over 2.5 million patients in the U.S. suffer from pressure injuries annually, resulting in significant pain, increased infection risks, a higher workload for hospital staff, and increased healthcare costs. Pressure injuries cost the U.S. healthcare system an estimated $12 billion annually, and hospitals urgently need effective offloading solutions to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs.

HeelP.O.D. is a unique pressure offloading device with an ‘open-air’ design that provides visual assurance of offloading and conveinent access to the foot with skin checks, dressing changes, debridement and range of motion therapy. The device is made a memory foam material that uses immersion and envelopment technology to continuously offload and maximize pressure redistribution of bony prominences.

Earlier this year, Recovery Force Health acquired HeelP.O.D from NelDerm, solidifying the company’s commitment to providing innovative prevention solutions addressing the top causes of hospital-acquired pressure injuries.

As Recovery Force Health’s SDVOSB Vendor, Lovell is excited to bring this product to federal healthcare providers. Recovery Force Health is now available through the Department of Veterans Affairs' Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), GSA Advantage, the Defense Logistics Agency's Electronic Catalog (ECAT), and the Department of Defense's Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA). Listing products on contract vehicles with Lovell streamlines the acquisition process while helping government agencies meet their SDVOSB procurement goals.

""We are proud to partner with Recovery Force Health to further our commitment to delivering first-class services to our veterans. This collaboration highlights our commitment to enhancing the lives of those who have served, ensuring they receive the top-quality care and support they deserve,"" said Chris Lovell, Major, USMC (Ret.), CEO of Lovell Government Services.

“We are pleased to announce our new partnership with Lovell Government Services. They have a legacy of serving our country and those who gave their service to our country, and it’s an honor to be a part of that,” said Chuck Young, Senior Director of Business Development. “HeelP.O.D. is a unique device for reducing heel pressure ulcers, and it also offers nursing staff an easy method of application, skin assessment and wound dressing changes. We’re confident that HeelP.O.D. will greatly impact the care and outcomes of our veterans.”

Of the eligible military hospitals participating in the grading assessment, 73% received an ""A"" grade.
Walter Reed National Military Medical Center was the first military test site for Leapfrog surveys.
The Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade program, updated twice a year, evaluates public and private hospitals.
""These latest grades should bolster our patients' confidence that they are receiving exceptional care at our military hospitals.""","The Defense Health Agency has announced that 16 military hospitals received an ""A"" rating in the latest Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade assessment for Spring 2025. These high grades reflect the DHA's ongoing dedication to transparency and providing high-quality care to service members and their families.

The Leapfrog Group is a national, independent organization focused on health care quality. The organization evaluates hospitals on a wide range of safety measures, including errors, injuries and infections. Leapfrog's grading system uses up to 22 evidence-based measures of patient safety.

A hospital must meet specific criteria to be eligible for participation in the Leapfrog safety assessment. In the Spring 2025 ratings, 32% of participating hospitals nationwide received the highest grade. Of the eligible military hospitals participating in the grading assessment, 73% received an ""A"" grade.

""These most recent Leapfrog Safety Grades continue to validate DHA's commitment to meeting high standards for the patients we are privileged to serve,"" said Dr. Paul Cordts, DHA's deputy assistant director for medical affairs and chief medical officer. ""We are proud that the care provided at these facilities ranks among the very best in the nation.""

DHA's engagement with Leapfrog began about seven years ago when it sought to incorporate Leapfrog's evaluations into the Military Health System's Quality Assurance Program. Walter Reed National Military Medical Center was the first military test site for Leapfrog surveys. After seeing positive results, DHA expanded the program across other eligible military hospitals.

""Our participation in this program showcases the consistent rigor our teams apply to safe, effective health care delivery."" said Cordts. "" We are proud of our medical teams' effort to meet the quality and safety metrics that Leapfrog has set.""

The Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade program, updated twice a year, evaluates public and private hospitals. Its grades are based on national standards for hospital safety and highlight risks that patients may face in a health care setting, including preventable medical errors and infections. The ratings are available to the public, making it easier for patients to understand the safety standards of their local health care facilities.

The 16 military hospitals that received an ""A"" grade in Spring 2025 are:

81st Medical Group, Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi

673rd Medical Group, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska

Alexander T. Augusta Military Medical Center, Fort Belvoir, Virginia

Blanchfield Army Community Hospital, Fort Campbell, Kentucky

Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, Texas

Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Cavazos, Texas

Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Fort Eisenhower, Georgia

Evans Army Community Hospital, Fort Carson, Colorado

Madigan Army Medical Center, Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington

Martin Army Community Hospital, Fort Benning, Georgia

Naval Medical Center Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina

Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Virginia

Naval Medical Center San Diego, San Diego, California

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland

William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Fort Bliss, Texas

U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, Guam

Some military hospitals were not included in the safety grades this spring because they did not meet the minimum requirements for reporting criteria used by Leapfrog. The DHA has instituted similar criteria internally to ensure patient safety for all facilities that did not qualify for official Leapfrog grades.

""We remain steadfast in our commitment to regular and transparent reporting about the quality of DHA's health care,"" said Cordts. ""These latest grades should bolster our patients' confidence that they are receiving exceptional care at our military hospitals.""",https://media.defense.gov/2025/May/20/2003718985/1280/1280/0/210423-F-PO640-9004R.JPG,N,1.0,2025-05-20 11:56:40.696995

If you ask someone what they think of NFL Hall of Famer Brett Favre, you most likely will get a strong opinion.
""Brett Favre ultimately ruined my life.""
When does the Netflix documentary on Brett Favre air?","A new Netflix documentary, ""UNTOLD: The Fall of Favre,"" explores the multifaceted life and career of Brett Favre.

The film examines both Favre's football accomplishments and controversies, including allegations of inappropriate messages sent to Jenn Sterger.

While Favre did not participate in the documentary, Sterger alleges Favre's actions negatively impacted her life.

If you ask someone what they think of NFL Hall of Famer Brett Favre, you most likely will get a strong opinion. What that opinion might be depends on who you ask.

Whether it's the family man who married his high school sweetheart, father of two daughters or the talented athlete who broke tons of records and led the Green Bay Packers to a Super Bowl win, Favre is a no doubt a sports hero.

You might have spotted him in movies such as ""There's Something About Mary"" alongside Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz or in ""Reggie's Prayer"" or any number of commercials, including for Wrangler jeans, Right Guard deodorant or Prilosec.

But then there's the other side. Jenn Sterger, who worked for the New York Jets at the same time Favre was on the team, alleges Favre sent her text messages, some of which included explicit photos.

The many sides of Favre are explored in a new Netflix documentary about the star athlete, taking him from his early days of football with father, Irvin, and at the University of Southern Mississippi to today and the shadows that cloud his shining star.

Netflix's ""UNTOLD: The Fall of Favre,"" directed by Rebecca Gitlitz, gives an in-depth look at the public figure, exploring his football career as well as some of the controversies that surround him, the most recent of which is the Mississippi welfare fraud scandal.

While he has never been accused of a crime, he received more than $1 million for speaking engagements that never materialized. Favre returned the money, but he is a party in a civil lawsuit connected with the case. Favre denies any wrongdoing.

Add to that the investments in and campaigns for Prevacus, which was supposed to produce a miracle concussion drug, and World Health Industries, producer of RxPro, another miracle drug, this for pain relief. It turns out, the pain cream scheme was a fraud that resulted in more than $1.5 billion in losses to TRICARE and other health care benefit providers.

The fraud eventually sent dozens to prison. As an investor, however, Favre was not a party to the fraud itself, and was never charged with any crimes connected to it.

You get the drift. While Favre may be a superhero on the field, he is also a man, like any other.

The tone for the documentary is set right away with an appearance by Michael Vick, another star quarterback whose star was tarnished by choices he made off-field. While Vick was able to overcome his past and return to coach college football, the shadow remains.

Gitlitz said in an interview with the Hattiesburg American and Clarion Ledger that she wanted to show people that there is more than one side to a person, and some of those sides can be complex.

What are the highlights of the Favre documentary?

The documentary focuses heavily on Sterger and the controversy surrounding her connection with Favre. It shows Sterger's rise to fame up to the point when the infamous text messages began rolling in.

Sterger said when the news broke about the texts, her life was ruined. She says she's not the only one who was affected by the radiation surrounding Favre's star.

""We get left in the wake because we were never the story,"" Sterger said in the documentary. ""Brett Favre ultimately ruined my life.""

There are other familiar faces in the documentary, including U.S. Congressman Bennie Thompson and longtime sports columnist Rick Cleveland.

Favre himself, although the center of the documentary, did not give an interview, nor did any of the people closest to him, despite attempts made by Gitlitz and her team.

The director said the documentary isn't just about Favre and Sterger or Favre and football.

There are many aspects Gitlitz explored, including how other people are impacted by Favre, whether it is to be in awe of his football skills, adore him as a family man or question his character because of his connections and the allegations made against him.

""There are numerous narratives that needed to be unpacked here, so I really meant for all sides of the story (to be told),"" Gitlitz said. ""You cannot take away from what Brett Favre did on the field. I wouldn't want to take away that he was a charismatic guy. I think that it's OK for two things to exist at the same time.""

When does the Netflix documentary on Brett Favre air?

""Untold, the Fall of Favre"" is according to Netflix an ""eye-opening documentary"" that ""delves into Brett Favre's controversial career, the dark side of sports stardom and the scandals that marred his legacy.""

It airs on the streaming service starting Tuesday, May 20 at 2 a.m. Central time.","https://www.hattiesburgamerican.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/17/PHAT/83693281007-untold-the-fall-of-favre-ss-12287177-b.jpg?crop=2011,1131,x0,y300&width=2011&height=1131&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,0.0,2025-05-20 03:56:18.272672

And I think President Trump has a great place to start by supporting our bill to expand IVF coverage for military families.","NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!

Today, May 19, 2025, is the deadline for policy recommendations on ways to implement President Donald Trump’s executive order to expand access to in vitro fertilization (IVF) and lower its costs. And while his administration is currently contemplating some bizarre and patronizing ways to raise birth rates, like baby bonuses and motherhood awards, my suggestion is to support military families who desperately want to grow their families.

I’m incredibly proud to represent San Diego, the biggest military community in the country, which is home to 110,000 active-duty service members and more than 118,000 of their family members. So, I hear all the time about their lives and their struggles to pay rent and put food on the table, their inability to find reliable childcare, their concerns about their safety, and their journeys with infertility.

For example, a senior-enlisted sailor, Matt, shared with me that he and his wife Jenny had two daughters via IVF – after five miscarriages, seven frozen embryo transfers, 600 shots and spending $80,000.

PRO-LIFE LEADERS URGE TRUMP TO REVERSE HIS IVF STAND, SAY THE TECHNOLOGY IS 'NOT PRO-LIFE'

About a quarter of active-duty service members and military spouses report infertility, which is double the national average of the general population. When we think about the level of sacrifices we’re asking from our military families, their struggles with infertility make sense.

Our service members endure physically intensive training, demanding schedules, and frequent relocations during their prime reproductive years. Deployments are often long and stressful, where they’re physically separated from their partner, which also takes an emotional toll. On top of that, military service also means living and working in hazardous environments that can negatively impact fertility.

Despite all of these well-documented stressors, TRICARE, the country’s military health insurance plan, only covers fertility services for those who can prove a service connection to injury or illness, which is often impossible to do. This leaves our military families with three realistic options: pay tens of thousands of dollars out-of-pocket for a chance at a family, forgo having children or leave the military altogether.

The cost-of-living crisis is affecting everyone in our country, but especially military families, many of whom live on fixed incomes and struggle to afford childcare, housing and food on the table. This isn’t a demographic that can easily afford tens of thousands of dollars out-of-pocket on anything, so folks are leaving the military for this coverage, worsening our recruitment and retention challenges and impacting our military readiness.

FLASHBACK: TRUMP SEEKS TO EXPAND FERTILITY COVERAGE, AFTER TIM WALZ ONCE ACCUSED HIM OF BEING ‘ANTI-IVF’

Military families need IVF access. They deserve it. And they’ve earned it. That’s why I introduced the ""IVF for Military Families Act"" alongside Illinois Democrat Senator Tammy Duckworth to require TRICARE to cover infertility diagnosis and treatment, including IVF. Our legislation would cover up to three complete egg retrievals, unlimited embryo transfers, and the necessary medications for IVF and intrauterine insemination (IUI).

CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION

Starting this year, members of Congress and our staff have access to comprehensive infertility treatment, including IVF coverage, just like many other civilian employees in the federal and private sectors. We shouldn’t have access to benefits that our military families don’t have. But despite this hypocrisy, our bill still lacks support from my Republican colleagues in both the House and Senate.

I’m (obviously) skeptical of Trump’s commitment to expanding IVF access, but he has called himself the ""Fertilization President"" and the ""father of IVF."" If he wants that to be true, he should throw his support behind a demographic that has already sacrificed so much for the safety and security of our country: our military families.

NASCAR STAR'S WIFE THANKS TRUMP FOR IVF EXECUTIVE ORDER: 'STEP FORWARD'

Expanding TRICARE coverage of IVF could be the watershed moment needed to change the entire market and ensure that everyone in our country has access to IVF. It could put market pressure on private insurers to include IVF and other fertility treatments in their healthcare coverage plans so they remain competitive.

This leaves our military families with three realistic options: pay tens of thousands of dollars out-of-pocket for a chance at a family, forgo having children or leave the military altogether.

While the IVF for Military Families Act would be a monumental step forward, the ultimate goal is for everyone to have access to the full range of reproductive care, so they have the power and the ability to decide when and if to have children.

We ask so much from our service members – to risk their safety, to be apart from their families, and to give up certain freedoms – but we shouldn’t ask them to give up their opportunity to build a family. As a country, we need to do more than say we value our military community, we need to actually show it. And I think President Trump has a great place to start by supporting our bill to expand IVF coverage for military families.",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/02/ap25056812814521.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-20 03:56:21.881420

If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

Active-duty family members, retirees and their eligible family members who live in Atlanta or Tampa, Florida, will have a new option for health care next year: Tricare Prime managed by CareSource Military and Veterans.

The nonprofit organization was awarded a contract in 2024 to run a three-year demonstration project to provide Tricare Prime, the Defense Department's managed care-style health program, to more than 146,000 eligible beneficiaries in the two cities, beginning in 2026.

The new agreement, which will run through 2029, gives another health care option for military beneficiaries and allows the Defense Health Agency to evaluate having other health care entities manage portions of the Tricare patient load alongside Humana Government Business, which holds the Tricare East Region contract.

""Tricare Prime Atlanta and Tricare Prime Tampa represent an innovative approach to advance access to care, enhance the patient experience, and strive for better health outcomes,"" Dr. David Krulak, director of the Tricare Health Plan at the DHA, said in a statement May 7. ""The data we get from this demonstration will inform future Tricare innovations nationwide.""

Atlanta previously served as a test bed for a three-year Tricare Prime pilot run by Humana and Kaiser Permanente, the nonprofit considered to be a pioneer in health maintenance organization programs.

That program, which ended in 2022, sought to determine whether the DHA could provide ""value-based care"" -- a health system that pays providers based on performance, quality and value as opposed to volume.

Atlanta was home to the Army's Fort McPherson until 2011 when it was closed as part of the Pentagon's 2005 Base Realignment and Closure effort. When it closed, nearly 30,000 military retirees and their families lived in the area, and Georgia has become an increasingly popular retirement state for military personnel.

Tampa is the home of U.S. Central Command and MacDill Air Force Base, with roughly 34,000 military dependents and 133,000 retirees, according to Defense Department data.

Interested patients will be able to enroll in the new Tricare Prime option during open season, which runs from early November through early December. During open season, beneficiaries can switch between Tricare programs such as Prime or Select or unique plans offered in various locations.

CareSource is a managed-care and health insurance organization that provides programs and services to 2 million people. After receiving the Tricare Prime program contract last November, the company's chief executive officer said the new programs are intended to increase access to care for Tricare Prime beneficiaries and provide personalized support.

""We are honored to be entrusted with this vital responsibility,"" CareSource CEO Erhardt Preitauer said in a statement. ""Our team is dedicated to delivering a health plan that will provide military families with access to high-quality care that is uniquely tailored to their needs.""

[UPDATED MONTHLY: MOAA's TRICARE Toolkit]

Families of active-duty personnel who use Tricare Prime pay no annual enrollment fees, cost-shares or copayments. Retirees and their family members on Tricare Prime pay an annual enrollment fee, which, for most retirees, was $372 for an individual and $744 for a family in 2025.

Those beneficiaries also pay a $25 copay for a primary care visit, $38 per specialty care or urgent care visit, and $77 for an emergency room visit.

Defense Department spokesman Peter Graves said that the new programs are in addition to the Tricare health care programs already available in both cities, including existing military treatment facilities as well as Tricare Prime and Select managed by Humana.

Of the eligible military hospitals participating in the grading assessment, 73% received an ""A"" grade, according to a DHA release.
“Patient safety is at the heart of everything we do -- from the smallest interaction to the most critical decisions.
Additionally, military hospitals can use the data to measure and compare their performance to other participating hospitals and healthcare systems, leading to continual process improvement.
“Patient safety is more than a measure -- it’s a mindset,” Harrell said.","The Defense Health Agency announced May 5 that three military hospitals from Defense Health Network Central earned an “A” Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade for spring 2025.

The 81st Medical Group, Keesler Air Force Base, Miss.; the 673rd Medical Group, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska; and Brooke Army Medical Center, Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, Texas, are among the 16 military hospitals that received top honors for their excellence in patient safety, quality and transparency.

“This recognition underscores the exceptional quality of care delivered every day across the Military Health System,” said Maj. Gen. Thomas Harrell, director of Defense Health Network Central. “From routine visits to complex medical interventions, our teams are deeply committed to providing the highest standard of safe, quality care to every patient, every time.”

The Leapfrog Group is a national, independent organization focused on healthcare quality. The organization evaluates hospitals on a wide range of safety measures, including errors, injuries, and infections, as well as the safety and quality programs in place to prevent patient harm.

A hospital must meet specific criteria to be eligible for participation in the Leapfrog safety assessment. In the spring 2025 ratings, 32% of participating hospitals nationwide received the highest grade. Of the eligible military hospitals participating in the grading assessment, 73% received an ""A"" grade, according to a DHA release.

NORTHERN STARS

This year marks JBER’s third consecutive time scoring an “A” grade.

JBER hospital, fondly known as “J-Bear,” is a joint venture between the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs that offers primary, specialty, outpatient, and inpatient care to 25,000 enrolled beneficiaries in the Anchorage area.

“Our third consecutive ‘A’ grade from Leapfrog is a direct reflection of the relentless commitment our Airmen and staff demonstrate every day to patient safety, high-reliability practices, and mission-ready care,” said Air Force Col. Laura Baugh, 673rd Medical Group commander. “This recognition belongs to the 673rd Medical Group team, whose discipline and dedication continue to set the standard for military medicine.”

KEESLER KUDOS

This year marks Keesler Medical Center’s second consecutive year on Leapfrog’s “honor roll.”

The 81st Medical Group maintains medical readiness for worldwide contingencies by delivering safe, high-quality health care to more than 27,000 beneficiaries. The group also oversees five military medical treatment facilities spanning from Mobile, Ala., to New Orleans, La., coordinating care for over 80,000 beneficiaries along the Gulf Coast.

“This accomplishment marks a significant milestone for our hospital,” said Air Force Col. Peter Kulis, commander of the 81st Medical Group and director of Keesler Medical Center. “Patient safety is at the heart of everything we do -- from the smallest interaction to the most critical decisions. I’m deeply proud of our team, whose commitment and excellence ensure our patients receive the safest, highest-quality care possible.”

BAMC BRILLIANCE

Brooke Army Medical Center also made the spring “honor roll.”

BAMC is the largest and most robust military hospital and the only Level I Trauma Center within the Department of Defense, providing safe, high-quality care to service members, their families, veterans, and civilian emergency patients.

BAMC serves more than 250,000 military beneficiaries within San Antonio and the surrounding communities. As one of two Level I Trauma Centers in San Antonio, BAMC administers lifesaving care to civilian emergency patients from across 22 counties in Southwest Texas.

“BAMC is committed to providing our patients the best quality and safest care possible, and these results exemplify that commitment,” said Army Col. Kevin Kelly, BAMC commander. “We are very proud of this extraordinary accomplishment.”

Along with assessing patient safety measures, Leapfrog participation is also intended to foster transparency with patients and the public. Additionally, military hospitals can use the data to measure and compare their performance to other participating hospitals and healthcare systems, leading to continual process improvement.

“Patient safety is more than a measure -- it’s a mindset,” Harrell said. “I’m proud of our hospitals for leading the way in delivering trusted, high-reliability care and for continuously striving to raise the bar across the Military Health System.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2203/7093678/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-19 14:56:22.949007

The work of the MHS Digital Transformation Executive Committee culminated in March 2025 with the publication of the premier MHS Digital Transformation Strategy.
The council is an integrator comprised of representatives from Health Affairs, USU, Defense Health Agency, and the military departments.
Dr. Christine Bader, an MHS Digital Policy Council member, said the MHS made digital transformation a priority because digital health modernization and innovation are seen as catalysts and enablers for change.","Digital transformation continues to have a significant impact on the way people live and work at a rapid pace, and its influence on health care is no exception. As artificial intelligence capabilities become more widespread and sophisticated, the Department of Defense will respond with agility and flexibility to advance its responsible adoption of AI. Over the past six years, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs has worked to identify the necessary actions to enable advances and adoption of AI and machine learning across military medicine, while ensuring robust strategy, policies, governance, and safeguards are in place.

The Military Health System fosters, protects, sustains, and restores the health of active duty and reserve component forces to support the mission. The MHS has a unique mission supporting 9.5 million beneficiaries composed of uniformed service members, military retirees, and family members. The MHS started an initial artificial intelligence and machine learning inventory in 2018.

In 2019, the MHS started hosting annual workshops specifically geared towards AI and machine learning. An updated inventory was performed in 2023. Since 2024, the MHS’ goal is to focus on strategy, collaboration, and establishing guidelines aligned with the policies of the DOD’s Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office. Leveraging the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences was a natural fit to develop a strategic digital health framework for the MHS.

Digital health experts at USU were charged to lead development of this digital strategy beginning in December 2023. USU is the nation’s federal health professions academy with an emphasis on military health care, leadership, readiness, and public health. The work of the MHS Digital Transformation Executive Committee culminated in March 2025 with the publication of the premier MHS Digital Transformation Strategy. The strategy identifies four distinct lines of effort: invest in the existing digital health infrastructure; develop digital care models and empower digital self-care; develop a digitally competent medical workforce; and integrate AI and data management.

According to Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of defense for Health Affairs, the MHS Digital Transformation Strategy represents a commitment and “is a testament to our unwavering dedication to providing the full spectrum of advanced digital health technologies to improve health outcomes for our warfighters on the battlefield or in garrison and for their families to access person-centric, healthcare tools. It harnesses America’s innate and nearly infinite capacity to innovate, enabling us to drive and master the future.”

Digital transformation refers to the process of integrating digital technologies, data analytics, and innovative processes into healthcare delivery, aiming to significantly improve the quality, efficiency, and accessibility of medical services, often including elements like telehealth, electronic health records, and patient portals, allowing for more personalized and data-driven patient care.

Susan Orsega, deputy assistant secretary of defense for Health Services Policy and Oversight, said “digital transformation in health care has created a culture of innovation and change across the medical community, and the MHS is no different.”

“Our medical teams are working to understand how digital tools can positively impact our beneficiaries’ health and military mission success,” she said. “As we continue to traverse the future of military medicine, we know digital tools can have a great influence on access to care, better patient outcomes, disease diagnosis, and prevention at home and abroad.”

To bring the strategy to life and support implementation, Ferrara chartered the MHS Digital Policy Council in March 2025. Led by Orsega, the council provides strategic implementation, guidance, and oversight of data governance and AI policy and ensures all MHS health data integration and digital adoption activities are transparent, mutually supporting, and shared across the components of the MHS.

The scope of their oversight includes the safe, secure, and trustworthy development and use of AI within health care, the enhancement and acceleration of enterprise data management, and the review and monitoring of developing data analytic platforms. The council is an integrator comprised of representatives from Health Affairs, USU, Defense Health Agency, and the military departments.

Dr. Christine Bader, an MHS Digital Policy Council member, said the MHS made digital transformation a priority because digital health modernization and innovation are seen as catalysts and enablers for change.

“The integration of digital health offers opportunities to increase operational readiness, improve clinical outcomes, enhance quality and safety, reduce risks, and fortify the resilience of the total force and all DOD beneficiaries,” said Bader, who currently serves as deputy director of the General Ronald H. Griffith Institute for Military Medical Professionalism and special assistant to the dean of the Daniel K. Inouye Graduate School of Nursing at USU.

According to Allen W. Middleton, a senior advisor to the president of USU, transforming the MHS into a digital health force multiplier is not an option, but necessary to ensure mission success across the DOD.

“Failing to embrace digital transformation will hinder the MHS’s ability to effectively support the National Defense Strategy, deliver the joint capabilities needed by the armed services and combatant commands, and provide quality care to the total force and DOD beneficiaries,” said Middleton. “A tightly integrated system, critical to which is digital transformation, is essential for the MHS to remain effective. If the MHS does not evolve into a digital health system, it risks falling behind in providing optimal health care, potentially jeopardizing the health and readiness of military personnel and their families.”

USU President Dr. Jonathan Woodson understands the value of digital health and its benefit to patients—saving the lives of service members and getting them back to the fight as quickly as possible. But equally as important is transforming how future military doctors and nurses are learning and shortening training times through adaptive learning and digital tools.

“USU is harnessing cutting edge AI technologies to revolutionize medical education, optimizing learning efficiency, engagement, and exam performance,” said Woodson. “These AI-driven innovations enhance curriculum, personalize interactive tutoring, provide high-fidelity exam preparation and medical-interviewing simulations. I think we will be able to accomplish moving students through the curriculum in three years.”

The transformation of digital health will continue to drive success on the battlefield, in military hospitals and clinics, and in MHS training and education venues for the next decade and beyond. With the support of innovative leaders and forward-thinkers throughout the organization in healthcare delivery, operational medicine informatics and teaching those skills at USU and at military hospitals and clinics will ensure they have the tools necessary to support the health and operational medicine needs of tomorrow.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2203/7083262/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-19 14:56:25.961380

County Clerk Beth Fiegenschuh said employees who choose not to sign up for health insurance, can sign up for the cash-in-lieu option. She said the amount of the cash-in-lieu has to be set each year.

To be eligible for the cash-in-lieu option, an employee must be to be able to be added to their spouse’s group health insurance program, be on Tricare (military insurance) or both the employee and the spouse must be eligible for Medicare, according to Fiegenschuh.

Commissioner Randy Miller said the program benefits the employee and the county.

Did Zynex Deceive Investors with Inflated Revenue Figures? Lawsuit Alleges Misleading Practices

The lawsuit contends that Zynex engaged in a scheme to inflate its reported revenue by routinely sending patients more products, including electrodes, than were medically necessary. This practice, the suit alleges, drew scrutiny from insurers, most notably Tricare, the health care program for active-duty and retired U.S. military personnel, potentially leading to adverse consequences such as removal from insurer networks and government penalties.

Concerns surrounding Zynex’s business practices were amplified on June 4, 2024, with the publication of a report in the medical journal STAT. The report, titled “How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills,” detailed what it described as an “oversupplying scheme” whereby Zynex allegedly sent excessive monthly supplies, such as electrode pads and batteries, to generate higher billings to insurers. Following the publication of the STAT report, Zynex’s stock price reportedly fell by more than 5 percent.

The lawsuit further highlights Zynex’s disclosure on March 11, 2025, when the company announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2024. In its report, Zynex revealed a significant revenue shortfall in the fourth quarter, attributed to slower payments from certain payers. The company also disclosed that Tricare had temporarily suspended payments while it reviewed prior claims. This announcement triggered a sharp decline in Zynex’s share price, plummeting by more than 51 percent, according to the legal filing.

Tricare Suspension Exacerbates Financial Woes: Post-Lawsuit Report Reveals Deepening Revenue and Profit Decline.

The financial repercussions of the Tricare payment suspension and the alleged prior practices became more evident after the lawsuit was filed. On April 29, 2025, Zynex reported a substantial decline in its first-quarter 2025 financial performance. Net revenue for the quarter plummeted to $26.6 million, a sharp decrease from the $46.5 million reported in the same period of 2024. The company also saw its gross profit margin contract significantly, falling to 69 percent in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 80 percent in the prior year. This downturn resulted in an adjusted EBITDA loss of $11.8 million for the quarter, a stark contrast to the $1.7 million in adjusted EBITDA recorded in the first quarter of 2024.

During the subsequent earnings call, Zynex Chief Executive Officer Thomas Sandgaard directly addressed the TriCare payment suspension as a primary factor contributing to the disappointing first-quarter results. Mr. Sandgaard stated that the disruption had a significant impact on revenue calculations and prompted the company to initiate a restructuring effort to prepare for a potential prolonged halt in TriCare payments.

Looking ahead, Zynex has issued a muted revenue guidance of $27 million for the second quarter of 2025 and anticipates an earnings per share (EPS) loss of $0.20. Reflecting the considerable uncertainty surrounding its relationship with TriCare, a key payer, the company has withheld its full-year financial guidance.

Hagens Berman’s Launches Inquiry into Zynex's Disclosures Amidst Financial Turmoil

Shareholder rights law firm Hagens Berman has announced an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding Zynex's recent financial disclosures and the allegations leveled in the class-action suit.

“Our investigation seeks to determine whether the company sufficiently revealed the potential pitfalls inherent in its billing methodologies and its dependence on TriCare’s financial contributions,” said Reed Kathrein, the partner spearheading the firm's probe.

Richard Barton, who retired from the Army in 2012, holds a doctorate in Clinical Social Work and has served as an Army brigade behavioral officer and served as chief of services for the Army’s Social Work Services. His primary focus at Defense Health Agency-Public Health is on behavioral health and suicide prevention.

As a leader, you play a critical role in maintaining the well-being and readiness of your service members. An often-overlooked aspect of a service member's mental and emotional health is their relationship with gambling. While many gamble casually, excessive gambling can have consequences, including financial difficulties, relationship problems and decreased job performance.

The changing face of gambling

Access to gambling has evolved; no longer confined to gaming halls of the past, it’s now available 24/7 via personal computers and smartphones. A recent review of gambling and problematic gambling published in the August 2024 journal of public health, The Lancet, estimated the amount of money lost to gambling worldwide in 2025 will be nearly $531 billion .

Moreover, The Lancet study also found that 46 percent of adults and 18 percent of adolescents have gambled within 12 months. A January 2024 study conducted by the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services found that nearly 70 percent of its residents acknowledged gambling in the past year, with 10.7 percent gambling online and 10.2 percent betting on sports. In Department of Defense studies conducted over the past 30 years, 6.3–7.1 percent of service members reported having at least one gambling issue.

The impact of excessive gambling on military service members

Excessive gambling, also known as problem gambling, is a pattern of behavior that can lead to significant distress and impairment in daily life.

The military lifestyle can lead some service members to be susceptible to excessive gambling. Some of those factors include:

Using gambling to relieve periods of stress and anxiousness.

Turning to gambling to combat boredom, such as during extended periods of “hurry-up and wait.”

Easy access to online betting platforms and, in some duty locations, gaming facilities.

Social pressures from peers, especially while viewing sporting events.

Limited financial literacy and budgeting skills.

Excessive gambling can have serious consequences for service members, including:

Financial difficulties, such as debt and bankruptcy.

Relationship problems, including marital issues and estrangement from family and friends.

Decreased job performance and reduced readiness.

Increased risk of mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety.

Risk for increased alcohol, tobacco and substance abuse.

Disruptions to unit cohesion and morale.

Warning signs of excessive gambling

Early identification is critical in addressing excessive gambling. Leaders play a key role in identifying those struggling with this issue. Be on the lookout for the following warning signs:

Changes in behavior, such as increased irritability or mood swings.

Concerns or difficulties with paying bills or debts on time.

Frequent borrowing or requests for financial assistance.

Unexplained absences or tardiness.

Decreased participation in unit activities or social events.

Social media posts or conversations suggesting excessive gaming or betting.

Strategies for leader support for service members who may be having gambling issues

Leaders need to take steps to identify and support service members who may be struggling with excessive gambling.

Maintain an open-door policy: Encourage service members to come forward and discuss their concerns or struggles with excessive gambling.

Foster a supportive unit culture: Promote open communication to help reduce stigma around mental health concerns, including excessive gambling.

Promote peer support: Enable mentorship programs to help foster a culture of trust and provide a responsive support network.

Conduct regular unit assessments: Consistently assess unit cohesion and morale to identify potential issues, including those related to excessive gambling.

Identify and support the use of financial education and resources: Ensure service members know the base or installation services that offer budgeting and money management training.

Ensure access to counseling and support services: Make service members aware of, and facilitate access to, available services, including substance abuse treatment programs and financial counseling.

Develop a policy on excessive gambling: Mirror existing unit policies or develop a policy on excessive gambling and betting, including consequences for excessive behavior.

Maintain regular performance evaluations: Discuss any potential personal issues, such as excessive gaming or betting, as part of regular performance evaluations.

Stay informed: Keep up-to-date on the latest research and trends related to excessive gambling by military service members.

Conclusion

Excessive gambling is a serious issue that can lead to significant consequences for service members. Leaders are critical in identifying and supporting service members struggling with this issue. By maintaining an open-door policy, conducting regular unit assessments, and providing financial education and resources, military leaders can help service members who may be struggling with excessive gambling.

Remember, early identification and support are key in addressing excessive gambling. Working together can help service members overcome this issue and maintain their overall well-being and readiness.

Both of these bowls are seasoned with Shirasa Shokudo’s original sauce made from sesame oil and salt.
It used to offer its extremely popular “uni-don” (sea urchin bowl) but has since removed it from the menu temporarily due to a decrease in the local sea urchin population, according to Kikuchi.
Be sure to try Shirasa Shokudo during your next drive to Kouri Island.","An old Ryukyuan legend has it that a young couple accidentally fell from the sky onto Kouri Island, becoming the first inhabitants of what we know call the Okinawan islands.

As beautiful as it is mysterious, this tiny island is an ideal day trip. And the rice-bowl dishes topped with fresh local ingredients served at Shirasa Shokudo make it an ideal eatery for anyone to drop in on.

Luckily, you needn’t take to the skies to get there.

You can drive to Kouri Island from Okinawa Island by way of the 1.3-mile-long Kouri Bridge – Japan’s third-longest toll-free bridge.

“The view from our restaurant is fantastic,” says owner Sonoko Kikuchi. Located smack-dab in the middle of a sightseeing attraction, most patrons are travelers. “From here, you can see all of majestic Kouri Bridge with the beautiful white beach and blue sea right in front of you.”

Shirasa Shokudo’s popular “kaisen-don,” or seafood bowl, for 1,500 yen ($13) is an attraction unto itself. It comes with large servings of tuna, salmon, white fish and “umibudo,” the local favorite “sea grape” type of seaweed with a crispy texture that pops in the mouth like caviar. The dish is garnished with various seasonal vegetables and, if available, island octopus. It’s all served atop vinegar-seasoned rice.

The umibudo-don (sea grape bowl), for 1,200 yen, is another option.

Both of these bowls are seasoned with Shirasa Shokudo’s original sauce made from sesame oil and salt.

“Although soy sauce is usually used for rice-bowl dishes, we don’t use it because its dark-brown color spoils the colors of other ingredients,” Kukuchi explains. “Our house-made transparent sauce can keep or even brighten the colors of the other ingredients while highlighting the flavor of each fresh local food.”

According to Kikuchi, all the dishes in her restaurant are cooked completely from scratch.

“We don’t use any precooked stuff in our dishes,” she says. “In order to serve dishes made 100-percent from scratch, we always start preparing our ingredients at 3 a.m.”

In addition to these rice-bowls, the restaurant offers taco rice, fried rice, and “goya champuru” (bitter melon stir fry). It used to offer its extremely popular “uni-don” (sea urchin bowl) but has since removed it from the menu temporarily due to a decrease in the local sea urchin population, according to Kikuchi.

“Sea urchin cannot be cultured,” she says. “So instead of using imported sea urchin as a substitute, we decided to stop serving it until the local population increases.”

The restaurant’s seating options include tables as well as traditional tatami floor seating, accommodating about 80 people in all.

Be sure to try Shirasa Shokudo during your next drive to Kouri Island. Better yet – now you have one more reason drop in on this mysterious island.

In addition, the jury determined that Omnicare's parent company, CVS Health Corporation (CVS), which acquired Omnicare in 2015, caused the false claims to be submitted.
The government further alleged that CVS ""caused"" the claims to be submitted, as it was aware of deficiencies in Omnicare's practices but failed to correct them.
After the government rested its case, CVS filed a motion for a directed verdict, arguing that the government failed to satisfy its burden that CVS ""caused"" the false claims to be submitted.
Judge McMahon reserved judgment on the motion, finding that there was enough evidence for the jury to determine false claims liability for CVS.","On April 29, 2025, a federal jury in the Southern District of New York found Omnicare liable for illegally dispensing drugs to elderly and disabled people in long-term care facilities without legitimate prescriptions. A unanimous jury concluded that Omnicare, the largest long-term care pharmacy in the United States, fraudulently billed Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE, a government military healthcare program, for more than three million false claims totaling more than $135 million in damages — one of the largest jury verdicts ever in an FCA case. If trebled, damages could reach more than $400 million, plus penalties. In addition, the jury determined that Omnicare's parent company, CVS Health Corporation (CVS), which acquired Omnicare in 2015, caused the false claims to be submitted.

The relator, an Omnicare pharmacist, filed suit in 2015, and in 2019 the federal government, 29 states, and the District of Columbia intervened. The four-week jury trial began on April 1, 2025. The government alleged that Omnicare dispensed drugs to individuals in assisted living and other long-term residential facilities that were not supported by valid prescriptions under state law and then submitted claims for reimbursement for those prescriptions to the federal healthcare programs. The government further alleged that CVS ""caused"" the claims to be submitted, as it was aware of deficiencies in Omnicare's practices but failed to correct them. CVS focused its defense heavily on a materiality argument, arguing that the practice at issue was allowed by law in many states and accepted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

After the government rested its case, CVS filed a motion for a directed verdict, arguing that the government failed to satisfy its burden that CVS ""caused"" the false claims to be submitted. Judge McMahon reserved judgment on the motion, finding that there was enough evidence for the jury to determine false claims liability for CVS. Specifically, she found the evidence showed that CVS ""had ultimate oversight over Omnicare's compliance with Government program regulations — indeed, was required to do so by virtue of the [Corporate Integrity Agreement]"" that CVS had entered into in 2016 related to different conduct by Omnicare; and ""that [CVS] was aware of the compliance issues that underlie this case, and the fact that certain fixes had been proposed to remedy them"" but ""opted not to force [Omnicare] to adopt those fixes.""

The parties will submit briefing over the next month addressing the penalties to be assessed under the FCA, and CVS has said that it plans to appeal the decision. We at Qui Notes will continue to keep you updated on developments in the case.

I think the entire Reserve Retirement needs to be revamped for what we actually get after 20 years.

The Reserve Components are not what they used to be. It’s not BBQs and drinking on the weekends anymore. It’s high OPTEMPO with 29 days orders to JRTC/NTC and constant activations/deployments.

It’s time for the benefits to keep up with the current environmental/economic landscape.

You are a funny guy.

That’s true, but getting 100% is a battle in it of itself. I would rather just take the TRICARE immediately after 20 years and lock it in. Hell, I’ll even pay for it like I do already, just let me have it after I do the 20.
