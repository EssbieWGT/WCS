According to a recent report from KNSI Radio, 40-year-old Adelle Starin – who operated a store that sold baby products and toys – made false claims for reimbursement to the healthcare program TRICARE to the tune of $9 million.

Authorities say that TRICARE initially paid out the claims, but when it started rejecting them, she created a fictitious shell company – Sunshine Medical LLC – in which she falsely claimed she represented two lenders who needed financing to purchase supplies from her firm.

However, according to a previous press release from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), her firm “had no business operations or revenue.” Therefore, to pull off the scheme, she had to create fake invoices for Sunshine Medical LLC and send them to the lenders she claimed the firm represented.

All in all, she fraudulently raked in $9 million from her fabrications to TRICARE.

She pleaded guilty to wire fraud in December 2024 and was sentenced to three years of probation and ordered to pay $2.35 million in restitution in addition to her time behind bars.

In an email sent August 26 to The Dallas Express, DHA acknowledged receiving a request for records.
“We regret the substantial delay in processing requests,” DHA’s FOIA analyst wrote in the interim response.
The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), passed in 1967, states that “all federal agencies are required to respond to a FOIA request within 20 business days, unless there are ‘unusual circumstances,'” per the Department of Justice website.

In an email sent August 26 to The Dallas Express, DHA acknowledged receiving a request for records. However, the FOIA agent said the request was number 950 out of 951 open cases and estimated a completion date of October 8, 2025 — roughly three weeks after the statutory deadline.

“We regret the substantial delay in processing requests,” DHA’s FOIA analyst wrote in the interim response.

The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), passed in 1967, states that “all federal agencies are required to respond to a FOIA request within 20 business days, unless there are ‘unusual circumstances,'” per the Department of Justice website. The unusual circumstances include situations where it will take an exceptional amount of time to collect records from field offices, requests for large amounts of documents, or those that require consultation with another agency.

Delays are now common, and transparency advocates warn that mounting backlogs weaken the law’s role as a tool for public oversight of federal agencies.

Federal News Network has reported that FOIA offices across the government are chronically underfunded and understaffed, despite receiving a record 900,000 requests in fiscal 2022.

“FOIA offices have traditionally been understaffed and underbudgeted,” Marshall Hamilton, an executive at Tyler Technologies, told the outlet. He added that shortages are “a big reason why these [FOIA] backlogs are increasing governmentwide.”

The Defense Health Agency manages health care delivery for 9.5 million beneficiaries worldwide through TRICARE and serves as a medical combat support agency to the Army, Navy, and Air Force, according to the agency website. Its FOIA office is based in Falls Church, Virginia, and processes requests for multiple subcomponents, including Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System.

The agency’s handling of FOIA requests echoes similar struggles across the federal government.

On July 8, the Federal Communications Commission agreed to expedite the processing of an earlier records request from The Dallas Express due to a “compelling need” to inform the public about government affairs. Seven weeks later, the special government process intended to produce records quickly has still not produced any documents.

The Dallas Express recently reported that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services continues to cite COVID-19 as a reason for reduced FOIA capacity, despite the pandemic emergency ending more than two years ago. In another case, the Air Force blew past multiple deadlines for records regarding water contamination at Dyess Air Force Base before ultimately stating that no responsive documents existed.

Hamilton said agencies are increasingly turning to automation and artificial intelligence to manage FOIA case loads, describing the tools as “force multipliers” that can speed reviews and balance workloads among analysts. But without more staff and resources, watchdogs argue, the law’s guarantees of timely public access remain out of reach.",https://dallasexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Waiting-concept.-Human-skeleton-sitting-at-wooden-table-with-laptop-indoors-Image-by-New-AfricaShutterstock.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-31 11:56:13.928035

Q3 2025 Earnings Release: Mid-November 2025: Q3 results and refreshed guidance, including Galleri sales progress and R&D spending updates, are due.","Overview

GRAIL (Nasdaq: GRAL) is a Menlo Park–based biotech aiming to catch cancer early with a single blood test, Galleri. This test – launched in June 2021 while GRAIL was under Illumina – is now the company’s main product and is sold by prescription to adults at higher risk, mostly those aged 50 to 75. Galleri isn’t cheap (each test runs $699 to $949), but GRAIL has bolstered its revenue through strategic partnerships, including deals with Quest Diagnostics and TRICARE, and it’s eyeing pharma collaborations to detect minimal residual disease in the future. The balance sheet’s looking squeaky clean: GRAIL holds no debt (net debt/EBITDA: 0.00 compared to a market average of 1.41) and says it has enough cash to keep the lights on through 2028, thanks to tight cost controls and a 2024 restructuring plan.

Recent Performance

Since listing, GRAIL’s stock has nearly doubled, climbing from about $17.00 to $32.79 in the year up to August 30th, 2025—a jump of roughly 93%. That’s miles ahead of the S&P 500’s 13.6% one-year return through June 30th, 2025. Investors have clearly piled in, betting big on GRAIL’s early lead in cancer screening.

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

GRAIL’s top line is moving in the right direction: Q4 2024 revenue hit $38.3 million — a 26% increase year-on-year — while Q2 2025 revenue came in at $35.5 million, up 11% year-on-year, fueled by a 29% jump in U.S. Galleri test sales. Growth should keep rolling, with management aiming for mid-teens annual revenue growth through 2028. Partnerships with Quest Diagnostics and TRICARE, real-world trials like PATHFINDER 2 with the UK NHS, and a big ESMO 2025 data presentation keep GRAIL on the industry’s radar. Management is also gearing up for a crucial FDA PMA submission in the first half of 2026 and is expanding into pharma collaborations for detecting minimal residual disease, with analysts predicting $217 million in revenue by 2028.

Quality & Moat

Galleri is GRAIL’s crown jewel—a clinically validated multi-cancer early detection (MCED) test built on years of research and Illumina’s genomics know-how. The company is still running losses, and its operating margin is a deeply negative –472% (impairment-driven), but it’s making progress: non-GAAP adjusted gross profit clocked in at $16.1 million in Q2 2025, and net loss dropped a dramatic 93% year-on-year. With no net debt, a solid free cash flow ($17.0 million in Q4 2024), and a capped burn rate of $310 million for 2025, GRAIL’s runway stretches to 2028. CEO Bob Ragusa has kept a tight grip on spending, while the company’s patent portfolio and machine-learning data edge give it a defensive moat against rivals.

Valuation

GRAIL trades at an enterprise-to-sales multiple of 9.3x, far pricier than the biotech average of 4.4x. This lofty valuation reflects investors’ expectations for high growth and unique technology. Since GRAIL is still loss-making (so no P/E ratio) and doesn’t yet generate a free cash flow yield, classic valuation yardsticks don’t apply. Still, analysts see upside—a 12-month average price target of $38.33 (~17% above current levels), and Canaccord Genuity has gone even higher at $40.50, betting on clinical milestones and revenue growth. That premium price tag is underpinned by GRAIL’s first-mover advantage and fast-growing top line.

Market Sentiment

Sentiment has brightened as GRAIL clears clinical hurdles and reins in costs. The stock’s 50-day trend is down –10.9%, and volatility is high (42.9%, with a beta of 2.91). Appetite from big investors is strong: institutions own around 66.6% of shares, with Illumina and insiders holding another 14.5%, leaving a lean public float. The analyst camp mostly falls in the Moderate Buy territory (1 Buy, 2 Hold), and as upgrades have rolled in, short interest has faded. Surveyed media sentiment on competitors also tips favorably toward GRAIL, especially compared to Guardant.

Key Risks

Regulatory and Reimbursement Risk: Galleri’s future depends on FDA approval—slated for a submission in the first half of 2026—and later, on whether insurers will pay up. Regulatory setbacks or lukewarm advisory reviews could slow adoption and revenue growth.

Competition: Rivals like Exact Sciences (Cologuard), Guardant Health (Shield, Reveal), Roche, and others are vying for the same space. If competitors win broader insurance backing or show better results in the clinic, GRAIL’s market share could come under pressure.

Profitability and Cash Burn: GRAIL has plenty of cash, but it’s not profitable yet, and it’s burning through that cash pile. If it doesn’t turn the business around or keep a lid on spending, its financial runway past 2028 could shrink.

Concentrated Ownership and Volatility: With a small public float (around 20%) and high beta (2.91), GRAIL’s shares are prone to dramatic swings—something that could spook larger, more risk-averse investors and result in sharp short-term moves.

Valuation Premium: At more than 9x EV/Sales versus the market’s 4.4x average, GRAIL needs to keep delivering the goods. Any wobble in investor confidence or missed milestone could see that premium evaporate.

Bull Case

Rapid Revenue Adoption: Galleri’s sales took off, up 29% year-on-year in Q2 2025, proving there's strong demand for multi-cancer early detection.

First-Mover Advantage: GRAIL’s Galleri test was the first of its kind to hit the market, giving it a solid head start and a growing data trove to stay ahead of latecomers.

Extended Cash Runway: Restructuring and careful spending mean GRAIL has enough fuel in the tank—no cash worries through 2028, supporting more R&D and expansion.

Strategic Partnerships: Deals with Quest Diagnostics, TRICARE, the NHS’s PATHFINDER 2 trial, and pharma companies help GRAIL expand its reach and open up new revenue streams.

Analyst Upside Potential: Analysts see more to come, with an average price target of $38.33 and Canaccord Genuity going as high as $43, as clinical catalysts approach.

Bear Case

Uncertain FDA Timeline: The all-important PMA submission won’t happen until 2026—any holdups could delay growth and drag out losses.

High Valuation Relative to Peers: GRAIL’s 9.3x EV/Sales is well above the sector’s usual 4x to 5x range, so there’s no safety net if the company slips up.

Lack of Insurance Coverage: If GRAIL can’t secure broad Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance coverage, high out-of-pocket costs could keep its market size in check.

Competition Escalation: Bigger rivals like Exact Sciences and Guardant Health have more muscle on the commercial side and could secure insurance deals faster.

Execution and Scaling Risks: Expanding sales, marketing, and lab operations takes a lot of cash. If GRAIL fumbles scaling up, costs could balloon and margins could sag.

On Our Radar

ESMO 2025 Presentation: October 18–22, 2025: Watch for detailed interim results from the PATHFINDER 2 trial to be presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology conference (ESMO 2025).

Q3 2025 Earnings Release: Mid-November 2025: Q3 results and refreshed guidance, including Galleri sales progress and R&D spending updates, are due.

FDA PMA Submission: First half of 2026: The formal PMA submission for Galleri will be a pivotal regulatory moment for GRAIL’s U.S. ambitions.

Investment Conclusion

GRAIL is out in front of the multi-cancer early detection race, with strong Galleri sales and a clear set of milestones ahead. With no debt and enough cash through 2028, GRAIL has shaken off the bumps from its spin-off and is focused on scaling up its core product. But big hurdles remain—success still rests on execution, clearing regulatory hurdles, and winning over insurers. Valuation is lofty compared to the competition, which means there’s execution risk for new buyers. For investors looking to back a high-growth disruptor with a shot at changing cancer detection, GRAIL’s current price could look like an opportunity ahead of some big upcoming catalysts. However, those who need steady profits or more regulatory certainty might want to wait for further milestones to play out before jumping in.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fasset_snapshot_placeholder.original.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=733c218a6175c5f3b8215b90512f96d8,N,0.0,2025-08-30 23:56:08.958968

Does anyone know for certain if ...,Not Available,,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1n496qj/tricare_for_life_ending_coverage_with_last_date/,"Not having seen or even knowing about this being a thing, my PA was set to expire some time in late July.
My dr’s office completed & submitted the PA on 8/13 and they approved it.
I was originally started on Zepbound with a diagnosis of obesity.
I also had a long standing diagnosis of OSA (obstructive sleep apnea & required a CPAP machine).
I had a sleep study done just prior to starting Zepbound and was told I had @30+ apneic episodes per hour.","46yoF, HW228, SW 221 (lost 7lbs unassisted), started 1/4/24 & current dose 15mg (Pics just for the hell of it)

Does anyone know if ppl who have TFL will be eligible for the $499/mo discounted price even though they’re on governmental insurance? (in the past Lilly has completely excluded those who’re insured with governmental insurance from any discounted prices or assistance programs) I have Blue Cross Blue Shield—husband’s employer is the State—which does not & has never covered any weight loss drugs—Medicare A/B only (on disability with No part D) and TFL (husband is retired Army —22.5yrs) and over age 65.

What’s crazy is I got the dreaded break-up letter from Tricare dated 7/30/25 saying they would no longer cover after 8/31 but because it had gotten mixed in with other pre-sorted mail-I had no clue this was a thing till I discovered the letter on 8/25. Not having seen or even knowing about this being a thing, my PA was set to expire some time in late July. My dr’s office completed & submitted the PA on 8/13 and they approved it. So, I’m so hella baffled and confused by Tricare knowing the coverage was ending on 8/31 but still yet approved the PA on 8/13…I see so many of you going to get whatever last refills you can get only discovering your PA’s have been canceled.

~God, I just hate this.~

I’ve been on Zepbound since Jan 4, 2024 and have lost @50lbs (incredibly slow but grateful loser here) and I might be able to swing $499/mo but full price @$1200+?!? Absolutely not; there’s just no frikkin way.

I was originally started on Zepbound with a diagnosis of obesity. I also had a long standing diagnosis of OSA (obstructive sleep apnea & required a CPAP machine). I had a sleep study done just prior to starting Zepbound and was told I had @30+ apneic episodes per hour. After being on Zepbound for almost a year I had another study and was found to have less than 9 apneic episodes per hour and no longer requiring a CPAP machine. In addition- I also have Multiple Sclerosis, Hyperadrenergic POTS, ME/CFS, Metabolic Dysfunction with Hypothyroidism and Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis, High AF cholesterol and Diastolic Dysfunction (my heart pumps fine but cannot relax) Having a shit ton of immune deficiency conditions and conditions that affect my ability to be mobile and active; Zepbound has not just been a game changer at lowering inflammation and controlling my weight allowing me to move around with more ease & comfort…it’s given me my life back. I’m just so incredibly disappointed and frustrated with the powers at be denying me and all of you who have TFL affordability access to this medication.

FYI My next refill was due @9/3/25 but my civilian pharmacist was an absolute angel and was able to get me my last refill box early by running it on a vacation override. If you need to squeeze out your last refill box before tomorrow’s deadline & you use a civilian pharmacy-try this hack and see if they’ll come through for you too…",,N,0.0,2025-08-30 18:56:11.282025

The NCDA welcomed the news, which will see the addition of more than 480 public and fleet chargers across the province to improve access for EV drivers. But the association also cautioned that charging infrastructure alone will not deliver the federal government and B.C.’s ambitious zero-emission vehicle targets “without action on affordability and policy timelines.”

“This investment is good news, but it won’t matter if British Columbians can’t afford the vehicles,” said Blair Qualey, President and CEO of the NCDA, in a statement. “The federal and provincial governments must re-establish EV rebate programs and put the brakes on unrealistic ZEV mandates. Without immediate action, these targets will remain out of reach — and consumers will be left behind.”

The NCDA said rebates are necessary. The ones under the CleanBC Go Electric program are currently on pause and pending review. And at the federal level, iZEV support is also under review. The association said the programs have been critical to making EVs more affordable for consumers and helping with uptake.

They also cautioned that mandates need a reality check, as the federal government’s national mandate/targets are not achievable due to the incentive situation, market readiness, and conditions that no longer exist. Rather, the association is advocating for a three-pillar approach to EV adoption: affordability through incentives, infrastructure, and education to build consumer confidence.

“All three must work together,” said Qualey. “Government cannot remove one leg of the stool and expect the system to stay upright. We are urging both levels of government to restore incentives and revisit ZEV policies before British Columbians are priced out of the market.”",https://tricorauto.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cropped-tricor-favicon-O-32x32.png,N,0.0,2025-08-30 15:56:10.214634
