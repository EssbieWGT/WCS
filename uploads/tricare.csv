Further details can be found at https://sayarc.com/tricare-approved-iop/

According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, substance abuse is a growing issue in the armed forces, with nearly 10% of veterans reporting substance use problems in the past year. This statistic underscores the increasing need for specialized programs tailored to the unique challenges faced by military personnel, and the IOP at the Addiction Resource Center provides a structured treatment option.

The center explains that IOPs are especially suitable for active duty service members who require more support than traditional outpatient therapy but do not need inpatient rehabilitation. This program focuses on helping individuals manage their substance use challenges while fulfilling their responsibilities at home, work, or within their military units.

The IOP's structure includes evidence-based treatment methods, such as group and individual therapy, designed to address the root causes of addiction. The program’s flexibility accommodates the unpredictable schedules of active duty members, with evening and weekend sessions to ensure that military duties can be prioritized alongside recovery.

The Addiction Resource Center’s clinicians are trained to address the unique stressors that military personnel face, such as deployment, PTSD, and reintegration into civilian life. Each treatment plan is personalized to meet the individual needs of the participant, ensuring that they receive care that is both effective and culturally sensitive. Tricare insurance coverage ensures that the program remains affordable, significantly reducing out-of-pocket costs for service members

In addition to individual and group therapy, the program includes family therapy and support to help loved ones navigate the recovery process. The Addiction Resource Center emphasizes the importance of providing a confidential, judgment-free environment to support the long-term recovery of military personnel.

SOURCE Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP","(MENAFN- PR Newswire) Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See .

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills."" The report claimed Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex further revealed ""Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims."" Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military.

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

Senator Murray has repeatedly voiced serious concerns over staffing shortages and decline in services at Naval Hospital Bremerton, spoke with Naval leadership about the issue last May on a visit to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard — PHOTOS HERE

Washington, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, sent a letter to the Acting Director of the Defense Health Agency (DHA), Dr. David Smith, expressing serious concerns over chronic staffing shortages at Naval Hospital Bremerton (NHB), which have forced the hospital to send hundreds of patients off base for medical care. In the letter, Murray outlined her alarm over the pattern of declining care and personnel mismanagement at one of the nation’s largest Naval bases and pressed Acting Director Smith for answers to questions including how the Military Health System and Defense Health Network plan to fill the vacancies in NHB’s Internal Medicine department.

“Naval Base Kitsap Bremerton is the third-largest Naval base in the country with 15,000 service personnel and 18,000 family members and retirees. Ensuring access to medical care for its servicemembers, retirees, and their families is crucial to maintaining military readiness. Yet NHB continues to experience staffing shortages, and no plan has been outlined to address them,” Murray wrote in the letter sent March 26th.

“In February, NHB spokesperson Doug Stutz confirmed that, since late November, the hospital’s internal medicine clinic has been staffed by only one physician for 2,200 patients. As a result, 700 retired military personnel and veterans have been transferred to facilities across Kitsap County. The reassignment of patients to new providers presents significant challenges, including disruptions in continuity of care which has led to gaps in treatment and potential declines in patient outcomes. It is also causing logistical and transportation barriers, particularly for older veterans or those with mobility limitations and difficulties in specialized care coordination, especially in designated Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs). These concerns must be addressed immediately,” Murray continued.

“The fact that DHA has struggled to resolve this issue with NHB within established military staffing systems raises serious concerns about whether DHA can address it in a timely manner. Furthermore, physician shortages have been an ongoing issue for the Kitsap County community, exacerbating NHB’s difficulties in recruiting and retaining medical personnel. Unfortunately, this downsize is part of a continuous trend in the declining quality of care at NHB,” Senator Murray wrote. “This pattern of declining care and personnel mismanagement at one of the largest Naval bases in the nation suggests a lack of attention to the healthcare needs of servicemembers, veterans, and their families in Kitsap County.”

Murray concluded by requesting a briefing from DHA detailing its plan to resolve long-term staffing shortages at NHB and prevent similar issues at other military medical facilities, and for answers to the following questions:

When will the Military Health System and Defense Health Network fill the vacancies in NHB’s Internal Medicine department?

What long-term policies and procedures are being implemented to improve NHB’s trajectory and ensure better quality of care for servicemembers, veterans, and their families?

How does DHA prioritize staffing of medical professionals based on base size and installation locations in high-risk and health shortage areas?

In a Senate Appropriations Defense subcommittee hearing last year, Senator Murray raised this issue with former Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro, pressing him on the Navy’s efforts to ensure adequate health care services are available at NHB as the facility faces a provider shortage combined with an increase in service members seeking care. And in a visit to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard last May, Murray spoke with Naval leadership about the reduction of services at NHB. Murray also sent a letter with former U.S. Representative Derek Kilmer raising concerns about the closure of the Labor and Delivery Department at NHB, among other issues, in October 2023.

A: You must have TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Prime Remote, or TRICARE Select.
You have 90 days from the date of DEERS registration to change your child’s enrollment to TRICARE Prime Overseas or TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas (if available and command-sponsored).","Are you expecting a baby in 2025? TRICARE covers many services to help you through pregnancy, childbirth, and after your baby is born. Prenatal and postpartum care helps keep both you and your baby healthy by catching any problems early—and, recent updates to the Childbirth and Breastfeeding Support Demonstration now bring more support options to families worldwide.

“These expanded services help military families get the support they need during a critical time in their lives,” said Jennifer Stankovic, health systems specialist, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “Our goal is to make sure military families have access to quality maternity support no matter where they live around the world.”

Coverage for maternity care and childbirth

As detailed in the TRICARE Maternity Care Brochure, TRICARE covers:

Obstetric visits during pregnancy

Ultrasounds

Prenatal and postpartum physical therapy and pelvic floor therapy

Prenatal carrier screening

Management of high-risk pregnancies

Hospital care during and after birth

Deliveries at TRICARE-certified and authorized birthing centers or deliveries planned at home (in the U.S.)

Breastfeeding support and breast pumps

Anesthesia for pain management during labor and delivery

Caesarean sections

Your costs depend on your TRICARE plan. Active duty service members and their family members with TRICARE Prime have no costs for maternity services.

How to get maternity care

Your path to maternity care depends on which TRICARE plan you have.

If you have TRICARE Prime:

Start by calling your primary care manager. Your PCM will help coordinate all your maternity care.

Does your military hospital or clinic have maternity services? If so, you’ll continue to receive care there.

If maternity care isn't available at your military hospital or clinic, your PCM will refer you to a civilian provider.

You don’t have copayments or cost-shares for covered services.

If you have TRICARE Prime Remote:

Your assigned PCM will direct your care.

You can see any TRICARE-authorized civilian provider with pre-approval from your regional contractor. Your PCM will help you with the pre-approval process.

If you have TRICARE Select:

You can see any TRICARE-approved provider without a referral.

If you see a network provider, you’ll pay less out-of-pocket, and they'll file claims for you.

Non-network providers might charge more, and you may need to file your own claims.

If you have TRICARE Young Adult:

You follow the same rules as the plan you chose—either TYA Prime or TYA Select.

With TYA Prime, you'll work with your assigned PCM for referrals.

With TYA Select, you can see any TRICARE-approved provider without a referral.

Remember: If you have a baby while on TYA, your child isn’t automatically covered by TRICARE unless the child's other parent is a military sponsor.

For overseas maternity care:

If you have TRICARE Prime Overseas, you’ll get care at military hospitals and clinics when available. Otherwise, your PCM will refer you to a civilian provider.

If you have TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas, you should contact the TRICARE Overseas contractor, International SOS, for assistance.

If you have TRICARE Select Overseas, you can see almost any TRICARE-authorized provider. You may need to pay upfront and file for reimbursement.

Dental care during your pregnancy

The TRICARE Dental Program provides a third cleaning in a 12-month period during pregnancy. To use this benefit, let your dental provider know that you're pregnant when scheduling your appointment.

Childbirth and Breastfeeding Support Demonstration updates

The Childbirth and Breastfeeding Support Demonstration gives you access to additional pregnancy and postnatal support. This program helps military families by covering services from specialized providers whose services aren’t otherwise covered by TRICARE.

Here are some answers to frequently asked questions about the CBSD.

Q: Can I use the CBSD?

A:

You must have TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Prime Remote, or TRICARE Select. (Note: You aren’t eligible if you have TRICARE For Life, the US Family Health Plan, or the Continued Health Care Benefit Program.)

You need to be at least 20 weeks pregnant for childbirth support or 27 weeks for breastfeeding support.

You must plan to give birth outside a military hospital or clinic.

Q: How has CBSD coverage changed in the U.S.?

A:

Doulas must now sign a participation agreement.

You now get a total of six hours of doula support (before or after birth) that can be divided by 15-minute increments, plus unlimited support during birth.

Doulas can’t charge you for covered services after you meet your deductible. They also can’t ask you to file your own claims.

Q: The CBSD expanded overseas Jan. 1. How do I access CBSD services overseas?

A: You can register for CBSD services with International SOS at any point in pregnancy, before getting any services. They'll try to find a provider within 14 days. You can start receiving care at 20 weeks of pregnancy.

The CBSD covers certified labor doulas who support you during pregnancy, birth, and postpartum, as well as lactation consultants and counselors who help with breastfeeding.

It’s important to know that TRICARE can’t guarantee CBSD services overseas. International SOS will try to find a provider for every eligible and interested beneficiary, but it may not always be possible.

Do you think you may move during your pregnancy? Contact your regional contractor to keep your care on track.

This demonstration runs through Dec. 31, 2026.

Coverage for your baby

Your baby gets their own TRICARE coverage after birth. But you need to take action to ensure continuous coverage:

Register your baby in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System within 90 days in the U.S. or 120 days overseas.

To register in DEERS, the sponsor must go to a Uniformed Services ID card office. Bring your baby's official birth certificate or FS-240 Consular Report of Birth Abroad.

If you miss the registration deadline, your baby will only be able to use military pharmacy services and get care at military hospitals and clinics if space is available.

After registering in DEERS, coverage works differently based on sponsor status:

Children of ADSMs are automatically enrolled in TRICARE Prime (if they live in a Prime Service Area in the U.S.) or TRICARE Select. Overseas, children are enrolled to TRICARE Select Overseas. You have 90 days from the date of DEERS registration to change your child’s enrollment to TRICARE Prime Overseas or TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas (if available and command-sponsored). You can change your child's plan within 90 days of DEERS registration.

Children of retirees aren’t automatically enrolled. You must submit enrollment forms to your regional contractor.

Children of TRICARE Reserve Select or TRICARE Retired Reserve enrollees aren’t automatically enrolled. You must submit enrollment forms to your regional contractor.

To check your child’s enrollment, visit milConnect within 90 days of birth.

Childbirth is also a Qualifying Life Event. This means you have 90 days to switch your family’s TRICARE health plan, if you want to make a change. All family members are eligible to change their health plan after a QLE.

NEW YORK, March 28, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Zynex, Inc. (""Zynex"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: ZYXI) and reminds investors of the May 19, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills."" The report claimed Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex further revealed ""Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims."" Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military.

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Zynex's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

To learn more about the Zynex, Inc. class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/ZYXI or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Related: Problems with Tricare Contract Transition 'Actively Harming' Military, Lawmaker Tells Pentagon Story Continues","The Defense Health Agency has extended several deadlines facing patients in the Tricare West Region as a result of the change in contract management to TriWest Healthcare Alliance on Jan. 1.

The agency announced Thursday that patients now have until April 30 to update their payment information with TriWest, get specialty care without prior authorization from the company, and receive care from non-network providers authorized by Tricare under the extension.

The postponement marks the fourth time patients have received a reprieve to update their payment information if they pay TriWest by bank draft or credit card. The original deadline was Dec. 31; it had been extended through Jan. 30 and subsequently Feb. 28 and March 31.

The deadline to receive specialty care without prior approval from TriWest -- a requirement for patients who use the Tricare Prime program -- also has been extended from March 31 until April 30. The waiver was initiated in late January due to problems with TriWest's referral portal that affected processing, according to Jacob Sanchez, referral management subject-matter expert for Tricare at the DHA.

And an original March 31 deadline regarding ""point of service"" care, or services provided by Tricare-authorized health providers who aren't in TriWest's network, also has been extended to April 30, according to DHA officials.

TriWest was awarded a 9-year, $65 billion contract to manage health care for 4.5 million beneficiaries in Tricare's West Region in December 2022; after a series of bid protests, it became effective in January.

Even before the contract began Jan. 1, however, patients and providers had concerns over the transition from former contractor Health Net Federal Services, with some providers saying they weren't aware of the change and patients worried that they would be required to switch physicians.

A Tricare West Region patient who requested anonymity to protect her health information said her primary care provider wasn't aware of any changes to the Tricare contract until just last week -- nearly four months into the transition -- and didn't know she had to apply to become part of TriWest's network.

""I still have no idea who I'm supposed to see,"" the patient said in an email to Military.com. ""I would prefer to stay with my current provider.""

For now, the Tricare patient will be able to see that provider until April 30. The point-of-service waiver allows patients to continue seeing doctors who were in Health Net's network who aren't yet enrolled with TriWest or will not become part of the new network.

According to the DHA, patients seeking care under the point-of-service waiver will still pay copayments, and they should ask any non-network providers whether they are authorized by Tricare.

""This means they're licensed by a state, accredited by a national organization, or meet other standards of the medical community [and] certified to provide benefits under Tricare,"" officials wrote in a statement.

Under the extension for specialty care, Tricare Prime beneficiaries still will need to see their primary care physicians for a referral but will not have to get authorization from TriWest to get care.

According to Tricare, they must have a copy of a referral from their primary care provider dated between Jan. 1 and April 30, as well as a copy of the waiver approval letter, which is available on the Tricare website.

The waiver for specialty care authorization does not apply to inpatient care, autism services, laboratory developed tests, and services under the Extended Care Health Option, a program that provides support for beneficiaries with special needs.

Patients enrolled in a Tricare premium-based plan, including Tricare Young Adult, Tricare Reserve Select and Tricare Retired Reserve also were given until April 30 to update their payment information with TriWest, according to Thursday's announcement.

Tricare officials said that if beneficiaries don't update their payment information or any fees before April 30, they will be disenrolled, retroactive to Jan. 1.

None of the enrollment requirements applies to Tricare for Life, the program for beneficiaries eligible for Medicare.

More information is available on the Tricare West Region website.

DOD’s acquisition and sustainment communities are primarily responsible for ensuring warfighters have the tools to fight and win in any conflict.
Michael said he’d work to rebuild the department’s relationship with the defense technology sector if confirmed.
“The military health system is a global leader in delivering world-class care, unmatched in excellence and second to none,” he said.
“A strong military health system is the cornerstone of our National Defense Strategy, and maintaining a medically ready force requires [an] integrated, innovative and adaptive health care system.” By C. Todd Lopez, DOD News","MARCH 28, 2025 – More efficient and faster acquisition, better technology and military hardware, and better medical care to keep service members healthy were among the commitments made on Capitol Hill by three Defense Department nominees.

Lawmakers from the Senate Armed Services Committee heard testimony from Michael P. Duffey, nominated for undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment; Emil G. Michael, nominated for undersecretary of defense for research and engineering; and Keith M. Bass, nominated for assistant secretary of defense for health affairs.

“If confirmed, I would assume responsibility to implement President [Donald J.] Trump’s mandate and [Defense] Secretary [Pete] Hegseth’s priorities by providing the military with the capabilities and force structure necessary to deter our adversaries and, if necessary, prevail in conflict,” Duffey said.

DOD’s acquisition and sustainment communities are primarily responsible for ensuring warfighters have the tools to fight and win in any conflict. Duffey said he would change how the department operates to achieve that goal.

“This will require the department to modernize how it manages the integration of requirements, budgeting and acquisition processes, aligning incentives to deliver results,” he said. “We must deepen our understanding of the strengths and vulnerabilities within our defense industrial base and seek to revitalize through reindustrialization, increased investment, flexible contracting, enhanced workforce recruitment and training and increased competition.”

If confirmed, Duffey told senators he’d focus on four priorities:

Accelerating the delivery of tools to warfighters.

Increasing the speed, performance and affordability of acquisition systems.

Strengthening the defense industrial base.

Bringing modern business systems and management practices to DOD.

Michael told senators that China is a strong competitor, and the U.S. must adapt to remain stronger.

“Time must be a factor in all of our decisions as we confront an increasingly sophisticated adversary in China, which not only has lower labor costs but is notorious for intellectual property theft, making its research and development costs even faster and less expensive than we could have imagined only a decade ago,” he said.

Michael said he’d work to rebuild the department’s relationship with the defense technology sector if confirmed.

“The DOD needs to foster a more robust and competitive defense industrial base by providing more realistic requirements, inviting [in] smaller and innovative companies with less burdensome processes, [and] becoming more agile in how and when we grant contracts,” he said.

It’s not the first time Michael has worked for the Defense Department. He told lawmakers he worked for then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates and played a role in developing the mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicle and Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization.

“If confirmed, I’d bring my decades of experience in the technology industry and management of large, complex, global organizations to ensure that the United States has the most technologically sophisticated defense systems in history,” he said.

If confirmed, Bass would be responsible for executing DOD’s medical mission and providing and maintaining readiness for medical services and support to service members.

“The military health system is a global leader in delivering world-class care, unmatched in excellence and second to none,” he said. “I’m excited about the future of military medicine and the opportunity to drive innovation and improve patient outcomes. By continuing to focus on modernization, technology, research, [and] care delivery, we can strengthen our operational readiness and set new standards.”

Bass said pressing issues in the military health care system include ensuring the readiness of American forces, recruiting and retaining medical personnel, and adapting to rapid technological advances.

“If confirmed, my highest priority will be ensuring the medical readiness of our forces [and] stabilizing the military health system to provide [the most] advanced care possible both on and off the battlefield,” he said. “A strong military health system is the cornerstone of our National Defense Strategy, and maintaining a medically ready force requires [an] integrated, innovative and adaptive health care system.”

Activities included demonstrations of knowledge about The Joint Commission; discussions on how the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) is used to monitor safe, high-quality care; and communication and leadership exercises designed to enhance patient safety and reduce medical errors. Staff also navigated an “Escape Room of Errors,” a hands-on challenge requiring participants to identify patient or environmental safety concerns before exiting the room.

The week concluded with the transfer of the Patient Safety Champion Belt from Primary Care Medical Home to the Emergency Department. The award recognizes entire departments for their safety practices and was presented to the ED for its proactive patient safety event reporting efforts from March 2024 to February 2025.

“A high-reliability culture requires staff at every level to feel comfortable sharing information and concerns with others, and they should be recognized when they do,” said Chief Medical Officer, Cmdr. Andrew McDermott.

Individual staff members were recognized with a “Good Catch!” award, which highlights safety events or potential problems identified and reported before they could cause harm to a patient. The following personnel received Patient Safety Champion certificates for their proactive efforts in upholding high-reliability care principles: Hospital Corpsman 3rd Class Justin Camaddo, Hospital Corpsman 2nd Class Denesha Lewis, Hospital Corpsman 2nd Class Shakirah Peterson-Wall, Lt.

“Our team’s commitment to patient safety is exceptional,” said McDermott. “Safety only works if we’re practicing it at the deckplate level.

The military health system faces persistent challenges in its structure, staffing, and the delivery of healthcare services.","WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today chaired a hearing examining several senior nominations for the Department of Defense, including those dealing with the Department of the Air Force, research and engineering, acquisition and sustainment, and health affairs.

During his opening statement submitted for the record by Senator Deb Fischer, R-Neb., Chairman Wicker covered the waterfront of responsibilities that each nominee would be tasked with if confirmed.

For the Department of the Air Force, the Chairman emphasized that the service needs to do more to boost space superiority and air dominance through better maintenance cycles, a focus on space control, and support for service personnel. For defense acquisition, Chairman Wicker referenced his “Freedom’s Forge” report and noted that there is much work to do in industrial base analysis and reforming defense procurement.

In a discussion about engineering and research at the Pentagon, the Chairman emphasized maintaining a technological edge over our adversaries by stewarding the Pentagon’s innovation ecosystem. And for health affairs, Chairman Wicker highlighted the need for the DoD to ensure the military health system is adequately resourced not only to support daily peacetime operations but also to meet the potential demands of large-scale combat operations in the future.

Dr. Troy E. Meink, nominee for Secretary of the Air Force, Mr. Michael P. Duffey nominee for Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, Mr. Emil G. Michael, nominee for Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, and Mr. Keith M. Bass, nominee for Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Appear before the committee.

Read Senator Wicker’s hearing opening statement as submitted for the record below.

I welcome all of our witnesses and their families, and I thank them for being here this morning. Their presence is timely. We are at a crossroads in American history. We face the most dangerous environment since World War II, and I am grateful that these individuals have stepped up to serve.

Dr. Troy Meink has been nominated to be the Secretary of the Air Force. More than ever before, our success as a joint force rests upon our Airmen and Guardians. We cannot deter or defeat the Chinese Communist Party without space superiority and air dominance. I was very glad to hear that the administration is moving forward with the Next-Generation Air Dominance program. With that announcement, President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have taken the first step to maintain our mastery of the skies.

Today, our Air Force is suffering through a death spiral. We have billions of dollars of unpaid aircraft maintenance bills, a shrinking combat fleet, and a munitions shortage we need to fix.

We created the Space Force just five years ago, and it has grown rapidly. But we have numerous opportunities to accelerate our space control efforts and support the joint force from orbit. Dr. Meink’s experience at the National Reconnaissance Office renders him uniquely qualified to ensure the Space Force continues its growth.

Managing weapons programs is only one aspect of the job for which Dr. Meink has been nominated. He will need to take care of our Airmen and Guardians. All the aircraft and satellites in the world are pointless unless we have the right support system for the people who develop, maintain, and operate those weapons systems.

I look forward to hearing Dr. Meink’s plan to maintain space superiority and air dominance in the years to come.

Mr. Michael Duffey has been nominated to become the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment. If confirmed, he will face three major challenges.

First, he will encounter our current acquisition system, which is slow, outdated, and ill-suited to meet the urgent demands of modern warfare. In my Restoring Freedom’s Forge plan, I outlined a game-changing approach to overhaul this system. We must streamline processes, embrace innovation, and deliver capabilities at the speed of relevance. It will take bold leadership to shift the culture of the acquisition workforce. We must encourage that workforce to leverage its authorities effectively and break free from its risk-averse habits.

Second, the Department of Defense does not possess the capacity and capability to perform serious industrial base analysis at scale. If confirmed, Mr. Duffey will need to expand and re-focus existing organizations. They must improve our ability to answer fundamental questions about industrial policy, re-industrialization, and defense mobilization.

Third, Mr. Duffey would chair the Nuclear Weapons Council. His leadership will be critical as we modernize and adapt our long-neglected nuclear forces so they can meet the threat of the rapidly growing Chinese, Russian, and North Korean arsenals.

I look forward to hearing Mr. Duffey’s views on these three challenges.

Mr. Emil Michael has been nominated to serve as the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering. In other words, he would be the Chief Technology Officer for the Department of Defense. If confirmed, Mr. Michael must ensure that the bright minds within our innovation ecosystem regain technological superiority against our adversaries, starting with China. Mr. Michael has worked with Secretary Gates on Iraq and Afghanistan and has been a part of a very small company called Uber. I believe his diverse experience gives him a unique appreciation for the challenges he will encounter if confirmed to this role.

We must all ensure that the department has an aggressive vision for innovation. That vision must resonate throughout the services and result in production at scale. I look forward to hearing from Mr. Michael about his vision for research and development and innovation.

Mr. Keith Bass has been tapped to become the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs. This role oversees all Department of Defense health policies and programs. If confirmed, Mr. Bass would assume the role at a crucial time. The military health system faces persistent challenges in its structure, staffing, and the delivery of healthcare services. Mr. Bass has extensive leadership experience as White House Medical Director, as the Director of Medical Services at the CIA, and as the Medical Center Director at the West Texas Health Care System for the Department of Veterans Affairs. He is well-equipped to address these challenges within the military health system.

This system must provide routine, peacetime healthcare and simultaneously maintain a state of preparedness for large-scale combat. The Pentagon faces considerable challenges in recruiting and retaining both civilian and military medical personnel. This staffing problem directly affects the quality of care provided to service members and their families.

I am eager to learn how Mr. Bass intends to tackle these issues and how he plans to equip the military health system so it can deliver top-notch care in peace-time and in potential future conflict.",https://www.wicker.senate.gov/services/images/876035CC-D530-4894-BDE7-CEBC677C2CE7/social,N,0.0,2025-03-27 20:56:26.510017

What You Need to Know: The U.S. Defense Health Agency has extended the temporary waiver of certain authorization and referral requirements for TRICARE patients.

On January 1, 2025, TriWest Healthcare Alliance (TriWest) began providing managed care services to TRICARE beneficiaries in the 26-state western region, including California. Due to challenges related to the transition of managed care responsibilities to the incoming contractor, the U.S. Defense Health Agency has temporarily waived authorization and referral requirements for all outpatient TRICARE-covered services for TRICARE Prime beneficiaries in the West Region. While they were initially waived through March 31, 2025, the agency recently announced it would extend that waiver through April 30.

During this time, providers will not need to submit referral or authorization requests for TRICARE Prime patients seeking TRICARE-covered outpatient services, with some exceptions. Authorizations and referral requests will still be required for inpatient care, applied behavior analysis, laboratory developed test and Extended Health Care Option services.

According to the TRICARE West Region Referral Waiver Approval Letter, TRICARE Prime enrollees can obtain covered outpatient services from any TRICARE-authorized provider (network or non-network) during the waiver period without obtaining separate referral approval from TriWest.

Referrals issued by providers between January 1 and April 30, 2025, are valid for services rendered through June 30, 2025. Referrals for care that extends beyond June 30, 2025, will need to follow the prior established TRICARE referral and authorization requirements and obtain approval to continue care after June 30. Referrals issued after April 30, 2025, must also follow TRICARE referral and authorization requirements.

Physicians with questions regarding the TRICARE transition should visit the new TriWest TRICARE Provider webpage or contact TriWest at providerservices@triwest.com or (888) 874-9378.

By celebrating different backgrounds, we create a safe, inclusive, and joyful environment for all of our residents. It’s a bonus that we also find a way to enjoy some delicious food and celebrate with our friends! Here are some of our favourite celebrations we’ve enjoyed recently:

Mother Language Day Morning Tea

International Mother Language Day reminds us of the importance of mother languages in preserving our cultural heritage. During our morning tea, residents came together to honour the languages that shape our identities. They sang national anthems with pride, shared stories of their cultural roots, and taught each other greetings in their native languages. It was a heart-warming event that brought everyone even closer together. After all, mothers are everything – and so are the languages that connect us to them!

Waitangi Day

Our TriCare residents recently celebrated New Zealand’s national day, Waitangi Day, with traditional Māori performances, cultural displays, and delicious Kiwi treats like fresh fry bread, creamy ambrosia, and mini pavlovas, all prepared by our wonderful kitchen staff. Our residents even joined in singing some traditional Māori songs, filling the room with joy! Waitangi Day was a great opportunity for everyone to learn more about New Zealand’s rich culture.

Chinese New Year

Many of our residences lit up with beautiful colours and lanterns of Chinese New Year this year. Our residents had the chance to read their fortune from a traditional Chinese fortune cookie, before indulging in delicious Chinese dishes – dumplings, dim sims, spring rolls, plus more! Our wellness team added some lighthearted competition to the mix with a quiz that tested everyone’s knowledge of the Lunar New Year. It was a wonderful celebration that brought our residents together, marking a year of good fortune and happiness to come…

Diwali Festival Armchair Travel

In anticipation of Diwali, the Hindu “Festival of Lights”, we hosted an Armchair travel event that transported our residents to India! The celebration was filled with delicious Indian finger food and lively music as everyone explored India’s fascinating culture. A standout moment at Mt Gravatt Aged Care Residence was when resident Stanley shared stories from his personal travels to India, sparking connections with our staff members from India. We’re already counting down the days until our next event…

Oktoberfest

Beer, bratwurst, and good company. Oktoberfest 2024 celebrations were a huge hit with our residents, with a terrific 55 people attending the event at Kawana Waters Aged Care Residence! We enjoyed sampling Bavarian beers from Germany and indulging in traditional foods like goulash with pretzels, leberkaese with bratwurst and sauerkraut, obatzter with rye bread, and Bavarian biscuits. The festive vibe was set with lively German music and plenty of laughs – a fun afternoon for everyone. Prost!

The King’s Birthday Morning Tea

October 2024, our Aged Care residents celebrated the King’s birthday in true royal style. They sipped tea from fine china and were treated to an array of delicious cakes, all while enjoying elegant British décor and classical music. It was a smashing morning filled with laughter and good company. Cheers, King Charles.

Australia Day

In January our residents came together to celebrate Australia Day with tons of fun and national pride. The day was filled with live music and traditional Aussie treats – meat pie or lamington, mate? Smiles were everywhere as residents sang along to classic Aussie songs and shared a yarn or two. What better way to celebrate our beautiful country and we can’t wait to do it all again next year.

Lawmakers from the Senate Armed Services Committee heard testimony from Michael P. Duffey, nominated for undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment; Emil G. Michael, nominated for undersecretary of defense for research and engineering; and Keith M. Bass, nominated for assistant secretary of defense for health affairs.

""If confirmed, I would assume responsibility to implement President [Donald J.] Trump's mandate and [Defense] Secretary [Pete] Hegseth's priorities by providing the military with the capabilities and force structure necessary to deter our adversaries and, if necessary, prevail in conflict,"" Duffey said.

DOD's acquisition and sustainment communities are primarily responsible for ensuring warfighters have the tools to fight and win in any conflict. Duffey said he would change how the department operates to achieve that goal.

""This will require the department to modernize how it manages the integration of requirements, budgeting and acquisition processes, aligning incentives to deliver results,"" he said. ""We must deepen our understanding of the strengths and vulnerabilities within our defense industrial base and seek to revitalize through reindustrialization, increased investment, flexible contracting, enhanced workforce recruitment and training and increased competition.""

If confirmed, Duffey told senators he'd focus on four priorities:

Michael told senators that China is a strong competitor, and the U.S. must adapt to remain stronger.

""Time must be a factor in all of our decisions as we confront an increasingly sophisticated adversary in China, which not only has lower labor costs but is notorious for intellectual property theft, making its research and development costs even faster and less expensive than we could have imagined only a decade ago,"" he said.

Michael said he'd work to rebuild the department's relationship with the defense technology sector if confirmed.

""The DOD needs to foster a more robust and competitive defense industrial base by providing more realistic requirements, inviting [in] smaller and innovative companies with less burdensome processes, [and] becoming more agile in how and when we grant contracts,"" he said.

It's not the first time Michael has worked for the Defense Department. He told lawmakers he worked for then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates and played a role in developing the mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicle and Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization.

""If confirmed, I'd bring my decades of experience in the technology industry and management of large, complex, global organizations to ensure that the United States has the most technologically sophisticated defense systems in history,"" he said.

If confirmed, Bass would be responsible for executing DOD's medical mission and providing and maintaining readiness for medical services and support to service members.

""The military health system is a global leader in delivering world-class care, unmatched in excellence and second to none,"" he said. ""I'm excited about the future of military medicine and the opportunity to drive innovation and improve patient outcomes. By continuing to focus on modernization, technology, research, [and] care delivery, we can strengthen our operational readiness and set new standards.""

Bass said pressing issues in the military health care system include ensuring the readiness of American forces, recruiting and retaining medical personnel, and adapting to rapid technological advances.

Beneficiaries now have until April 30 to use referral approval waivers and point-of-service waivers and provide payment information to TriWest, the agency announced Thursday. The previous deadline was March 31.

Officials have extended these deadlines as West Region beneficiaries and health care providers have reported a number of problems with the contract transition from Health Net Federal Services to TriWest. TriWest officials have said they’re taking steps to improve their online portals and staffed up their customer call centers to provide more service to beneficiaries and health care providers.

Referral approval waiver: This allows Tricare Prime beneficiaries to seek care with Tricare-approved specialists, with referrals from their primary care managers, without having to go through TriWest to get those referrals approved.

Beneficiaries may seek outpatient care from these specialists with a copy of their primary care manager’s referral dated between Jan. 1 and April 30 and a copy of the Tricare West Region referral/authorization waiver approval letter.

Some families have told Military Times that even with the referral waiver, some specialists won’t see Tricare patients because of various issues they’ve been having.

The referral waiver doesn’t apply to inpatient care, applied behavior analysis, Autism Care Demonstration services, laboratory-developed tests and Extended Care Health Option services.

Point-of-service waiver: This allows Tricare Prime beneficiaries in the West Region to continue seeing providers who may no longer be in the Tricare network after the contract transition. The provider must be Tricare authorized, which means they meet certain requirements. Those using the point-of-service waiver through April 30 will pay regular Tricare Prime co-pays, instead of the more costly point-of-service fees. Using the point-of-service option doesn’t require a referral.

Tricare snafus cause medical shortfalls for military families

Payment extension: The extension for setting up payments applies to certain beneficiaries in the West Region who pay fees for their Tricare Prime or Tricare Select plans and those who are enrolled in a premium-based plan, including Tricare Young Adult, Tricare Reserve Select and Tricare Retired Reserve.

Those who paid their fees to the previous contractor using electronic funds transfer, credit card or debit card must contact TriWest to set up the payment using one of those methods. Some beneficiaries have experienced difficulties setting up those payments through the TriWest portal and customer call center, Military Times previously reported. Tricare officials have said those who paid previously by allotment didn’t have to take action because their allotment would be automatically ported over. Some beneficiaries told Military Times this didn’t happen for them.

TRICARE beneficiaries in Alexander, Alleghany, Ashe, Avery, Buncombe, Burke, Cabarrus, Caldwell, Catawba, Cherokee, Clay, Cleveland, Gaston, Graham, Haywood, Henderson, Iredell, Jackson, Lincoln, Macon, Madison, McDowell, Mecklenburg, Mitchell, Rowan, Rutherford, Stanly, Swain, Transylvania, Union, Watauga, Wilkes, and Yancey counties are now eligible to receive emergency prescription refills through April 6, 2025.

For beneficiaries in Polk County, the date has been extended from April 2, 2025, to April 6, 2025.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

• The referral approval waiver has been extended from March 31 to April 30.

• The point of service waiver has been extended from March 31 to April 30.

• The deadline to provide payment information to TriWest Healthcare Alliance, the new West Region contractor, has been extended to April 30.

The referral approval waiver allows TRICARE Prime beneficiaries to see TRICARE-authorized specialty providers for outpatient care without getting primary care manager (PCM) referrals approved by TriWest. However, beneficiaries still need their PCMs to provide referrals before getting specialty care.

This process is retroactive to Jan. 1.

TRICARE Prime beneficiaries may seek outpatient care from any TRICARE-authorized specialty provider with the following documentation:

• A copy of the referral dated Jan. 1-April 30.

• A copy of the TRICARE West Region Referral/Authorization Waiver Approval Letter, available on tricare.mil/west.

TRICARE Prime beneficiaries may see both network and non-network TRICARE-authorized providers during this waiver period. TRICARE Prime beneficiaries should ask the provider if they’re TRICARE-authorized.

The referral approval waiver does not apply to:

• Inpatient care

• Applied behavior analysis or Autism Care Demonstration services

• Laboratory developed tests

• Extended Care Health Option services

If beneficiaries need any of these services, TriWest will still need to approve their referral before they see a specialist.

The point of service waiver allows beneficiaries to continue seeing providers who may no longer be in network. However, providers MUST be TRICARE-authorized. This means they’re:

• Licensed by a state, accredited by national organization, or meet other standards of the medical community

• Certified to provide benefits under TRICARE

Beneficiaries using the point of service waiver will pay TRICARE Prime copayments.

Finally, beneficiaries enrolled in a TRICARE premium-based plan (TRICARE Young Adult, TRICARE Reserve Select, and TRICARE Retired Reserve) now have until April 30 to provide payment information to TriWest.

If beneficiaries have TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select, they also have until April 30 to pay their fees.

If they don’t act before these dates, they’ll be disenrolled, retroactive to Jan. 1.

For more information, please visit the TRICARE Newsroom, or tricare.mil/west.

Media with additional questions should contact DHA Media Relations.

By Chazz Kibler

BALTIMORE—In a development for the Maryland Military Department, two employees from the Health Care for Heroes program have recently advanced within the agency, reflecting a commitment to promoting talent from within. Peter Kriscumas has transitioned from his role as program manager to deputy director of Legislative Affairs. At the same time, Schanell Hurt-Franklin has stepped up from program officer to program manager for the Health Care for Heroes office. This movement highlights their expertise and reinforces the agency’s focus on enhancing support for service members and their families.

As part of the Health Care for Heroes program, which provides financial assistance to service members for their TRICARE insurance premiums, their leadership will be crucial in navigating the intersections of policy and personal impact. With their new responsibilities, they aim to deepen the program’s reach and effectiveness, ensuring that those who serve the state receive the comprehensive support they deserve.

In his new role, Kriscumas will serve as a bridge between the Maryland Military Department, the state legislature, and the federal Congressional Delegation.

“My previous role as program manager for the HCfH program provided me with invaluable experience that directly translates to my new responsibilities in legislative affairs,” said Kriscumas. “Working closely with service members helped me understand the challenges they face, from accessing medical services to addressing affordable healthcare and dental premiums.”

As part of the Health Care for Heroes program, which provides financial assistance to service members for their TRICARE insurance premiums, their leadership will be crucial in navigating the intersections of policy and personal impact. With their new responsibilities, they aim to deepen the program’s reach and effectiveness, ensuring that those who serve the state receive the comprehensive support they deserve.

“My previous role as program manager for the HCfH program provided me with invaluable experience that directly translates to my new responsibilities in legislative affairs,” said Kriscumas. “Working closely with service members helped me understand the challenges they face, from accessing medical services to addressing affordable healthcare and dental premiums.”

In his new role, Kriscumas will serve as a bridge between the Maryland Military Department, the state legislature, and the federal Congressional Delegation.

“My primary objective is to effectively communicate the department’s needs, challenges, and strategic priorities to policymakers while also ensuring that legislative initiatives align with our mission of supporting service members and their families,” said Kricumas. “I hope to achieve this by developing a proactive and transparent approach to legislative engagement, focusing on building strong relationships, providing comprehensive policy insights, and advocating for resources and policies that directly benefit our service members.”

Kriscumas’ promotion to deputy director left a vacancy in the HCfH’s office and Hurt-Franklin said that Kriscumas was one of her biggest supporters to take his place.

“When Pete announced his relocation into another role, he praised my performance and encouraged me to pursue the role of program manager,” said Hurt-Franklin. “He felt I knew the program like the back of my hand, showed dedication and could keep it running successfully.”

Hurt-Franklin’s ascent in Maryland state government dates back to 2001, where she started as a temporary employee.

“Before separating for a few years in 2011, I gained experience at the Office of Administrative Hearings, the Maryland Department of the Environment, and the Office of Traffic and Safety,” said Hurt-Franklin. “Upon my return, I wanted to continue to learn different aspects/entities of state government and have since been employed in six additional state agencies.”

Hurt-Franklin’s movement throughout Maryland state government has afforded her many opportunities to connect with individuals from various backgrounds and presented her with a multitude of opportunities for career advancement.

“I tell any new employees in Maryland state government to ‘shoot for your best,’” said Hurt Franklin. “You don’t have to be still and you are never stuck. Maryland’s state government encourages growth and advancement and has so many opportunities for it. Set a career goal, invest your time in any free training, move around to gain experience and knowledge, and never be discouraged to amplify your skills.”

As of 2025, approximately 6,000 service members are in the National Guard. Hurt-Franklin said she intends to introduce the program to all of them and give them the opportunity to get something back for their dedication. Her goal within the next year is to increase membership and align the budget for such.",,N,1.0,2025-03-27 19:56:29.893503

MEADE, Md.– Fort Meade Emergency Medical Services hosted the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians Tactical Emergency Casualty Care training March 20-21. The training presented EMS providers with concepts, principles, and skills to deliver emergency medical care for patients in a civilian tactical environment.

The two-day specialized course drew EMS personnel from Fort Meade and the surrounding jurisdictions of Anne Arundel, Howard, and Baltimore Counties.

“The course not only reinforces crucial trauma care techniques but also ensures that local providers are equipped with the most up-to-date methods to improve patient outcomes in critical situations,” said Carrie A. Krest, Chief of Fort Meade Emergency Medical Services.

Major course topics instructed by the Maryland Fire & Rescue Institute focused on rapid trauma assessment, stabilization, and decision-making in the field that included hemorrhage control; surgical airway procedures and needle decompression; strategies for treating wounded responders in threatening environments, and techniques for dragging and carrying victims to safety. Topics ensured that attendees are prepared to deliver the best medical care possible before patients reach the hospital. Methods of instruction included lecture, discussion, hands-on skills stations and team-focused practical exercises.

“By hosting the training, Fort Meade EMS reaffirms its commitment to maintaining high standards of emergency care for both the base and the surrounding community,” Krest said.

The TECC training provides evidence-based and best practice trauma care that integrates nomenclature familiar to civilian EMS, fire, and law enforcement. The training plays a critical role in enhancing the skills necessary to providing care outside normal operating conditions of most EMS agencies, such as responding to a mass casualty or active shooter event.

“The course is a reminder of the importance of ongoing professional development in the ever-evolving field of emergency medicine,” Krest said.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2503/8939221/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-27 14:56:15.703595

,,2025-03-27 16:40:57+00:00,Federal News Network - Helping feds meet their mission.,Something new on the health care front for military service members,Tom Temin,,,,,https://federalnewsnetwork.com/defense-main/2025/03/something-new-on-the-health-care-front-for-military-service-members/,"Ronald Garner: For uniformed service members, this is the first year that health care flexible spending accounts are available.
We implemented dependent care flexible spending accounts last year, and this year is the first year for health care flexible spending accounts.
It’s not just traditional health care costs that are covered under HCFSA, but there are also vision care and dental care costs that are considered eligible expenses under HCFSAs.
An HCFSA is a benefit, it’s an optional benefit, that allows service members to set aside pretax earnings to pay for eligible health care, dental care, and vision care expenses.
Ronald Garner: What I’m encouraging any service member, whether they are a single service member or a service member with a family, a service member with an exceptional family member, any service member, what I’m encouraging them to do is to take a look at the benefits available through a health care flexible spending account.","Ronald Garner: I really appreciate the opportunity to talk to you and your listeners about health care flexible spending accounts. I am a retired service member myself and I think about how beneficial this program would have been to my family while we were on active duty.

Tom Temin: I should have known this. This is the first year they’ve had this available.

Ronald Garner: For uniformed service members, this is the first year that health care flexible spending accounts are available. We implemented dependent care flexible spending accounts last year, and this year is the first year for health care flexible spending accounts. So it’s an unusual year in that the enrollment period for this year is from March 3rd to March 31st, which means, of course, we’re right in the middle of the enrollment period right now. But the standard enrollment period for service members will be the normal federal benefits open season from mid-November to mid-December each year. And that will start in mid-November of 2025, so mid-November of this year for the next plan.

Tom Temin: So if they missed this one that’s about to close on us, they can do it later in this year. And if something comes up in their life that they could use this money, there’s an option for some other type of sign-up mechanism?

Ronald Garner: Yeah, there absolutely is Tom. Like many programs of this nature, there are options to sign up based upon qualifying life events. In qualifying life events, with respect to HCFSAs, you might think of things that constitute significant changes to your employment. So for a service member that might be a PCS, right? Or something of that nature or deployment. Say you’re a single service member and you deploy, and it becomes obvious to you that you’re not going to be able to utilize a lot of the funds that you would be putting into an HCFSA. That would be a qualifying life event that would allow you to stop sending funds to your HCFSA.

Tom Temin: And I guess I was under the impression that if you are in uniform as a service member, pretty much all of your health care requirements are taken care of by virtue of you being in uniform. But that’s apparently not the case.

Ronald Garner: That’s a good point there, Tom. There are a lot of things that no health insurance system or no health care system is going to cover, particularly if you’re talking about not just service members, but their families, right? So if you are a service member in uniform, certainly the coverage for you is very comprehensive under TRICARE. And for families, it is much more comprehensive under TRICARE than the vast majority of health insurance programs. But there are always going to be expenses that aren’t covered by health insurance or that are just unexpected expenses that you incur in the spur of the moment, right? So for instance, if you have a kid and your kid gets sick in one day, in the middle of the day, in the middle of the night, you’re probably not going to wait until you can get into a health care facility to take your child in if they’ve got a cold or something like that. You’re going to go buy some cold medicine at the local pharmacy and those kinds of over-the-counter medications would be covered under an HCFSA.

Tom Temin: If that child say something near and dear to my heart would need, say, glasses.

Ronald Garner: And that’s an important point, right? It’s not just traditional health care costs that are covered under HCFSA, but there are also vision care and dental care costs that are considered eligible expenses under HCFSAs. One that was near and dear to my heart when I was an active-duty member was the cost of braces for my daughter. TRICARE Dental doesn’t cover the entire cost of that. And as any parent who has had a teenager knows, those costs can be pretty significant.

Tom Temin: Yeah, I’ve put a few on in my own life for kids over the years. We’re speaking with Ron Garner. He’s the assistant director for military compensation policy at the Defense Department. And just give us some of the details here. How large can the accounts be and what does it take to withdraw? What are some of the mechanics here?

Ronald Garner: Sure, I would like to just first start off by saying what an HCFSA is. An HCFSA is a benefit, it’s an optional benefit, that allows service members to set aside pretax earnings to pay for eligible health care, dental care, and vision care expenses. Obviously, one of the primary benefits of this program is that you can pay for those expenses while reducing your taxable income, right? So I think that this is going to be of great service to military families, particularly military families that potentially fall within that exceptional family member program community. Now, as to how much you can set aside each year, each member is eligible to set aside between $100 and $3,300 in a year. If you have two eligible family members, so if you and your spouse are both eligible, you can, through your employer, and it’s not just military service members who have access to HCFSAs, federal civilians have access to them, many private sector employees have access too them as well. So if you or your spouse is both eligible and you maintain separate accounts, you can set aside up to $6,600 in a year.

Tom Temin: All right, and then this is just in an account and do you have a card that goes with it? Some kind of a debit card or how does it work?

Ronald Garner: No, you don’t. There’s no debit card. So the way that it works is that the service member signs up for the HCFSA through FSAFEDS.gov. They indicate how much they want to set aside in the plan. You’re up to the $3,300 limit and then they go out and they incur expenses the way that they normally would, right? So to use our example from earlier, you’re going to get braces for your child. You would go out and incur that expense you would pay for it. And then you would take your receipt or your statement of services or whatever you get from the provider. You would upload that to FSAFEDS. And FSAFEDS would reimburse you for all of those eligible expenses from the money that you have contributed. Now, there’s an important point here, I think, to make, which is that when you contribute, you’re going to contribute a certain amount each month. Let’s say that you elect to contribute the full $3,300 in a year and you’re going to do that in $330 increments across 10 months. So even though you haven’t contributed that entire amount at any point in the year until the end of the year, the entire amount of that $3,300 is available to you immediately after you enroll, right? So if you incur $3,300 worth of expenses a week after you enroll, and you haven’t contributed more than let’s say $330, you’re still going to be able to get reimbursed for that full $3,300 and it will just continue to be withdrawn from your pay each month.

Tom Temin: And I have a bigger question on this. We’ve talked about benefits for, say, children of service members. That seems to be the model that this is patterned for. That is to say, there’s very little that the service member, him or herself, would need this account for, given the comprehensive coverage of TRICARE. This seems to be a family-oriented or partner/spouse-oriented program to begin with. Am I correct in that?

Ronald Garner: I think it is appropriate to say that the members who are most likely to benefit from this are members with families, that military families are more likely to benefit from it than service members who don’t have families. Now, that isn’t to say that there aren’t benefits to this program to service members. There are certain things that you just can’t cover with a health insurance program, even when it’s comprehensive. As TRICARE, the best example of that is unexpected expenses. Anything that a service member can plan for themselves individually, many things that they can plan for, they’re going to be able to get taken care of through a military treatment facility. But there are a lot of unexpected costs that they’re not going to be able to get taken care of through a military treatment facility. And so there are some benefits to certainly to single service members. I think the greatest benefits are going be to those service members with families.

Tom Temin: Are you encouraging single service members to take an account anyhow?

Ronald Garner: What I’m encouraging any service member, whether they are a single service member or a service member with a family, a service member with an exceptional family member, any service member, what I’m encouraging them to do is to take a look at the benefits available through a health care flexible spending account. And there’s plenty of information out there about it. They can do it. They can find information via FSAFEDS.gov. We’ve put out a ton of information on the DoD Financial Readiness website. There’s an FSA page on the DoD Financial Readiness website and there’s just a wealth of information out there. I’m encouraging them to get all of the information they can and make a determination about whether an HCFSA is the right answer for themselves and or their family.

Tom Temin: Somewhere there’s a list of things that TRICARE doesn’t cover and then there’s also a list of things the health spending account does cover and that’s what you’re looking for.",https://federalnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ThinkstockPhotos-509111008-e1743092040838.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-27 12:56:19.166347

Referral approval waiver extended through April 30 for TRICARE Prime

DHA has extended the West Region referral approval waiver. Through April 30, you should continue following the rules of your TRICARE Prime plan, as described in the TRICARE Choices in the United States Handbook.

You can continue seeing your PCM to get referrals for specialty care—even if your PCM is not currently in TriWest’s network. (Note: Point-of-service fees are also waived for existing referrals with providers who are now non-network in the West Region through April 30.)

During the waiver period, you don’t need to wait for the contractor to approve your referral, regardless of the PCM's location (office, urgent care, etc.). However, the specialist you see must be TRICARE-authorized.

Remember: This waiver doesn’t apply to:

Inpatient care

Applied behavior analysis or Autism Care Demonstration services

Laboratory developed tests

Extended Care Health Option services

The next USAG Benelux in Brussels Town Hall is planned for June 12 at 4 p.m. at the Brussels Unit School.","BRUSSELS, Belgium – Jeff Gliedman, interim deputy garrison manager for USAG Benelux in Brussels, along with Stacy Perez, the director of Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation (FMWR); Lt. Col. Keithbarry Garcia, the officer-in-charge of the Brussels Health Clinic; Lt. Col. Everett Zachary, the garrison chaplain; Dr. Oliver Freeman, director of Human Resources and Lt. Col. Reginald Moise, the director of Emergency Services, hosted a town hall March 20, 2025 at the Brussels Unit School at Sterrebeek Annex.

The hybrid town hall permitted garrison leaders and community members to come together both in person and online to share information and answer questions about support and services provided to the Brussels military community.

Community Update- Jeffrey Gliedman, interim Brussels deputy garrison manager

Gliedman welcomed town hall attendees and thanked them on behalf of Col. Patrick Hofmann, the garrison commander, for attending in person and online. He then gave a brief update regarding garrison operations in Brussels.

Gliedman started by saying that despite recent changes in the U.S. government and personnel actions at some agencies of the federal workforce, there have been no significant changes in the services provided in Brussels and no garrison jobs have been lost to personnel reductions.

Gliedman explained that there is currently a hiring freeze which impacts the garrison and a number of positions have not been filled and the garrison is seeking exceptions to policy to try and onboard personnel. One position that was filled is a member of the 266th Financial Management Center, who has arrived to assist Army military members with pay issues.

For Brussels consolidation efforts on Brussels main, Gliedman provided the following updates:

The plan for moving the Brussels gym from Building 3 into the site of the old 3 Star Recreation Center is expected in May, but it may slip to June.

The gym will not close until it’s ready to move, so it is still open at the current location with 24-hour access. When it’s time for the gym to move it will probably be closed for two or three days.

Personnel who work in Building 3, will move to Building 2 or Building 4 as planned in May. The exact date has not been determined.

Gliedman said that when it comes to future plans for the Brussels consolidation and move from Brussels Main to Sterrebeek Annex, the plan is still dependent on funding. If the funding is not approved, then garrison staff will stay at Brussels Main and leadership will continue to request funds and revise plans accordingly.

Gliedman also outlined future construction at the Brussels Unit School on Sterrebeek Annex that will take place from 2026 to 2029 and said garrison leaders are coordinating with Army Corps of Engineers to ensure construction is done smartly, safely and with minimal impact to students.

Some upcoming Brussels events are:

April 25: Brussels Annual Volunteer Recognition Ceremony, 1 p.m. at the Community Conference Room, Brussels Main.

April 26: Brussels Consignment Shop Flea Market- 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., open to all U.S. and NATO ID cardholders.

May 3: Daddy-Daughter dance hosted by the American Legion in Building 2 Community Conference Room, Brussels Main.

Col. Everett Zachary- Religious Services

Zachary gave an overview of past and present religious support provided to the Brussels community and acknowledged that COVID-19 had a significant impact on religious services across the Benelux. Since the pandemic, the number of people seeking religious services in Brussels dropped dramatically and around a year ago it was decided to sunset Protestant services in Brussels and continue with Catholic services only. Zachary said they will continue to monitor requests for support to see if there is a need for additional services.

Zachary highlighted the following religious services that are provided by volunteers in the Community Conference Room in Bldg. 2 of Brussels Main:

Monday - Coffee Moms at 10:30 a.m. and Middle School Bible Study at 5 p.m.

Wednesday - New Moms Group at 10 a.m. and Youth Bible Study at 5 p.m.

Thursday - Adult Bible Study at 7 p.m.

Friday - Women's Bible Study at 10 a.m. and Food for Life Bible Study 11:30 a.m. (1st and 3rd Sundays)

Zachary said the Chaplain Corps is short of chaplains, but there is the option of utilizing a volunteer Designated Faith Group leader to provide additional religious support for Brussels. A qualified Brussels community member is in the process of becoming a designated Faith group leader and in the next weeks additional religious services are planned for the Brussels Community Conference Room. Zachary explained that the volunteer leader would be the lead pastor for Brussels with oversight by the chaplains at Chièvres Air Base.

Zachary ended his remarks by telling the Brussels community that support from the Catholic priest at SHAPE is available by request and that information about Chapel services and special services during the holidays is available at https://home.army.mil/benelux/about/Garrison/religious-support and on the garrison’s social media pages.

Stacy Perez, FMWR

Before highlighting some upcoming events, Perez encouraged the community follow the garrison’s Facebook, Instagram, Linked-In social media pages and use the U.S. Army Garrison Benelux website to find information about all the activities provided by FMWR.

Perez stressed the need for additional volunteer coaches and explained FMWR can offer more activities for the Brussels community if more volunteer coaches become available. She also highlighted that Army Community Services can register people to become a volunteers and can also assist with training for those who are new to coaching.

Perez also discussed the Interactive Customer Evaluation system (ICE) and encouraged community members to provide feedback about FMWR services. She also suggested that people provide their contact details when using ICE so garrison leaders can reach out for additional information.

Perez highlighted the following upcoming FMWR events:

April 11 - CYS Purple Up Run

April 19 - Eggstravaganza egg hunt and games from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.

April 26 - Mommy and Daddy 101, 12 p.m. at Army Community Services

Lt. Col. Keith Garcia, Brussels Health Clinic

Garcia spoke about staffing challenges and the proactive steps the Brussels Health Clinic is taking to navigate those challenges. With the hiring freeze, there will be more shortages due to staff turnover and hiring delays. However, a new radiologist and medic are expected in May and the clinic is coordinating with the SHAPE Healthcare Facility and Landstuhl Regional Medical Center to receive nursing support on a rotational basis. Clinic staff are also working to optimize medical appointment time slots and ensure all slots are utilized effectively with no lost appointments.

To ensure timely care, Garcia advised patients schedule appointments in advance for essential services such as routine blood pressure checks and pregnancy tests. He also recommended for parents to schedule annual child physicals early in the months of April and May.

Regarding the Brussels Dental Clinic, Garcia said there will be reduction of operations due to permanent change of station of the only dentist assigned to the clinic. Beginning April 1st, dental clinic operations will be reduced to two days a week for dental readiness and space available care will no longer be scheduled. Dental cleanings and routine dental care such as fillings, crowns and extractions need to be scheduled at the Shape Dental Clinic due to space limitations.

Garcia also provided the following updates regarding clinic operations and network care:

Physical Health Assessment rodeos for active-duty members will be held April 7th and 18th. For more information and updates about clinic hours and services visit the Brussels Happenings web page at https://home.army.mil/benelux/my-fort/happenings/brussels.

The clinic continues to coordinate with network providers to receive healthcare records in a timely manner, but requests must go through International SOS can take up to a month.

Patients can proactively assist with their healthcare by retrieving their own medical records through the Mynexushealth portal. This portal will give patients access to their medical records from Belgian providers and give the option to share records access with the medical team at the Brussels health Clinic. For more information about the portal and mobile app visit https://www.nexuzhealth.com/en/patients.

For more assistance with the Mynexushealth portal or questions about network healthcare contact the Brussels clinic patient liaison at michael.g.vandriessche.ln@health.mil or audrey.m.geldhof.ln@health.mil.

The medical center in Wezembeek-Oppem no longer accepts Tricare Prime patients for routine care. However, Tricare Prime members can still go to the medical center’s emergency room to receive urgent care treatment.

The Brussels Health Clinic cannot provide urgent care. Community members worried about loss of limb, eyesight or life should call 112 or visit the nearest emergency room. For Tricare Prime beneficiaries, it is recommended to notify the health clinic of any emergency room visits as soon as possible before bills are received for care.

Personnel arriving and departing the Brussels community are reminded to in-process and out-process with the Tricare Service Center. Failure to properly in-process or out-process can lead to gaps in healthcare coverage.

The clinic is working with Tricare and International SOS to provide patients with information updates about appointments made with host nation network providers. Please ensure the clinic has your correct e-mail address.

The clinic seeks patient cooperation to prevent missed appointments, which impacts availability of care for other patients and can incur additional costs. Some network providers charge up to 600 Euros for missed appointments with charges going to a collection agency. If patients cannot make an appointment with a network provider, they should contact the Brussels Health Clinic to reschedule.

Garcia emphasized that clinic staff stand ready to serve the needs of the Brussels community and encouraged members to contact the clinic for healthcare questions or to provide feedback.

Dr. Oliver Freeman, Human Resources

Freeman explained that the hiring freeze has impacted the garrison’s ability to fill the Brussels position for passport services, so personnel from Brunssum and SHAPE are helping to provide support for Brussels services. Freeman also encouraged community members to use ICE comments to give garrison leaders feedback, positive or negative.

Collette Tate, Brussels Unit School

Tate said that the school is not impacted by the hiring freeze and they will have a full staff for the start of the new school year in August.

Shawn Ticho, Child and Youth Services

Ticho reminded community members that April is Month of the Military Child and encouraged everyone to wear purple on Fridays throughout April to recognize military children.

Ticho also highlighted the following CYS events for April:

April 9 - Purple Up at the Brussels Unit School. Community members will meet at the school at 7:45 a.m. to welcome students.

April 25 to 26 - Operation Megaphone- Brussels youths will stay on Brussels Main overnight and meet online with other youths from CYS programs worldwide to discuss key issues affecting military children.

Kristin Savage, Public Affairs

Savage provided an update that Make-A-Wish is happening on SHAPE from 4 p.m. June 6 to 4 p.m. June 7 for 24 hours of fun activities for kids and food from the different nations at SHAPE. For more information visit https://www.facebook.com/USECOonSHAPE/

Town Hall Questions and Answers

Q1. What is the update regarding the creation of a community room that we can use in place of the 3 Star Recreation Facility?

A1. The garrison, together with the Department of Defense Activity (DODEA) Europe West District office, has recently opened a conference room here on Sterrebeek Annex. We will confirm the procedures for requesting use of the room with DODEA and inform the community through the public affairs office.

Q2. Are ACS resources available for civilian employees?

A2. Yes, absolutely!

Q3. How long are CYS medical physicals valid?

A3. Medical physicals for CYS sports are valid one year. CYS care physicals are valid for three years.

Q4. Are medical records from UZ Leuven automatically transferred to MHS Genesis?

A4. Yes, but it can take some time, up to four weeks. This is why we recommend patients to sign up for the Mynexushealth portal and enable their records to be shared from the Belgian provider to the Brussels Health Clinic, which is a much faster process.

Q5. Will the garrison support the 4th of July this year?

A5. Yes, the Benelux will partner with the SHAPE Base Support Group for the July 4th celebration at SHAPE starting at 3 p.m. and ending with fireworks. The garrison will also celebrate Independence Day in Brunssum as well.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled “How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills.” The report claimed Zynex engaged in an “oversupplying scheme” by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to “bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could.” The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were “kicking the company out of network.”

On this news, Zynex’s stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024.

Then, on March 11, 2025, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a revenue “shortfall” in the quarter “due to slower than normal payments from certain payers.” Zynex also revealed that Tricare, the healthcare program for uniformed service members that “currently represents approximately 20-25% of [the Company's] annual revenue”, “has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.”

On this news, Zynex’s stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025.

James Kinnaird, a flight nurse with the 911th Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron, steadied himself on the open door. Just days ago, he had practiced rappelling in the quiet of a classroom, but now, the deafening roar of rotor blades and the violent vibrations of the aircraft made every movement a challenge.

With one deep breath, he clipped in and stepped off, descending rapidly to the open field below—one step closer to earning his Air Assault wings.

Kinnaird was the sole Citizen Airman who attended the Air Assault course in the U.S. Army’s Sabalauski Air Assault School at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, from Aug. 13-28, 2024. The rigorous nine-day program trains service members in helicopter-based operations, including air assault tactics, sling-load operations, and rappelling. Upon graduation, each Soldier—or Airman—can execute critical skills to maximize the use of helicopter assets in both training and combat environments to support unit operations.

The course covers a wide scope of rotary-wing aircraft operations, including aircraft safety, aeromedical evacuation procedures, pathfinder operations, combat assault techniques, and the execution of sling-load and rappelling techniques. Instruction is conducted in both classroom and field environments, ensuring students are prepared for real-world missions.

A Grueling Start

Earning the Air Assault badge requires extensive preparation, both physically and mentally.

“A typical day involved early morning physical training, followed by classroom sessions, hands-on exercises, and team-building activities,” Staff Sgt. Zachary Adams, a fire team member with the 911th Security Forces Squadron said. “Evenings were often spent reviewing the day’s lessons and preparing for the next.”

Adams, who attended the course a few months after Kinniard, prepared by following a strict 4 a.m. workout routine that included rucking. Kinnaird also focused heavily on rucking, logging about 20 miles each week.

For those considering Air Assault School, Adams emphasized preparation and perseverance. “My advice would be to prepare thoroughly, both mentally and physically,” he said. “Seek mentorship, stay committed, and never underestimate the importance of teamwork and resilience.”

The course officially began with “Day Zero,” a physically demanding introduction designed to weed out unprepared candidates. The day included a gear inspection, known as the ""bag drag,"" to ensure each student had all required equipment, followed by an obstacle course.

“You have a packing list, and you have to have everything. If you don't have it, you’re kicked out,” Kinnaird said. “We lost 10 members on the first day.”

Packing requirements included roughly 50 items, ranging from simple necessities such as extra pairs of socks, earplugs, and gallon-sized Ziploc bags to more specific military gear like “one Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment rucksack (large or medium, complete with a frame, waist belt, and sustainment pouches), and an Improved Outer Tactical Vest or plate carrier with Enhanced Small Arms Protective Inserts plates, Kevlar inserts, with name tape, and rank affixed” according to information from the U.S. Army Air Assault webpage.

The obstacle course consisted of nine challenges designed to test strength, endurance, and confidence at heights. One of the toughest, Kinnaird recalled, was the ""confidence climb""—a 35-foot ladder with widening gaps between rungs as students ascended.

“When I got toward the top, I had to jump to reach the final rung,” he said. Because students were not allowed to use the ladder’s side rails, the challenge forced them to problem-solve while battling any fear of heights.

Sling-Load Stress

After completing the physically demanding opening phase, students moved on to phase two– sling load operations– a critical component of the course that trains students to rig, inspect, and secure external loads for helicopter transport.

“The A-22 sling load deficiency test was especially challenging,” said Adams.

Air Assault hopefuls had to memorize more than 65 possible deficiencies and identify three out of a maximum of four errors to pass, and there are no second chances. Even minor mistakes—such as a misrouted strap, an unsecured snap link, or failing to notice an unbalanced load—could result in failure. The high-stakes nature of the test and the rapid pace of inspections caused significant stress among students.

“The test for the sling load deficiencies really stressed a lot of people out,” said Kinnaird. “You had to inspect four different loads in under two minutes and find the exact discrepancies the instructors set up. “That’s where we lost ... maybe a third, if not a half, of our class.

Mastering sling load operations is crucial, as improperly secured loads can be catastrophic in real-world missions, endangering both personnel and equipment. The training ensured that graduates could confidently conduct aerial resupply, troop transport, and combat sustainment operations under pressure.

Descending to Graduation

The final phase of training focused on rappelling—first from a tower and, ultimately, from a hovering UH-60 Black Hawk.

For both Kinnaird and Adams, the moment they stepped off the helicopter was the highlight of the course.

“You could see the light at the end of the tunnel,” Kinnaird said, recalling the moment he landed in an open field below. But one final challenge remained—the grueling 12-mile ruck march.

Beginning at 4 a.m., students carried 35-pound rucksacks while maintaining a demanding pace. Those who completed the march crossed the finish line just in time for graduation that afternoon.

“Finishing [the ruck] made me realize that all the hard work and sacrifices leading up to the course were completely worth it,” Adams said.

Of the 30 students in Kinnaird’s ruck unit, only about 17 made it to graduation. The others, unable to finish the march, were sent home without earning their wings.

Graduates of the course receive the coveted Air Assault Badge, which is traditionally pinned onto their uniforms by an instructor. But completing Air Assault School is more than just earning a badge—it’s a testament to resilience, teamwork, and the ability to operate in high-stress environments.

For Kinnaird and Adams, the grueling days of physical and mental challenges reinforced their skills and determination. Now, armed with their newly earned expertise, they stand ready to apply their training to real-world missions, ensuring they can support their units with precision and confidence.",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Mar/26/2003676527/2000/2000/0/250302-F-DM010-1013.JPG,N,0.0,2025-03-27 00:56:23.893699

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company’s practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled “How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills.” The report claimed Zynex engaged in an “oversupplying scheme” by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to “bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could.” The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were “kicking the company out of network.”

On this news, Zynex’s stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue “shortfall” in the quarter “due to slower than normal payments from certain payers.” Zynex further revealed “Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.” Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military.

On this news, Zynex’s stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Zynex’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

The letter went on to warn TRICARE patients that they would be placed on a waiting list and additional appointments would only be made after payment had resolved.

“So it’s either find another office that will take TRICARE, pay out of pocket, or go on base and wait forever,” Brassard said.

“I find this whole thing repulsive,” she continued, after learning that other military families around the country were experiencing similar issues. Two weeks after receiving that letter of warning, Brassard learned she was dropped from another provider as well.

Jennifer Bittner, the executive director for Exceptional Families of the Military, has been monitoring the situation both for her family and for other military families who are unable to receive services due to the lack of payment. She identified two significant changes in coverage that are the underlying cause.

With new contracts that began Jan. 1, TRICARE made changes to the regional care for military beneficiaries, moving six TRICARE East states to their West region. Bittner explained that there was difficulty in transferring everything at once, resulting in some providers not being contacted about the change and some information simply getting lost in the shuffle. With so many families calling to sort things out, wait times to speak to customer service representatives are longer than usual.

In addition to the regional care change, a new claims processor also went into effect on Jan. 1, which has resulted in delayed payments processing. Those delays, in turn, have led to many medical providers either pausing care or considering dropping TRICARE patients.

“I’m honestly so frustrated and disappointed the system has failed us so badly and all we are told is to ‘wait until February, it’ll be fixed. Wait until March. It’ll be fixed.’ Well, we are halfway through March and things still aren’t fixed,” Bittner said. “I’m in Texas, so I am in a state that switched regions and switched to TriWest. Both my sons have a rare mitochondrial disease, and when we were under [TRICARE] East, their medical team was an approved out-of-network provider.

Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to upend how businesses operate, and the life sciences field is no exception. Generative AI provides life sciences companies the ability to identify and learn from patterns in large data sets. This use of AI has clear applications for the development of life-changing therapies. AI can assist companies with enhancing marketing strategies, driving developments in research and development, and making the manufacturing process more efficient—just to name a few examples.

The increased adoption of AI technologies also invites unique regulatory compliance risks stemming from the growing automation of certain business functions. At the same time, AI also offers companies the ability to innovate and improve their compliance functions.

AI compliance risks

The government is aware of the potential compliance risks accompanying the use of AI. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has a longstanding policy to consider the effectiveness of a company’s compliance program when exercising prosecutorial discretion—e.g., making charging decisions and determining what penalties to seek.

DOJ’s September 2024 update to its guidance on the Evaluation of Corporate Compliance Programs (ECCP) invites consideration of whether or not a corporate compliance program adequately accounts for the impact of emerging technologies like AI on compliance with any applicable rules and regulations. Life sciences companies should carefully consider updates to their compliance programs to address such risks.

For example, in November 2024, the University of Colorado Health (UCHealth) agreed to pay a $23 million civil settlement, without admitting liability, to resolve whistleblower allegations that it violated the False Claims Act (FCA), a federal law prohibiting companies from defrauding the government that can be enforced by both the government and through civil actions for treble damages brought by private whistleblowers. The whistleblower alleged that UCHealth used automatic coding programs and improperly up-coded certain claims submitted to Medicare and TRICARE for all Evaluation & Management services with the highest paying code associated with emergency room visits. The whistleblower further alleged that UCHealth knew that their automatic coding rule did not satisfy Medicare and TRICARE billing requirements because the rule did the reflect the actual resources UCHealth used in association with the claims submitted to the government.

Companies participating in federal healthcare programs may find AI appealing for that exact same task, automating the claims submission process; the UCHealth settlement illustrates how an overreliance on such automated processes, without proper oversight and verification of data inputs, can lead to allegations of defrauding the government.

AI compliance solutions

FCA whistleblowers and the government may use AI to identify potential noncompliance, but companies can implement AI in compliance protocols to identify and address problematic trends and compliance risks before the outside identification of noncompliance. The use of AI over traditional compliance monitoring techniques can result in higher efficiencies that enable companies to identify potential issues in close-to-real-time, even when dealing with vast amounts of data.

Examples include:

• Detection of potential compliance risk areas: For potential kickback, bribery, or other unethical behavior, AI-based detection logic can be used on communications and financial transactions between employees and external parties to detect red-flag behavior (meals, entertainment, and disguised gifts) that are in violation of relevant laws (Stark, anti-kickback statute, anti-bribery laws), as well as company internal policies. Likewise, machine learning algorithms can use historical data and create employee and relationship profiles to assess compliance risks associated with contemplated relationships and transactions before any transactions are entered into.

• Enhance outlier analyses: Particularly for healthcare companies and financial institutions, AI can be used to enhance existing data analysis for outlier-type analyses (e.g., Medicare G code tiering or Medicare Advantage risk adjustment adjustments), both in terms of automation of approach and in the ease of access to readily available analyses for more immediate decision-making and mitigation. AI algorithms can link to publicly available Medicare and Medicaid data, OIG reports, and industry data to analyze outlier potential across multiple data sets.

• Compliance investigations: AI can be used to enhance compliance investigation reports through AI-driven document review and report compilation (e.g., suspicious activity reports). AI can also be used to categorize internal compliance reports (e.g., HR, fraud, misuse of corporate resources), which is an area that has been prone to human error. Similar AI investigation techniques can be used for document production for government-initiated investigations. Increasingly, authorities expect that companies will use AI techniques in document production.

• Evolving regulatory requirements: For heavily regulated industries such as healthcare and banks, AI can be used to stay up to date on evolving regulatory requirements. AI tools can monitor changes in the regulatory landscape and implement necessary changes through automated internal controls and updated compliance policies and procedures.

As with any AI or computer-based learning, the results are dependent on the quality of the input data. Data collection, segregation, and integrity are crucial to the success of any AI-driven compliance solution.

Takeaways

There are many compelling reasons why life sciences companies may explore the uses of AI for the development of therapies and technologies. But when doing so, companies should adopt the following mantra: trust but rigorously verify. Without adequate controls in place, the use of AI could quickly turn a seeming business improvement into a business nightmare.

Companies should also carefully consider how AI-driven innovations can enhance their own compliance monitoring and mitigate—or avoid altogether—the adverse consequences of regulatory noncompliance.

While TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select generally have similar benefits, one benefit is unique to TRICARE Prime: payments for travel to receive medically necessary specialty care that isn’t available locally.

The travel benefit is available to all family members and retirees who are enrolled in TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Prime Remote and live within the 48 contiguous states. It is not available when using TRICARE Select, and there’s a different program for overseas.

The medical care must meet specific criteria. Care must be deemed medically necessary. A suitable specialist must not be available within 100 miles of the patient’s primary care manager. A referral from the primary care manager and prior authorization from TRICARE are required.

[LEARN MORE: TRICARE.mil/primetravel]

If eligible, TRICARE will cover plane or train tickets or mileage reimbursement for car travel and necessary tolls and parking fees.

The program might also cover expenses related to meals and lodging. Reimbursement might not fully cover all out-of-pocket costs. For example, lodging reimbursements might be limited per diem allowances, and meal reimbursements might have daily limits.

To use this benefit, beneficiaries must coordinate with their TRICARE regional contractor for pre-authorization. The contractor verifies the care qualifies

for travel reimbursement and provides instructions on filing a travel reimbursement claim. After traveling, beneficiaries must submit receipts for all claimed expenses, including lodging and meal receipts if applicable.
