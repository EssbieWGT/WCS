“The experience underscored the critical importance of the hospital's mission within the broader context of Guantanamo Bay,” Ferrara said.
As part of this system, USNH Guantanamo Bay plays a vital role in delivering health care to service members, civilians, and their families stationed at U.S.
Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.","GUANTANAMO BAY, Cuba – Dr. Stephen Ferrara, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, visited U.S. Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay to engage with leadership and staff on Feb. 27, 2025.

Ferrara’s visit underscores his commitment to engaging with medical personnel at military hospitals and clinics across the Military Health System to better understand their challenges and ensure they have the resources necessary to provide exceptional care.

As the principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense and the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Ferrara oversees health policy, programs, and force health protection across the MHS.

“There is no substitute for boots-on-the-ground to understand the nature and complexity of any mission, especially one this complex,” Ferrara said. “I wanted to ensure the team was receiving the support they need to execute their mission successfully. U.S. Naval Hospital Guantanamo is a particularly vital military hospital in a remote location with a unique mission set, so seeing both the daily operations and unique operations like the joint expeditionary MEDEVAC training was invaluable for understanding the hospital's specific needs and how I can best support their critical work from my position. As the Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, I have a unique responsibility for detainee care, making it important that I gain a firsthand understanding of that unique mission.”

Managing a geographically remote military hospital comes with challenges in manning and occasionally supply chain procurement. Hospital Director U.S. Navy Capt. Tammy Servies, who also serves as commanding officer for U.S. Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command and commander of Joint Task Force Guantanamo’s Joint Medical Group, doesn’t let that impede the mission with her focus on a ready medical force and a medically ready force.

“We were very excited to welcome Dr. Ferrara to Guantanamo,” Servies said. “We provide care to a diverse community, including service members, their dependents, government civilian employees, contractors, and foreign national workers. It was very gratifying to show Dr. Ferrara that no matter who walks through our doors, we are committed to delivering high-quality, reliable health care. Our mission is rooted in operational readiness and wellness, ensuring that those we serve receive the best possible care.

“The health, wellness, and readiness of every service member I lead as the CO of USNMRTC Guantanamo, matters to me personally,” Servies continued. “My team cannot adequately care for others if they are not healthy themselves.”

During his visit, Ferrara met with a cross-section of sailors from every department within the hospital to speak with them and listen to what matters to the most junior members of the hospital team.

“The dedication and resilience of the entire medical staff left a lasting impression on me,” Ferrara said. “It's one thing to hear about the demands of operating in a remote location, but witnessing the team's unwavering commitment to providing top-notch care across a range of disparate environments was truly inspiring.”

Servies echoed the significance of Ferrara’s visit, emphasizing the impact of leadership engagement in understanding the realities of providing health care in a remote setting.

“Despite the challenges we face, my team never fails to amaze me with their willingness to take on every mission that comes our way,” Servies said. “Whether providing support to Joint Task Force Guantanamo, Joint Task Force Southern Guard, or managing the daily operations and patient load from our local community, these military and civilian personnel show an indomitable spirit and mental toughness that sometimes leaves me in awe.”

Ferrara’s visit highlights the ongoing efforts to strengthen military health care delivery and support the dedicated medical personnel who stand ready to serve whenever and wherever they are needed.

“The experience underscored the critical importance of the hospital's mission within the broader context of Guantanamo Bay,” Ferrara said. “The team's ability to maintain a constant state of readiness, adapt to diverse needs, and seamlessly collaborate with other units is a testament to their professionalism and commitment to excellence. The isolation of Guantanamo Bay is also easy to underestimate until walking the spaces. The team here has a mission like no other in the Military Health System.”

The Defense Health Agency manages military hospitals and clinics across the Department of Defense, integrating health care services to enhance readiness, improve patient outcomes, and streamline medical operations.

How to prepare for going to the dentist

Prepare a list of questions. Before your appointment, prepare a list of questions. Ask about preventive measures specific to your needs, like the best flossing technique for your teeth or the ideal frequency of cleanings based on your risk factors.

Don’t hesitate to ask questions. During your appointment, ask clarifying questions about procedures if you’re feeling unsure, discuss the pros and cons of different treatment options, and inquire about potential risks and side effects. If a procedure is suggested, ask about alternative methods, the cost associated with each, and whether your insurance covers the procedure.

Be clear and direct. At any time during the appointment, be clear and direct in expressing any discomfort or concerns. Don't suffer in silence. If a procedure is painful or uncomfortable, inform your dentist immediately. They can adjust their technique or provide pain relief.

Use active listening. Make sure you understand what your dentist is saying about your diagnosis, treatment plan, and aftercare instructions. You can repeat the information back to your dentist to ensure you’ve understood correctly.",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Mar/18/2003669042/1920/1080/0/250318-O-D0202-1001.JPG,N,1.0,2025-03-18 16:56:32.090496

Clarkson opened up the episode with a ""Kellyoke,"" where she sang ""Flames"" by New Zealand artist Will Swenson. Soon after wrapping the song, the music star jumped right into interviewing ""Severance"" actor Adam Scott.

The 42-year-old singer did not publicly address her absence from the show's past several episodes. Reports surfaced last week that the ""American Idol"" winner was fine herself but was ""dealing with a personal matter.""

Fans awaited Clarkson's expected return Tuesday after the daytime talk show revealed this week's TV schedule. If the schedule stays true, Clarkson will be out again for Wednesday's show and will return on Thursday and Friday.

""Watch What Happens Live"" host Andy Cohen will take the helm on Wednesday, according to the schedule.

For the past two weeks, a handful of celebrities have stepped up to guest host episodes of ""The Kelly Clarkson Show.""

According to Entertainment Tonight, a source said Clarkson's absence was due to a ""sudden family emergency"" and she missed a total of 10 tapings of her talk show. With nine of those already aired, Wednesday's episode would be the last one she missed.

ET reported Clarkson was back in her studio Thursday to tape a new episode and will host the show's 1,000th episode set to air this week.

Questions about Clarkson's absence started on March 3, when actor Simu Liu seemingly took on hosting duties at the last-minute.

""I am not Kelly Clarkson. I know this may shock many of you,"" Liu quipped at the top of the show. ""But Kelly actually isn't able to make it today, we're sending her our very best.""

""Here's the thing, I did not know that I was doing this until about five minutes ago when I arrived here to promote my new movie, 'Last Breath,' which is in theaters right now,"" Liu explained.

According to the Entertainment Tonight report, guests were not told in advance that Clarkson would be out due to privacy reasons and were given the option to guest host when they arrived at the studio.

While Clarkson hosted the episodes that aired on Tuesday and Wednesday of that week, comedian Roy Wood Jr. guest hosted on Thursday and Wanda Sykes was there on Friday.

Here’s how it works: • Employer-sponsored and private insurance: OHI pays first.
You must submit a TRICARE Other Health Insurance Form to Express Scripts.
When everyone is informed and working together, you’ll ensure that your health coverage is maximized.","FALLS CHURCH, Va. – Do you or your spouse have health coverage through an employer? Or maybe you’ve been shopping for additional coverage due to a change in your health needs.

TRICARE may not be the only health coverage you have. If you have health insurance through an employer, a spouse’s plan, or a private insurer, it’s considered other health insurance.

OHI can affect how TRICARE processes your claim. TRICARE and OHI work together to help cover your health care and services, as described in Chapter 4, Section 1 of the TRICARE Reimbursement Manual.

Understanding how TRICARE coordinates with OHI can help ensure your claims are processed correctly, helping to avoid unexpected costs.

Which insurance pays first?

In most cases, TRICARE pays after your OHI has processed your claim. Here’s how it works:

• Employer-sponsored and private insurance: OHI pays first. After your OHI processes the claim, TRICARE may cover some—or all—of the balance.

• Medicare, OHI, and TRICARE For Life:

• Whether Medicare or your OHI pays first depends on several factors: whether your OHI is based on current or former employment (and the number of employees), and if you have end-stage renal disease. Medicare only coordinates with one other health plan.

• If OHI pays after Medicare, and there is a remaining balance, you’re responsible for filing a claim with TRICARE.

• TRICARE pays last, after Medicare and OHI, as described in the TRICARE For Life Handbook.

• If you have Medicare and have questions about who pays first, or if your coverage changes, call Medicare’s Benefits Coordination and Recovery Center at 855-798-2627 (TTY: 855-797-2627) .

• Travel insurance: If you buy a temporary plan for travel, TRICARE will process your claims only after your travel insurance.

There are a few times when TRICARE pays first. This includes when you have:

• Medicaid

• TRICARE supplemental plans

• Eligibility for state victims of crime compensation programs

• Other federal government programs identified by the Defense Health Agency

If TRICARE mistakenly pays first when it shouldn’t, it may take back the payment and reprocess your claim after your OHI has processed it.

OHI for active duty service members

Active duty service members can use OHI under certain circumstances. If you use OHI, keep the following in mind:

• You’re responsible for all costs.

• TRICARE won’t be second payer. There’s no coordination of benefits with your OHI and TRICARE.

• You must disclose your military status to your OHI to avoid denials or recoupments.

• If you get care from a civilian provider, you must comply with service regulations.

• Unauthorized care may affect your fitness for duty status.

What you need to do

To avoid claims processing delays, let your TRICARE contractor and care providers know you have OHI. You can report your OHI by:

• Phone: Call your regional TRICARE contractor.

• Online: Fill out and submit your contractor’s OHI questionnaire.

• Mail or fax: Complete and send your TRICARE contractor OHI questionnaire.

If your OHI coverage changes, notify your TRICARE contractor right away. Losing OHI is a Qualifying Life Event, so you’ll have 90 days to make changes to your plan.

Using OHI with TRICARE pharmacy and dental coverage

• Pharmacy benefits: If your OHI includes pharmacy coverage, your OHI will pay first. You must submit a TRICARE Other Health Insurance Form to Express Scripts. For lower costs, use a pharmacy that’s in both your OHI’s network and the TRICARE network.

• Dental plans: If you’re enrolled in the TRICARE Dental Program or the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program, your dental insurance provider will determine the order of payment based on your plan.

Stay informed and notify TRICARE

Properly coordinating your OHI with TRICARE ensures you maximize your benefits and avoid delays in claims processing. If you have OHI:

• Tell your TRICARE contractor and healthcare providers about your OHI.

• Make sure your claims are submitted in the correct order.

• Notify TRICARE if your OHI coverage changes.

Unlock your health by taking these simple steps today. When everyone is informed and working together, you’ll ensure that your health coverage is maximized.

If you look at what our primary mission is—supporting the warfighter in combat—it is very empowering.","In his first exclusive interview, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Dr. Stephen Ferrara talks about how the Military Health System supports the Department of Defense in achieving its mission by being a “Force Multiplier for the Warfighter.” Dr. Ferrara is a retired U.S. Navy doctor who continued to practice medicine after 25 years on active duty until being appointed into his current role on Jan. 20, 2025. Prior to his present position, he served as the deputy director for clinical operations for the National Capital Region, the Department of Defense’s largest health care network.

“We improve and increase the lethality of the warfighter, and we do that through a number of ways. If you look at what our primary mission is—supporting the warfighter in combat—it is very empowering.

Fire ants, Solenopsis invicta and S. richteri, from South America have recently colonized three continents. Prevalence of fire ant-venom anaphylaxis in the general population and in systemic mastocytosis is unknown. The aim was to determine fire ant-venom anaphylaxis prevalence among Tricare beneficiaries and those with systemic mastocytosis.Methods: We queried the beneficiary immunotherapy prescription database for patients who received immunotherapy with Hymenoptera venom or fire ant whole-body extract and the Tricare beneficiary population health registry database for patients with an ICD-10 code for Hymenoptera venom allergy (HVA). Greater than 95% of the beneficiary population were patients living in the United States. Chart review of a random sample of 150 patients linked to a HVA ICD-10 code was performed to determine the percent of patients with Hymenoptera-venom anaphylaxis. Retrospective review of a systemic mastocytosis cohort was performed to assess fire ant-venom anaphylaxis rate and treatment patterns.Results: Fire ant immunotherapy was the most frequently ordered individual immunotherapy prescription 45.9% (n=878). Fire ant prescriptions surpassed all flying Hymenoptera immunotherapy prescriptions combined in six states. Fire ant and flying Hymenoptera-venom anaphylaxis prevalence in the general population was 0.048% and 0.083%, respectively. Fire ant-venom anaphylaxis prevalence in the 14 colonized states was 0.085%. More patients with systemic mastocytosis had anaphylaxis triggered by fire ant than all Hymenoptera combined.

I am an in network credentialed provider for Tricare and yet some clients randomly show me as out of network and their EOB erroneously reflects this as more financial responsibility for the client.

Your provider needs to contact Tricare and resubmit the claim. And yes, balance billing (asking a client for more than negotiated rate) is not right. But if the provider has a billing service this may just be an automated response to the internal errors. It’s a huge issue with many providers not getting paid by Tricare since 12/2024.

I would contact Tricare right away and ask them about it. When I had my kids (granted, this was ages ago), the hospital I went to tried balance billing, which they weren’t allowed to do. I had to have Tricare write them a cease and desist twice. It’s not deductible. They wouldn’t make you pay the entire thing at once (though I have select, so Idk if it’s different in that, but I doubt it). I would call before the bill is due and then have Tricare verify and then contact the provider. I know I didn’t have to do anything beyond that, but you may want to cover yourself and just tell them you contacted Tricare, who will be contacting them about it.

Good luck.

I use a nurse practitioner for my primary care provider. He is also apparently listed as an allergy specialist. On a visit last year he billed as a specialist which has a higher copay. I contacted the billing office to find out what was going on and they wrote off the entire copay.

Now my copay shows before I even see him and I go ahead and pay that online, then I don't pay anything else until I get the EOB and I only pay what Tricare says I owe. (Tricare select)",,N,-1.0,2025-03-18 12:59:54.925680

Camden, NJ — Two former executives of a Louisiana compounding pharmacy were found guilty of conspiring to use the pharmacy to defraud New Jersey and military health benefits programs of approximately $100 million, conspiring to commit identity theft in connection with the fraud, and conspiring to transact in the criminal proceeds, U.S. Attorney John Giordano announced.

Christopher Kyle Johnston of Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Trent Brockmeier of The Villages, Florida, were convicted on March 10, 2025 of one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and health care fraud, one count of conspiring to commit identity theft by fraudulently using a means of identification, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering by transacting in criminal proceeds following a six-week trial before U.S. District Judge Edward S. Kiel.

According to documents filed in this case and the evidence at trial:

Central Rexall Drugs was a pharmacy in Louisiana that prepared compounded medications, which are specialty medications mixed by a pharmacist to meet the specific medical needs of an individual patient. In 2013, Johnston and Brockmeier entered into an agreement to take over the management of the pharmacy and expand the compounding business in exchange for 90 percent of the profits. Brockmeier became chief operating officer of Central Rexall and Johnston became general counsel.

Johnston and Brockmeier learned that certain insurance plans would reimburse thousands of dollars for a one-month supply of certain compounded medications – including pain, scar, and antifungal creams, as well as vitamin combinations. The health plans for New Jersey state and local government and education employees, including teachers, firefighters, municipal police officers, and state troopers, covered these medications, as did TRICARE, which insures current and former members of the U.S. military and their families.

Johnston and Brockmeier designed compounded medications and manipulated the ingredients in the medications in order to obtain high insurance reimbursements rather than serve the medical needs of patients. To determine which ingredients and combinations resulted in high insurance reimbursements, Johnston and Brockmeier directed Central Rexall employees to submit false prescription claims to test out different combinations of ingredients, but they did not have a valid prescription signed by a doctor for these formulas. Central Rexall submitted these false claims using, without their consent, individuals’ names, dates of birth, and identifying information (including insurance information) from pre-existing Central Rexall prescriptions.

By use of these false claims, Johnston and Brockmeier designed compounded medications with combinations of ingredients that were chosen solely based on the amount of money that insurance would pay rather than on the medications’ ability to serve the medical needs of patients.

Johnston and Brockmeier retained and directed an outside sales force that used various methods to get doctors to prescribe these medications and patients to accept them, including having prescriptions signed without the patient seeing a doctor or knowing about the medications, having medications or refills ordered without the patients’ knowledge, paying patients to accept the medications, and paying doctors to prescribe them.

Johnston and Brockmeier caused approximately $100 million in fraudulent insurance claims for compounded medications that were not medically necessary. Johnston received approximately $34 million and Brockmeier received approximately $5 million in illicit profits.

50 people have been convicted or pled guilty in the overarching conspiracy.

The health care fraud and wire fraud conspiracy count carries a maximum potential penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, or twice the gain or loss from the offense. The conspiracy to commit identity theft count carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense. The conspiracy to commit money laundering charge carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense or not more than twice the amount of the criminally derived property involved in the transactions. Sentencing is scheduled for July 21, 2025.

U.S. Attorney John Giordano credited special agents of IRS - Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI), under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Jenifer Piovesan in Newark; special agents of the FBI’s Atlantic City Resident Agency, under the direction of Acting Special Agent in Charge Terence G. Reilly in Newark; and the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Inspector General, Northeast Region, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Jonathan Mellone, with the investigation leading to today’s conviction.

A total of 148 active-duty service members (SMs) were recruited for this randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants were randomly assigned to either the SMART (n=80) or SCORE (n=68) intervention arms. Outcome measures were administered at the start (T1) and end of treatment (T2), and at 3 months post-treatment (T3). The primary outcome measure was the Global Deficit Scale (GDS), a composite of seven different objective measures of cognitive performance. Secondarily, participants completed the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI) and Key Behavioral Change Index (KBCI) self-report measures of post concussive symptoms (PCS). A cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) was performed directly comparing the relative efficiencies of the two CR interventions. Mixed Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed a significant decrease in GDS scores from T1 to T3 (p <.001, ηp2 = .217), irrespective of intervention type (p = .986, ηp2 = .000).

This flexibility can be helpful when choosing a rehab center that meets your needs. TRICARE insurance has several plans, including TRICARE Select, each with different benefits and coverage options.

When choosing a rehab facility it’s important to know the different types of treatment centers TRICARE Select covers. These include:

1. Inpatient Rehab Centers

Inpatient treatment or residential rehab centers provide intensive, around-the-clock care in a structured environment. These programs are best for individuals with severe addictions who need medical supervision and support. TRICARE Select typically covers inpatient stays but pre-authorization may be required.

2. Outpatient Rehab Centers

Outpatient treatment allows you to receive care while living at home, making it a good option for those with mild to moderate substance use disorders. Services may include individual and group therapy, medication management, and relapse prevention planning.

TRICARE Select covers both inpatient and outpatient rehab services, so flexibility is based on the severity of the addiction.

3. Partial Hospitalization Programs (PHPs)

PHPs provide a high level of care without full-time residential treatment. Patients attend treatment for several hours a day and return home in the evenings. TRICARE Select often covers PHPs as an alternative to inpatient rehab.

4. Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOPs)

IOPs offer a structured treatment approach with multiple therapy sessions a week but more flexibility than inpatient or PHP treatment. These programs are good for individuals transitioning from a higher level of care or those with moderate addiction concerns.

5. Detox Centers

Medically supervised detox for alcohol and drugs is the first step in addiction recovery, especially for substances that cause severe withdrawal symptoms.

TRICARE Select may cover detox services if they are done at a TRICARE-authorized facility.

1. Verify TRICARE Authorization

Authorized facilities meet the necessary standards for quality care and accept TRICARE coverage. To make sure the rehab center is TRICARE authorized, speak with a TRICARE Rehabs representative. We can help you find a TRICARE-approved facility that is covered under your plan.

2. Understand Costs and Coverage Limits

While TRICARE Select covers many rehab services, you may still have out-of-pocket costs such as copayments or cost-shares. Be sure to confirm financial responsibilities before starting treatment.

3. Consider Location and Specialization

Choose a facility that meets your needs. Some centers specialize in treating veterans while others offer dual diagnosis treatment for co-occurring mental health disorders.

4. Get Recommendations

Talk to a TRICARE Rehabs representative to get guidance on choosing the right rehab center to get treatment. We are experts on military-specific addiction treatment, and work with an extensive network of veterans rehab facilities across the nation that cater military members and their families.

What to Expect in a TRICARE Select Rehab Program

The rehab experience varies based on the level of care and individual needs but most programs follow a structured treatment plan that includes:

1. Assessment and Intake

A comprehensive evaluation to determine the best treatment plan. This may include medical assessments, psychological evaluations, and substance use history.

2. Detox (if needed)

Medically supervised detox to ensure a safe withdrawal process and prepare individuals for the next phase of treatment.

3. Therapy and Counseling

Evidence-based therapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and trauma-informed care are often included in treatment plans. This is due to how common mental health issues are amongst military personnel and veterans.

4. Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT)

For those struggling with opioid or alcohol addiction, MAT may be prescribed to ease withdrawal symptoms and reduce cravings.

5. Aftercare and Relapse Prevention

Successful recovery from drug and alcohol addiction requires ongoing support such as 12-step programs, outpatient therapy, and sober living arrangements.

Getting treatment for substance use disorder is a big step and TRICARE Select health insurance makes it available to military families. Knowing the coverage, choosing the right rehab and committing to the process can mean a healthier, addiction free life.

TRICARE offers several health insurance options for retired service members and their eligible family members. Understanding these options is key to making the best choices for your healthcare needs during retirement.

Who’s Eligible?

If you’re a retired service member, you’re eligible for TRICARE benefits if you fall into one of these categories:

You retired from active duty.

You retired from the National Guard or Reserve (beginning at age 60 or earlier if drawing retirement pay due to specific service credits).

You’re placed on the Temporary Disability Retirement List (TDRL) or Permanent Disability Retirement List (PDRL).

You’re receiving retired pay, even if it’s due to a medical retirement.

Eligible Family Members Include:

Spouses

Unmarried children (up to age 21, or 23 if enrolled in college full time)

Adult children with disabilities that occurred before age 21 (or 23 if in college)

TRICARE Plan Options for Retirees

Once you retire, your TRICARE options change from what you had on active duty. Here’s a breakdown of the available plans:

1. TRICARE Prime

Who Can Enroll: Retired service members and eligible family members in Prime Service Areas (PSAs) in the U.S.

Cost: Enrollment fees apply, and there may be copayments for certain services.

How It Works: You have a Primary Care Manager (PCM) who coordinates your care and referrals. It’s similar to an HMO. If your family was enrolled in TRICARE Prime during active service, or you were a service member receiving care at a Military Treatment Facility (MTF), this is the same process.

2. TRICARE Select

Who Can Enroll: Retirees and families worldwide (where TRICARE Select is offered).

Cost: Annual enrollment fees and cost-shares (percentage of covered services you pay). No referrals needed, but some services require prior authorization.

How It Works: You manage your own health care. You can see any TRICARE-authorized provider without a referral.

3. TRICARE For Life (TFL)

Who Can Enroll: Retirees and their family members who are eligible for Medicare Part A and have Medicare Part B.

Cost: No enrollment fee, but you must pay for Medicare Part B. TFL acts as a secondary payer to Medicare.

How It Works: Available worldwide. Medicare pays first in the U.S., and TFL pays what’s left. Outside the U.S., TFL is the primary payer.

4. TRICARE Reserve Select (TRS) / TRICARE Retired Reserve (TRR)

TRS: For actively serving National Guard/Reserve members (not retirees).

TRR: For “gray area” retirees—those under age 60 not yet drawing retired pay. It’s a premium-based plan.

5. US Family Health Plan (USFHP)

Who Can Enroll: Retirees and family members under age 65 in specific areas of the U.S.

Cost: Enrollment fees and copayments, similar to TRICARE Prime.

How It Works: Care is provided by a network of private providers. Once you turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare, you can no longer stay in this plan.

Dental and Vision Coverage

TRICARE Dental Program (TDP)

Not available to retirees.

Retirees can enroll in the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP) for dental coverage.

Vision Coverage

Retirees enrolled in a TRICARE health plan can also get vision coverage through FEDVIP.

What Changes at Age 65?

At age 65, you typically become eligible for Medicare Part A and Part B, and TRICARE For Life becomes your primary TRICARE coverage. You must enroll in Medicare Part B to keep TRICARE coverage.

Key Takeaways

Enrollment Fees & Costs: Retirees pay enrollment fees and cost-shares, unlike active-duty members. These fees change annually.

Open Season: Annual TRICARE Open Season runs from mid-November to mid-December, allowing you to enroll in or switch plans.

When people have insurance that covers therapy, psychiatry, and other mental health services, they’re more likely to seek help when needed rather than delaying care due to financial concerns. TRICARE mental health coverage is crucial for military service members since early intervention often leads to better outcomes and prevents conditions from worsening to the point where they require more intensive and expensive treatments.

Mental health insurance in Los Angeles also reduces the financial burden that can come with ongoing mental health care, which sometimes requires months or years of consistent treatment.

As access to treatment and insurance coverage expands, the percentage of adults who have received any mental health treatment has increased in recent years. This article will further explore the benefits of how insurance increases access to mental services and how to ensure every patient can receive affordable treatment for mental health.

How Do TRICARE’s Mental Health Benefits Compare to Other Insurance Plans?

TRICARE’s mental health coverage generally offers comprehensive benefits comparable to or better than many private insurance plans. Active duty service members receive full coverage with minimal out-of-pocket costs for authorized care, while family members and retirees have access to a broad network of providers with reasonable copays.

TRICARE is particularly strong in its coverage of various treatment modalities, including individual therapy, group therapy, inpatient care, partial hospitalization programs, and medication management. Another notable advantage is TRICARE’s integration with military treatment facilities, which can provide seamless care coordination between physical and mental health services, which civilian plans often struggle to achieve.

However, TRICARE does face some limitations compared to certain premium private insurance plans. Network availability can be challenging in remote locations, sometimes requiring beneficiaries to travel significant distances for specialized mental health care. While TRICARE has expanded its telehealth options, some premium commercial plans offer more extensive virtual mental health platforms with broader provider networks and specialized digital therapeutic tools.

Insurance verification for mental health treatment and referral requirements can also be more stringent under TRICARE, particularly for active duty members, creating potential administrative barriers to care that some civilian plans have eliminated. Despite these differences, TRICARE remains a valuable and robust mental health benefit that continues to evolve to meet the unique needs of the military community.",https://momentofclarity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tricare-mental-health-coverage.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-17 17:50:49.574543

The project presentation was based upon such criteria as innovative/creativity and overall impact on quality of care, patient safety and operational readiness.

“By continuously evaluating and refining our processes, we can reduce inefficiencies allowing more time for patient care and more time to utilize/improve the knowledge, skills, and abilities that make us a ready medical force,” said Lt. Cmdr. Ashley Gripe, Navy Medicine Readiness Training Unit Everett Physical Therapy Department head and Process Improvement Sciences lead. “By always looking at ways to improve, we are better able to provide the safe and quality healthcare that our service members need to ensure a medially ready force.”

The ‘Continuous Process Improvement’ concept is based upon the DHA Ready Reliable Care principle, which is focused on reducing unwarranted variation across the system, eliminating waste, and lowering costs.

“We recognize that Continuous Process Improvement is critical to what we do in Navy Medicine and in the fleet. By constantly analyzing and refining processes, we can adapt to changing demands, increase our patient satisfaction, and optimize our resource utilization,” Gripe said.

“This CPI Fair gives us an opportunity to highlight initiatives around the command,” continued Gripe. “Staff can demonstrate the improvements they are making to advance patient quality and safety. It helps to encourage a culture of High Reliability and Continuous Process Improvement that we strive for every day.

CPI initiatives included such ideas as implementing clinical improvements; developing strategic clinical partnerships; and improving and refining administrative and support processes.

“The submissions this year included projects from throughout the command including submissions from our branch clinics. They show the innovation and creativity that our staff utilizes every day to improve the care of our beneficiaries. The submissions demonstrated an impact on safety, quality, and readiness with controls to make sure they are able to sustain the benefits over time,” explained Gripe. “Some of the best ideas come from our civilian staff and corpsmen working day in and day out on the deck plates.”

Each of the 15 submissions presented a process to be improved, measurement on the improved process, analysis which tested any change(s) implemented, and more.

Navy Medicine Readiness Training Unit Everett Pharmacy presented their submission of ‘Pharmacy Designated Service Hours,’ how increased patient wait times can occur when pharmacy staff helping patients are pulled to perform other necessary tasks. Their goal indicated to create designated service hours to increase efficiency and reduce patient wait time by allowing pharmacy tasks to be done prior to assisting patients. Project lead was Lt.

Kala Lepore, Naval Hospital Bremerton director and Navy Medicine Readiness Training Command Bremerton commanding officer, that ship providers homeported at Naval Station Everett were encountering challenges when they tried to place lab orders. Vera and her team members of HM2 Moncho Cabahug, HM2 Caleb MartinezSewell and Ms. Jezieca Cachero devised their project around distributing a lab order reference guide – with regular updates – to all providers on the waterfront to ensure a seamless and efficient ordering process for lab work.

After Hospitalman Olivia Blader Polzin of NHB’s Patient Administration noticed that there was unknown supply inventory with several departments which caused delays and missed items, she took it upon herself to develop an Excel spreadsheet to keep accurate records to minimize deficiencies, streamline ordering of actual needed supplies and increase productivity between the departments.

NHB’s Information Management Department had a vexing problem which they rectified as presented in ‘Asset Refresh,’ led by project leads Lt. j.g. David Tegtmeyer and Electronics Technician 1st Class Adam Phelps, ably assisted by all IMD staff members. They had approximately 800 pieces of equipment which had to be timely updated to meet the stringent requirements. Each item took nearly four hours to upgrade as required.

NHB’s Radiology Department presented their project, entitled “MOU for CT Training.’ The department has had CT imaging challenges due to manning challenges, caused by transfer and retirement. The department has proposed establishing a memorandum of understanding with local civilian hospital, St. Michael Medical Center, to authorize NHB radiologic technologists to obtain added training for CT, as well as other modalities such as MRI, ultrasound and mammography.

Lt. Essie Gutierrez represented the Directorate of Health Services Specialty Care Clinic presentation, ‘Utilization of Electronic Colonoscopy Teaching Video,’ which called for streamlining the delivery process of patient education instructions for colonoscopy teaching.

The Neurology Clinic, with project leads Lt. Cmdr. Margaret Mitzkewich and Lt. Justin Roelofs and team members Hospital Corpsman 1st Class William Brown and HM2 Kyle Champion, determined that they were retrieving approximately 16 vials per week of Botulinum from the inpatient pharmacy. Not a difficult task, but time consuming. Due to the constant need for refrigeration and inability to pick up in bulk, there was the continuous need to only pick up one order at a time. Until a properly suited refrigerator was identified and relocated in the clinic.

The Ophthalmology Department presented their ‘Ocular Triage and Challenges of Standardization’ submission, noting they had determined there was a lack of accurate ophthalmic triaging at the initial point of care, resulting in deferred patient referral and delays in care. Their goal was to standardize the triage process with initial [patient] presentation at primary and urgent care clinics, reduce time delays for urgent and emergent ophthalmology cases and reduce potential patient harm through delays in reporting for care. Project lead was Lt. Cmdr. Lan Nguyen assisted by team member HM2 Quinniece Mosley.

‘Project Pulmonary Expansion’ was presented by the Pulmonary Clinic with project lead HM1 Joseph Towery explaining that the clinic is not generating [enough] encounters relevant to patient populations and referrals. In order to improve access to care for all respiratory therapy patients within the service area and lower the task load of primary care, the clinic restructured referral management template to provide NHB as the top source for appointments by bringing back patients previously sent for care into the surrounding network and Madigan Army Medical Center.

Improving time management was key the ‘RFID Implementation in the Clinic Setting’ presentation by Family Medicine, led by project lead Lt. j.g. Maryn Holtslander and team members Lt. Hana Reichert and Hospitalman Gillian Searfoss. Their premise indicated a delay when transferring intake [information] from paper to the DoD’s electronic health record, MHS GENESIS, instead of directly documenting during the initial intake process. Eliminating the need for paper charting provides a number of time-saving advantages, especially giving the provider added triage time with the patient.

The Family Medicine presentation ‘On the Lookout’ used HEDIS (Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set) to help identify patients due – or overdue – for preventive medicine measures such as colorectal screenings and mammograms, as well as address other delinquent measures including immunizations. The goal, established by project lead Terri Jandron, registered nurse, with team members registered nurses Ramir Salcedo, Farrah Palad and Devry Cmelo, Lt. Mikala Tracy, Lt. Christopher Gunderson, Lt. Olivia Cook, and Reichert, Lt. j.g. Wanda Burdick, Lt. j.g. Halle Hassett, and Holtslander, was to ensure providers and support staff are aware of screening needs and added orders placed while patients are present for scheduled appointments which can increase the number of patients completing their preventive health needs.

‘Teams Communication’ was the submission from Primary Care, with project lead Dr. Brandi Hommel and Reichert, aided by Family Medicine staff as team members. Their problem statement indicated challenges in communication amongst staff members was spreading in the clinic, specifically relating appointment delays between administrative receptionists and clinic support staff. They implemented the process of using Teams chat for all; nursing and support staff to help improve easier – and timely – communication.

NHB’s Informatics Steering Committee, charged with planning and implementing strategic informational technology initiatives, determined that the command did not have appointed peer experts for clinical areas, a Defense Health Agency requirement for all military treatment facilities. Their ‘Peer Expert Program,’ was led by project lead Reichert and team members Kelly Gann, Chris Rona, Kristina Sainz, Gunderson and Cmdr. J. M. Patton. A standardized program format was developed and peer experts within two clinical areas were put in place on a trial basis to determine knowledge and confidence with MHS GENESIS.

‘Utilizing Auto-Text’ from Family Medicine’s Primary Care Clinic, led by project lead HM3 Adam Redman and Holtslander, with team members Reichert and HN Anfernee Coleman, realized that their clinic relied upon in-between encounters with MHS GENESIS to communicate information regarding patient requests and staff member needs. There were times some information would be omitted, and written messages were a time-consuming process. The project goal was to streamline routine tasks through automation by implementing a standardized approach for all users.

The Family Medicine Clinic presented the ‘Purple Paper Project,’ stating that obstetrics referrals from their clinic to OB/GYN could be delayed due to a non-standardized process for ordering, verifying test results and timely entering appropriate referrals for network care.

Their goal is to create a standardized format for patients enrolled in the clinic, as well as those who present in NHB’s Urgent Care Clinic and request a pregnancy test. Project lead was Hassett, with team members Tracy, Reichert, Cook, Gunderson, Holtslander, Burdick, Salcedo, Palad and Cmelo.

Gripe attests that the benefits of encouraging such innovation and creativity in military medicine are manifold.

“Both our beneficiaries and our staff benefit from us sharing our process improvement ideas. The benefit however is not limited just to here. After the CPI Fair we will enter these projects into the Strategic Performance Improvement Data Repository which makes these improvement ideas available to all Department of Defense and the Defense Health Agency entities. The improvements that we make here has the potential to impact staff and patients across the world,” stated Gripe.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2503/8919769/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-17 12:50:35.328372

I constantly drill into them, to never pay a claim until AFTER Medicare has adjudicated it.

But yet, many times they pay the first claim that comes in from the provider.

A few years ago Rachel got an outpatient claim from the hospital for $20k. The provider coded the claim correctly but someone at the hospital keyed in a code that was off by one digit. This caused the claim to be adjudicated as NC vs approved.

The provider called the hospital, explained the coding discrepancy, and the claim was paid in full (remaining 20% covered by the Medigap).

On another situation, Rachel had OP consult in Dec 2024 followed by surgery in January. The first bill we got was in early March for $14,000. The bill was never submitted to Medicare, they were billing us as ""self pay, no insurance"". After they submitted it to Medicare we owed $87 (the Part B deductible).

In the Army and Air Force, nearly 1,400 more soldiers and airmen work as surgical technicians.
“Some of the surgical techs here can be [asked] to serve in Djibouti or tasked out to certain hospitals that are critically undermanned.
“We are the fastest turnaround for refractive surgeries,” Mosley said.
Mosley’s duties include ordering specialty implants for surgeries, managing supplies and equipment, and overseeing other ophthalmology surgical techs and hospital corpsmen.","MARCH 16, 2025 – Peace through strength — one of the Defense Department’s basic tenets — is partially achieved through readiness. A ready, focused force isn’t possible without the crucial medical care offered to warfighters to ensure they’re equipped for any fight that might come.

Navy hospital corpsmen are critical components of military medicine, including as support for surgeons in various specialties. Corpsmen with the surgical tech specialty are considered the backbone of the departments in which they work, helping the Navy as it provides day-to-day medical support to sailors who often operate in far-flung locations.

According to a draft of the Medical Transparency Database from the Defense Health Agency, as of September 2024, there were about 830 hospital corpsmen with the surgical tech specialty in the Navy. In the Army and Air Force, nearly 1,400 more soldiers and airmen work as surgical technicians.

From assisting during surgeries to properly carrying out disinfection and sterilization processes, surgical techs are vital in fields ranging from dentistry and ear, nose and throat services to labor and delivery and ophthalmology. They go where they’re needed, whether it’s on a trauma team near a combat zone, on a humanitarian mission or at a military medical treatment facility.

“Some of the surgical techs here can be [asked] to serve in Djibouti or tasked out to certain hospitals that are critically undermanned. There’s a wide range of opportunities,” said Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class Quinn Mosley, the lead hospital corpsman and certified surgical technician at Naval Hospital Bremerton’s Ophthalmology Clinic and Refractive Surgery Center, Bremerton, Washington.

In 2023, Bremerton’s ophthalmology clinic handled more than 4,400 appointments for active-duty service members and other uniformed personnel. The refractive surgery center, which does corrective surgeries such as LASIK, brings in patients from across the Indo-Pacific, a region where the DOD is working to strengthen alliances against ever-increasing threats from China.

“We are the fastest turnaround for refractive surgeries,” Mosley said. “You will be seen 10 times faster [here than] anywhere else in the Navy.”

Improving Operational Readiness

Bremerton’s ophthalmology clinic emphasizes enhancing warfighters’ visual performance which means they strive to improve operational readiness by reducing the need for glasses and contact lenses. Service members can have nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism corrected through PRK or LASIK surgery.

Mosley’s duties include ordering specialty implants for surgeries, managing supplies and equipment, and overseeing other ophthalmology surgical techs and hospital corpsmen. Any surgery is nerve-wracking, but especially those involving the eyes, so the surgical techs also help educate their patients on the procedures and what could potentially happen, as well as offer reassurances to calm them.

“I make sure I play a little bit of music for them in my office just to get them ‘zen’d’ out,” Mosley said.

Mosley’s job also includes traveling with patients if they need to be transferred. For example, she might go with a patient to Madigan Army Medical Center on Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, about 45 minutes south, so the doctors performing the surgery have someone familiar with them.

Mosley said getting surgeries set up in a timely fashion in ophthalmology can be challenging, so when patients get the relief they’ve been seeking, it’s incredibly satisfying.

“That is the best part of my job — in real-time seeing how you’ve drastically changed someone’s life,” Mosley said. “I’ve had patients come back, and they’re just so thankful. They thank the entire staff, and they explain how their quality of life has drastically improved.”
