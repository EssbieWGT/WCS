We must be able to rely on our frontline supervisors to make informed judgments, respond to crises under pressure, and carry out their objectives.

“Air Force medicine exists to project the lethality of the United States Air Force … we must be able to shoot, move, communicate — then medicate.”","“Make your career, your career,” Air Force Chief Master Sgt. Tanya Johnson, Defense Health Agency’s senior enlisted leader, said to a roomful of airmen who were attending the Frontline Supervisors Course at Malcolm Grow Medical Clinics and Surgery Center in Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, Sept. 30.

Johnson participated in a panel of senior enlisted leaders and field-grade officers at the day-long course — attended by top enlisted personnel and officers — to provide leadership advice and answer questions. Course topics throughout the day included administrative writing, supervising civilians, manpower management, standards and discipline, building culture, caring for your people, and additional leadership skills.

Stressing the importance of making supervisors’ leadership journey their own, Johnson said, “If you focus on you, what you want out of your experience, you'll be OK … I'm human too, and we're all walking through this together.”

Training course ensures mission readiness of medical personnel

U.S. Air Force leadership emphasized training such as the Frontline Supervisors Course helps to address potential knowledge gaps across leaders in the military.

“We noticed for frontline supervisors, there were certain things that we expect people to know at a specific rank that a lot of times they didn’t know or had not had the training or exposure to,” said Air Force Master Sgt. Chelsie Evangelista, dental flight chief, Bolling Medical Squadron, Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in Washington, D.C.

Evangelista said ongoing training “isn’t just about checking a box — it’s about staying ready for whatever comes next. We must be able to rely on our frontline supervisors to make informed judgments, respond to crises under pressure, and carry out their objectives. You can’t expect anyone to do well if they don’t have solid foundational and continuous training that reinforces their capabilities and resilience.”

The day also included opportunities to learn from a variety of senior leaders who provided guidance and perspective into their journey at the helm of military health care.

“Our frontline supervisors occupy different lanes and accomplish our mission; it's important that we can have a united front and take pride in our roles as medics, making sure that people are upholding the standards, and then having the necessary tools to be successful,” said Evangelista. “We designed this course to be able to strengthen those capabilities for our frontline supervisors.”

Air Force Senior Airman Isamar Garcia, a mental health technician at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, Washington, D.C., said she participated in the course “to prep me for going into that staff sergeant position in the future, and then hopefully leading my flight.”

“Air Force culture is to lead by example, and I hope to follow that tradition,” said Garcia. “Starting as a young airman in leadership positions, we’re trying to raise ready and capable airmen. We're getting ready for the future.”

Continued knowledge sharing and education, Evangelista said, is critical to mission success.

“Mission begins with readiness, and readiness begins with us. Ongoing training isn’t just a professional responsibility; it’s a strategic imperative. The future of health care leadership hinges on our commitment to lifelong learning.”

Positivity and teamwork at the foundation of Johnson’s leadership

With more than 30 years of military service, Johnson provided anecdotes and leadership advice to those senior leaders and frontline supervisors in attendance.

“Today is a good day to have a good day — that’s how I want you to walk in the door every day,” she said to course participants.

She also emphasized the importance of not only having a team behind you, but one that you can trust. “Having that person who can tell you to take a knee or say those uncomfortable things to you when it begins to get a little too personal” is key to success, she added.

“Manage your expectations,” Johnson said. “Just because someone doesn’t do something one way doesn't mean it is wrong. It is just a different way.”

True leaders recognize that they, too, can continue learning, she stressed.

“Knowledge is another essential element to being an effective leader,” Johnson said. “I have a homework folder where if I hear something that I didn't understand what it was, or I don't know something about it — I will.”

Attitude can make or destroy a team’s morale, she added. “The tone of your flight and your organization is heavily dependent on your attitude. If you’re saying something against leadership or policy, that tone will be the tone of your flight or your department. If you're upbeat, you're positive — that’s how your team will behave.”

She stressed that U.S. Air Force medical personnel need these vital skills both in battle and in their dedication of warfighter care. “Air Force medicine exists to project the lethality of the United States Air Force … we must be able to shoot, move, communicate — then medicate.”",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,0.0,2025-11-17 12:56:27.508202

When my primary care physician referred me to OB/GYN, the Naval Medical Center exercised right of first refusal. However, because I was hospitalized and needed immediate care and Tricare agreed to change my referral to a civilian OB/GYN who was able to see immediately following the hospital visit. The referral now lists my civilian OB/GYN and seems to be covering the entirety of the prenatal care including hospital delivery and postpartum care. It's open enrollment season, and I'm considering switching to Tricare Select to avoid any potential issues (for example, Tricare refusing to cover hospital expenses because the Naval Medical Center exercised right of first refusal). Tricare claims the current referral is valid, but the Naval Medical Center, upon contacting, claimed that they had the original referral and threatened that Tricare wouldn't cover costs of healthcare if I refused to seek it there. I love my current OB/GYN and don't want to switch my care to another doctor at the Naval facility. I would also prefer to not to switch to Tricare Select at this time because of the potential for extra cost in comparison to Tricare Prime.

Could you please advise what's the approximate difference in cost of hospital delivery (this seems to be the biggest difference) between Tricare Prime and Select? My civilian OB/GYN is affiliated with Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla, so I would be giving birth there. The cost of delivery at that facility ranges from $10,000 to $30,000, depending on type of delivery and related complications.

Also, if Tricare were to refuse to cover the costs of Healthcarebecause of failure to seek it at the Naval Medical Center, a valid argument against refusal would be need for the continuity of care, which is an exception to the right of first refusal rule?

There’s the hug at the airport, the flag-waving kids, the tearful reunion in front of a very tired TSA agent. It feels like the end of a feel-good movie; now cue the music and roll credits.

Related: 10 Things you only know if you’ve given birth on Tricare

Except it’s not the end. It’s barely the end of the First Act. Buckle up, buttercup, this blockbuster is showing in homes all around the US of A. Because after the hugs come the hiccups. And the reintegration phase? That’s less Hollywood rom-com and more the “Saw” franchise.

The Fantasy vs. The First Fight

You spent months dreaming of this reunion, planning and plotting, even. They’d walk through the door, and everything would click right back into place. There’d be candles, connection, maybe a celebratory charcuterie board with white wine. Instead, you get: “Why are the knives in a different drawer now, babe?”

Turns out, life kept going while they were gone. You developed systems, survived solo parenting, possibly became fluent in generational culture, or microwaveable meals. Meanwhile, they’ve been living in a world of routine, uniforms, and Meals Ready to Expire (MREs). And now the two of you are trying to merge realities like some Sci-Fi Channel docuseries.

Reintegration: The Remix

There’s a rhythm to solo life. You figure out how to do everything yourself, from bedtime routines to killing spiders with utter confidence (or at least screaming into that vacuum hose with a Viking warrior). Then, suddenly, your partner is back—and so is the negotiation. Who does bedtime now? Are we a “team” again, or do I still lead this household like a stressed-out cruise director? Why are they folding the towels like that? We never fold our towels like that!

Even the intimacy takes a minute. You thought it would be “Fifty Shades of Grey,” but it’s more like a “Band of Brothers” intro. Physically, yes, but emotionally? There’s a hesitancy. You want to pick up where you left off, or shoot for the stars, but there are unspoken miles between you that must be bridged.

Sleep, Sex, and the Silent Treatment

Let’s talk about that first night. You imagine spooning under cozy covers. Instead, you’re jolted awake at 3 a.m. by your partner yelling “Contact left!” in their sleep while flailing like they’re in a tactical burrito.

Time zones, muscle memory, and emotional armor don’t just melt away with a welcome-home cake. And let’s not even get started on the TV remote wars, fridge organization drama, or why the kids are doing push-ups in your living room… and now running laps around the house.

The Little Wins

But then, ever so slowly, there are moments, peaks of sunshine in the overcast clouds. You laugh at a shared joke from three deployments ago. You tag-team a chaotic school morning and high-five like you just won Olympic gold. You finally reconnect—physically and emotionally—and it feels… earned.

You learn each other again. Not who you were, but who you are now. And weirdly, that might be better.

The Long Game

Here’s the truth they don’t put in the reunion videos: reintegration isn’t a week-long vacation. It’s a process. A sometimes clumsy, always evolving, beautifully frustrating process. There might be counseling. There might be silence. There will definitely be a moment when one of you cries into a frozen pizza or dubious leftover Chinese food. But you’re not failing. You’re just adjusting. Together.

So be patient. Give grace. Keep the knives where they are, or move them, just make sure it’s a joint decision this time. Because this messy, beautiful part? It’s where the real story begins.

Algiers – November 2025 – In a stride toward deepening security cooperation, Algeria and the United Kingdom have formalized a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) aimed at bolstering bilateral collaboration in the field of advanced electronic fingerprint analysis. The agreement was signed by the Director General of National Security, Ali Badaoui, and the UK Minister of State for Borders and Asylum Security, Alex Norris, during an official working visit to London.

The signing ceremony, held in the presence of Algeria’s Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Noureddine Yazid, marks a new chapter in the long-standing partnership between the two countries, reinforcing their shared commitment to strengthening police cooperation in response to evolving global security challenges. Badaoui led a high-level delegation comprising senior cadres of the General Directorate of National Security, underscoring the strategic importance Algeria accords to international security partnerships.

The MoU is designed to enhance operational coordination and upgrade the technical skills of Algerian police officers and specialists in the field of electronic fingerprint analysis. It paves the way for advanced training, structured knowledge exchange, and the adoption of cutting-edge methodologies in identity verification and biometric technologies—domains that have become indispensable in confronting contemporary threats.

A core aspect of the agreement involves facilitating the transfer of expertise between both sides, particularly in the areas of digital forensics, identity authentication systems, and data-driven investigative tools. This aligns seamlessly with Algeria’s broader vision of modernizing its security apparatus and integrating advanced technologies to counter crime in all its evolving forms.

During the visit, Badaoui and his accompanying delegation toured the United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency (NCA) in London, where they gained first-hand insight into the British model of crime-fighting and digital investigation. Senior NCA officials provided detailed briefings on the agency’s digital systems, forensic platforms, and mechanisms for criminal data analysis and cross-border information exchange.

In return, Badaoui outlined Algeria’s operational strategy in combating crime—particularly transnational organized crime—highlighting the substantial progress made by the Algerian police in intelligence-based policing, territorial control, and international cooperation frameworks.

Algiers – November 2025 – Algeria has once again underscored its commitment to strengthening the operational readiness and medical resilience of its armed forces, as General of the Army Saïd Chanegriha, Minister-Delegate to the Minister of National Defence and Chief of Staff of the People’s National Army (ANP), supervised on Saturday the inauguration of major new military health infrastructures in the First Military Region. The event, held as part of the commemorations of the 71st anniversary of the outbreak of the glorious November Revolution, stands as a testament to the country’s strategy of coupling military development with advanced, state-of-the-art healthcare capabilities.

According to a communiqué from the Ministry of National Defence (MDN), the ceremony began at the Central Army Hospital in Ain Naadja with a formal reception attended by senior generals and high-ranking officials of the Ministry and the ANP Staff. There, General Chanegriha received an extensive briefing from the Central Director of Military Health Services on the newly completed projects, which form part of a comprehensive program aimed at enhancing the performance, efficiency, and medical quality of military healthcare institutions.

The Chief of Staff then oversaw the operational launch of two new specialized medical services at the Central Army Hospital, both newly equipped with cutting-edge technologies. He inspected the hyperbaric medicine unit, which now offers advanced oxygen-therapy treatments for hypertension and other conditions, as well as the nuclear medicine department, recently modernized with state-of-the-art PET-scan and PET-MRI facilities. These systems, based on high-precision molecular imaging, are designed to enable physicians to detect the precise nature, location, and evolution of diseases, significantly improving diagnostic accuracy.

The MDN clarified that these services were constructed in accordance with international medical standards and equipped with modern, high-performance technologies capable of delivering superior care and contributing to markedly improved patient management.

Later, in Blida, General Chanegriha inaugurated the new Regional Mixed Military University Hospital, a major health facility intended to serve both military personnel and civilians. After a detailed presentation by the hospital’s Director General concerning its structure, capacity, equipment, and highly qualified medical and administrative staff, the General toured its departments to assess the range and quality of the medical and surgical services it provides.

During a subsequent meeting with military health cadres—broadcast via videoconference to personnel across all six Military Regions—General Chanegriha delivered a powerful orientation address. He emphasized that the inauguration of these infrastructures was both a tribute to Algeria’s martyrs and an expression of the nation’s commitment to strengthening the institutional and operational foundations of its armed forces. He urged all personnel to draw inspiration from the sacrifice and dedication of the men and women who shaped Algeria’s glory, calling for work conducted with the highest levels of professionalism, rigor, and devotion.

Central to his message was the affirmation that these achievements reflect the High Command’s unwavering resolve to continuously adapt the military health system to the evolving requirements of the battle corps and to emerging health threats—whether operational, technological, or epidemiological. He highlighted that such progress is a direct result of the attention and guidance of the President of the Republic, Supreme Chief of the Armed Forces and Minister of National Defence.

General Chanegriha stressed that the development of specialized services and advanced medical infrastructure is accompanied by sustained investment in highly qualified human resources—general practitioners, specialists, surgeons, nurses, and technical staff—capable of managing sophisticated medical systems and ensuring top-tier healthcare for military personnel and their families.

The ceremony concluded with the signing of the Golden Books, symbolizing the strategic significance of these new achievements and Algeria’s vision of a modern, resilient, and fully integrated military health system aligned with the nation’s security and development priorities.

Algiers – November 2025 – In an affirmation of the Algerian state’s strategic orientation toward bolstering public services and expanding national energy infrastructure, the Minister of Energy and Renewable Energies, Mourad Adjal, delivered a forceful address at the opening of the First National Forum of Sector Managers on Saturday. His intervention underscored substantial achievements in the electrification and gasification of the country, reflecting what he described as “vast, meticulously executed programs” aimed at ensuring reliable, uninterrupted energy supply for all citizens.

Adjal announced that more than 2.4 million households have been newly connected to the national natural gas network—a figure that marks a considerable leap in the country’s energy development map. Parallel to this, 456,000 additional homes have been linked to the electricity grid. These efforts have propelled Algeria’s electricity coverage rate to an impressive 99 percent, representing over 12.5 million subscribers. Gas coverage has reached 72 percent, now serving more than 8.2 million subscribers nationwide.

Highlighting the sector’s commitment to supporting national food security and rural development, Adjal revealed that more than 100,432 agricultural farms have been connected to the natural gas network. This milestone, he stressed, is transformative for agricultural productivity, cost reduction, and improved living conditions within the farming community.

The minister further detailed advances in the energy transition, notably the completion of 1,000 electric vehicle charging stations across the national territory. This rollout represents a critical step in the shift toward cleaner mobility and aligns with global trends in sustainable transport.

In the realm of vital water infrastructure, Adjal announced that five seawater desalination plants have been connected ahead of schedule to the electricity grid—an achievement that enhances the reliability of the country’s drinking water supply. Studies are currently underway to ensure that three additional desalination plants will be connected in the coming months.

TRICARE approved oral appliances are changing the way veterans sleep — no masks, no hoses, no noise.

If you’ve been battling obstructive sleep apnea and struggling to stay comfortable with CPAP, there’s a better, simpler way to reclaim your nights.

At New England Sleep Health, we proudly provide VA-approved sleep apnea treatment through custom oral appliances — simple, comfortable devices designed to restore quiet, restorative sleep in a natural way.

Whether you’re seeking alternatives for moderate sleep apnea or exploring new methods for treating sleep apnea without machinery, our team is here to help you find the right fit.

We work hand-in-hand with both the VA and TRICARE to make the process seamless and stress-free.

From your home sleep study and sleep apnea diagnosis, to the final fitting of your personalized device, our dedicated care team guides you every step of the way — so you can breathe freely, sleep deeply, and wake refreshed.

Why Veterans Struggle With Sleep Apnea

Many veterans experience chronic snoring, exhaustion, and poor sleep quality due to sleep-disordered breathing. The most common sleep apnea symptoms include loud snoring, pauses in breathing during sleep, morning headaches, and persistent fatigue — signs that your body isn’t getting the oxygen it needs.

When the airway repeatedly collapses during the night, oxygen levels drop, forcing your body to wake up just enough to reopen the airway — sometimes hundreds of times per night.

This cycle prevents deep, restorative sleep and leads to:

Morning headaches and grogginess

Memory lapses and poor focus

Daytime fatigue and mood swings

High blood pressure and heart strain

According to a study of the National Library of Medicine, sleep apnea is among the most commonly diagnosed conditions in veterans, often linked to service-related stress, weight gain, and disrupted sleep patterns.

Oral appliance therapy (also known as dental appliance sleep apnea treatment) uses a custom oral device — similar to a mouthguard — that gently repositions your jaw and tongue to keep your airway open while you sleep.

This proven, non-invasive therapy is an excellent CPAP alternative, especially for veterans who find masks uncomfortable or travel frequently.

Our team provides complete sleep apnea support from testing to treatment — helping you move from restless nights to truly restful sleep.

Benefits include:

Comfortable and lightweight design

No mask, hose, or noise

Covered by TRICARE and VA Community Care

Fully customized for your unique jaw and bite

Easy to travel with and maintain

Clinical studies from the American Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine (AADSM) show that oral appliances are highly effective for mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea, with greater patient comfort and adherence than CPAP therapy.

I assumed that I would be under his insurance until he turned the divorce papers into DEERS, and only then would they stop paying for me.

Turns out I was wrong and they go by the date the divorce was finalized on the decree (Aug). But that doesn’t make sense to me because 1) he was paying for the health insurance, 2) I didn’t get my divorce papers with the date of divorce until a whole MONTH later, so I wouldn’t have known about it until then anyways. 3) they didn’t email me about it until he turned in his papers like October 14th.

Idk I just don’t get how they can do this to me, what do you mean I’m suddenly 6k+ in debt in one phone call?? I don’t know who I can talk to about this, it’s so confusing and the people who are there to help alone the way are miserable, rude, and most just genuinely don’t know much it seems.

What’s even more frustrating is now I’m out of date to get any kind of health insurance. I’m over time to apply for covered California, even the CHCBP thing they have I’m past the 60days. That seems like my only saving grace but I’d have to pay 3600 for 6mo AND pay whatever out of pocket price they have before they’ll help. So if that comes out to more than 8k then it’s just worth it for me beg for payment plans and move on with my life.

I’m just annoyed because I don’t feel I should be on the hook for this. I wish someone would have been there to say, “here are some next steps”.

Tivic Health® Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:TIVC), a diversified immunotherapeutics company, today announced financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and provided a business update.

""Following our discussions at the Military Health System Research Symposium and continued engagement with key government agencies, we are encouraged by the interest in our lead product candidate, Entolimod for acute radiation syndrome (ARS), as a military medical countermeasure and stockpile drug,"" stated Tivic CEO, Jennifer Ernst. ""This quarter, we continued the advancement towards commercial readiness. Starting the cGMP manufacturing process with successful cell line verification was a critical first step to establishing reproducibility and scalability in our drug manufacturing.""

Tivic also completed the transfer of two INDs to Tivic from Statera Biopharma. These two INDs allow Tivic to initiate clinical trials for the use of Entolimod in the treatment of neutropenia and cancer-related conditions.

""Subsequent to the quarter's end, we also reported the compelling findings from Tivic's VNS Optimization Trial. These findings uncovered new insights into vagus nerve stimulation and have led to additional patent filings intended to protect Tivic's prescription device development for commercialization and licensing,"" added Ernst.

About Entolimod

Entolimod is a novel Toll-like Receptor 5 (TLR5) agonist that triggers NF-kB signaling, activating antiapoptotic and cell protective mechanisms. Under the FDA's Animal Rule, Entolimod™ has been the subject of extensive trials for the treatment of acute radiation syndrome (ARS), and has demonstrated robust survival, enhanced GI tract recovery and improved hematopoiesis in animal models. Entolimod has been granted Fast Track Designation for ARS.

About Tivic Health Systems, Inc.

Tivic's dual platform utilizes the body's biopharmaceutical and bioelectronic systems to treat unmet medical needs through targeting the immune system.

Tivic's biologics compounds activate an innate immune pathway to prevent cell death in the bone marrow and epithelial tissues across systems impacted by radiation and age. The company's lead drug candidate, Entolimod™ for acute radiation syndrome, is a novel TLR5 agonist that has been granted Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations and is in late-stage development. In addition to Entolimod™ for ARS, Tivic's pipeline includes and Entolimod™ for the treatment of neutropenia, and lymphocyte exhaustion, and Tivic has the exclusive option to license additional indications, including Entolasta to treat immunosenescence, and chronic radiation syndrome.

Tivic's bioelectronic program has been developing a novel, non-invasive medical device designed to target the neural pathways implicated in many prevalent and debilitating diseases. Early trials show promising signals that Tivic's approach may regulate specific biologic responses, and the company believes its early-stage vagus nerve stimulation device has the potential to deliver clinical outcomes similar to or better than those of surgically implanted devices.

Now to the standard vs advantage. Advantage locks you into a certain network provider that is normally local and limited on who you can see.

Electrodiagnostic testing is an extremely valuable tool that provides vital information about the health of your nerves and muscles and is helpful in the evaluation of weakness, numbness, pain and symptoms such as fatigue, cramps, and abnormal sensation. This test is performed by a physician who has had special training to perform such a procedure.

On the day of your test

Bath or shower to remove excess body oils

Do not use any oils, lotions or creams as these can interfere with your test

Wear loose, comfortable clothing but be aware that you may have to change into a hospital gown

Be sure to inform the physician if you are taking blood thinning medication such as Coumadin, have hemophilia or a cardiac pacemaker

There are no meal or activity restrictions before or after the test

About the test

Nerve conduction studies: To perform this test the physician tapes small metal electrodes to the surface of your skin and applies an electrical pulse to one portion of the nerve being tested.

EMG (Electromyographic): A sterile fine “acupuncture-like” needle electrode is gently inserted into the muscle. Needle insertion may cause mild temporary discomfort. The needle is not used for injections and no shocks are given. The needle itself serves as a small microphone that allows the physician to detect if there may be abnormalities

The study takes approximately 60-90 minutes

After the test

You may return to your normal routine immediately

The results are sent directly to the referring physician

Failing a military drug test can feel like your world just shifted. Within minutes you could face disciplinary proceedings, a potential hit to your career, and stress on your mental health. But the good news is: you are not without options.

Keep reading as we break down all the details on what happens if you fail a military drug test.

In this article from the expert team at TriCareRehabs.com, you will learn what to expect, how the process works, what your rights and obligations are, and how to engage treatment: especially when your healthcare is covered by Defense Health Agency (DHA) via TRICARE.

Understanding the Military Drug Testing Program

The U.S. military has a zero-tolerance policy for unauthorized drug use, and tests for a wide array of substances, both licit and illicit. Service members are subject to random testing, pre-deployment tests, commander-directed tests, and tests following accidents or misconduct.

If a sample comes back positive for a prohibited substance (without a valid medical‐use waiver), the chain of command will typically initiate an investigation.

What are the Immediate Consequences of a Positive Test in the Armed Forces?

If you receive a failed test result, the immediate steps may include:

Mandatory notification to your command.

A temporary suspension from duties pending investigation.

Enrollment in a commander’s referral to a substance misuse evaluation program.

Potential initiation of administrative or non-judicial punishment (depending on branch, grade, and circumstance).

For some careers (e.g., pilots, special operators), you may face suspension of security clearances or duty restrictions.

It’s crucial to act quickly: to cooperate with the investigation and seek support, and to realize that failing a test isn’t automatically the end of your career. Many service members recover and resume duty.

What is the Role of the Substance Misuse Evaluation (SME) in the Military?

After a positive test, you will likely undergo a substance misuse evaluation by a qualified clinician. This assessment determines whether you have a substance use disorder, whether you require treatment, and what level of care you need (outpatient vs residential).

The evaluation outcome directly influences command decisions—such as whether you receive a referral to treatment rather than administrative separation.

Treatment Pathways: Detox, Residential Care, Outpatient

If your evaluator determines you need treatment, you may be referred to one of the following:

Detoxification (“detox”): If your use includes alcohol or drugs requiring medical supervision, you may enter a medically supervised detox to safely manage withdrawal symptoms.

Residential (inpatient) treatment: Inpatient rehab offers a structured 24/7 environment where you live at the facility for a period of days to weeks, receive therapy, medical monitoring, and address the root causes of substance use.

Outpatient treatment: You continue to live at home (or on base) but attend scheduled therapy, groups, medication management, and monitoring.

The referral may also point you to a “dual diagnosis” program if you have underlying mental health issues (PTSD, anxiety, depression) alongside substance use. Programs tailored to the military lifestyle are especially effective.

How TRICARE Coverage Works with Treatment After a Failed Test

If you’re enrolled in TRICARE (as an active‐duty service member, retiree, or dependent), your treatment options are partially or fully covered, provided the care is medically necessary and delivered by a TRICARE-approved facility.

For example:

TRICARE covers medically supervised detoxification services.

Residential and outpatient services for substance use disorders are often covered through TRICARE East, TRICARE West, or TRICARE For Life plans.

Whether you pay out-of-pocket depends on your plan (e.g., active duty vs retiree), in-network status, and whether prior authorization is obtained.

It’s wise to verify your benefits, confirm that the facility accepts TRICARE, and ensure a referral is generated, especially after a positive drug test, when time is of the essence.

What a Failed Drug Test in the Armed Forces Means for Your Career (and How Treatment Affects It)

Failing the drug test places you at a crossroads. The command may decide to retain you if you actively engage in treatment and show accountability. Entering a treatment program voluntarily (and proactively) can reflect positively in command decision-making. It shows responsibility and commitment to recovery.

Conversely, refusing evaluation, skipping treatment, or repeated positives can trigger administrative separation, loss of security clearance, or discharge. For dependents, failing a test may affect access to certain base privileges and can complicate benefits.

The core takeaway: treatment is not just about your health: it plays a strategic role in your career outcome. A strong clinical record, documented completion of a program, and good follow-through may mitigate career damage.

Navigating Privacy, Treatment Selection & Aftercare

As a service member or veteran, you may worry about the effect of treatment on your career or security clearance. Programs specifically designed for military and veteran populations understand these concerns. They offer confidentiality, peer support, and aftercare planning that helps you transition smoothly back to duty or civilian life.

After your residential or outpatient program, aftercare is essential. This can include sober-living, weekly therapy, group support, medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid or alcohol use disorders, and monitoring. The goal is not just to stop use, it’s to build a sustainable recovery that supports your duties, family, and future.

What are the Steps to Take After a Failed Test for Drugs in the Military

Stay calm and cooperate: The investigation is procedural: your response and attitude matter.

Ask for the evaluation: Request the substance misuse evaluation to clarify your treatment recommendation.

Verify your TRICARE benefits: Contact TriCareRehabs.com to confirm what level of care is covered, in-network providers, and authorization requirements.

Select an appropriate treatment facility: Preferably one experienced with military/dual-diagnosis issues and TRICARE.

Complete the program and engage aftercare: Demonstrating progress and stability will help your command decision-making.

Keep documentation: Records of evaluation, treatment progress, completion, aftercare enrolment—all of this may be relevant during retention or discharge proceedings.

Reach Out Proactively and Get Support for a Failed Military Drug Test Today

Failing a military drug test is serious, but it doesn’t have to end your mission or career. With the right mindset and proactive steps, you can leverage the resources available through TRICARE, get the support you need, and come out stronger on the other side.

Whether you’re undergoing detox, residential treatment, or outpatient care, the crucial response is one of action: begin treatment promptly, engage fully, and use the aftercare plan as your launchpad for sustained wellness.

If you’re a service member, veteran or family member facing this challenge, you are eligible for help, and the sooner you act, the better your health, career and future will be.

Please call us confidentially to learn more about your coverage and options, and protect your role and military career now.

FAQs Often Asked About Military Failed Drug Testing Results

Will I be automatically discharged following a failed military drug test?

Not always. If you engage in the evaluation and treatment process, many commands will support retention.

Will TRICARE cover long‐term rehab after failing a drug test?

Yes: so long as your care is medically necessary and approved. Coverage for residential stays or extended treatment varies by plan.

Does the type of substance matter for a failed drug test in the Armed Forces?

Yes. Some substances (illegal drugs or misused prescription medications) carry heavier administration consequences than others (e.g., alcohol policy violations). Each branch has its own policy.

Will my command or clearance find out about a positive drug screening?

Yes: the command is notified of the positive test. However, the focus is on your next steps and treatment rather than shame.

Can dependents (spouse or child) who fail a test access TRICARE-covered rehab?

Yes, dependents enrolled in TRICARE may also access coverage if medically necessary and approved by TRICARE. The process for them parallels the service member process.

My dad is on Medicare and tricare for life. We decided to keep him on traditional Medicare due to is diagnoses of Parkinson's, lewy body dementia, dementia, and a few other things. Tricare is the supplement that pays the 20% after Medicare. Tricare also has his meds (part d). Part D is a required suppliment when you hit 65. Doesnt matter if you dont have any ongoing scipts. If you dont have it there will be a penalty when you do get it. I have most of his scripts through express scripts mail order. There are a few off types that I get through a local pharmacy. The co pays are very reasonable.

I will say the biggest reason I won't entertain anything other than traditional Medicare is that extended stays in rehab up to 100 days is fully covered.

I would recommend reading the pub that is put out yearly regarding Medicare benefits. It answers so many questions and even those that you didnt even think of.",,N,0.0,2025-11-14 15:56:41.984634

Civilian employees can also make changes to their health plans, health care FSAs, and limited expense health care FSAs.
However, civilian employees are encouraged to carefully review their health plan elections.
Limited expense health care FSAs are available only to employees enrolled in high-deductible health plans with health savings accounts.
The Office of Personnel Management offers tools to compare plan benefits and out-of-pocket costs for both health plans, and dental and vision plans.","The annual Open Season for federal benefits is scheduled from Nov. 10 to Dec. 8, allowing both civilian and military personnel to make adjustments to their benefit elections.

During this period, military members and civilian employees can modify their dependent care flexible spending accounts and dental and vision insurance plans. Civilian employees can also make changes to their health plans, health care FSAs, and limited expense health care FSAs. Outside of a qualifying life event, this is the only time to enroll, change or cancel enrollment in these programs.

Because military members are typically enrolled in TRICARE, no health-related changes are necessary for them. However, civilian employees are encouraged to carefully review their health plan elections. Many plans will see benefit and rate changes for the upcoming year. Some plans may be discontinued or alter their service areas or coverage options. Employees should carefully review their coverage to determine the best plan and premium for their individual circumstances for the upcoming year. Health benefits elections will be effective Jan. 11, 2026.

Open Season also provides an opportunity for both military and civilian personnel to review dental and vision insurance coverage, which can supplement health insurance and lower out-of-pocket costs for these types of care. Enrollment can be cancelled during this time as well. Dental and vision insurance elections will be effective Jan. 1, 2026.

A dependent care FSA allows individuals to use pre-tax dollars to pay for eligible dependent care services, such as preschool, summer day camp, before- or after-school programs, and child or adult daycare. Contributions are not subject to payroll taxes, which reduces overall taxes. The maximum annual contribution is $3,750 for those who are married and file a separate tax return and $7,500 for those who are married and file a joint tax return, or file as single or head of household. If both spouses participate, the combined maximum contribution is $7,500. Dependent care FSA elections will be effective Jan. 1, 2026.

A health care FSA is also a pre-tax benefit account used to pay for eligible medical, dental, and vision care expenses not covered by elected plans. Contributions are not subject to payroll taxes. The maximum annual contribution is $3,400, with the option to carry over up to $680 remaining in the account from one plan year to the next. Health care FSA elections will be effective Jan. 1, 2026.

Limited expense health care FSAs are available only to employees enrolled in high-deductible health plans with health savings accounts. Allotments may be used for eligible dental and vision expenses. The maximum amount an employee can set aside in any tax year is $3,400. Limited expense health care FSA elections will be effective Jan. 1, 2026.

While Thrift Savings Plan contributions can be adjusted at any time, upcoming changes to contribution limits for 2026 should be noted. The standard IRS contribution limit for the TSP will increase to $24,500, a $1,000 rise from 2025. The catch-up contribution limit for those age 50 and over will also increase to $8,000, up from $7,500. A special catch-up contribution for participants aged 60-63 will remain unchanged at $11,250. TSP contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, reducing taxable income.

Camp Johnson marks the final phase of the endeavor.
“The Camp Johnson Branch Health Clinic is more than just a new building; it’s a targeted investment in the operational strength of the support forces that keep the Marine Corps moving,” said Lt. Cmdr.
“This team has become a part of the cherished Camp Johnson community as a whole.
In addition to the Camp Johnson Branch Health Clinic are several other MCHM establishments and upgrades to include MCMH clinics at Hadnot Point, Wallace Creek, New River, French Creek, and the Camp Geiger SMART Clinic/School of Infantry East Human Performance Center which opened in July.","JACKSONVILLE, N.C. – The new Camp Johnson Branch Health Clinic is open to care for Marines and Sailors stationed at Camp Johnson. The clinic serves approximately 12,000-15,000 service members who rotate through training platforms at Camp Johnson including Marine Corps Combat Service Support Schools (MCCSSS), Field Medical Training Battalion-East (FMTB-East), and the Staff Non-Commissioned Officers Academy.

The clinic offers a range of services from primary care to physical therapy. For staff, the commissioning of the new clinic has been highly anticipated after years of operating out of temporary trailers.

“Unfortunately, the previous clinic was damaged beyond repair by Hurricane Florence in 2018,” said Cmdr. Courtney Powell, director of branch clinics for Naval Medical Center Camp Lejeune (NMCCL). “While the trailers served their function, staff and beneficiaries had limited space, older equipment and reduced services. The new clinic is a state-of-the-art facility with enough space to accommodate dental, medical, and Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation Team (SMART) under one roof, which improves access and availability for Marines and Sailors.”

The 22,321 square-feet clinic is part of a broader project to establish new spaces for medical and dental care and upgrade existing facilities to meet modern expectations. For more than 10 years, the Defense Health Agency has collaborated with the Navy and Marine Corps on the Marine Centered Medical Home (MCMH) venture to replace ageing infrastructure with a modernized care environment in direct support of force readiness and operational training requirements. Camp Johnson marks the final phase of the endeavor.

“The Camp Johnson Branch Health Clinic is more than just a new building; it’s a targeted investment in the operational strength of the support forces that keep the Marine Corps moving,” said Lt. Cmdr. Matthew Miles, health facilities planning and project officer for DHA. “With thousands of Marines and Sailors cycling through MCCSSS and FMTB-East each year, having a modern, co-located care facility improves our ability to keep them healthy, training, and ready.”

The clinic began officially seeing patients on Sept. 10, 2025. Staff commemorated the opening with a ribbon cutting on Oct. 22.

While only open for a few weeks, the impact and contribution to the mission of Camp Johnson’s training pipelines is apparent to base leadership. MCCSSS Commanding Officer Col. Scott Benninghoff provided guest speaker remarks.

“This building only becomes a capability with you add well-trained, dedicated professional providers and corpsmen to it,” said Benninghoff. “This team has become a part of the cherished Camp Johnson community as a whole. You have created an environment of commitment and support, and we can’t thank you enough.""

Substance use changes the brain over time, but compassionate, structured treatment can support real recovery. TRICARE generally covers care when it is deemed necessary and provided by authorized providers, and many people qualify for more services than they realize. You can start by confirming benefits, documenting symptoms, and discussing the safest level of care with a clinician.

What Types of Addiction Treatment Are Covered by TRICARE?

TRICARE typically covers a full continuum of addiction care when it is medically necessary and delivered by an authorized provider. That means services can include medical detox, residential treatment, intensive outpatient care, standard outpatient therapy, and medication-assisted treatment.

Coverage also extends to co-occurring mental health services, which are common for people with substance use disorder. This breadth of benefits helps you match treatment intensity to your current symptoms and safety needs.

To utilize these benefits, start by conducting an assessment to determine the most suitable level of care. Ask about authorization requirements, provider network status, and expected out-of-pocket costs before admission. Clarify whether you require a referral and confirm that the facility sends the required clinical updates to maintain active coverage. Building this plan early helps your recovery start smoothly and stay on track.

Recent national findings suggest that about half of people with substance use disorder also live with a mental health condition, highlighting why integrated care matters. Commonly covered services include the following options that many people use at different stages:

Medical detox with 24/7 monitoring

Residential or inpatient rehab

Intensive outpatient programs

Medication-assisted treatment (MAT)

Individual and family therapy

As you compare programs, look for authorized facilities and request written details about TRICARE insurance for addiction rehab so you can plan confidently.

How Long Will TRICARE Cover Inpatient Rehab?

Inpatient authorization depends on medical necessity, which considers the risk of acute withdrawal, safety, and functional impairment. TRICARE may approve an initial stay and then extend coverage when clinical updates show that inpatient care remains essential.

Your length of stay is personalized; some people stabilize quickly, while others require more time before being discharged. Discharge planning often includes a transition to intensive outpatient care to maintain gains.

Focus on what keeps you safe and progressing, not a fixed number. Your care team submits notes, vitals, and progress measures to justify continued days when needed. Research indicates that treatment engagement for at least 90 days across all levels of care is associated with improved outcomes. That time can include inpatient, outpatient, and recovery support, all of which add up to sustained change.

TRICARE rehab coverage supports inpatient care when it is the safest and most effective setting for you. If alcohol is a primary concern, this overview of insurance for alcohol rehab can help you anticipate approvals and costs. Document withdrawal symptoms, cravings, medical issues, and any safety risks to strengthen authorizations. As your condition stabilizes, discuss a step-down plan that protects your progress at a lower cost.

Does TRICARE Pay for Detox or Dual Diagnosis Treatment?

Yes. TRICARE typically covers medically supervised detox when withdrawal could be dangerous or severely uncomfortable. It also covers treatment for co-occurring conditions such as PTSD, depression, and anxiety when they are addressed alongside substance use disorder. Integrated care is essential because symptoms often interact with one another, and recovery is more effective when both are addressed simultaneously.

Your plan may require preauthorization for detox or residential care, especially if significant medical issues are present. Ask which detox setting is appropriate: inpatient hospital-based detox, residential detox, or outpatient withdrawal management.

For ongoing stabilization, medication-assisted treatment with buprenorphine, methadone, or naltrexone is often covered. Studies show these medications cut the risk of death roughly in half for opioid use disorder, reinforcing their role in care.

To understand coverage, ask your provider to outline the dual diagnosis plan and how progress will be measured. Common covered elements in integrated care include the following supports:

Psychiatric evaluation and medication management

Evidence-based therapies like CBT and EMDR

MAT for opioids or alcohol

Family education and relapse prevention

What Our Customers Are Saying

How Do You Verify TRICARE Rehab Benefits?

Verification starts with a call to TRICARE or a benefits check through an authorized provider. Have your member ID, plan type, and a summary of symptoms ready. Ask about deductibles, copays, preauthorization rules, and any limits for each level of care. Think of coverage like a map: it shows the routes, and you choose the pace.

Next, confirm that the provider is in-network and request a written estimate for the first phase of care. If you require rapid admission, request urgent preauthorization to avoid delays. A recent national survey found that roughly one-third of adults cite cost as a top barrier to starting treatment; therefore, clarifying benefits early can reduce stress. If you feel overwhelmed, ask the admissions team to guide you through each step.

For military families, trauma-informed support and community connection can be decisive for long-term healing. Explore veterans addiction rehab in Los Angeles to see how specialized care aligns with TRICARE approvals. Tricare rehab coverage can be verified in minutes, helping you move from questions to an actionable plan. Keep notes from each call so you can advocate for yourself at every stage.

Frequently Asked Questions About TRICARE Rehab Benefits for Addiction Care

Here are straightforward answers to common questions about eligibility, costs, timelines, and choosing authorized providers:

Do I need a referral before starting rehab?

Some TRICARE plans require a referral or preauthorization, especially for inpatient levels. Call your plan or ask admissions to verify this step before scheduling.

What will I pay out of pocket?

Costs depend on your TRICARE plan, deductibles, and network status. Ask for a written estimate covering detox, rehab, medications, and follow-up care.

Can I choose outpatient instead of inpatient?

Yes, if outpatient is clinically safe and appropriate for your symptoms. A clinical assessment determines the least restrictive, effective level of care.

Are medications for cravings and withdrawal covered?

TRICARE often covers FDA-approved medications for opioid and alcohol use disorders. Coverage usually requires a prescriber and ongoing monitoring.

Will treatment address PTSD, anxiety, or depression too?

Yes, integrated care for co-occurring conditions is commonly covered. Ask your provider to coordinate therapy and medication management together.

How fast can benefits be approved?

Admissions teams can often verify benefits the same day. Urgent cases may receive expedited preauthorization when safety is a concern.

As Breitbart News reported, the Pentagon has reported that 4,240 troops have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, the term the military is using to signify being transgender.
However, a majority of the justices allowed it to remain in place while the legal challenges proceeded in the lower courts.
The Pentagon did not respond to the Air Force lawsuit but has a longstanding policy of not commenting on ongoing litigation, AP reported.","Seventeen transgender members of the Air Force who were discharged under the Trump administration’s transgender ban filed a lawsuit this week against the federal government for allegedly revoking their pensions and other benefits after their forced early retirement.

The lawsuit, dated November 10, involves members who served between 15 and 18 years in the Air Force, and asks for benefits they claim had been previously offered to them — but then were then told in August that decision had been reversed.

Glad Law, one of the advocacy groups that helped bring the lawsuit, writes:

These service members will loose [sic] $1–2 million in lifetime benefits, jeopardizing their families’ economic security. The action also strips the Airmen and their families of access to TRICARE, the military health insurance program, which would have provided access to civilian health care providers beyond VA facilities.

Michael Haley, a staff attorney with the group, told the Associated Press that the revocation of the early retirement benefits was part of “the general cruelty in attacking transgender people.”

“These are folks who are going to move on with their lives, have received the OK to do so, and then have that taken away from them once again,” Haley added.

Logan Ireland, a master sergeant in the Air Force with 15 years of service that includes a deployment to Afghanistan, told AP that he became a plaintiff in the suit after having his early retirement denied.

“The military taught me to lead and fight, not retreat,” he said. “Stripping away my retirement sends the message that those values only apply on the battlefield, not when a service member needs them most.”

The lawsuit is one of several legal challenges to the Trump administration’s policies that have sought to remove transgender troops from the military and ban transgender individuals from enlisting in an effort to make the military more lethal.

As Breitbart News reported, the Pentagon has reported that 4,240 troops have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, the term the military is using to signify being transgender.

In May, plaintiffs seeking immediate relief from the ban petitioned the Supreme Court. However, a majority of the justices allowed it to remain in place while the legal challenges proceeded in the lower courts.
