Tricare is a common health insurance in Utah, and individuals who have Tricare may wish to find sex therapists who are in-network with their health insurance.

When you see a sex therapist who is in-network with Tricare, each session you’ll pay only a copay, which typically ranges from $0-$75/session. Depending on your plan, you may first need to pay the provider’s full session fee until you meet your annual deductible, which is the total amount of medical expenses required before your health insurance starts to cover costs. Some plans cover the cost of in-network therapy sessions before the deductible is met; to verify whether your specific plan covers therapy sessions and at what rate, visit the Tricare website or call the number on the back of your insurance card and ask about your coverage for outpatient mental health.

Best decision of my 38 year career. 10 months of full pay and benefits along with 2 years of annual leave payout leading into 12/31 retirement. Package very common in private sector but we have never seen that kind of offer in government and probably never will again. Best wishes and best of luck.

Navigating career advancement in federal jobs can be a complex and often frustrating process, but it also offers unique benefits like job security and meaningful work. Here's a succinct guide based on the experiences and advice shared by redditors:

Navigating the Hiring Process

Steps to Getting a Federal Job: The federal hiring process can be lengthy and intricate. Here are the nine steps as outlined by a redditor:

Apply.

Get referred to the hiring manager.

Get interviewed.

Get a Tentative Offer Letter.

Accept Tentative Offer.

Start a BI (background investigation).

Get Final Offer.

Get start date (EOD).

Walk through the door and take the Oath of Office. ""There are about nine steps to getting the job... The first major hurdle is to get referred to the hiring manager.""

Importance of Being ""Best Qualified"": To increase your chances, you need to be in the ""Best Qualified"" group, which is where hiring managers select candidates for interviews. ""You need to be in the Best Qualified group. That's the group that the hiring manager will choose from for interviews.""

Veterans and Other Preferences: Veterans, military spouses, and individuals with certain disabilities (Schedule A) receive hiring preferences. ""Veterans Preference: Say a disabled Veteran comes in at 90 due to how the HR specialist ranks the disabled Veteran’s resume and questionnaire, if there is one. The disabled Veteran gets a 10-point preference."" ""Schedule A is NOT a preference. It’s just a non-competitive hiring option.""

Resume Tips: Keep your resume concise and tailored to the job posting. ""As someone in HR Recruitment and Placement in the federal government, I can absolutely assure you that 2 pages of a resume is more than enough, and 8 pages is absurd."" ""I simplified my resume down to one page per my boyfriends advice and plugged it into the template. That’s when I started getting more referrals and have had two interviews since doing so.""

Challenges: The process can be slow and competitive. ""The interview process is horrifyingly slow and in my experience offers/interviews are communicated after i have already accepted another role."" ""We are getting 1500 applications for 1 position jobs that we would previously have gotten less than 150 for.""

Career Advancement Opportunities

Specific Roles: Consider roles like Legislative Aide, Foreign Service Officer, or Presidential Management Fellow (PMF). ""If you're younger or have less experience, becoming a Legislative aide or a foreign service officer are great for your career."" ""There are examples of people who use an MPA to career change, and for them something like the presidential management fellowship or consulting is great.""

Internships and Pathway Programs: These can be a good entry point into federal service. ""State/Federal Government: Internships/Pathway Programs""

Data Analysis and Consulting: If you have strong quantitative skills, data analysis jobs are an option. Consulting for federal clients can also be lucrative. ""If you go to a Quant heavy school and you like numbers you can easily land data analysis jobs.""

Pros and Cons of Federal Employment

Pros:

Job Security and Benefits: Federal jobs often come with good benefits and pensions. ""Public sector pays less upfront, but you trade burnout and instability for long-term security, union protection, and a pension.""

Meaningful Work: Many find federal jobs rewarding due to their impact. [""It's meaningful, impactful work that they (hopefully) really enjoy and wouldn't be able to do without the degree.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicPolicy/comments/1d1anwn/comment/l",,N,0.0,2025-11-24 01:56:28.306084

About 6% of the War Department’s unresolved recommendations are classified as priority, while 12% of the VA’s are.","(The Center Square) – Of the 15 federal executive departments that compose the president’s Cabinet, the Departments of War and Veterans Affairs have the most unresolved, open recommendations for improvement from congressional watchdog, the Government Accountability Office.

The Department of War, which is overwhelmingly the largest executive branch department with about 3 million military and civilian personnel, has the most by far, with 778 open recommendations stretching back to 2011. Forty-eight of those were marked as priority. The Department of Veterans Affairs is the second-largest executive department, with more than 450,000 employees, and it has the second-highest, with 180 unresolved recommendations going back to 2012 and 22 flagged as priority.

The Government Accountability Office was established by Congress in 1921 as an independent, non-partisan congressional watchdog agency founded to “investigate all matters related to the use of public funds.” It provides reports to congressional committees and subcommittees on various government departments, agencies and projects to inform legislation and oversight.

Those reports typically include a list of recommendations for how the report’s subject can be improved. The recommendations are divided into priority action items and non-priority action items based on what is most pressing or important.

The War Department has some unresolved open priority recommendations from the office dating back to 2013 on topics like the poor living conditions in military barracks, improper TRICARE payments, fraud risk management and sustainment of the F-35 fighter jet program. Of all of the department’s open priority recommendations, it has partially addressed 15.

Many of the VA’s open priority recommendations are related to the department’s attempts to replace its legacy health records system. It rolled out a new electronic health records system starting with five medical centers in 2023 and was “making incremental improvements” to the new system as of March 2025, according to GAO, but there was still a lot to be done. There are approximately 170 VA Medical Centers.

The VA’s oldest unresolved priority recommendation concerns its “incomplete” sexual harassment policies and dates back to a 2020 report. The department has resolved all priority recommendations through 2019, according to GAO records, meaning the 22 that are open only date back to 2020. Of those, the VA has partially addressed five.

Some departments have open recommendations dating back to the early 2000s.

,,2025-11-22 14:10:06+00:00,Insurance News | InsuranceNewsNet,'Ghost networks' leave Arizona families searching for behavioral health care,Not Available,,,,,https://insurancenewsnet.com/oarticle/ghost-networks-leave-arizona-families-searching-for-behavioral-health-care-3,"Joseph's mother, Seetha DeMarco, said they never struggled to find mental health providers under TRICARE.
""There was a large list, the carrier was very easy to work with,"" said DeMarco, a mother of three and a behavioral health professional.
Arizona is not new to the managed care model, which means the state does not directly provide or administer most care.
In the Medicare Advantage plans, 55% of listed behavioral health providers were inactive; in Medicaid managed care plans, 28% were inactive.
HHS-OIG surveyed providers to understand why they stop participating in Medicaid managed care and Medicare Advantage networks.","PHOENIX -- Joseph DeMarco was about to turn 19 when he first showed the signs of a severe mental health condition.

By then, his family had already switched insurance plans from TRICARE, a health plan for military personnel, retirees and their families, to Mercy Care, a large nonprofit insurer that contracts with AHCCCS, Arizona's Medicaid program.

Joseph's mother, Seetha DeMarco, said they never struggled to find mental health providers under TRICARE.

""There was a large list, the carrier was very easy to work with,"" said DeMarco, a mother of three and a behavioral health professional. ""I didn't contact a provider that was no longer enrolled with TRICARE.""

Things changed after the switch, she said.

""Each and every time I've contacted Mercy Care to identify a provider in the network, they direct you to a website with a list,"" she said. ""It would take days to go through that list and find a provider that is active and enrolled with Mercy.""

She said they didn't find a competent provider until 2025, nearly 10 years later.

The impact extends beyond inconvenience: without timely care, people with serious mental illness often experience worsening symptoms, instability or repeated crises.

DeMarco's experience reflects what federal investigators have identified as ""ghost networks.""

A ""ghost network is really a directory of providers that's just largely unreachable, out of network or doesn't accept new patients,"" said Meridith Seife, deputy regional inspector general and a co-author of the recent report from the Office of Inspector General (OIG) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Companies that operate private Medicare Advantage and Medicaid managed care plans have inflated and inaccurate lists of psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers and other mental health providers they say are available to subscribers, the report found.

That runs counter to federal rules requiring plans to keep their directories current. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services mandates updates every quarter or within 30 days when a provider's status changes.

Arizona is not new to the managed care model, which means the state does not directly provide or administer most care. The state pioneered Medicaid managed care by creating AHCCCS, the first mandatory statewide program, funded mainly by the federal government, with the remaining quarter covered by the state.

The program's proposed budget for fiscal 2025 is approximately $22.3 billion. Private insurers that contract with AHCCCS to deliver most of the physical and behavioral health services to eligible Arizonans are paid monthly per-member capitation payments from those public funds.

""There was a significant percentage of providers that were inactive, meaning they had not provided a single service throughout an entire year,"" Seife said. ""Almost three-quarters of them should not have been listed in those network directories.""

HHS-OIG reviewed plans across 10 counties in five states, sampling one urban and one rural county in each, targeting ""geographically representative samples around the country."" Urban Maricopa and rural Santa Cruz counties in Arizona were included in the report. In the Medicare Advantage plans, 55% of listed behavioral health providers were inactive; in Medicaid managed care plans, 28% were inactive.

HHS-OIG surveyed providers to understand why they stop participating in Medicaid managed care and Medicare Advantage networks. Many described the administrative workload as overwhelming.

""Keeping up with them (administrative requirements) is nearly impossible and clinical staff feel like they are just cogs in a wheel versus clinicians,"" Seife said.

Other providers cited reimbursement rates that do not cover the cost of care, making continued participation financially unsustainable.

To address these issues, HHS-OIG recommends steps to reduce the administrative requirements and create a centralized, nationwide directory that would be a ""single place that providers could list all the insurance plans they participate in, their correct addresses,"" Seife said.

In a written statement to Cronkite News, AHCCCS acknowledged the challenges and outlined ongoing efforts, stating the agency recognizes ""that timely access to behavioral health services is critical to the well-being of our members, and we share the OIG's commitment to improving transparency and accountability in provider networks.""

The AHCCCS statement highlighted ongoing efforts to improve care access, including increased monitoring of network adequacy, reducing administrative hurdles for providers, investing in behavioral health workforce development and exploring improvements to public-facing provider search tools.

The state agency noted that rural and tribal communities remain the most impacted by provider shortages.

Cronkite News reached out to a number of private insurance companies operating in Arizona; however, none had responded by the time of publication.

Seetha DeMarco said improvement must move beyond policy announcements.",https://insurancenewsnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/inn-social-default.jpg,N,0.0,2025-11-22 12:56:33.824779

Frequently Asked Questions Does Tricare cover all weight loss medications?","Key Takeaways

Zepbound is an FDA-approved medication for chronic weight management and obesity-related obstructive sleep apnea.

Tricare coverage for Zepbound depends on specific plan details and medical necessity criteria.

Patients often need prior authorization and must meet clinical guidelines to qualify for coverage.

Combining Zepbound with lifestyle changes enhances treatment effectiveness.

Doctronic.ai offers convenient telehealth services that can help patients navigate treatment options and prescriptions.

Zepbound, a breakthrough in pharmacotherapy, works by targeting specific pathways in the brain that regulate appetite and metabolism, making it a vital tool for those struggling with obesity. The medication not only aids in weight loss but also plays a crucial role in improving overall health outcomes, particularly for individuals suffering from obesity-related conditions such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Clinical trials have shown that patients using Zepbound alongside a structured diet and exercise program can achieve significant weight loss, which in turn can lead to reductions in the severity of sleep apnea symptoms, enhancing sleep quality and overall well-being.

Understanding the nuances of insurance coverage can be daunting for patients considering Zepbound. Each Tricare plan has its own set of criteria for medication approval, which often includes documentation of previous weight loss attempts and current health assessments. This process can be streamlined with the help of healthcare providers who are familiar with the necessary paperwork and guidelines. Telehealth services like those provided by Doctronic.ai are particularly beneficial in this context, as they allow patients to consult with healthcare professionals from the comfort of their homes, ensuring they receive timely advice and support as they navigate the complexities of treatment options and insurance requirements.

Understanding Zepbound and Its Medical Uses

What Is Zepbound?

Zepbound, known generically as tirzepatide, is a once-weekly injectable medication approved by the FDA to help adults manage chronic weight issues. It targets two hormone pathways, GIP and GLP-1, which regulate appetite, digestion, and insulin release. By reducing hunger and slowing stomach emptying, Zepbound supports significant weight loss over time. This dual-action approach not only enhances the body’s ability to manage glucose levels but also promotes a feeling of fullness, making it easier for individuals to adhere to dietary changes. Clinical trials have demonstrated that patients using Zepbound can achieve substantial weight loss compared to those on a placebo, highlighting its potential as a transformative option for weight management.

How Zepbound Helps with Obstructive Sleep Apnea

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is often worsened by excess weight, which can cause fat deposits around the airway, leading to airway collapse during sleep. Zepbound does not act directly on sleep centers but helps improve OSA by reducing weight, thereby decreasing airway obstruction. Patients with obesity-related OSA may see meaningful improvements in their symptoms with sustained weight loss on Zepbound. As weight loss progresses, many patients report enhanced sleep quality, increased energy levels, and improved overall health, which can contribute to better daytime functioning. The relationship between weight management and sleep apnea underscores the importance of a comprehensive approach to treating OSA, where lifestyle changes and medical interventions work in tandem to achieve optimal results.

Important Considerations and Side Effects

While Zepbound offers promising benefits, it is not suitable for everyone. People with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 should avoid this medication. Common side effects include nausea, appetite changes, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort. Consistent dosing and follow-up with healthcare providers are essential for safety and effectiveness. Patients should be aware that while some side effects may diminish over time, others may require medical attention. It is crucial for patients to maintain open communication with their healthcare team to monitor their progress and adjust treatment plans as necessary. Lifestyle modifications, such as incorporating regular physical activity and a balanced diet, can enhance the efficacy of Zepbound and contribute to long-term weight management success.

Does Tricare Cover Zepbound?

Tricare Overview

Tricare is the health insurance program serving military members, retirees, and their families. It offers various plans with different coverage rules depending on the beneficiary’s status and location. Understanding whether Tricare covers a specific medication like Zepbound requires looking at plan details and medical necessity requirements.

Coverage Criteria for Weight Management Medications

Tricare generally covers medications for chronic conditions if they are FDA-approved and medically necessary. For weight management drugs, coverage often hinges on documented obesity or related health issues, such as type 2 diabetes or obstructive sleep apnea. Patients must typically demonstrate previous attempts at lifestyle modification before coverage is approved.

Is Zepbound Included?

As a newer medication, Zepbound’s inclusion on Tricare’s formulary may vary. Some Tricare plans might cover it under specialty drugs or weight management categories, but prior authorization is almost always required. This process involves submitting medical records and evidence that the patient meets clinical guidelines for use.

Steps to Confirm Coverage

Check your specific Tricare plan formulary online or contact Tricare customer service.

Consult your healthcare provider to determine if Zepbound is appropriate for your condition.

Ask your provider to submit a prior authorization request if needed.

Consider alternative medications if Zepbound is not covered or if authorization is denied.

Maximizing the Benefits of Zepbound

Combining Medication with Lifestyle Changes

While Zepbound can significantly aid weight loss, it works best when paired with healthy eating, regular exercise, and behavioral changes. Patients should view the medication as one component of a comprehensive weight management plan rather than a standalone solution.

Monitoring and Follow-Up

Regular medical follow-up is crucial to track progress, manage side effects, and adjust treatment as needed. Telehealth services like Doctronic.ai make it easier to maintain consistent communication with healthcare providers, ensuring ongoing support throughout your weight loss journey.

Setting Realistic Expectations

Weight loss with Zepbound is gradual and requires patience. Most patients experience meaningful improvements in metabolic health and OSA severity over months of treatment. Staying committed to the prescribed regimen and lifestyle changes is key to long-term success.

Tricare and Zepbound

Tricare coverage for Zepbound is possible, but it depends on your specific plan and meeting medical necessity criteria. Prior authorization and documentation are usually required. Patients interested in this medication should work closely with their healthcare providers to explore options and ensure proper use.

Telehealth platforms like Doctronic.ai offer an accessible way to get expert medical advice, prescriptions, and ongoing care for weight management and related conditions. Leveraging these services can simplify navigating insurance coverage and treatment decisions.

Buyers in the U.S. who rushed to secure incentives in September left a gap that quickly showed up in October sales. New EV sales fell to an estimated 74,835 units, down 48.9 per cent from September and 30.3 per cent year over year. EV market share slid to 5.8 per cent from September’s 11.6 per cent.

Declines were widespread: luxury EVs fell 39 per cent and non-luxury dropped 65 per cent. Tesla led with 40,650 units sold, down 35.3 per cent month over month, but still gained share to reach 54.3 per cent as competitors posted deeper losses. Rivian recorded the smallest decline among major brands at 14.7 per cent.

Used EV sales reached 31,610 units, down 20.4 per cent from September but still 36.2 per cent higher than a year earlier. Market share slipped to 1.9 per cent. Tesla again led the segment with 11,927 units.

Inventory levels rose as demand cooled. New EV days’ supply climbed to 79, up sharply from September’s 48-day low. GMC posted the highest supply at 91 days, while Subaru remained lean at eight days. Used EV days’ supply increased to 39, though still below ICE levels.

Prices continued to rise. The average new EV transaction price reached $59,125, up 1.6 per cent month over month. Used EV listing prices surged 8.6 per cent to $37,538, widening the gap with ICE models.

The province’s year-to-date total now sits 0.5 per cent below the same period last year, marking a shift for a market that typically anchors national performance.

The decline comes as last year’s rush to capture outsized EV incentives continues to distort year-over-year comparisons. That late-2024 surge also contributed to the province’s muted results through the first three quarters of 2025.

Quebec wasn’t alone. Dealers in the Atlantic provinces recorded single-digit declines across the board after outperforming the market for much of the year. Alberta and Manitoba also saw sales fall in October, contributing to a patchwork of provincial results. Andrew King, managing partner at DAC, said sales volatility remains a defining feature of the current landscape.

“Provincial level sales performances can vary significantly depending on market conditions, but the segment level is where the market is most vulnerable to changing market dynamics and where market disruptions can be felt most keenly,” he said in a statement. “Compact car sales, as one example, saw a significant drop in October despite seeing strong growth throughout much of the year.”

King added that while the market is in a turbulent period, shaped by shifting ZEV policies, trade uncertainty, economic softness, pricing pressures and surprising employment growth — October’s overall showing was still respectable. “October itself was actually a solid sales month, just one that ran up against a difficult comparable.”

Nationally, 159,000 new light vehicles were sold in October, down 1.8 per cent from the 162,000 units posted a year earlier.
