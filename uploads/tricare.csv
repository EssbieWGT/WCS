The counties affected are Maricopa and Gila.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

###

The Defense Health Agency provides health services to 9.5 million beneficiaries, including uniformed service members, military retirees, and their families. The DHA operates one of the nation’s largest health plans, the TRICARE Health Plan, and manages a global network of more than 700 military hospitals, clinics, and dental facilities.

Nila Devanath, a Hampton Roads hospital physician, said she is running to address the high cost of living and to fix the ""broken"" health care system.

""In our hospitals, I see every day what happens when Washington fails to act. Families wait months for care. Veterans are forced to split their pills in half. Patients with diabetes lose their lives avoiding treatment for something as simple as a small cut because they’re afraid of the medical bills that will follow,” Devanath said in her announcement. “Rep. Jen Kiggans and I both swore to care for our patients, but in Washington she’s turned her back on that promise. As a doctor, I can’t stand by while families suffer. I’m running for Congress to fix this broken system for my patients, for our veterans, and for every family who deserves better.”

Devanath grew up in the Hampton Roads region as the daughter of immigrants from Bangladesh. She said her mother worked for the Navy as a TRICARE primary care doctor.

She received her MD from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, but in the middle of it, she took a leave of absence to earn a JD degree from Harvard. After finishing her MD, she completed her residency at Yale New Haven Hospital.

She also said, before she herself became a doctor, that she practiced law and defended survivors of domestic violence while working at a legal aid clinic. She is currently an acute care doctor with Sentara.

Currently, five other Democrats are challenging the Republican incumbent, Jen Kiggans: Patrick Mosolf, a first-time candidate and resident of Virginia Beach; James Osyf, a commander in the Navy reserve; Nicolaus Sleister, a community advocate; John Stringfellow, a teacher; and Michael Williamson, a retired Marine colonel.",https://media.13newsnow.com/assets/WVEC/images/bff5aa85-62db-4029-bcbf-65d2c26f0d6f/20251021T152950/bff5aa85-62db-4029-bcbf-65d2c26f0d6f_1140x641.jpg,N,0.0,2025-10-21 14:02:04.952053

Coverage for certain GLP-1 drugs under TRICARE For Life ended Aug. 31 thanks to a Defense Health Agency (DHA) decision that threatens both the health of those taking these medications and the overall health of the TRICARE For Life (TFL) benefit.

Before the change, TFL beneficiaries who completed a rigorous prior-authorization process to validate obesity-related comorbid medical conditions could secure coverage for GLP-1 drugs approved for weight loss by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). TRICARE did not cover these drugs for weight loss alone, but rather to improve medical conditions associated with obesity.

TRICARE Prime and Select users retain coverage for these medications under these conditions, while all beneficiaries are still covered for GLP-1 medications to treat Type 2 diabetes.

As MOAA works with DHA officials, lawmakers and their staffs, beneficiaries, and fellow advocacy groups to address this issue, we’ve requested feedback from those who’ve lost drug coverage because of the change. Hundreds have answered the call so far, but the more stories we can share, the stronger our voice becomes.

One MOAA member made his case in a commentary at Military Times, where he shared his personal story while detailing the questionable path DHA officials took to reach their decision.

“In 2001, Congress ended decades of second-class treatment for older retirees with the creation of the Senior Pharmacy Program, guaranteeing Medicare-eligible retirees the same pharmacy coverage as younger beneficiaries,” wrote Col. Derence V. Fivehouse, USAF (Ret). “For more than 20 years, that promise held. When I turned 65, nothing changed: same formulary, same co-pays, same access. Until now…This is not an abstract dispute. It is a matter of health and dignity for older veterans.”

He was far from the only TFL beneficiary to raise concerns about the future of TFL and the betrayal of losing an earned benefit:

“I just don’t understand why a person that served 21 years and deployed in wartime is suddenly being treated like a second-class citizen and any differently from those on TRICARE Prime,” wrote one.

“My biggest concern is that more drugs will be added to the list that TFL won't cover. Although I am a military veteran, I identify as a spouse primarily. I am thankful for all that Tricare has done for my family throughout the years, but we were promised health care coverage for life. If they can start cutting meds from our plan, what is to stop them from cutting the program down the road,” wrote another.

“Am I no longer entitled to equal benefits because I served for over 20 years and now, I’m just too costly to pay for? I am trying to prevent diabetes and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Please fix this egregious error and restore my right to receive equal benefits,” wrote a third.

Taking advantage of these appeals processes is essential, not only for contesting terminations, but especially in response to audit findings.
Pharmacies are strongly encouraged to appeal all audit findings, regardless of the financial impact, as even minor findings can lead to more significant PBM actions if left unchallenged.
PBMs will use multiple adverse audit findings to justify terminating pharmacies from their network, so it is crucial for pharmacies to appeal PBM audit findings and attempt to reduce the amounts at issue to the fullest extent possible.","Recently, Frier Levitt assisted an Illinois-based pharmacy in challenging multiple Pharmacy Benefit Manager’s (“PBM”) audit findings as a service to the TRICARE Pharmacy Program and successfully reversed 100% of the discrepant amounts. In the audit findings, the PBM sought claim data verification for several prescriptions, stating the “Network Provider Refused to or Failed to Provide Requested Information.” Under Frier Levitt’s guidance, the Pharmacy gathered supporting documentation and submitted a robust appeal response challenging the alleged discrepancies, particularly as the PBM withheld the funds despite the Pharmacy’s timely submission of a Grievance Request and Request for Reconsideration. Leveraging Frier Levitt’s experience in addressing PBM audit tactics, the Pharmacy submitted patient records, signed prescriptions, pharmacy work orders, compounding records, progress notes, and delivery tickets demonstrating that the Pharmacy did in fact maintain and provide sufficient claim data verification. Ultimately, the PBM reversed 100% of the audit findings.

The excessive audit findings seen in this case are examples of abusive PBM tactics that have become far too routine in pharmacies’ dealings with PBMs. Being aware of such practices and how they can be remedied is crucial to avoiding negative outcomes for your pharmacy.

While PBMs are increasingly taking disciplinary actions against pharmacies, pharmacies have several effective tools at their disposal to push back against PBM overreach. One of the most important steps pharmacies can take is to implement and maintain comprehensive policies and procedures that ensure compliance with the requirements set forth in PBM Provider Manuals. By doing so, pharmacies can reduce the risk of unfavorable audit outcomes or severe sanctions and, if action is taken by a PBM, they are better positioned to respond effectively.

Moreover, PBM Provider Manuals generally include contractual appeal and dispute resolution processes. These procedures give pharmacies the right to challenge any actions or allegations made by PBMs. Taking advantage of these appeals processes is essential, not only for contesting terminations, but especially in response to audit findings. Pharmacies are strongly encouraged to appeal all audit findings, regardless of the financial impact, as even minor findings can lead to more significant PBM actions if left unchallenged. Timely appeals can result in the reversal of unfounded findings, the release of improperly withheld payments, and a reduced risk of future network termination.

Finally, there is growing momentum among state and federal lawmakers to rein in PBM misconduct. Many states have enacted Fair Audit laws that establish procedural safeguards, including clear limits on what documentation PBMs may demand, when funds can be withheld or recouped, and how audits must be conducted. As regulatory scrutiny of PBM practices increases, additional legislative protections for pharmacies are likely on the horizon.

This matter further demonstrates the importance of combating all PBM audit findings, as PBMs assert unnecessary discrepancies to use pharmacy audits as a source of revenue rather than ensuring compliance with applicable laws and contractual obligations. PBMs will use multiple adverse audit findings to justify terminating pharmacies from their network, so it is crucial for pharmacies to appeal PBM audit findings and attempt to reduce the amounts at issue to the fullest extent possible. Thus, seemingly “insignificant” amounts should be appealed to avoid additional future adverse actions by PBMs.

By M.J. Cameron

On Oct. 1, the U.S. government shut down for the first time since Dec. 22, 2018. Congress failed to enact the 12 bills for fiscal year 2026 that make up the spending budget before the midnight deadline on Sept. 30.

Each year, Congress is required to pass bills to approve funding for government agencies and organizations. If the bills aren’t passed on time, lawmakers can pass a short-term fix called a continuing resolution to provide temporary spending bills that allow federal operations to continue until final appropriations are enacted according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

When there is no funding bill or continuing resolution, the government shuts down due to a lack of approved funding.

Serving Arizona’s fourth congressional district, Rep. Greg Stanton said that many agencies must stop or reduce the essential services they provide, and furlough employees until the end of the shutdown. Other essential employees in agencies must keep working without pay until funding is passed.

Under federal law, however, employees who are furloughed or required to work during a shutdown must be paid after it ends for the time the government was closed.

What does this mean for military families?

Active-duty personnel are considered essential; therefore, they must continue their duties without pay. Military families aren’t just worried about paychecks, but the resources and programs they rely on for support according to the National Military Family Association,

The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) may run out of remaining funding quickly, leaving families without food assistance. People receiving health care through Tricare on the base may be affected as there are no protections for routine medical care. Those receiving civilian healthcare with Tricare shouldn’t be affected.

College students may be affected as well. Active-duty, veterans and dependents receiving higher education typically use education benefits such as Chapter 35 for survivors and dependents, post-9/11 GI Bill and the Montgomery GI Bill.

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has stated that benefits will continue to be processed and delivered. Students new to using their benefits, switching schools or changing programs may face delays in payments. Hotlines for education assistance are closed until further notice, leaving students unsure.

As the shutdown continues, millions of military families and students wait for Congress to reach an agreement. Until lawmakers pass a funding bill, families and individuals who depend on federal programs face growing financial stress and uncertainty about when relief will come.

While the end of the shutdown is unknown, families could start accessing what bills to prioritize.",https://thetacomaledger.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/cropped-ledgerLogo-32x32.jpg,N,0.0,2025-10-20 11:19:54.547719

PRESS RELEASE: CMB.TECH trading update

Cylembio plus pembrolizumab achieved a clinically relevant 19.4 months median progression free survival (mPFS) compared to 11.0 months mPFS with pembrolizumab alone; study narrowly missed progression free survival (PFS) primary endpoint for statistical significance

Improvement in PFS favored the combination across virtually all subgroups, notably in patients with PD-L1-negative tumors, BRAF V600 -mutated tumors, and elevated LDH, without adding any systemic toxicity compared to pembrolizumab alone

Final data from the Phase 2 basket trial in lung and head & neck cancers also presented

NEW YORK, Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IO Biotech (Nasdaq: IOBT), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel, immune-modulatory, off-the-shelf therapeutic cancer vaccines, today presented detailed results from its global Phase 3 trial (IOB-013/KN-D18) of Cylembio ® (imsapepimut and etimupepimut, adjuvanted), in combination with Merck’s (known as MSD outside the United States and Canada) anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab), for the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic (advanced) melanoma. The data, presented as a proffered paper at the Melanoma and other skin tumors session of the 2025 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress in Berlin, expand upon topline results reported in August 2025.

Final results from the Phase 2 basket trial (IOB-022/KN-D38) evaluating Cylembio in combination with pembrolizumab in the first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN) were also presented.

“The Phase 3 results in advanced melanoma, together with final data from our Phase 2 basket trial, continue to build on the encouraging clinical evidence seen with Cylembio in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy,” said Mai-Britt Zocca, PhD, president and chief executive officer of IO Biotech. “These data reinforce Cylembio’s potential to serve as a first-line treatment option across multiple tumor types, and we remain committed to advancing novel immune-modulatory vaccines that may help people living with cancer.”

In the randomized Phase 3 trial, 407 patients with previously untreated advanced melanoma received either Cylembio plus pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab alone. Median progression-free survival was 19.4 months for the combination and 11.0 months for pembrolizumab (hazard ratio [HR] 0.77; 95% CI, 0.58–1.00; p=0.0558), narrowly missing the primary endpoint prespecified threshold for statistical significance (p≤0.045).

Across virtually all subgroups, outcomes in progression-free survival consistently favored the combination regimen, including among patients with PD-L1–negative tumors (16.6 vs 3.0 months; HR 0.54; 95% CI, 0.35-0.85), BRAF V600 mutated tumors (HR 0.60; 95% CI, 0.40-0.90), and elevated LDH (HR 0.60; 95% CI, 0.39-0.92). In addition, a post-hoc analysis, excluding patients previously treated with anti-PD-1 therapy in neoadjuvant or adjuvant settings, showed mPFS of 24.8 months vs 11.0 months (HR 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56–0.98).

The combination was well tolerated, with no increase in immune-mediated adverse events (34.0% vs 38.4%) or grade ≥3 treatment-related events (14.5% vs 15.6%) compared to pembrolizumab alone. Local vaccine-related injection-site reactions, reported in 56% of patients in the exploratory arm, were generally mild and transient, mostly grade 1/2. IDO1- and PD-L1–specific T-cell responses were expanded in the vaccine arm versus the pembrolizumab arm, reinforcing the therapy’s proposed immune-modulatory mechanism.

“Despite the narrow miss on statistical significance, I am encouraged by the clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival observed with IO102-IO103 plus pembrolizumab. The consistency of findings across subgroups, together with the manageable safety profile and convenient administration, supports continued exploration of IO102-IO103 as a potential option for patients. I am particularly excited about the encouraging outcomes seen in patients with PD-L1–negative tumors across multiple endpoints,” said Jessica Hassel, MD, Professor at the Department of Dermatology and National Center for Tumor Diseases at the University Hospital Heidelberg, Germany, and lead enrolling investigator for the Phase 3 trial.

Phase 2 Basket Trial in NSCLC and SCCHN

Also presented at ESMO were final data from the Phase 2 basket trial (IOB-022/KN-D38), evaluating Cylembio in combination with pembrolizumab as first-line treatment for patients with NSCLC (PD-L1 TPS ≥50%) or SCCHN (PD-L1 CPS ≥20).

Among 49 efficacy-evaluable patients (31 with NSCLC and 18 with SCCHN), mPFS was 8.1 months at 21.4 months of follow-up in NSCLC and 7.0 months at 18 months of follow-up in SCCHN, with durable responses and encouraging 18-month overall survival (OS) rates. The combination’s safety profile remained consistent with anti–PD-1 monotherapy, with no new safety signals.

The UAE launch of the FX Super One will take place on October 28 at the Armani Hotel, Burj Khalifa, Dubai.

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF.

“Welcome to the 25 th issue of our Weekly Report. We are starting with the EAI Flywheel.

Today we are excited to announce a major production and delivery milestone for FX Super One. On S2-S4 Product & Technology, Supply Chain, Production, and Delivery FX has officially signed the procurement agreement for the first batch of complete parts for the FX Super One with its supply chain partners, and shipment is about to begin. The whole team is now in full sprint mode for the year-end off-line target for our first FX Super One vehicle. This marks a key milestone for FX, from R&D and design to prototype development, pilot validation, and eventually the potential for mass production, subject to securing necessary agreements, funding and permitting. This marks a critical leap from technical validation and prototype development to mass production and delivery. This milestone carries significant meaning:

Accelerated Production: FX Super One will officially move to pilot build and initial production, laying the foundation for the first vehicle off-line at year-end, and building experience for large-scale delivery.

Engineering Validation: Once the parts arrive, vehicle engineering validation, functional testing, and homologation will start, generating real data to support potential mass production and continuous improvement.

Closer to Market Delivery: This step brings us closer to user delivery and marks the strategy of our Co-Creation Ecosystem Online Direct Sales Model.

Government Affairs Support: It also provides solid data and a business justification for ongoing tariff exemption or reduction negotiation.

Localization Advancement: More U.S.-based R&D, engineering changes, and component upgrades will enhance product competitiveness, and help ensure compliance with the U.S. ICTS requirements. Although higher localization standards increase both costs and lead times, this investment is essential to deliver products that meet U.S. market and compliance standards.

Next, we will speed up our logistics and supply chain efforts to ensure the timely arrival of this batch of parts at our Hanford factory. The whole team is now in full sprint mode for the year-end off-line target for our first FX Super One vehicle. We are also empowering FX Super One with much of the core technologies of our $300,000 FF 91, bringing Ultimate AI TechLuxury to a broader audience and targeting to make this “Blue Ocean + Blockbuster” product the first mass-produced model under the Global Automotive Industry Bridge Strategy.

In the mid- to long-term, this milestone not only validates the effectiveness of our Light 4, Swift 4, Focused 5, and Empowering 5 model, it also provides a replicable foundation for potential FX’s future mass production programs, including the FX 4 concept. This also marks the first time that the globalized value of China’s supply chain has been realized locally in the U.S. through FX.

Moving on to S5 Capital:

We’ve officially kicked off the Q3 financial reporting process right on schedule. Both listed entities under the Dual Flywheel structure have now entered their regular quarterly preparation cycles, and we’re confident about delivering the reports on time as planned.

On S6 Middle East:

The Middle East Final Launch of the FX Super One will take place on October 28 at the Armani Hotel, Burj Khalifa, Dubai. From California to the Gulf, the first-class EAI-MPV is ready to make its debut. We warmly invite everyone to join and co-create this moment together.

Coming back to S7 System Build-Up:

After years of experience as a U.S.-listed company, FF has gradually built a mature operational management system. We are providing transition services to Qualigen to assist with building a solid, compliance-ready operating framework that meets public company standards. The team is making good progress on this.

On the Crypto Flywheel:

This week, the listed company QLGN kicked off its implementation and execution of its three core business engines. We will share more progress in the following weekly reports.

Finally, our issues, reflections, and solutions over the week:

As the Dual Flywheel Strategy deepens across regions and verticals, we are establishing a new strategic and business incubation system. This initiative could not only enhance coordination and execution efficiency but also enable faster incubation of high-potential businesses — reshaping our value creation model for the future. Guided by our “Light 4, Swift 4, Focused 5, and Empowering 5” methodology, we are confident in driving dual breakthroughs in both operational efficiency and long-term value creation.

We will share a piece of good news on the FF FX Auto Finance Company next week. With the Dual Flywheel Strategy accelerating on all fronts, a composite ecosystem of Technology × Product × Finance × Co-Creation is rapidly taking shape. Together, let’s continue to push boundaries and embrace the next breakthroughs. See you next week!”

PRESS RELEASE: CMB.TECH trading update

Cylembio plus pembrolizumab achieved a clinically relevant 19.4 months median progression free survival (mPFS) compared to 11.0 months mPFS with pembrolizumab alone; study narrowly missed progression free survival (PFS) primary endpoint for statistical significance

Improvement in PFS favored the combination across virtually all subgroups, notably in patients with PD-L1-negative tumors, BRAF V600 -mutated tumors, and elevated LDH, without adding any systemic toxicity compared to pembrolizumab alone

Final data from the Phase 2 basket trial in lung and head & neck cancers also presented

NEW YORK, Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IO Biotech (Nasdaq: IOBT), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel, immune-modulatory, off-the-shelf therapeutic cancer vaccines, today presented detailed results from its global Phase 3 trial (IOB-013/KN-D18) of Cylembio ® (imsapepimut and etimupepimut, adjuvanted), in combination with Merck’s (known as MSD outside the United States and Canada) anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab), for the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic (advanced) melanoma. The data, presented as a proffered paper at the Melanoma and other skin tumors session of the 2025 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress in Berlin, expand upon topline results reported in August 2025.

Final results from the Phase 2 basket trial (IOB-022/KN-D38) evaluating Cylembio in combination with pembrolizumab in the first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN) were also presented.

“The Phase 3 results in advanced melanoma, together with final data from our Phase 2 basket trial, continue to build on the encouraging clinical evidence seen with Cylembio in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy,” said Mai-Britt Zocca, PhD, president and chief executive officer of IO Biotech. “These data reinforce Cylembio’s potential to serve as a first-line treatment option across multiple tumor types, and we remain committed to advancing novel immune-modulatory vaccines that may help people living with cancer.”

In the randomized Phase 3 trial, 407 patients with previously untreated advanced melanoma received either Cylembio plus pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab alone. Median progression-free survival was 19.4 months for the combination and 11.0 months for pembrolizumab (hazard ratio [HR] 0.77; 95% CI, 0.58–1.00; p=0.0558), narrowly missing the primary endpoint prespecified threshold for statistical significance (p≤0.045).

Across virtually all subgroups, outcomes in progression-free survival consistently favored the combination regimen, including among patients with PD-L1–negative tumors (16.6 vs 3.0 months; HR 0.54; 95% CI, 0.35-0.85), BRAF V600 mutated tumors (HR 0.60; 95% CI, 0.40-0.90), and elevated LDH (HR 0.60; 95% CI, 0.39-0.92). In addition, a post-hoc analysis, excluding patients previously treated with anti-PD-1 therapy in neoadjuvant or adjuvant settings, showed mPFS of 24.8 months vs 11.0 months (HR 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56–0.98).

The combination was well tolerated, with no increase in immune-mediated adverse events (34.0% vs 38.4%) or grade ≥3 treatment-related events (14.5% vs 15.6%) compared to pembrolizumab alone. Local vaccine-related injection-site reactions, reported in 56% of patients in the exploratory arm, were generally mild and transient, mostly grade 1/2. IDO1- and PD-L1–specific T-cell responses were expanded in the vaccine arm versus the pembrolizumab arm, reinforcing the therapy’s proposed immune-modulatory mechanism.

“Despite the narrow miss on statistical significance, I am encouraged by the clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival observed with IO102-IO103 plus pembrolizumab. The consistency of findings across subgroups, together with the manageable safety profile and convenient administration, supports continued exploration of IO102-IO103 as a potential option for patients. I am particularly excited about the encouraging outcomes seen in patients with PD-L1–negative tumors across multiple endpoints,” said Jessica Hassel, MD, Professor at the Department of Dermatology and National Center for Tumor Diseases at the University Hospital Heidelberg, Germany, and lead enrolling investigator for the Phase 3 trial.

Phase 2 Basket Trial in NSCLC and SCCHN

Also presented at ESMO were final data from the Phase 2 basket trial (IOB-022/KN-D38), evaluating Cylembio in combination with pembrolizumab as first-line treatment for patients with NSCLC (PD-L1 TPS ≥50%) or SCCHN (PD-L1 CPS ≥20).

Among 49 efficacy-evaluable patients (31 with NSCLC and 18 with SCCHN), mPFS was 8.1 months at 21.4 months of follow-up in NSCLC and 7.0 months at 18 months of follow-up in SCCHN, with durable responses and encouraging 18-month overall survival (OS) rates. The combination’s safety profile remained consistent with anti–PD-1 monotherapy, with no new safety signals.

The UAE launch of the FX Super One will take place on October 28 at the Armani Hotel, Burj Khalifa, Dubai.

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF.

“Welcome to the 25 th issue of our Weekly Report. We are starting with the EAI Flywheel.

Today we are excited to announce a major production and delivery milestone for FX Super One. On S2-S4 Product & Technology, Supply Chain, Production, and Delivery FX has officially signed the procurement agreement for the first batch of complete parts for the FX Super One with its supply chain partners, and shipment is about to begin. The whole team is now in full sprint mode for the year-end off-line target for our first FX Super One vehicle. This marks a key milestone for FX, from R&D and design to prototype development, pilot validation, and eventually the potential for mass production, subject to securing necessary agreements, funding and permitting. This marks a critical leap from technical validation and prototype development to mass production and delivery. This milestone carries significant meaning:

Accelerated Production: FX Super One will officially move to pilot build and initial production, laying the foundation for the first vehicle off-line at year-end, and building experience for large-scale delivery.

Engineering Validation: Once the parts arrive, vehicle engineering validation, functional testing, and homologation will start, generating real data to support potential mass production and continuous improvement.

Closer to Market Delivery: This step brings us closer to user delivery and marks the strategy of our Co-Creation Ecosystem Online Direct Sales Model.

Government Affairs Support: It also provides solid data and a business justification for ongoing tariff exemption or reduction negotiation.

Localization Advancement: More U.S.-based R&D, engineering changes, and component upgrades will enhance product competitiveness, and help ensure compliance with the U.S. ICTS requirements. Although higher localization standards increase both costs and lead times, this investment is essential to deliver products that meet U.S. market and compliance standards.

Next, we will speed up our logistics and supply chain efforts to ensure the timely arrival of this batch of parts at our Hanford factory. The whole team is now in full sprint mode for the year-end off-line target for our first FX Super One vehicle. We are also empowering FX Super One with much of the core technologies of our $300,000 FF 91, bringing Ultimate AI TechLuxury to a broader audience and targeting to make this “Blue Ocean + Blockbuster” product the first mass-produced model under the Global Automotive Industry Bridge Strategy.

In the mid- to long-term, this milestone not only validates the effectiveness of our Light 4, Swift 4, Focused 5, and Empowering 5 model, it also provides a replicable foundation for potential FX’s future mass production programs, including the FX 4 concept. This also marks the first time that the globalized value of China’s supply chain has been realized locally in the U.S. through FX.

Moving on to S5 Capital:

We’ve officially kicked off the Q3 financial reporting process right on schedule. Both listed entities under the Dual Flywheel structure have now entered their regular quarterly preparation cycles, and we’re confident about delivering the reports on time as planned.

On S6 Middle East:

The Middle East Final Launch of the FX Super One will take place on October 28 at the Armani Hotel, Burj Khalifa, Dubai. From California to the Gulf, the first-class EAI-MPV is ready to make its debut. We warmly invite everyone to join and co-create this moment together.

Coming back to S7 System Build-Up:

After years of experience as a U.S.-listed company, FF has gradually built a mature operational management system. We are providing transition services to Qualigen to assist with building a solid, compliance-ready operating framework that meets public company standards. The team is making good progress on this.

On the Crypto Flywheel:

This week, the listed company QLGN kicked off its implementation and execution of its three core business engines. We will share more progress in the following weekly reports.

Finally, our issues, reflections, and solutions over the week:

As the Dual Flywheel Strategy deepens across regions and verticals, we are establishing a new strategic and business incubation system. This initiative could not only enhance coordination and execution efficiency but also enable faster incubation of high-potential businesses — reshaping our value creation model for the future. Guided by our “Light 4, Swift 4, Focused 5, and Empowering 5” methodology, we are confident in driving dual breakthroughs in both operational efficiency and long-term value creation.

We will share a piece of good news on the FF FX Auto Finance Company next week. With the Dual Flywheel Strategy accelerating on all fronts, a composite ecosystem of Technology × Product × Finance × Co-Creation is rapidly taking shape. Together, let’s continue to push boundaries and embrace the next breakthroughs. See you next week!”

,,2025-10-19 11:51:40+00:00,MSNBC.com,Trump's IVF announcement disappoints everyone – even his own supporters,Susan Rinkunas,,,,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-ivf-conservatives-health-care-insurance-rcna238151,"“Under the Trump administration, we are going to be paying for that treatment,” he told NBC News.
Once in office, Trump signed an executive order in February directing aides to submit within 90 days “a list of policy recommendations on protecting IVF access and aggressively reducing out-of-pocket and health plan costs for IVF treatment.” The 90-day deadline came and went.
In August, officials admitted to The Washington Post that the administration had no plans to require insurance coverage of IVF but that it would work to lower costs.
That means any cost savings from IVF drugs could be eaten up by increasing monthly premiums — if people can afford to purchase health insurance at all.
Even though Trump’s plan doesn’t mandate IVF coverage, anti-abortion leaders were not pleased.","During the 2024 presidential campaign, President Donald Trump claimed he would make in vitro fertilization free for people in the U.S. His official plan, laid out Thursday, should be a wake-up call for anyone who still believed he’d follow through. Instead, the president’s plan primarily focuses on somewhat reducing the cost of IVF — at the same time that the administration is pursuing policies that will increase what people pay for health insurance.

Starting in August 2024 — only after Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee — Trump began claiming on the campaign trail that he would make IVF free if he won. “Under the Trump administration, we are going to be paying for that treatment,” he told NBC News. At a Michigan event a day later, he claimed: “Your government will pay for — or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for — all costs associated with IVF treatment.”

Any cost savings from IVF drugs could be eaten up by increasing monthly premiums.

Once in office, Trump signed an executive order in February directing aides to submit within 90 days “a list of policy recommendations on protecting IVF access and aggressively reducing out-of-pocket and health plan costs for IVF treatment.” The 90-day deadline came and went. In August, officials admitted to The Washington Post that the administration had no plans to require insurance coverage of IVF but that it would work to lower costs.

On Thursday, the White House announced that the administration will issue guidance to encourage more employers to cover IVF and that it had negotiated with one drug manufacturer and two specialty pharmacies, CVS Specialty and Express Scripts, to lower costs of prescription fertility drugs used in IVF.

To be clear, the guidance does not make insurers cover IVF. Instead, as Sen. Elizabeth Warren put it, the White House’s idea is to “politely ask companies to add IVF coverage out of the goodness of their own hearts — with zero federal investment and no requirement for them to follow through.” And while 60% of people under 65 have insurance through their jobs, that leaves the remaining 40% who either have public coverage, buy their own plans or go without insurance.

And while getting lower prices for some IVF medications is certainly a good thing, it won’t make the treatment affordable for most people who pay out of pocket for fertility services. That’s because drugs are not the main source of IVF costs, which can run about $15,000 to $20,000 per cycle and include lab visits, genetic testing and an embryo transfer procedure. Per the White House’s own fact sheet, the prescription drugs needed to complete the process make up about 20% of that cost. The administration suggested that, with new discounts, people could save up to $2,200 on the drugs per cycle, but that would still leave people with bills of more than $10,000.

“The Federal government has the power to meaningfully improve IVF access, but the recommendations it announced [Thursday] are not nearly enough,” said Center for Reproductive Rights President Nancy Northup in a statement. Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, told The New York Times: “I think it is a whole lot less than he promised in the campaign.”

To make matters worse, Trump announced this plan on Day 16 of a government shutdown, in which a central issue is Republicans’ refusal to extend enhanced subsidies for people who buy their own insurance on the Obamacare marketplace. That means any cost savings from IVF drugs could be eaten up by increasing monthly premiums — if people can afford to purchase health insurance at all.

Even though Trump’s plan doesn’t mandate IVF coverage, anti-abortion leaders were not pleased.

And insurance costs are expected to increase even for people with other kinds of health plans, thanks to the GOP budget law that passed this summer. The bill is designed to kick millions of people off Medicaid, which will result in hospitals taking on more “uncompensated care.” Health policy experts warn that hospitals will raise their rates as a result, and that will increase costs for everyone across the country.

If Trump wanted to require insurers to cover IVF, he could back a bill sponsored by Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., a combat veteran who welcomed two children through IVF. Her Right to IVF Act would create a right to access fertility services, including IVF, and would require employer-sponsored plans and public insurance including Medicaid and military TRICARE plans to cover the treatments. Republicans blocked Duckworth’s bill twice in 2024.

Instead, Thursday’s announcement was another example of Trump trying to appease voters who supported him on a pledge to lower costs while also attempting to mollify religious conservatives who strongly oppose abortion and IVF. But even though Trump’s plan doesn’t mandate coverage, anti-abortion leaders were not pleased. Many in that movement oppose IVF because they believe life begins at fertilization and the treatment involves the creation of multiple embryos, genetic testing and routine destruction and storage.

Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life, wrote on social media, “I’m thankful there’s no new healthcare mandate forcing coverage for the destructive IVF industry, but IVF, as it’s practiced, still destroys countless humans in the embryonic stage.” Hawkins said it was the “second disappointment in two weeks from his team,” referring to the FDA’s approval of a new generic version of the abortion drug mifepristone. Live Action founder Lila Rose was more critical, claiming after Trump’s announcement that “IVF kills more babies than abortion — millions of embryos are frozen, discarded, or destroyed.”

At a press conference Thursday, Trump claimed to be unaware of anti-abortion opposition to IVF. “I’m just looking to do something because, you know, pro-life,” he said. “I think this is very pro-life. You can’t get more pro-life than this.”

It’s worth remembering that Trump only took up the IVF issue during the 2024 campaign after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that IVF embryos can be considered children for the purposes of wrongful death lawsuits. Trump had repeatedly bragged about nominating three of the Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade, but that ruling allowed states and judges (like in Alabama) to define life as beginning at fertilization, limiting access to fertility treatments. Trump didn’t want to be associated with those consequences, so he criticized the ruling — and once Harris entered the race, he made his wild promises. Some voters believed him.

And now here we are with a plan that falls far short of his pledges, barely makes a dent in affordability, and has still angered conservatives. As is so often the case with Trump, everyone loses while he claims victory.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251017-trump-ivf-announcement-zz-01-7c638d.jpg",N,-1.0,2025-10-20 07:17:05.578750
