There’s 2 forms of tricare. Prime and select. She has to have select to for sure go off post and not need referrals. Some bases send civilians out off post with prime but not everyone so it’s not guaranteed. Google tricare select costs. You’ll find it’s substantially cheaper than most civilian plans. Glasses are not covered by medical coverage but that’s standard for most civilian plans too. She’ll need to enroll in vision insurance. It’s a small fee per month. She’ll also have to enroll in the tricare dental plan separately which is also a small fee a month. You can Google tricare dental plan united Concordia to see a breakdown of their coverage. There’s no premiums for active duty dependents and the deductible is Pennies compared to most of my friends civilian deductibles. Tricare covers most medically necessary things as long as there’s proper documentation.

You can enroll her in Tricare Select and she can go to any in network provider without a referral (some things still need prior authorization though). Active duty SMs/families have an annual $1,000 catastrophic cap, so you’ll never pay more than that for healthcare in a calendar year. My wife dropped her workplace coverage when we got married and did not regret it.

Dependents enroll for optional vision and dental coverage (FEDVIP—same plans offered to all federal employees and federal/military retirees).

You can find info on literally any question she has by googling Tricare + XYZ (like the other commenter said).",,N,0.0,2026-01-24 16:56:22.378076

The Defense Health Agency announced on Jan. 23 that people who use TRICARE in Kansas can get emergency prescription refills due to the impending arrival of severe winter weather. This offer expires on Feb. 2 and is offered throughout the State of Kansas.

TRICARE beneficiaries who want to receive an emergency refill of prescription medications in Kansas are instructed to take their prescription bottles to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. Beneficiaries who don’t have a bottle to bring in, or if the label is damaged or missing, should get in touch with Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for help. You can find a network pharmacy by calling Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303 or by clicking here.

The DHA encourages people to visit the pharmacy where they had their prescriptions filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain can be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, people can talk to them about calling in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

TRICARE beneficiaries who are not active duty military can get urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral, according to the DHA. This allows beneficiaries to get non-emergency help for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is not available due to emergencies.

You should know there are some steps to take to ensure your TRICARE coverage continues as you make the transition to civilian life. This article explains what you need to do to keep your TRICARE benefit in retirement.

“Your TRICARE coverage doesn’t automatically continue when you retire,” said Zelly Zim, senior program analyst, TRICARE Health Plan Policy & Programs Division at the Defense Health Agency. “You must take action to keep your TRICARE coverage for yourself and any eligible family members.”

Why you need to act now

When you retire from active duty or the National Guard or Reserve, you experience a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event. A QLE gives you 90 days to enroll in a TRICARE health plan. You’ll still have access to TRICARE coverage. Unlike during your military service, in retirement you need to choose your plan.

Before you retire

Schedule your Separation History and Physical Examination between 90 and 180 days before you retire or start terminal leave. The Department of Veterans Affairs uses the SHPE as a single separation examination to capture your complete medical history.

Update DEERS

Your first priority is updating your status in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. You have three ways to do this:

Log in to milConnect.

Call 800-538-9552.

Visit a Uniformed Services ID card office near you.

Get new ID cards

Once your retirement paperwork processes, you’ll need to get new Uniformed Services ID cards for yourself and your family members. Find an ID card office at the RAPIDS ID Card Office Online.

Choose your health plan

Review your TRICARE options based on your situation. You’ll need to enroll yourself and eligible family members within 90 days of retirement to avoid a gap in coverage and claims processing. Eligible family members don’t have to be in the same plan, as described in the TRICARE Retiring From Active Duty Brochure.

If retiring from active duty before age 65, your health plan options are:

TRICARE Prime (if you live in a Prime Service Area)

TRICARE Select

US Family Health Plan (available in six U.S. locations)

TRICARE Prime Demo (available in Atlanta, Georgia, and Tampa, Florida areas)

TRICARE For Life if you have Medicare Part A and Part B, regardless of age

If retiring from the National Guard or Reserve, your health plan options are:

Before age 60: TRICARE Retired Reserve

Ages 60-64: Same options as retirees from active duty

Age 60 and older: TRICARE For Life (once you have Medicare Part A and have Medicare Part B).

Enroll in your new plan

You must enroll within 90 days of your retirement date to avoid a gap in coverage. You can enroll:

Online through milConnect

By phone with your TRICARE regional contractor

By mail using an enrollment form

If you’re overseas: In person at a TRICARE Area Office

If you have Medicare Part A and Part B, you automatically have TRICARE for Life if you meet all other requirements for TRICARE coverage

Set up payment

Most retiree plans require enrollment fees or premiums. For TRICARE Select or TRICARE Prime, you’ll pay enrollment fees. You must set up payments to keep your coverage active.

Consider setting up an allotment from your retirement pay to cover your TRICARE enrollment fees automatically. This convenient payment option deducts the fees directly from your retirement check, saving you time. There are no enrollment forms or fees for TRICARE for Life.

Consider dental and vision coverage

When you retire, your active duty dental and vision coverage will end. You can choose to enroll in:

Dental coverage through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program

Vision coverage through FEDVIP if you enroll in a TRICARE health plan

Your pharmacy coverage

You’ll have access to:

Military pharmacies

TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery

Retail network pharmacies

Non-network pharmacies

You may need to fill maintenance medications through home delivery. Contact Express Scripts to learn about prescription requirements and copayments.

Going overseas?

If you plan to live overseas after retirement, your TRICARE options will differ. Before you move, contact International SOS, the TRICARE overseas contractor, to learn about available plans and coverage in your new location.

Plan ahead for Medicare

If you’ll turn 65 after retirement, sign up for Medicare no later than two months before the month you turn 65, as described in the TRICARE and Medicare Turning 65 Brochure.

If you receive Social Security Disability Insurance monthly benefits, you'll become eligible for Medicare Part A and Part B in the 25th month of receiving SSDI. You must keep Medicare Part A and Part B to remain eligible for TRICARE.

What if you miss the 90-day window?

If you miss the 90-day enrollment window and you’re not yet age 65, you can request retroactive enrollment up to 12 months from your retirement date. Remember:

Claims can’t process until enrollment completes.

Coverage starts from your retirement date.

You must pay applicable enrollment fees back to your retirement date.

Until you enroll in a plan, you can only get care at military hospitals and clinics. This is only true during your time between the 90-day enrollment window and when you sign up for a plan.

Changes to your coverage

You no longer have access to certain TRICARE services after you retire. These include but aren’t limited to the following:

The Extended Care Health Option for family members with special needs

Hearing aids and hearing aid services, although you may be able to get hearing aids through the VA or the Retiree-At-Cost Hearing Aid Program

Chiropractic care through military hospitals or clinics

Routine eye exams except with TRICARE Prime or enrollment in FEDVIP

At the core of the new platform are the patient advocates who help patients navigate the MHS.
Capturing the patient experience PAART is a web-based secure portal designed to collect a wide range of patient interactions, including concerns, complaints, and compliments.
The tool will be used by all patient advocates at the unit, facility, and network levels.","The Defense Health Agency implemented a new system for patient advocates to track and manage patient feedback across the Military Health System.

The Patient Advocate Assistance Reporting Tool, or PAART, is the ""new standardized, enterprise-wide system that will manage all patient feedback that is received by the patient advocates at all of our military medical treatment facilities,"" said Cmdr. Gabrielle Crane, chief of the patient experience branch at DHA.

The primary goal of PAART is to use patient feedback provided to drive improvements within military hospitals and clinics, Crane said. The system was developed to replace inconsistent legacy methods and give patient advocates a new platform to efficiently collect, track, and resolve patient concerns.

""It's standardized and consistent,"" she explained. ""The old process was fragmented within each MTF, and patient advocates had differing processes for how they managed feedback. The new system is exciting because now it will be streamlined and provide transparency enterprise-wide.""

For military hospital and clinic leadership, PAART will provide data across the MHS and make better decisions to ensure data-driven improvements — ultimately enhancing the overall patient experience and safety.

At the core of the new platform are the patient advocates who help patients navigate the MHS.

“An advocate is the shipmate, the battle buddy, and the wingman,"" said Crane. “PAART enables an advocate to document interactions and ensure warm handoffs and transfers to the appropriate person who can provide service recovery.""

Capturing the patient experience

PAART is a web-based secure portal designed to collect a wide range of patient interactions, including concerns, complaints, and compliments. Advocates can select preestablished fields including case date, type, location, and patient category.

The system categorizes cases by severity, which dictates the timeline for resolution:

Emergent cases, posing an immediate threat to life or safety, are flagged for immediate action.

Urgent cases, with a significant impact on health, have a 24-hour response time.

Routine casesare to be completed within 10 business days.

Crane noted PAART’s technology will flag cases to ensure meeting those windows, giving leaders ""at each level an awareness of those timelines and where we are in meeting them.""

The tool will be used by all patient advocates at the unit, facility, and network levels. Using the PAART system is mandatory for patient advocates — and a vital measure of effectiveness. PAART data can be used to analyze patient feedback and identify common trends, which ultimately assist in developing solutions as well as inform training programs for military hospital and clinic staff. The portal enables advocates to inform supervisors or military hospital and clinic leadership of concerns expressed by patients in their local area.

""It will allow us to see how we're doing across the entire system,"" Crane said. ""We will be able to identify which areas we can work on or which areas we can leverage and are doing well. We can learn best practices and incorporate those best practices across our system.""

Improving patient experience through PAART

Crane said the new system ""allows transparency at all levels: at the MTF level, at the network level, and at headquarters.”

Through centralizing feedback, the DHA aims to foster a ""culture of continuous improvement,"" Crane said. She noted the system strengthens trust by showing patients that the DHA created it with them in mind: When feedback goes into a system where it can be tracked, trended, and escalated, it counters the feeling that a complaint ""goes nowhere.""

""This was designed with the patient at the center of everything we're doing,"" she added, “we want to make sure that our patients’ voices are being heard and that they're being provided with the appropriate service recovery. That is what’s necessary to ensure the patient journey and experience is where it needs to be.”

Safeguards are in place to protect patient confidentiality. All users of PAART must complete Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act training, and patients can choose not to provide certain demographic information if they feel uncomfortable.

Looking ahead, Crane envisions technology will always evolve and that ""we are here to ensure that our patient advocates at the MTFs have the tools, resources, and training that they need to successfully complete their job and be the advocate our beneficiaries deserve.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2512/9463019/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2026-01-23 16:56:38.944233

The Leapfrog Group recognized Naval Health Clinic Cherry Point on Monday, December 15, 2025 as a recipient of a Top Ambulatory Surgery Center Award, marking the first time a military clinic earned the honor.

“This award recognizes the exceptional skill and knowledge of the staff aboard the clinic and our commitment to providing high-quality, safe patient care. Both are critical to our mission of ‘Keeping the Warfighter in the Fight,” said Navy Captain James Driscoll, the clinic’s commanding officer. “The core of that mission: the medical readiness of forces assigned to Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point and the wellness of communities surrounding the base, is at the forefront of everything we do here.”

The recognition, according to a press announcement by the Leapfrog Group published on December 15, 2025, “honors top hospitals and ASCs that demonstrate the highest performance in the nation on quality and patient safety, including ethical billing and informed patient consent procedures, lower infection rates, prevention of medication errors and surgical safety.”

“Having 13 of our military treatment facilities recognized is a remarkable achievement,” said Maj. Gen. Jeannine Ryder, DHA’s acting assistant director for Health Care Administration in an article published December 18, 2025. “These facilities exemplify the Defense Health Agency’s steadfast commitment to high-quality care and is a testament to the exceptional care delivered to our patients.”

Mrs. Chelsea Mull, the clinic’s Infection Preventionist, and Navy Commander Carlton Bennett III, Director of the clinic’s Public Health Services, championed the effort to earn the award. “Achieving the Leapfrog Top ASC designation demonstrates that we consistently exceed national standards in these critical areas,” said Mull. “This achievement is a direct reflection of our staff’s dedication, hard work, and commitment to providing the highest level of care to our patients.”

The clinic serves as the keystone of medical readiness for units stationed aboard Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point such as the 2nd Marine Air Wing and Fleet Readiness Center East, and in the health and wellness of communities surrounding the base.

When We March for Life, We Must Fight for the Hyde Amendment

By: James Lankford

This Jan. 23, as we mark the 53rd annual March for Life, we also recognize the 50th anniversary of the Hyde Amendment, which settled in law that American taxpayers do not subsidize elective abortions. Period. The Hyde Amendment is not about if elective abortion should be legal, it’s about who has to pay for it. For five decades, each Congress has voted in favor of the annual appropriation bills to affirm the Hyde Amendment. The citizens of our great nation have strongly held and widely diverse opinions about abortion, but in poll after poll, Americans agree that they should not be forced to pay for someone else’s abortion.

The Hyde Amendment has two clear tenets: federal taxpayers do not pay for abortions or subsidize programs that pay for abortions. Every federal healthcare program has Hyde Amendment protections, including Medicaid, Tricare, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and Indian Health Services and Medicare, except for one healthcare program: Obamacare.

The so-called “Affordable Care Act” is the only healthcare plan that circumvents Hyde protections with its notorious “Section 1303” accounting gimmick created when the bill passed 16 years ago.

Democrats will often say that Obamacare abides by Hyde because Section 1303 requires a “separate payment” of at least a dollar each month for abortion coverage, which they know is an accounting sleight of hand. As soon as the law passed 16 years ago, the Obama administration ruled that “separate” actually meant “together” which allowed one payment to be split into two parts, often paid for by federal tax dollars.

The millions of people paying zero premiums for Obamacare do not pay an additional dollar for their abortion coverage; it’s included in their taxpayer-subsidized premium tax credit.

There are now 12 states that will not even allow a healthcare plan to be sold in the state unless it covers surgical and chemical abortion. In those states, every taxpayer is forced to subsidize abortions with their tax dollars and with their monthly premium dollars. Roughly 15 different insurers failed to even itemize dollars associated with abortion coverage on their enrollees’ bills, nor did they separately bill for the abortion premium amount, which is required by law.

Of course, the biggest evidence that Obamacare does not really have Hyde Amendment protections actually comes from the pro-abortion groups Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Reproductive Freedom for All. They recently sent a strong letter to all Democratic members of Congress letting them know that they would fight against any member of Congress who adds Hyde protections to the Obamacare tax credits. They know that Obamacare is the only federal healthcare that pays for abortions, and they do not want to lose that revenue stream.

There is no debate that the cost of healthcare has skyrocketed. Former President Barack Obama’s pledge of a $2,500 savings for all American families in healthcare premiums has never materialized. For years, Republicans have laid out simple strategies to reduce the cost of healthcare, like allowing small businesses to join together into groups, creating subsidized high-risk pools to lower the cost for all health insurance and confronting the pharmacy benefit managers that limit formulary choices and drive up costs for the consumer.

But, each time we attempt to address healthcare costs, Democrats demand that any deal must include elective abortion coverage, paid for by American taxpayers. That is a non-starter for the millions of Americans that want healthcare to save lives, not take it. We don’t believe that some children are disposable and some children are valuable. We believe all children are valuable.

Which is why the conversation about the 50-year-old Hyde Amendment matters, because children matter. All of them. We can reduce the cost of healthcare, but to do it, Democrats are going to have to be more flexible on Hyde.

That’s exactly what we provide for TRICARE beneficiaries in Tampa. Whether you’re active duty, retired, or supporting someone who serves, physical therapy here is not just about recovery. It’s about longevity, performance, and making sure you don’t just get back, but move forward.

Explore how we support military and first responders or schedule your first visit.

No Room for Delay

You don’t have time for waitlists or red tape. When you need care, you need it now—before that nagging issue becomes a sidelining injury.

That’s why we work hard to ensure:

Referrals and authorizations don’t stand in your way of getting started with us

Appointments are typically available within 24–48 hours

You can access us easily at both South Tampa and Westchase

Whether you’re between deployments or navigating transition to civilian life, we make it easy to get in, get evaluated, and get a plan that respects your time.

Beyond Rehab: Precision Care Built Around You

We don’t just treat the injury, we treat the person behind it. Your background, your career, your physical history—these are the building blocks of how we customize your care.

Maybe it’s your shoulder that’s never been the same since a training injury. Maybe it’s your knees after airborne school. Or maybe it’s your back after a decade wearing gear. Whatever it is, we’re not guessing.

We listen first. Then we evaluate thoroughly. We explain everything in clear terms and make sure you understand what’s happening—and what comes next.

Technology That Works as Hard as You Do

Our therapists don’t just rely on manual techniques and exercise. We’re equipped with clinical technology that accelerates outcomes and elevates your care experience:

Neubie electrical stimulation to rebuild neuromuscular control and reduce pain

PEMF therapy to reduce inflammation deep at the cellular level

TECAR therapy to accelerate healing and restore tissue function

HRV diagnostics to measure your readiness and recovery potential

We use these tools strategically—not because they’re flashy, but because they work. When you’re balancing physical demand with limited time, precision matters.

Not Just for the Injured

You don’t have to be broken to benefit from physical therapy. Some of the most successful outcomes we see come from patients who show up before things fall apart.

We work with service members prepping for training cycles, veterans easing back into fitness, and military parents who simply want to stay strong for the demands of everyday life.

Whether it’s refining how you move, keeping old injuries from resurfacing, or helping your body recover better between workouts, we help you stay ahead of setbacks.

This includes veterans returning to the gym, parents carrying the weight of family life, and service members preparing for their next move, physically or professionally.

We also work with military spouses and dependents, ensuring that the entire family unit has the tools and care needed to stay healthy, strong, and pain-free.

Your Mission, Our Priority

You’ve taken care of others your whole career. Now it’s your turn.

We bring the same commitment to excellence that defines military service into every session. Our clinic is calm, efficient, and driven by purpose, just like the patients we serve.

Here, you’ll find:

Experienced clinicians who respect your experience

A clear plan that fits your goals and schedule

A team who listens, adapts, and delivers real results

Don’t Wait for the Pain to Win

Injuries don’t just affect your body—they affect your focus, your sleep, your performance, and your ability to enjoy the life you’ve earned.

TRICARE covers the physical therapy you need. All that’s left is for you to make the move.

Book your appointment now or connect with our team to get started.

Many Filipino-Americans (Fil-Ams) who spent decades working in the United States are now reaching retirement age and choosing to return to the Philippines. But there is a major problem: they cannot use their U.S. Medicare benefits outside the United States.

This is why Fil-Am organizations, senior citizen groups, and the Commission on Filipinos Overseas (CFO) are actively advocating for Medicare portability — a policy that would allow U.S. retirees to use their Medicare coverage while living in the Philippines.

Why this matters

Most Fil-Am retirees:

• Worked legally in the U.S. for decades

• Paid Medicare taxes their entire working life

• Fully qualified for Medicare benefits

Yet once they leave the U.S., their benefits stop being usable, even though they already paid into the system.

For many seniors, this creates a painful choice:

Stay in the U.S. alone to keep healthcare

Or return to the Philippines and pay medical costs out of pocket

The humanitarian argument

Fil-Am advocacy groups and the CFO argue this is a social justice issue:

Many elderly Filipinos return home for:

• Family support

• Lower cost of living

• Cultural and emotional reasons

• End-of-life care with loved ones

But without Medicare, healthcare becomes financially risky — even for retirees who “did everything right” under the U.S. system.

Benefits for both countries

Advocates say Medicare portability would benefit both sides:

For Filipino-Americans:

• Access to affordable healthcare

• Better quality of life in retirement

• Dignified aging in their home country

For the U.S.:

• Lower healthcare costs (treatment is cheaper in PH)

• Reduced strain on U.S. hospitals

• Seniors still use benefits they already earned

For the Philippines:

• Boost to medical tourism

• Investment in hospitals and clinics

• More returning retirees bringing pensions and spending power

What’s being proposed?

So far, groups are pushing for:

• Pilot programs

• Bilateral PH–US agreements

• Limited portability for long-term contributors

• Special schemes for dual citizens

As of 2026, no full agreement exists yet, but the issue keeps resurfacing in:

• Filipino-American summits

• Diaspora forums

• CFO consultations

• U.S. policy discussions

Bottom line

This is not about free benefits.

This is about using benefits already paid for.

Fil-Am seniors are simply asking:

“If I paid into Medicare my whole life, why can’t I use it in my own country?”

For many advocates, Medicare portability is ultimately about aging with dignity, fairness, and basic human rights.

All told, 156 medical facilities were named Top Hospitals in 2025, Leapfrog announced last month. The 13 military facilities recognized represent a record number for the annual list, according to a Dec. 18 news release from the Defense Health Agency.

A Leapfrog designation “says to other facilities that we worked hard to meet standards to prevent errors, infections or accidents to our patients,” said Air Force Maj. Katerina Loeffler, officer in charge of the 51st Medical Group’s operating room at Osan Air Base, South Korea.

“So, we’re meeting a higher level of patient care by putting in effort to attain” Leapfrog status, Loeffler said in a video posted Wednesday on the base’s Facebook page.

Of the 12 military hospitals recognized, two are in South Korea, two are in Italy and one is in Japan. The remaining hospitals are across the United States, from Alaska to California to South Carolina. Naval Health Clinic Cherry Point in North Carolina was named a Top Ambulatory Surgery Center.

All but two military hospitals earned recognition in the general category. Bayne-Jones Army Community Hospital at Fort Polk, La., and Gen. Leonard Wood Army Community Hospital at Fort Leonard Wood, Mo., were designated Rural Top Hospitals.

Fewer than 6% of hospitals nationwide receive Top Hospital status each year, according to DHA’s release.

In Europe, U.S. Naval Hospital Naples and U.S Naval Hospital Sigonella, both in Italy, earned Top Hospital designations. In the Indo-Pacific, the 374th Medical Group at Yokota Air Base, Japan, and Brian D. Allgood Army Community Hospital at Camp Humphreys, South Korea, also made the list.

“What really sets our hospital apart is that quality care comes first and the Leapfrog score follows,” said U.S. Army Col. Chad Black, director of the Allgood hospital and commander of the 549th Hospital Center and Medical Department Activity – Korea.

“From double checking medications to careful prep for surgery and childbirth, our teams focus on doing the right thing for patients every time — and Leapfrog simply reflects that,” Black said Friday in an email from hospital spokeswoman Jean Han.

Access to care may influence both comorbidity management and cancer treatment and recovery. We examined the association between comorbidity and postoperative outcomes among men with prostate cancer in the universal access Military Health System (MHS). MethodsWe identified a cohort of men diagnosed with non-metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma from 2001-2014 who received radical prostatectomy (RP) within 1 year of diagnosis in the MilCanEpi database, which links the Department of War Cancer Registry and MHS Data Repository. We used ICD-9 diagnosis codes to capture 90-day postoperative general and genitourinary (GU) complications and hospital readmissions; and 18-month postoperative GU complications. Poisson regression estimated the adjusted risk ratios (ARRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the outcomes associated with comorbidity (0, 1-2, or ≥3) measured using the Elixhauser Index.ResultsThe study included 5645 men with non-metastatic prostate cancer (mean age 57.9 ± 7.7 years) who received RP; 39.9% of patients had no comorbidity, 43.9% had 1-2 conditions, and 16.2% had ≥3 conditions. Patients with ≥3 comorbidities had statistically significant higher risks of 90-day general (ARR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.34, 2.64) and GU (ARR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.06, 1.36) complications and hospital readmission (ARR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.12, 2.26) relative to men with no comorbidity. At 18-month post-RP, men with 1-2 comorbidities (ARR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.05, 1.35) and ≥3 comorbidities (ARR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.13, 1.55) had statistically significant higher risk of measured GU complications relative to men with no comorbidity.ConclusionsIn the MHS, higher comorbidity was associated with an increased risk of 30-day and 18-month complications and 90-day readmissions following RP for prostate cancer. This study identifies a need for risk management strategies to reduce complication rates among men with higher comorbidity levels diagnosed with prostate cancer and treated by RP.

First I wish you a speedy recovery.

2nd, I am seeing this is a bill of the hospital, not from triwest.

There is a chance that this is not a final bill that you owed. This maybe an unadjusted cost of the bill, aka sticker price before insurance discount and negotiated prices ( insurance usually has a negotiated price with the healthcare system that is typical a lot lower than the sticker price ).

You should have a EOB, explanation of benefits from Triwest which will list your responsible amount.

That should be the amount that you owed because there usually a max out of pocket that you are responsible for.

And there is also a chance of mid- billing too.

Good luck and I hope everything goes well.",,N,0.0,2026-01-22 16:36:48.584820

College officials said the day emphasized turning reflection into action, with participants working on projects that addressed local needs and promoted dignity across the community.

As part of the Day of Service, Beaufort CCC students assembled care packages filled with toiletries, hats, and blankets. The packages will be distributed through Zion Men’s Shelter and Kitchen and Open Door Women’s Shelter to support individuals experiencing homelessness.

Donations for the care packages were provided by several local churches and community partners, including Ware’s Chapel United Methodist Church, Word of Life Worship Center, Spring Garden Missionary Baptist Church, Beebe Chapel Christian Methodist Church, Cornerstone Family Worship Center, Kingdom Life Community Church, and St. Peter’s Episcopal Church.

One hundred handmade hats included in the care packages were donated by Uncle Bud’s Knitters, a faith-based knitting group new to loom knitting. College officials said the project took several months to complete and adds to the nearly 4,000 hats the group has donated to community causes over the past three years.

Another volunteer team assisted the Beaufort County Animal Shelter, helping with cleaning, feeding, and preparing care items for animals awaiting adoption.

Service teams included students, faculty, and staff, along with members of local faith-based organizations who helped gather supplies and assemble donations. After completing their service projects, participants returned to campus for acknowledgment and fellowship.

The Day of Service was followed by Beaufort CCC’s Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Community Celebration, where Rev. Joneice Carroll encouraged attendees to use their platforms to uplift voices that are often unheard and overlooked.

DOJ said in an announcement last week that the $6.8 billion tally is the highest ever under the False Claims Act.
The agency said that, since the False Claims Act was significantly enhanced in the mid-1980s, there have been $85 billion in total settlements and judgments.
“Stopping rampant fraud is a top priority, and this record-breaking year proves the False Claims Act remains one of the government’s most powerful weapons against fraud,” said Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in the announcement.
Per the announcement, DOJ focuses its False Claims Act investigations in three buckets: managed care, prescription drugs and medically unnecessary care.","Judgements and settlements under the False Claims Act topped $6.8 billion in the last fiscal year, according to new data from the Department of Justice.

DOJ said in an announcement last week that the $6.8 billion tally is the highest ever under the False Claims Act. In the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 2025, whistleblowers submitted 1,297 qui tam lawsuits, also the highest number in one year, according to the announcement.

The department added that the government opened 401 investigations in the past fiscal year.

The agency said that, since the False Claims Act was significantly enhanced in the mid-1980s, there have been $85 billion in total settlements and judgments.

“Stopping rampant fraud is a top priority, and this record-breaking year proves the False Claims Act remains one of the government’s most powerful weapons against fraud,” said Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in the announcement. “We will continue to aggressively deploy it to protect taxpayer dollars and hold all fraudsters accountable.”

Of the $6.8 billion total, $5.7 billion was related to the healthcare industry, DOJ said. This includes fraud across Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE. That $5.7 billion reflects federal recoveries only, though investigations in healthcare are also critical to recoveries for state Medicaid programs.

Per the announcement, DOJ focuses its False Claims Act investigations in three buckets: managed care, prescription drugs and medically unnecessary care.

“The False Claims Act and its whistleblower provisions are crucial tools for ensuring that public funds are spent properly and in the public interest,"" said Assistant Attorney General Brett A.

The Defense Health Agency announced that TRICARE beneficiaries statewide may receive emergency prescription refills from Jan. 24 through Feb. 3. All North Carolina counties are included in the waiver.

TRICARE officials said beneficiaries can take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy to receive an emergency refill. If the bottle or label is missing or damaged, beneficiaries are encouraged to contact Express Scripts or a network pharmacy for assistance.

Patients can find a TRICARE network pharmacy by calling Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303 or using the network pharmacy locator. Officials recommend visiting the pharmacy where the prescription was originally filled, if possible. Prescriptions filled at a retail chain may be refilled at another location within the same chain.

If the prescribing clinician is available, beneficiaries may also ask for a new prescription to be called in to a network pharmacy.

TRICARE officials also reminded beneficiaries that, except for active duty service members, patients may visit any TRICARE-authorized urgent care provider without a referral if their primary care provider is unavailable. Anyone experiencing a medical emergency is urged to call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room.

Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina is also allowing early prescription refills for its members as the state prepares for winter weather impacts.

Blue Cross NC said members can access early refills through Feb. 20, 2026, following Gov. Josh Stein’s declaration of a state of emergency for all of North Carolina. The early refill policy applies while the emergency declaration remains in effect and does not include controlled substances.

If you have TRICARE For Life or you’ll become eligible for Medicare this year, now is a good time to review these costs.

“Generally, your costs will depend on if the care you get is covered by both Medicare and TRICARE, by only one of them, or by neither,” said Anne Breslin, TRICARE For Life program manager at the Defense Health Agency. “If both Medicare and TRICARE cover the care, you’ll have no out-of-pocket expenses.”

Keep reading to learn more, including costs related to having TFL coverage and how TFL minimizes what you pay for health care services.

What is TRICARE For Life?

TFL is Medicare-wraparound coverage if you’re TRICARE-eligible and you’re eligible for Medicare Part A. You must have Medicare Part A and Part B to have TFL, regardless of your age or where you live.

Enrollment fees and premiums

TFL has no enrollment fees or premiums. However, you need to pay Medicare premiums to have TFL.

Medicare Part A premiums are financed through payroll deductions while you’re working.

Medicare Part B has a monthly premium based on your income. This premium may change each year. If you receive monthly Social Security retirement or disability benefits, your Part B premium is deducted from these monthly benefits.

Learn more about paying Medicare premiums.

Costs for care covered by both Medicare and TRICARE

Medicare and TRICARE work together to coordinate your benefits. Most health care services are covered by both Medicare and TRICARE.

The type of provider you see will affect your costs:

When you see a Medicare participating or Medicare non-participating provider, you have no out-of-pocket costs for services covered by both Medicare and TRICARE. Check out Health Plan Costs or the TRICARE For Life Cost Matrix to see examples of these costs for 2026.

Some providers opt out of Medicare. Medicare doesn’t pay for the services you get from these providers. If you see a provider who has opted out of Medicare, TRICARE pays the amount Medicare would have paid if Medicare had processed the claim. (This is normally up to 20% of the TRICARE-allowable charge.)

Learn more about types of Medicare providers. You can also learn about services Medicare covers and services TRICARE covers.

Costs for care only covered by Medicare

When you get care that’s covered by Medicare only, Medicare processes the claim as the primary payer and pays the Medicare-allowed amount. TRICARE pays nothing. You’re responsible for the Medicare deductible and cost-share and any remaining billed charges. See the TRICARE For Life Cost Matrix to learn more about 2026 Medicare deductibles.

Costs for care Medicare doesn’t cover

Medicare doesn’t cover all health care services. Medicare also doesn’t cover care you get outside the U.S. and U.S. territories, as described in the TRICARE For Life Handbook.

In these cases:

TRICARE processes the claim as the primary payer and pays the TRICARE-allowable charge. You’re responsible for the applicable TRICARE deductible, cost-shares, and any remaining billed charges.

You’ll have lower out-of-pocket costs when you see a TRICARE network provider. Learn more about network providers in the U.S. and overseas providers.

During a calendar year (Jan. 1 – Dec. 31), the most you pay for TRICARE-covered services and supplies is your TFL catastrophic cap.

The TFL catastrophic cap is $3,000.

When you meet your catastrophic cap, you don’t pay anything for the rest of the calendar year for services and supplies that are medically necessary and covered by TRICARE.

Costs for care not covered by Medicare or TRICARE

When you get care that isn’t covered by Medicare or TRICARE, you’re responsible for the entire bill. This may be more than the Medicare-approved amount or TRICARE-allowable amount.

Pharmacy costs

TFL includes prescription drug coverage through the TRICARE Pharmacy Program.

Go to Pharmacy Costs to see TRICARE Pharmacy Program costs for 2026 and 2027. These costs are based on who you are, the category of drug you need, and where you fill your prescription.

“The motivation for focusing more on NASA was generated through our past performance work,” Howard explains.
“Once we started our first NASA contract, we could build expertise on more NASA work,” she says.
The company started with a defense contracting focus, emphasizing research and development, engineering, information technology, and mission operations support for DoD clients.
Building NASA Credentials HX5 entered NASA work through teaming arrangements rather than direct competition.","Through the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, NASA had directed $4.4 billion in prime contracting dollars to small business firms, a 20% increase over the previous year.

The agency consistently exceeds its Small Business Administration goals, creating opportunities for contractors who can navigate the technical requirements and compliance standards inherent in aerospace work.

Margarita Howard, the founder and CEO of government contractor HX5, built her company around Department of Defense contracts before the company touched NASA work. However, the transition from defense to space agency contracting was an organic progression driven by demonstrated capability and NASA’s openness to working with smaller firms, often collaborating with large contractors. HX5 now employs over 1,000 professionals supporting both DoD and NASA programs across over 20 states.

“The motivation for focusing more on NASA was generated through our past performance work,” Howard explains. “We were attractive to a large business, and they approached us about teaming with them on a NASA contract.”

That initial partnership created the foundation. “Once we started our first NASA contract, we could build expertise on more NASA work,” she says.

Defense Work as Foundation

Howard founded HX5 in Florida. Her background included Air Force service and subsequent work implementing the Tricare military health care program, where she observed the complete procurement cycle: bidding, contract award, implementation, transition.

The company started with a defense contracting focus, emphasizing research and development, engineering, information technology, and mission operations support for DoD clients. The work demanded professionals with advanced technical degrees and often required security clearances, credentials that can take months to obtain and create barriers to rapid hiring.

“Our focus is professional support services in research and development and in specialty areas, primarily the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering, and math,” Howard says. “So, across the DoD and NASA, those are the specialties that make up our primary workforce. [Our employees] have to have advanced education.”

The specialized workforce HX5 developed for defense contracts proved transferable to NASA requirements. Both agencies need technical expertise, operate under strict regulatory frameworks, and value demonstrated successes in previous contracting projects as crucial evaluation criteria.

The Subcontracting Path

HX5 pursued subcontracting opportunities before competing as a prime contractor. The approach addressed a fundamental challenge facing new defense contractors: procurement officers prioritize proven past performance, but companies can’t build performance records without winning contracts.

“When pursuing work as a subcontractor, you tend to focus on specific specialization areas, you network regularly with multiple prime contractors, and try to demonstrate the value you bring as a partner to the prime’s team,” Howard says.

Subcontracting provided revenue while HX5 built up the credentials needed for prime contract proposals. When that larger business approached HX5 about NASA work, the company had already established a track record supporting complex government programs.

At the same time, NASA’s procurement patterns create openings for experienced but smaller firms, avenues that don’t necessarily exist in all federal contracting. The agency selected 299 Phase I proposals in its Small Business Innovation Research program during 2024, investing $44.85 million total.

Building NASA Credentials

HX5 entered NASA work through teaming arrangements rather than direct competition. The initial contract generated performance data and client relationships that supported subsequent bids.

“Once we’ve been awarded a prime contract, it’s crucial to stay compliant with all contractual requirements, regulations, and reporting obligations, and we ensure we have the best teams in place to do this,” Howard says.

NASA’s procurement system emphasizes past performance heavily. Contractors who execute their first NASA contract successfully gain advantages in future competitions. The agency maintains detailed performance records through the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System, and contracting officers weigh these assessments when evaluating proposals.

The company eventually secured prime contracts with NASA. “We have won some, for our size company, very large prime contracts,” Howard notes.

The dual role—serving as both prime contractor and subcontractor depending on the opportunity—provides flexibility and revenue stability. Prime contracts carry greater responsibility and risk but also offer more control over program execution.

Technical Specialization as Differentiator

HX5’s workforce composition enables the company to compete for technically demanding contracts that smaller firms often can’t staff. The company prefers hiring candidates with prior NASA or DoD experience.

“Experience in their respective fields, while supporting these agencies’ respective programs and missions, is very different from experience gained working in the commercial world,” Howard says.

This hiring preference creates challenges in tight labor markets but yields staff who understand classified information handling, government reporting requirements, and the risk-averse culture characterizing both DoD and NASA operations.

HX5 has also continued to support training and hiring veterans with relevant real-world experience. The company’s veteran hiring practices earned recognition through the 2025 HIRE Vets Medallion Award, a federal program honoring employers for exceptional achievement in recruiting and retaining veterans.

The company also invests in professional proposal development capabilities. “Developing winning proposals that accurately show the company’s capabilities, solution approach, and value proposition in a compelling and compliant manner requires solid technical and cost expertise combined with effective proposal writing skills,” Howard says.

Many small contractors lack dedicated proposal teams and must assemble resources for each bid, creating quality inconsistencies. HX5’s investment in permanent proposal staff improved win rates and enabled the company to pursue multiple opportunities simultaneously.

Dual-Agency Operations Today

HX5 now operates in over 20 states at government locations supporting both NASA and Department of Defense missions. The company has evolved from defense-focused startup to contractor serving two distinct but related federal customers.

“Building strong relationships with government agencies is an invaluable asset for successful government contractors as it can serve to provide the contractor with positive performance appraisals and sometimes even lead to new or additional business,” Howard says.

The company’s growth pattern reflects broader trends in government contracting. Small businesses that build credentials in one agency can leverage that performance history to expand into adjacent federal markets. The technical skills, compliance systems, and security infrastructure required for defense work translate to NASA requirements more readily than to many other federal agencies.

The progression requires patience, capital investment in infrastructure before revenue justifies it, and willingness to accept subcontractor roles while building toward prime contractor status.",https://www.finsmes.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Spacetech_Depositphotos_738858972_L-1024x674.jpg,N,0.0,2026-01-22 13:36:42.447678

Cervical cancer is preventable, yet it presents a significant health concern affecting thousands of women annually, Bunch explained.
“If a routine cervical health screening identifies a need for subspecialty care, WRNMMC can seamlessly provide Gynecologic Oncology subspecialty support and care from the Ob/Gyn clinic,” she added.
A woman’s cervical health can also impact readiness, Bunch explained.
Appointments can be made through the WRNMMC Women’s Health service line.” “Maintaining cervical health is largely about prevention, early detection, and healthy habits,” Bunch said.","JANUARY 21, 2026 – Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) offers Military Health System (MHS) beneficiaries access to “a comprehensive suite of women’s health services supporting cervical health maintenance, [disease] prevention, early detection, and management of related issues,” said U.S. Army Lt. Col. (Dr.) Kristen Bunch, director of the Gynecologic Cancer Center of Excellence at WRNMMC. Bunch also serves as director of Fellowship in Gynecologic Oncology for the National Capital Consortium, which includes graduate medical education programs at military medical treatment facilities throughout the National Capital Region (NCR).

Cervical Health Awareness Month is observed during January to educate the public about cervical cancer prevention, early detection through Pap tests and Human Papillomavirus (HPV) screenings, and the importance of the HPV vaccine.

Cervical cancer is preventable, yet it presents a significant health concern affecting thousands of women annually, Bunch explained.

Bunch said the routine services provided at Walter Reed central to maintaining cervical health include annual well woman exams, Pap smears and HPV testing, pelvic exams, and breast screenings. “If a routine cervical health screening identifies a need for subspecialty care, WRNMMC can seamlessly provide Gynecologic Oncology subspecialty support and care from the Ob/Gyn clinic,” she added.

A woman’s cervical health can also impact readiness, Bunch explained.

“A service member’s cervical health can directly affect individual medical readiness, deployability, and unit readiness in ways that may be underappreciated, and is a force health protection issue, not just an individual concern,” Bunch stated. “Abnormal cervical screenings without proper follow-ups can affect deployable status.

Additionally, service members who miss routine cervical cancer screenings are at higher risk for late detection of disease, needing more treatment, or longer recovery times and duty limitations. Optimal cervical health supports readiness by minimizing preventable disease, reducing non-deployable time, and preserving long-term health and career longevity.”

MHS officials report that while the MHS “experiences the same resource management challenges as the rest of U.S. health care, [the MHS] also faces unique challenges posed by its patient population, some of whom undertake long assignments to remote and austere locations without infrastructure or medical providers necessary to support cytology screenings.”

According to a study reported by the MHS in May 2025 titled Trends in Cervical Cancer Screening Modality in the Active Component U.S. Military, 2013–2023, “the MHS practice patterns demonstrated a response to national guideline changes including increased co-testing and evidence of increasing primary HPV screening among women aged 30-64 years.”

Bunch added that all beneficiaries of Walter Reed who face a cervical health challenge can expect comprehensive evaluation and care from its robust women’s health and specialty oncology services. “The diagnostic workup is tailored to the specific findings and treatment planning [and] is done with a gynecology provider at WRNMMC. Additionally, beneficiaries may access specialty care with Gynecologic Oncology, Urogynecology, and Reproductive endocrinology/infertility specialists located at WRNMMC, as needed. Care is coordinated to ensure continuity and connection across Ob/Gyn and specialty services. Appointments can be made through the WRNMMC Women’s Health service line.”

“Maintaining cervical health is largely about prevention, early detection, and healthy habits,” Bunch said. “The most important advice can be summarized as:

“One, get regular cervical cancer screening. Your Ob/Gyn or health care provider can discuss the timing of screenings, and I recommend following up if results are abnormal.

“Two, get the HPV vaccine, if eligible. HPV causes the vast majority of cervical cancers and vaccination can be protective and preventative from infection.

“Three, practice safe sex by using condoms to reduce HPV and other sexually transmitted infections, limit sexual partners, and seek prompt evaluation and treatment if concerned about having a sexually transmitted infection.

“Four, avoid smoking which weakens the immune system and impairs the cervix’s ability to clear HPV, and

“Five, pay attention to symptoms such as abnormal bleeding, bleeding with intercourse, and vaginal discharge, and pelvic pain.”

Bunch said the routine services provided at Walter Reed central to maintaining cervical health include annual well woman exams, Pap smears and HPV testing, pelvic exams, and breast screenings. “If a routine cervical health screening identifies a need for subspecialty care, WRNMMC can seamlessly provide Gynecologic Oncology subspecialty support and care from the Ob/Gyn clinic,” she added.

A woman’s cervical health can also impact readiness, Bunch explained.

“A service member’s cervical health can directly affect individual medical readiness, deployability, and unit readiness in ways that may be underappreciated, and is a force health protection issue, not just an individual concern,” Bunch stated. “Abnormal cervical screenings without proper follow-ups can affect deployable status.

Additionally, service members who miss routine cervical cancer screenings are at higher risk for late detection of disease, needing more treatment, or longer recovery times and duty limitations. Optimal cervical health supports readiness by minimizing preventable disease, reducing non-deployable time, and preserving long-term health and career longevity.”

MHS officials report that while the MHS “experiences the same resource management challenges as the rest of U.S. health care, [the MHS] also faces unique challenges posed by its patient population, some of whom undertake long assignments to remote and austere locations without infrastructure or medical providers necessary to support cytology screenings.”

According to a study reported by the MHS in May 2025 titled Trends in Cervical Cancer Screening Modality in the Active Component U.S. Military, 2013–2023, “the MHS practice patterns demonstrated a response to national guideline changes including increased co-testing and evidence of increasing primary HPV screening among women aged 30-64 years.”

Bunch added that all beneficiaries of Walter Reed who face a cervical health challenge can expect comprehensive evaluation and care from its robust women’s health and specialty oncology services. “The diagnostic workup is tailored to the specific findings and treatment planning [and] is done with a gynecology provider at WRNMMC. Additionally, beneficiaries may access specialty care with Gynecologic Oncology, Urogynecology, and Reproductive endocrinology/infertility specialists located at WRNMMC, as needed. Care is coordinated to ensure continuity and connection across Ob/Gyn and specialty services. Appointments can be made through the WRNMMC Women’s Health service line.”

“Maintaining cervical health is largely about prevention, early detection, and healthy habits,” Bunch said. “The most important advice can be summarized as:

“One, get regular cervical cancer screening. Your Ob/Gyn or health care provider can discuss the timing of screenings, and I recommend following up if results are abnormal.

“Two, get the HPV vaccine, if eligible. HPV causes the vast majority of cervical cancers and vaccination can be protective and preventative from infection.

“Three, practice safe sex by using condoms to reduce HPV and other sexually transmitted infections, limit sexual partners, and seek prompt evaluation and treatment if concerned about having a sexually transmitted infection.

“Four, avoid smoking which weakens the immune system and impairs the cervix’s ability to clear HPV, and

“Five, pay attention to symptoms such as abnormal bleeding, bleeding with intercourse, and vaginal discharge, and pelvic pain.”

(the “Company”) (NASDAQ:GSBC), the holding company for Great Southern Bank (the “Bank”), today reported that preliminary earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2025, were $1.45 per diluted common share ($16.3 million net income) compared to $1.27 per diluted common share ($14.9 million net income) for the three months ended December 31, 2024. Full-year preliminary earnings for 2025 were $71.0 million, or $6.19 per diluted common share, compared to $61.8 million, or $5.26 per diluted common share, for 2024.

For the quarter ended December 31, 2025, annualized return on average common equity was 10.16%, annualized return on average assets was 1.16%, and annualized net interest margin was 3.70%, compared to 9.76%, 1.00% and 3.49%, respectively, for the quarter ended December 31, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2025, return on average common equity was 11.38%, return on average assets was 1.22%, and net interest margin was 3.67%, compared to 10.55%, 1.05% and 3.42%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Key Results :

Significant Expense Items : During the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company recorded expenses related to adjustments to asset values for branch closures and certain leased facilities. Expenses totaling $259,000 and $287,000 were recorded in Other Income and Net Occupancy and Equipment Expense, respectively.

Net Interest Income : Net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2025 decreased $371,000 (or approximately 0.7%) to $49.2 million compared to $49.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, largely driven by the completion of accounting recognition in October 2025 of interest income from a previously-terminated interest rate swap, partially offset by lower interest expense on deposit accounts and other borrowings. Annualized net interest margin was 3.70% for the quarter ended December 31, 2025, compared to 3.49% for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, and 3.72% for the quarter ended September 30, 2025.

Asset Quality : Non-performing assets and potential problem loans totaled $9.5 million at December 31, 2025, a decrease of $7.1 million from $16.6 million at December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2025, non-performing assets were $8.1 million (0.15% of total assets), a decrease of $1.5 million from $9.6 million (0.16% of total assets) at December 31, 2024. See “Asset Quality” below.

Liquidity : The Company had secured borrowing line availability at the FHLBank and Federal Reserve Bank of $1.32 billion and $305.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2025.

Capital : The Company’s capital position remained strong as of December 31, 2025, significantly exceeding the “well-capitalized” thresholds established by regulatory agencies. See “Capital” below.

Loans : Total net loans, excluding mortgage loans held for sale, decreased $333.5 million, or 7.1%, from $4.69 billion at December 31, 2024 to $4.36 billion at December 31, 2025. This decrease was primarily driven by decreases in other residential (multi-family) loans, construction loans, one- to four-family residential loans, and commercial business loans. Compared to September 30, 2025, net loans decreased $110.8 million. The Bank experienced significant loan repayments in the 2025 fourth quarter and year.

Selected Financial Data:

Three Months Ended December 31, December 31, September 30, 2025 2024 2025 (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net interest income $ 49,163 $ 49,534 $ 50,773 Provision (credit) for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments 882 1,556 (379 ) Non-interest income 7,188 6,934 7,062 Non-interest expense 36,000 36,947 36,116 Provision for income taxes 3,194 3,043 4,346 Net income $ 16,275 $ 14,922 $ 17,752 Earnings per diluted common share $ 1.45 $ 1.27 $ 1.56

Joseph W. Turner, President and CEO of Great Southern, commented, “Our fourth quarter and full year 2025 results reflect the sustained success of our core banking operations and our commitment to long-term tangible book value appreciation, despite a volatile economic environment. Throughout the year, we remained focused on preserving net interest margin, protecting credit quality, controlling non-interest expense, and opportunistically repurchasing our stock. That discipline translated into solid profitability in the fourth quarter, with net income of $16.3 million, or $1.45 per diluted common share, compared to $14.9 million, or $1.27 per diluted common share, in the prior year period. For the full year, net income was $71.0 million, or $6.19 per diluted common share, compared to $61.8 million, or $5.26 per diluted common share, in the prior year.”

Turner noted, “Core performance remained solid during the quarter, supported by resilient net interest income, a steady net interest margin, continued moderation in funding costs, and disciplined asset-liability management. Net interest income totaled $49.2 million for the 2025 fourth quarter, down modestly from the prior-year quarter, due mainly to the end of quarterly recognition of interest income from a previously-terminated interest rate swap, as we had disclosed in prior filings. The quarterly recognition had been $2.0 million in prior quarters and was only $134,000 in the fourth quarter of 2025, since it ended in early October 2025. Despite lower interest income, effective management of funding costs reduced interest expense and mostly offset the decrease in interest income. The effective management of loan repricing and funding costs resulted in net interest margin expansion, reaching 3.70% in the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to 3.49% in the same quarter in 2024. Core deposits remained stable during the quarter, underscoring the strength of our customer relationships and the enduring value of our community banking franchise. Compared to the third quarter of 2025, net interest income decreased $1.6 million, due mainly to the ending of income recognition from the previously-terminated interest rate swap.”

Turner added, “Loan production remained active during the quarter, though total net loans declined modestly due to heightened paydown and refinancing activity. These repayments were primarily within the multi-family, construction, one- to four-family residential, and commercial business loan portfolios. While we continue to be selective with loan originations, our pipeline of unfunded commitments remained solid, particularly within construction and commercial real estate lending. Additionally, our credit discipline, emphasis on relationship-based lending, and conservative underwriting standards remain evident in our excellent asset quality metrics.”

Turner further commented, “Non-performing assets were 0.15% of total assets at year-end 2025, and net charge-offs were negligible for both the fourth quarter and the full year. We did not record a provision for credit losses on loans during 2025.”

Turner continued, “Operating discipline remained a priority in the fourth quarter. Non-interest expense totaled approximately $36.0 million, in line with the prior-year quarter and the third quarter of 2025. As part of our focus on controlling operating costs, we continue to strategically invest in technology, infrastructure, and personnel, enabling efficiencies and ultimately expanding capabilities for our customers. The fourth quarter of 2025 also included certain facility-related costs incurred during the period which were not normal operating costs. In 2026, we expect to continue investing in technology. Non-interest income for the quarter totaled $7.2 million, supported by recurring fee-based revenue streams and increased loan-related fee income.”

“As we begin 2026, we remain focused on maintaining strong capital and liquidity positions, deploying capital thoughtfully, maintaining strong credit metrics, and supporting our customers and communities. At December 31, 2025, our tangible common equity ratio was 11.2%, and book value per common share was approximately $57.50, reflecting the benefit of consistent earnings and disciplined capital management, including share repurchases during the quarter and throughout 2025. While economic conditions and market interest rate levels may fluctuate throughout 2026, we believe our conservative approach, sound balance sheet, and dedicated associates position Great Southern to continue delivering long-term value for our stockholders,” Turner concluded.

NET INTEREST INCOME

Three Months Ended December 31,

December 31,

September 30, 2025 2024 2025

(Dollars in thousands) Interest Income $ 73,435 $ 82,585 $ 79,079 Interest Expense 24,272 33,051 28,306 Net Interest Income $ 49,163 $ 49,534 $ 50,773 Net interest margin 3.70 % 3.49 % 3.72 % Average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities 129.5 % 127.0 % 128.1 %

Net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2025 decreased $371,000 (0.7%) to $49.2 million, compared to $49.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2024. This decrease was driven primarily by the $1.9 million net reduction in quarterly interest income associated with a previously-terminated interest rate swap (income ended on October 6, 2025). Additionally, interest income declined due to lower loan balances and lower market rates, which primarily impacted the interest rates on variable-rate loans and new originations of fixed-rate loans. Mostly offsetting the decrease in interest income was reduced interest expense, due to the strategic management of maturing/repricing brokered deposits and interest-bearing demand deposits. Also, there was no interest expense on subordinated notes in the quarter ended December 31, 2025, as those notes were redeemed in June 2025. Correspondingly, annualized net interest margin was 3.70% in the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to 3.49% in the same period of 2024 and 3.72% in the third quarter of 2025. The average interest rate spread was 3.16% for the three months ended December 31, 2025, compared to 2.87% for the three months ended December 31, 2024 and 3.13% for the three months ended September 30, 2025. Net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2025 decreased $1.6 million (3.2%) compared to $50.8 million for the third quarter of 2025, primarily due to the impact of the end of income recognition on the previously-terminated interest rate swap.

The average yield on total interest-earning assets decreased from 5.83% in the 2024 fourth quarter to 5.53% in the 2025 fourth quarter, with the average yield on loans decreasing 34 basis points, the average yield on investment securities increasing 12 basis points and the average yield on other interest earning assets (primarily funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank) decreasing 91 basis points. The average rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities decreased from 2.96% in the 2024 fourth quarter to 2.37% in the 2025 fourth quarter, with the average rate paid on interest-bearing demand and savings deposits, time deposits and brokered deposits decreasing 26 basis points, 50 basis points and 76 basis points, respectively. The average rate paid on short-term borrowings decreased 70 basis points.

Market interest rates, primarily the federal funds rate and SOFR rates, declined in the fourth quarter of 2024, and remained lower through the fourth quarter of 2025, with additional federal funds rate cuts in September, October, and December of 2025, totaling 75 basis points. This market rate decline reduced the average yield on loans, though the impact was tempered as cash flows from lower-rate fixed rate loans originated a few years ago were deployed into residential and commercial real estate loans with comparably higher rates of interest. The decline in market interest rates also resulted in lower average rates paid on deposits and borrowings, compared to the prior-year fourth quarter.

To mitigate exposure to the risk of fluctuations in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates (primarily related to falling interest rates), the Company has strategically utilized derivative financial instruments - primarily interest rate swaps - as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.

The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the effect of cash flow hedge accounting included in interest income in the consolidated statements of income:

Three Months Ended December 31,

December 31,

September 30, 2025 2024 2025

(In thousands) Terminated interest rate swaps $ 134 $ 2,047 $ 2,047 Active interest rate swaps (1,364 ) (2,172 ) (1,761 ) Increase (decrease) to interest income $ (1,230 ) $ (125 ) $ 286

The Company entered into an interest rate swap in October 2018, which was terminated in March 2020. Upon termination, the Company received $45.9 million, inclusive of accrued but unpaid interest, from its swap counterparty. The net amount, after deducting accrued interest and deferred income taxes, was accreted to interest income on loans monthly until the originally scheduled termination date of October 6, 2025. With this date having passed, the Company no longer has the benefit of that income from the terminated swap. At December 31, 2025, the Company had two active interest rate swaps with a combined notional amount of $400 million. These swaps resulted in a reduction of interest income of $1.4 million and $2.2 million in the three months ended December 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Market rates for time deposits for much of 2024 were elevated, but have declined as the FOMC cut the federal funds rate by 100 basis points in late 2024, 25 basis points in the third quarter of 2025 and 50 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2025. As of December 31, 2025, time deposit maturities over the next 12 months were as follows: within three months — $591.3 million, with a weighted-average rate of 3.53%; within three to six months — $262.9 million, with a weighted-average rate of 3.13%; and within six to twelve months — $38.7 million, with a weighted-average rate of 1.87%. Based on time deposit market rates in December 2025, replacement rates for these maturing time deposits are likely to be approximately 2.70-3.10%, depending on term.

NON-INTEREST INCOME

For the quarter ended December 31, 2025, non-interest income increased $254,000, to $7.2 million, when compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2024, primarily as a result of the following item:

Late charges and fees on loans : Late charges and fees on loans increased $289,000, or 218.9%, from the prior-year quarter. This increase was primarily due to prepayment fees on one large commercial real estate loan, which paid off in the 2025 fourth quarter.

Additionally, Other Income, which decreased by $67,000, includes $259,000 in contra-income associated with leased facility asset disposals, mentioned in the ‘Significant Expense Item’ section above.

NON-INTEREST EXPENSE

For the quarter ended December 31, 2025, non-interest expense decreased $947,000, to $36.0 million, when compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2024, primarily as a result of the following items:

Other operating expenses : Other operating expenses decreased $2.0 million, or 49.0%, from the prior-year quarter. In the 2024 period, the Company expensed $2.0 million due to developments related to a litigation/contract dispute matter.

Net occupancy and equipment expenses : Net occupancy and equipment expenses increased $1.2 million, or 13.9%, from the prior-year quarter. Various components of computer license and support expenses, related to upgrades of core systems capabilities and disaster recovery site, collectively increased by $593,000 in the fourth quarter of 2025 compared to the fourth quarter of 2024. During the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company recorded expenses totaling $287,000 related to adjustments to asset values for branch closures and certain leased facilities. Also, during the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company recorded a total of $219,000 of seasonal expenses for snow removal and adjustments to real estate taxes.

The Company’s efficiency ratio for the quarter ended December 31, 2025, was 63.89% compared to 65.43% for the same quarter in 2024. The Company’s ratio of non-interest expense to average assets was 2.56% for the three months ended December 31, 2025, compared to 2.46% for the three months ended December 31, 2024. Average assets for the three months ended December 31, 2025, decreased $381.1 million, or 6.4%, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to the decline in the average balance of net loans.

INCOME TAXES

For the three months ended December 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company's effective tax rate was 16.4% and 16.9%, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company's effective tax rate was 18.7% and 18.1%, respectively. These effective rates were below the statutory federal tax rate of 21.0%, due primarily to the utilization of certain investment tax credits and the Company’s tax-exempt investments and tax-exempt loans, which reduced the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company’s effective tax rate may fluctuate in future periods as it is impacted by the level and timing of the Company’s utilization of tax credits, the level of tax-exempt investments and loans, the amount of taxable income in various state jurisdictions and the overall level of pre-tax income. State tax expense estimates continually evolve as taxable income and apportionment between states are analyzed. The Company currently expects its effective tax rate (combined federal and state) will be approximately 18.5% to 19.5% in future periods.

CAPITAL

December 31, December 31, September 30, 2025 2024 2025 Consolidated Regulatory Capital Ratios (Preliminary) Tier 1 Leverage Ratio 12.2 % 11.2 % 11.9 % Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio 13.6 % 12.3 % 13.3 % Tier 1 Capital Ratio 14.1 % 12.8 % 13.8 % Total Capital Ratio 15.3 % 15.4 % 15.1 % Tangible Common Equity Ratio 11.2 % 9.9 % 10.9 %

As of December 31, 2025, total stockholders’ equity was $636.1 million, representing 11.4% of total assets and a book value of $57.50 per common share. This compares to total stockholders’ equity of $599.6 million, or 10.0% of total assets, and a book value of $51.14 per common share at December 31, 2024. The $36.6 million increase in stockholders’ equity from December 31, 2024, was primarily driven by $71.0 million in net income, a decrease in unrealized losses on investments and interest rate swaps, and a $6.7 million increase from stock option exercises, partially offset by $18.8 million in cash dividends declared on the Company’s common stock and $44.5 million in common stock repurchases. The decreased unrealized losses on the Company’s available-for-sale investment securities and interest rate swaps, which totaled $32.2 million and $54.4 million (net of taxes) at December 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, increased stockholders’ equity by $22.2 million during 2025. These net unrealized losses primarily resulted from increased intermediate-term market interest rates in prior periods, which generally decreased the fair value of the investment securities and interest rate swaps. In 2025, these market interest rates decreased, resulting in increases in the fair value of the Company’s investment securities and interest rate swaps.

The Company had unrealized losses on its portfolio of held-to-maturity investment securities, which totaled $16.6 million and $24.7 million at December 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, that were not included in its total capital balance. If held-to-maturity unrealized losses were included in capital (net of taxes) at December 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, they would have decreased total stockholder’s equity at those dates by $12.5 million and $18.6 million, respectively. These amounts were equal to 2.0% of total stockholders’ equity of $636.1 million at December 31, 2025, compared to 3.1% of total stockholders’ equity of $599.6 million at December 31, 2024.

In April 2025, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the purchase, from time to time, of up to one million additional shares of the Company’s common stock. As of December 31, 2025, approximately 687,000 shares remained available under this stock repurchase authorization.

During the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company repurchased 241,301 shares of its common stock at an average price of $59.33, and the Company’s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.43 per common share, which, combined, reduced stockholders’ equity by $19.2 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2025, the Company repurchased 755,759 shares of its common stock at an average price of $58.35, and the Company’s Board of Directors declared regular quarterly cash dividends totaling $1.66 per common share, which, combined, reduced stockholders’ equity by $63.3 million.

LIQUIDITY AND DEPOSITS

Liquidity is a measure of the Company’s ability to generate sufficient cash to meet present and future financial obligations in a timely manner. The Company’s primary sources of funds are customer deposits, FHLBank advances, other borrowings, loan repayments, unpledged securities, proceeds from sales of loans and available-for-sale securities and funds provided from operations. The Company utilizes some or all of these sources of funds depending on the comparative costs and availability at the time. The Company has from time to time chosen not to pay rates on deposits as high as the rates paid by certain of its competitors and, at management’s discretion, supplements deposits with alternative sources of funds. Management believes that the Company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors’ requirements and meet its borrowers’ credit needs.

At December 31, 2025, the Company had the following available secured lines and on-balance sheet liquidity:

December 31, 2025 Federal Home Loan Bank line $1,320.6 million Federal Reserve Bank line 305.2 million Cash and cash equivalents 189.6 million Unpledged securities – Available-for-sale 338.5 million Unpledged securities – Held-to-maturity 24.4 million

During the year ended December 31, 2025, the Company’s total deposits decreased $122.8 million. Interest-bearing checking balances increased $74.7 million (3.4%), primarily in certain money market accounts, and non-interest-bearing checking balances decreased $1.4 million (0.2%). Time deposits generated through the Company’s banking center and corporate services networks decreased $87.3 million (11.3%). Brokered deposits, obtained through a variety of sources, decreased $108.7 million (14.1%). During the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company’s total deposits decreased $45.3 million, $16.6 million of which was in brokered deposits and $35.2 million of which was in retail time deposits. As total assets (primarily loans receivable) decreased, the Company elected not to replace some of its maturing brokered deposits.

At December 31, 2025, the Company had the following deposit balances:

December 31, 2025 Interest-bearing checking $2,289.4 million Non-interest-bearing checking 841.5 million Time deposits 688.4 million Brokered deposits 663.4 million

At December 31, 2025, the Company estimated that its uninsured deposits, excluding deposit accounts of the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries, were approximately $720.1 million (16.1% of total deposits).

LOANS

Total net loans, excluding mortgage loans held for sale, decreased $333.5 million, or 7.1%, from $4.69 billion at December 31, 2024 to $4.36 billion at December 31, 2025. This decrease was primarily driven by decreases in other residential (multi-family) loans of $161.8 million, construction loans of $96.5 million, one- to four-family residential loans of $51.3 million and commercial business loans of $41.8 million. Compared to September 30, 2025, net loans decreased $110.8 million.

The pipeline of the unfunded portion of loans and formal loan commitments remained strong, with the largest portion of these unfunded balances represented by the unfunded portion of outstanding construction loans ($605.5 million at December 31, 2025). See the table below.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

During the three months ended December 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company did not record a provision expense on its portfolio of outstanding loans. During the year ended December 31, 2025, the Company did not record a provision expense on its portfolio of outstanding loans, compared to a provision expense of $1.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2024. Total net recoveries were $22,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2025, compared to total net charge-offs of $155,000 during the same period in the prior year. Total net recoveries were $11,000 for the year ended December 31, 2025, compared to total net charge-offs of $1.6 million during the prior year. Additionally, for the quarter ended December 31, 2025, the Company recorded a provision for losses on unfunded commitments of $882,000, compared to a provision for losses on unfunded commitments of $1.6 million for the same period in 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2025, the Company recorded a provision for losses on unfunded commitments of $45,000, compared to a provision for losses on unfunded commitments of $1.0 million in 2024.

The Bank’s allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.46%, 1.36% and 1.43% at December 31, 2025, December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025, respectively. Management considers the allowance for credit losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the Bank’s loan portfolio at December 31, 2025, based on recent reviews of the portfolio and current economic conditions. However, if challenging economic conditions persist or worsen, or if management’s assessment of the loan portfolio changes, additional provisions for credit losses may be required, which could adversely impact the Company’s future financial performance.

ASSET QUALITY

At December 31, 2025, non-performing assets were $8.1 million, a decrease of $1.5 million from $9.6 million at December 31, 2024 and an increase of $319,000 from $7.8 million at September 30, 2025. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets were 0.15% at December 31, 2025, compared to 0.16% at December 31, 2024 and 0.14% at September 30, 2025.

Average Balances, Interest Rates and Yields

The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the total dollar amounts of interest income from average interest-earning assets and the resulting yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, expressed both in dollars and rates, and the net interest margin. Average balances of loans receivable include the average balances of nonaccrual loans for each period. Interest income on loans includes interest received on nonaccrual loans on a cash basis. Interest income on loans also includes the amortization of net loan fees, which were deferred in accordance with accounting standards. Net fees included in interest income were $1.0 million and $1.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Net fees included in interest income were $4.1 million and $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Tax-exempt income was not calculated on a tax equivalent basis. The table does not reflect any effect of income taxes.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

This document contains certain financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), specifically, the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets.

In calculating the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets, we subtract period-end intangible assets from common equity and from total assets. Management believes that the presentation of this measure excluding the impact of intangible assets provides useful supplemental information that is helpful in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, as it provides a method to assess management’s success in utilizing our tangible capital as well as our capital strength. Management also believes that providing a measure that excludes balances of intangible assets, which are subjective components of valuation, facilitates the comparison of our performance with the performance of our peers. In addition, management believes that this is a standard financial measure used in the banking industry to evaluate performance.

This non-GAAP financial measurement is supplemental and is not a substitute for any analysis based on GAAP financial measures. Because not all companies use the same calculation of non-GAAP measures, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures as calculated by other companies.
