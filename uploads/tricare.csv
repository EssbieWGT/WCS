The six clinics that will be reopened include those seeing 400 or more patients per month.

The final provision also calls on the Defense Health Agency (DHA) to develop a plan to reopen closed clinics and to explore the feasibility of putting doctors of chiropractic stationed at military facilities in the federal General Schedule (GS) system. Further, the amendment directs DHA to report back to the House and Senate on its progress by March 31, 2026.

The move to restore chiropractic services is consistent with the DHA’s ongoing concern over the use of opioids by active-duty members of the military and calls to make non-addictive alternatives for pain management more readily available to military personnel. The final language was first adopted in September as an amendment by Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.) to the House version of the bill. It reflects upon the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act (Public Law 106-398), which in 2001 established the original chiropractic benefit in the Department of Defense healthcare system.

“We thank Rep. Steube for his foresight to tackle this issue, and we also acknowledge House and Senate negotiators who kept the bulk of his amendment in the final package,” said John Falardeau, American Chiropractic Association (ACA) senior vice president of public policy and advocacy.

The Steube amendment was drafted in response to chiropractic clinic closures over the past year caused by contracts with participating chiropractors being allowed to lapse, even though surveys indicate chiropractic services are highly valued at U.S. military facilities. Reports show that these clinics provide proven, cost-effective care to hundreds of patients monthly, offering a range of non-drug services to address painful musculoskeletal conditions commonly experienced by members of the military, enabling them to return to service. The results of a four-year clinical trial conducted at several military sites—the largest chiropractic clinical trial on record—provided further evidence that chiropractic care, when added to usual medical care, resulted in moderate short-term improvements in low back pain intensity in active-duty personnel.

The Fiscal Year 2026 National Defense Department Authorization Act now heads to the president’s desk for his signature. ACA will continue to work with Congress to ensure all military clinics that were recently closed reopen and to expand access at additional bases across the country and overseas.

Bill Includes A Pay Raise for Service Members and Authorizes Over $240 Million for New York Projects

Today, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, announced that several of her provisions were included in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2026.

“This year’s NDAA is a win for service members, New Yorkers, and all Americans,” said Senator Gillibrand.“I was proud to fight for and secure key provisions in the final bill, including a significant pay raise for troops, over $240 million in authorizations for military installations and activities in New York, and measures to strengthen our defense against cyber threats, biological threats, and unmanned aerial systems (UAS). Protecting our troops and our national security is of the utmost importance, and I am glad to see Democrats and Republicans work together to pass this vital legislation.”

A list of Senator Gillibrand’s priorities included in the NDAA and the Senate Report include:

Personnel:

Increases service members’ pay by 3.8%.

Protects access to sexual assault medical forensic examinations by requiring the Secretary of Defense to authorize military medical treatment facilities to provide sexual assault medical forensic examinations to all victims, not just victims who are eligible for military health care.

Bolsters OBGYN care at Fort Drum by directing a briefing on the adequacy and sufficiency of OBGYN care for TRICARE beneficiaries in the installation’s vicinity.

Protects service members’ brain health by supporting blast exposure monitoring within Special Operations Command.

Helps victims of anomalous health incidents by encouraging the Department of Defense (DOD) to provide the cross-functional team addressing anomalous health incidents (AHIs) with adequate resources to continue its efforts, particularly treatment of those affected by AHIs, and by ensuring timely compensation under the Helping American Victims Afflicted by Neurological Attacks (HAVANA) Act of 2021.

New York Priorities:

Senator Gillibrand secured over $240 million in authorizations for New York institutions in the NDAA, including:

$90 million for the 42nd Infantry Division Headquarters Readiness Center, which when funded will also clear the way for separate investments and construction at Watervliet Arsenal.

$54 million for the Combined Operations Airfield Facility at Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station

$31 million for the Fort Hamilton Child Development Center

$29 million for the Watervliet Arsenal Electrical Switching Station

$20 million for the planning and design of future construction projects at Fort Drum, including:

$9.5 million for Fort Drum aircraft maintenance hangar addition

$8.3 million for Fort Drum Operational Readiness Training Center barracks design

$2.5 million for Fort Drum Range 41c, Automated Record Fire Plus range design

$5 million for short-pulsed lasers intended to defeat hypersonic missiles and other potential threats. This research is carried out by the University of Rochester.

$5 million to expand the regional presence and outreach of the Defense Innovation Unit, which works to rapidly integrate commercial technologies into the DOD.

$5 million for an Agile, Assured, and Autonomous Battle Management Network and Readiness Accelerator (3A-BMN) at Rome Lab

$5 million for biotechnology manufacturing

Unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) and unmanned aerial systems (UAS):

Expands DOD’s authority to counter unmanned aerial systems (UAS) by allowing the Secretary of Defense to designate DOD installations as critical to national security and therefore covered assets for the purposes of counter-UAS (cUAS) actions; allowing the use of contractors for cUAS activities; and improving information sharing between DOD and other agencies relevant to cUAS activities.

Expands domestic cUAS authorities by allowing DHS and DOJ to provide training to state, local, Tribal, or territorial law enforcement or correctional agencies to engage in cUAS detection and mitigation to protect critical infrastructure and mass gatherings.

Strengthens UAP oversight by requiring the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO)to brief Congresson UAP intercepts by NORTHCOM and NORAD and by requiring AARO to account for security classification guides that apply to UAP and authorizing a consolidated security classification matrix for UAP.

Cyber:

Protects undersea cables by requiring a report on the strategy, challenges, and capability gaps facing DOD in protecting undersea cables from physical and cybersecurity threats.

Bolsters cyber capabilities by requiring the Secretary of Defense to conduct one or more tabletop exercises to evaluate concepts for the future employment of cyber capabilities.

Biosecurity:

This year’s NDAA includes multiple provisions to strengthen America’s defense against biological threats, including:

Increasing interagency coordination to strengthen biodefense by directing the Defense Threat Reduction Agency to coordinate with other agencies and departments to clarify roles and responsibilities for building out biodefense capacity.

Supporting research and development of bioindustrial manufacturing processes by expanding DOD’s ability to support these activities at bioindustrial manufacturing facilities.

Giving the Secretary of Defense the authority to establish a program to support the expansion of the domestic capacity for bioindustrial manufacturing at a commercial level through awards to entities for establishing, upgrading, and retooling bioindustrial manufacturing facilities.

International Partnerships:

$500 million for Israeli Missile Defense Cooperative Programs such as Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and Arrow.

Here are some of the best ways to reduce your home insurance costs, based on advice from Redditors:

Increase Your Deductible

One of the most effective ways to lower your premium is by increasing your deductible. This means you'll pay more out-of-pocket if you need to file a claim, but your monthly or annual premium will be lower.

""Increase your deductible""

""The most impactful way to reduce your premium is to raise your deductible.""

Bundle Insurance Policies

Many insurance companies offer discounts if you bundle your home and auto insurance policies. This can significantly reduce your overall insurance costs.

""Auto/Home bundling discount is the largest discount on most home policies so if you don't currently have your auto(s) and home with the same carrier, look into it.""

""I bundle home, car, and umbrella through AllState. They give an excellent deal.""

Shop Around Regularly

Insurance premiums can vary widely between companies, so it's worth shopping around for quotes regularly. Consider using a local independent broker who can compare multiple options for you.

""We’ll make it easy for you: call a local independent broker/agent to shop your policy.""

""Find a good broker. I use a small local broker and they know how to find good rates.""

Improve Home Security

Installing security systems, smoke detectors, and other protective devices can earn you discounts on your premium.

""Sometimes getting a monitored alarm system will qualify you for a protective device discount.""

Update Your Home

Making improvements to your home, such as replacing an old roof, can also reduce your insurance costs.

""Year of construction and/or age of roof are big premium factors in today's market. The newer, the better your premium will be.""

""I spent $10,000 on a new roof-the insurance company lowered my premium $180.00.""

Review Your Coverage

Ensure you are not over-insured for personal property or loss of use if you can afford to cover these costs out-of-pocket.

""Reducing personal property insurance or loss of use insurance have a big impact on the premium?""

Consider a Trust

If you have significant assets, a living trust can help protect your home from potential medical bills and ensure it passes to your heirs.

""Generally, a living trust would be a good vehicle, but ya need to do some research and maybe get an attorney consultation.""

Evaluate Your Need for Additional Coverage

Determine if you truly need additional coverage like umbrella policies or flood insurance, especially if you live in a low-risk area.

Housing

Fort Bragg Garrison Commander, Col. Chad Mixon, said housing repairs are underway and that a refinancing plan will help bring 400 to 500 homes back online.

“Think of all that money they can reinvest in some of our other issues around housing, like playgrounds and potholes,” said Mixon.

Roads

Director of Fort Bragg Department of Public Works, Jeff Williamson, announced that King Road and Manchester Road are now complete and open. The roads have been recently expanded and repaved.

Child Care: Construction has started on a new child development center near Irwin Intermediate School.

“That’s for a mega CDC one of the first in the Army where it will house 338 children,” said Mixon.

There are 17 CDCs at Fort Bragg with a long wait list. The mega CDC will help alleviate that list.

Dining

A new campus-style dining facility is also in the works. This is also a first at Fort Bragg and the Army.

“It’s really like a restaurant,” explained Mixon. “There’s going to be all kind of grab-and-go options in there.”

Safety

Speeding continues to be a problem, stated Director of Fort Bragg Department of Emergency Services, Col. Craig Giancaterino.

“The speed abatement policy is anything over 15 miles per hour, you will lose your driving privileges on post for 30 days,” he said.

Giancaterino added that more than 7,000 citations have been issued.

“We still see speeding in school zones, All-American Freeway, I295, Rock Merritt Road, and Gruber Road,” he said.

Health

Womack Army Medical Center is open for enrollment to TRICARE Prime and TRICARE for Life beneficiaries.

“We are trying to re-attract care with our 65 and older population,” said Womack Army Medical Center Commander, Col. Stephanie Mont, “We’re also open for those TRICARE for Life beneficiaries.”

Neighborhood Mayors

Two new volunteer neighborhood mayors were also appointed. Sarah Niles representing Casablanca/Anzio Acres and Megan Giancaterino representing Normandy/Bastogne Gables.

“With these latest two additions, we now have six of our 11 neighborhoods represented,” said Fort Bragg Housing Manager, Steve Wykel.

Five Mayor openings are still available:

“As the agency’s leader for analytics and AI, participating in this event provides exposure to emerging technologies,” Caban said.
“This experience allowed us to test readiness-focused use cases, transforming how we approach medical readiness solutions within the DHA,” she said.
The vital work of Team MEDAL demonstrated agility, innovation, and enhanced productivity for military medical readiness, Caban said.","A team from the Defense Health Agency Chief Data and Analytics Office turned the Defense Technologies “Hackathon” into a major step forward for mission and medical readiness.

As part of the National Defense Industrial Association’s Emerging Technologies for Defense Conference & Exhibition, held in Washington, D.C., Aug. 25-29, the team competed in a weeklong competition alongside 50 other teams from government, private industry, and academia. The DHA CDAO team finished second overall for what the judging panel of military technology leaders called an “impactful and innovative readiness solution.”

Members of Team MEDAL — Medical Evaluation for Defense Airmen’s Readiness — who represented DHA CDAO included Barinderjeet Dhillon, operations research analyst; Chris Kittrell, branch chief; and Junayd Park, functional lead for application prototyping and integration.

Dr. Jesus Caban, DHA’s chief data and analytics officer, said the team participated in the event to gain valuable experience in a competitive environment, solving real-world issues to enhance operational readiness.

The team took “synthetic data similar to what we see in MHS GENESIS and combined it with readiness policies,” he said. “They then spent three to four days developing a software application to show the value of leveraging DHA data and AI (artificial intelligence) to better understand and support medical readiness.”

For Caban, the event offered more than a trophy: He said it served as proof for how data and AI can remove barriers that limit the force’s response speed.

“As the agency’s leader for analytics and AI, participating in this event provides exposure to emerging technologies,” Caban said. “It also highlights the incredible talent we have within the agency that we can leverage to apply innovative solutions in support of warfighter readiness.”

Leveraging AI to increase workflow productivity and efficiency

Team MEDAL took on the challenge of automating aeromedical waiver generation for U.S. Air Force pilots. The scenario was a “known constraint on pilot availability,” said Park. They developed a prototype to “streamline aeromedical waiver processing and readiness,” directly addressing issues of medically clearing pilots in an efficient and timely manner, Park said.

Aeromedical waivers can be a critical piece of the readiness puzzle. Before pilots can fly after a disqualifying injury, illness, or new diagnosis, providers must draft an aeromedical waiver, which reviews the airman’s medical history, current condition, and specific occupational requirements. This process can be unnecessarily time-consuming for military providers.

“Leveraging AI capabilities, we were able to demonstrate a significant decrease in the time that a doctor would take to process aeromedical waivers,” said Kittrell, referring to a process that commonly ranges anywhere between 30 minutes and multiple days. “Our solution demonstrated the ability to get this down to less than 30 seconds.”

The entire prototype development took less than 16 hours of coding during the hackathon, according to Park. “We used a coding platform to stand up the front end, coupled with an MHS GENESIS-compatible backend that we integrated using AI tools.”

Creating real-world streamlining solutions

Team MEDAL’s success demonstrated DHA’s capability to leverage AI and innovative approaches to improve efficiency, enhance clinical decision-making, and ultimately increase warfighter readiness, according to Dhillon.

“This experience allowed us to test readiness-focused use cases, transforming how we approach medical readiness solutions within the DHA,” she said. “We’re excited to continue piloting AI solutions in support of the agency’s mission.”

Since the hackathon, the team has continued refining the application using an approved application programming interface and has explored how similar tools could enhance other enterprise-wide initiatives. This example of integrating human and technology operations also aligns to DHA’s FY26 Mission Focused Directive as a combat support agency.

The vital work of Team MEDAL demonstrated agility, innovation, and enhanced productivity for military medical readiness, Caban said.

“I want to recognize and congratulate the team on their outstanding work and their continued support as we move quickly to mature our data and analytics capabilities in support of the readiness mission,” he added. “They are truly agents of change.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9448437.jpg,N,1.0,2025-12-17 23:56:41.310581

According to a 2024 survey, half of military service members say their compensation is a top stressor, followed closely by housing concerns.","The Senate voted 77-20 to pass the final version of the 2026 defense bill on Wednesday. The bill authorizes a record $900 billion in military spending — $8 billion more than initially requested in President Donald Trump’s budget.

“This year’s National Defense Authorization Act helps advance President Trump and Republicans’ Peace Through Strength Agenda by codifying 15 of President Trump’s executive orders, ending woke ideology at the Pentagon, securing the border, revitalizing the defense industrial base, and restoring the warrior ethos,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, said in a statement.

Some Democrats, however, felt that the bill fell short and focused on the wrong priorities.

“Trump and [Defense Secretary Pete] Hegseth are deploying troops to our streets, carrying out extrajudicial killings, and undermining our military readiness,” Democratic Rep. John Garamendi of California, a senior Armed Services Committee member, said on social media. “Congress must reassert its oversight. We need accountability — not just handouts to Trump.”

The National Defense Authorization Bill (NDAA) establishes priorities and programs, but does not actually provide budget authority or spending for those programs. To provide funding, Congress is supposed to pass 12 appropriations acts each year, including one for the Department of Defense.

The NDAA has passed year after year for more than six decades, largely because deeply partisan provisions have been kept out. However, reflecting the state of politics, culture war provisions — including diversity, equity and inclusion programs, critical race theory, abortion-related travel, drag queen shows and COVID vaccine and mask mandates — were heatedly debated on the House and Senate floors this year. Compromises shaped different versions of the bill for months. The House first passed a version of the bill on September 10, and the Senate passed its own version on October 9. Then, legislators considered hundreds of amendments and worked to reconcile any differences between the two versions. The House passed its final, compromise version on December 10, followed by the Senate a week later. The 3,086-page bill now awaits the president’s signature.

The NDAA outlines the military’s values and strategic priorities, which often signal the administration’s broader vision about what might be coming to other federal departments and civilian life. Here are some of its notable provisions:

Reproductive health care

What was included in the final bill:

TRICARE, the health care program for active-duty and retired members of the Armed Services, will only cover fertility services, including in vitro fertilization (IVF), for service members whose infertility was caused by “a serious or severe illness or injury while on active duty.”

What was removed from the text:

A provision that would have required TRICARE coverage of fertility services, including IVF, for all service members and their families was removed in final negotiations — despite passing with bipartisan support in both the House and Senate versions of the bill.

Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs of California, who championed the IVF provision in the House, pointed out that military families face higher rates of infertility than the average population and need extra support overall for family building.

“I think it’s really important because of the nature of their jobs: demanding schedules, long deployments, frequent relocations, the physical demands of training, exposure to hazardous environments, being separated from their partner,” Jacobs said.

When Jacobs spoke on the House floor in the final hours of debate, she told the story of an Army wife who tried nine rounds of intrauterine insemination and has been told her husband’s infertility is due to his service. Still, TRICARE wouldn’t cover IVF, so she’s considering getting a divorce so she can find other coverage and give them another opportunity at growing their family.

“What I hear from so many military families is that they’re basically left with three choices,” Jacobs said. “Either pay tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket for a chance to have a family, leave the military to find a job in the private sector that will cover it or forgo a family altogether.

Jacobs said she was especially disappointed because she and other Democrats were hopeful the provision would make it this year, given Trump’s campaign promises to make IVF more accessible for everyone.

Diversity, equity and inclusion

What was included in the final bill:

Each of the five military branches will be required to restore service-level women’s initiative teams, some of which were disbanded when Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth called for the end of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the Pentagon. These teams will include servicewomen from different ranks, backgrounds and occupations, and they will be tasked with identifying and addressing issues that hinder women’s service. They will also support recruiting and retention and recommend policy changes that support the needs of women in the military.

Democratic Rep. Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, who introduced the provision, said she was grateful to find bipartisan support.

“These protections strengthen our force, our families, and our national security, and are vital under an Administration working to sideline women and erase their contributions,” Houlahan said in a statement.

The secretary of defense is prohibited from maintaining a DEI office, employing a chief diversity officer, maintaining an employee resource group or affinity group, developing any strategic plans or reports related to DEI and developing any training courses related to DEI, critical race theory or intersectionality.

Service academies are now prohibited from considering race, sex, color, ethnicity, national origin or religion in admissions decisions.

What was removed from the text:

The final version repealed existing DEI mandates, removing statutory requirements for diversity initiatives and other efforts to promote equal opportunity. The move is a reflection of Hegseth’s leadership and vision to shift the military’s culture away from what he called “woke garbage” to a “warrior ethos.”

LGBTQ+ care and participation

What was included in the final bill:

Transgender women enrolled at U.S. service academies can no longer participate in athletic programs designated for women.

What was removed from the text:

The final version did not include many anti-LGBTQ+ provisions that were added in early versions, like a ban on Defense Department funding for gender-affirming surgeries, which had passed in previous versions of both the House and Senate bills. It also dropped a provision that would have required all people to use single-sex facilities, including restrooms, locker rooms and changing rooms, at military installations based on their “reproductive system.”

“While we’re grateful that most anti-LGBTQI+ provisions were removed, the GOP kept one anti-trans provision in the final bill — and that’s one too many,” the Congressional Equality Caucus, a House caucus committed to advocating for LGBTQ+ rights, said in a statement. “We’re committed to repealing it.”

Previous versions of the bill also had provisions that said TRICARE would not cover or furnish “gender-related medical treatment,” which includes puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries for transgender people. Some versions also expanded the existing ban on covering gender dysphoria treatments for children by also banning mental health care. These provisions are not found in the final version. TRICARE currently only covers hormone therapy and psychological counseling for gender dysphoria. It does not cover surgery.

An earlier version also said that the secretary of defense would be prohibited from collecting information about gender identity on any form or survey — which will now only include “male” and “female” as gender options. The amendment was dropped.

An amendment included in the 2024 NDAA allowed military leaders or certain civilian leaders to approve the display of Pride flags; however, that provision has been removed.

Support for military families

What was included in the final bill:

All branches of the military will be required to set clear policies exempting service members from performance evaluations during parental leave, which they will now be allowed to take within two years of a child’s birth or adoption instead of one. In the past several years, the military made significant progress in expanding parental leave options to up to 12 weeks of paid leave for primary and secondary caregivers. The latest provision seeks to provide more consistency across the services and ensure that no one is at a disadvantage.

Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma, who championed the provision, called it a “victory for parents and for the strength of our national defense.”

In an effort to improve service members’ quality of life, the bill includes a 3.8 percent pay increase across the board and reauthorizes and expands military bonuses. It also brings a 4.2 percent average increase to housing allowances. According to a 2024 survey, half of military service members say their compensation is a top stressor, followed closely by housing concerns. The rising cost of housing is outpacing the military’s housing allowances: Only 37 percent of families said their allowances covered the cost of housing.

More than $491 million is authorized for the construction of new child care centers and more than $200 million for new schools for service members’ children and dependents. Finding child care is a common struggle for military families. According to the National Military Family Association, nearly 40 percent of the more than 1 million active-duty service members have children, and 70 percent of these children are under the age of 12.

What was absent from the text:

Notably, there were no amendments in this year’s bill that explicitly addressed the high military spouse unemployment rate. In previous years, the NDAA extended the Defense Department’s authority to fill open civilian positions with qualified military spouses, help those in licensed or credentialed professions more easily work after relocating across state lines and increase reimbursement rates for spouses’ business costs. The unemployment rate among military spouses — more than 90 percent of them are women — was 20 percent or higher for the last decade, according to Pentagon survey data. This is five times the national civilian unemployment rate.

WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) welcomed final passage of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26). The legislation includes major wins that Heinrich secured, including investments in New Mexico’s service members, military installations, national labs, job-creating initiatives throughout the state, and two specific Heinrich-led bills.

“This bipartisan defense bill includes important provisions to support our service members, invest in New Mexico’s military installations, strengthen our national labs, and accelerate critical environmental clean-up work in New Mexico. It also includes my legislation to ensure military families stationed at White Sands Missile Range, Holloman Air Force Base, and rural bases across the U.S. are reimbursed for medical travel under TRICARE Prime,” said Heinrich. “I’m proud that this legislation also further cements New Mexico’s leadership on emerging defense and space capabilities, includes my Downwinder Commemoration Act and International Nuclear Energy Act, and builds on important cybersecurity provisions that grew out of my work in the Bipartisan Senate AI Working Group. This bill will help make New Mexico and our country stronger and safer.”

Heinrich successfully included within the FY26 NDAA his TRICARE Travel Improvement Act to ensure active-duty service members and their families can be reimbursed when they travel for medical care. Currently, families stationed at White Sands Missile Range and Holloman Air Force Base travel nearly 100 miles to El Paso, Texas, for specialist medical care, but are denied reimbursement because they are just under the 100-mile threshold. Heinrich’s TRICARE Travel Improvement Act will ensure fairness for military families serving in remote areas by lowering the travel reimbursement threshold under TRICARE Prime from 100 miles to 75 miles for military families.

Heinrich also successfully included in the FY26 NDAA his Downwinder Commemoration Act to recognize the harm endured by New Mexico’s Downwinders following the 1945 Trinity Test — the first nuclear detonation in U.S. history. The bill directs the Department of Defense (DoD) to place commemorative monuments in publicly accessible areas at White Sands Missile Range and Holloman Air Force Base in their honor.

Both the TRICARE Travel Improvement Act and the Downwinder Commemoration Act are led by Heinrich in the Senate and U.S. Representative Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.) in the House.

“As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I’m fighting for New Mexico’s interests and fair share of funding in the nation’s defense bill,” said Vasquez. “With the passage of these two bipartisan bills I have led, we will finally recognize the families who have suffered in silence from the impacts of the Trinity Test and also ensure military families at White Sands and Holloman Air Force Base don’t have to pay out of pocket to access health care.”

Additionally, Heinrich successfully included the FY26 NDAA his International Nuclear Energy Act, co-led with U.S. Senators James Risch (R-Idaho), Chris Coons (D-Del.), and Mike Lee (R-Utah), to provide the federal government new tools to coordinate on nuclear energy policy with allied nations and help American energy companies thrive on the world market.

The FY26 NDAA now heads to the White House.

The NDAA sets the DOD spending levels and policies for the upcoming fiscal year and authorizes funding for the U.S. Department of Energy's programs at Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories, as well as the Department of Energy's environmental cleanup programs including the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP).

Heinrich has long championed provisions that benefit New Mexico’s service members, national laboratories, and defense missions. Heinrich served as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee from 2013 to 2020 and as Chairman of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee from 2021 to 2022. He is also a member of the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and a member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.

During his time in Congress, Heinrich has doubled the total budgets for Sandia and Los Alamos, significantly increasing the total employees and local economic impact of both labs.

Heinrich has also delivered a total of more than $1.5 billion for military construction projects at defense installations in New Mexico over the course of his career in Congress.

FY26 Defense Authorization Bill Highlights

Military Construction

Heinrich championed a historic number of investments in our military installations in New Mexico, including:

$90 million for a new 192-bed dormitory at Cannon Air Force Base.

$79 million for a Deployment Processing Center at Cannon Air Force Base.

$83 million for a Space Rapid Capabilities Office Headquarters at Kirtland Air Force Base.

$10 million for a dormitory for the 58th Special Operations Wing on Kirtland Air Force Base.

$26 million for an Explosive Operations Building on Kirtland Air Force Base.

$38.5 million for a Power Generation and Microgrid project on White Sands Missile Range.

$4.25 million for a Soldier Performance Readiness Center for the New Mexico Army National Guard at the Sante Fe Training Center.

Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technologies

Heinrich helped secure provisions that ensure the DoD only uses commercial AI services from companies with a reliable cybersecurity posture. AI companies that do not take appropriate steps to defend themselves in cyberspace may become the victims of supply chain attacks that compromise the trustworthiness of their products.

Pay Raise for Junior Enlisted Service Members

The FY26 NDAA authorizes a 3.8 percent pay raise for service members. This builds off of a 14.5 percent pay raise for the most junior-ranking enlisted service members, and a 4.5 percent pay raise for the rest of the force in the FY25 NDAA.

Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories

The FY26 NDAA authorizes $1.79 billion for LANL’s ongoing research and development programs. The funding supports personnel, equipment, and other activities at LANL.

Within the FY26 NDAA's overall $26 billion for the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), Sandia National Laboratories will receive funding to support and sustain system integration, engineering, and science programs. Sandia is also receiving $40 million for their Microsystems, Engineering, Science and Applications (MESA) Photolithography Capability and $52.2 million for Combined Radiation Environments for Survivability Testing.

Additional Heinrich-led provisions include:

Directing the U.S. Department of Energy Secretary to brief Congress on recommended actions to accelerate environmental cleanup milestones with the State of New Mexico at Los Alamos National Laboratory, including interim measures to control migration of a hexavalent chromium plume and progress on the groundwater remedies for the Royal Demolition Explosive (RDX) plume in Cañon de Valle.

Directing the NNSA Administrator for Nuclear Security and Directors of Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories, along with leaders from other national labs, to evaluate site strategies that can aid the NNSA in making greater use of facilities in areas neighboring existing laboratory and site installations, particularly where workforce housing is less constrained.

Directing the U.S. Comptroller General to assess:

What Unexploded Ordnance remediation efforts the NNSA has completed in the vicinity of Sandia National Laboratories; and

The extent to which additional efforts are needed to ensure that all affected nearby communities have been cleared of legacy unexploded ordnance.

Authorizing nearly $300 million for environmental cleanup efforts at Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories.

Directing the NNSA Administrator for Nuclear Security to conduct a study of portions of Tract A-14 (Rendija Canyon) of Los Alamos National Laboratory that may be suitable for conveyance.

Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP)

The FY26 NDAA authorizes over $415 million to operate WIPP including $2 million to construct a hoisting capability project to improve facility capacity and effectiveness.

Space Force Modeling, Simulation & Analysis Hub

The FY26 NDAA authorizes $7.5 million for the ongoing establishment and deployment of a U.S. Space Force modeling and simulation hub at the Air Force Research Lab on Kirtland Air Force Base.

Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration Program

The FY26 NDAA authorizes over $182 million for the DoD’s Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration (REPI) Program. Cannon Air Force Base, Melrose Air Force Range, and White Sands Missile Range utilize the REPI to prevent encroachment and preserve their testing and training missions. The program as a whole is critical to assisting military installations and ranges as they are increasingly impacted by extreme weather, flooding, wildfires, drought, and other threats to resilience.

Advanced Simulation and Computing for Nuclear Stockpile Stewardship

The FY26 NDAA authorizes $866 million in funding for the NNSA’s advanced simulation and computing efforts in the Stockpile Stewardship Program. This program ensures continued reliability of the stockpile and allows realistic simulations on supercomputers to understand how they would behave, without requiring explosive testing.

Intelligence Authorization Act

The FY26 NDAA includes the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY26, legislation that equips U.S. intelligence agencies with the tools, resources, and personnel they need to protect the American people, while also ensuring congressional oversight over those same agencies.

Humana (HUM, Financial) secures a $7.34 billion contract with the Defense Health Agency for TRICARE services in the East Region.

Humana's market capitalization stands at approximately $31.3 billion, positioning it as a significant player in the healthcare sector.

The company's financial health is underscored by a Piotroski F-Score of 7, indicating robust financial strength.

Humana (HUM) has successfully secured a $7.34 billion contract for the continuation of health care and administrative support services under the Defense Health Agency's TRICARE program in the East Region. This contract involves the integration of Humana's resources with the military's medical care system to deliver comprehensive health, medical, and support services to eligible uniformed service members, retirees, and their families.

The East Region encompasses a wide range of locations, including Washington, D.C., and states such as Alabama, Florida, New York, and Virginia among others. Initiated on December 22, 2022, this contract includes a 12-month base period along with eight potential one-year extensions plus a transition-out phase. The current option period is scheduled from January 1, 2026, to December 31, 2026, with operations centered in Louisville, Kentucky. The Managed Care Contracting Division of the Defense Health Agency oversees this contract.

Humana Inc, one of the largest private health insurers in the US, has carved out a niche specializing in government-sponsored programs. Nearly all its medical membership stems from Medicare, Medicaid, and the military's TRICARE program. Beyond medical insurance, Humana provides other healthcare services, including primary-care services, at-home services, and pharmacy benefit management. With a market capitalization of approximately $31.3 billion, Humana is a formidable entity within the healthcare sector, specifically in the healthcare plans industry.

Financial Health Analysis

Humana's financial performance is characterized by a revenue growth of 14.9% over the past three years, reflecting its ability to expand its market presence effectively. However, the company's net margin remains relatively modest at 1.02%, indicating room for improvement in profitability. The EBITDA margin stands at 2.55%, while the EBIT margin is 1.86%.

On the balance sheet front, Humana's debt-to-equity ratio is 0.68, suggesting a balanced approach to leveraging debt. The company has a interest coverage ratio of 3.63, indicating its ability to meet interest obligations comfortably. However, a warning sign is the company's continued issuance of new debt, with $2 billion issued over the past three years.

Valuation & Market Sentiment

Humana's valuation metrics reveal a P/E ratio of 24.39, which is within its historical range, suggesting that the stock is fairly valued relative to its earnings. The P/S ratio is 0.25, and the P/B ratio is 1.69, both indicating a reasonable valuation compared to historical norms.

Analyst sentiment is moderately positive, with a target price of $289.06 and a recommendation score of 2.5. Technical indicators such as the RSI of 51.84 suggest that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. Institutional ownership is high at 98.39%, reflecting strong confidence from large investors.

Risk Assessment

Humana's financial health is supported by a Piotroski F-Score of 7, indicating a very healthy situation. The Beneish M-Score of -2.43 suggests that the company is unlikely to be a manipulator. However, sector-specific risks, such as regulatory changes in healthcare, could impact future performance.",https://static.gurufocus.com/logos/0C00000BCM.png?20,N,1.0,2025-12-17 18:57:38.564715

The Military CARE Act gives service members and their families a direct line to report care access issues and track their resolution, while ensuring Congress has the data needed to identify and fix systemic problems across the military health system,” Rep. Bacon said.
Our commonsense bipartisan bill will cut senseless red tape, restore basic accountability, and return the power back where it belongs: with patients.","“Military families serve our nation and sacrifice so much for it, and they deserve a health care system that serves them just as well,” Rep. Horsford said. “Too many families struggle to get timely appointments or clear information, and they’re left without a reliable way to raise concerns or track whether problems are fixed. This bipartisan bill gives military families a real voice, gives providers the tools to respond quickly, and gives Congress the oversight needed to ensure servicemembers and their loved ones are never left behind.When we support our families, we strengthen the entire force.”

“Access to timely, reliable health care is both a personal issue and a readiness issue. Too often, military families hit administrative roadblocks or long delays with no clear way to raise concerns or track whether problems are being fixed,” Rep. Houlahan said. “The Military CARE Act brings transparency and accountability to the system by giving TRICARE beneficiaries a straightforward way to report access issues and ensures those concerns reach patient advocates and senior leaders.

“Today, America’s servicemembers, veterans, and military families are forced to fight endless red tape and navigate a confusing and deeply frustrating system to get the healthcare they have earned,” Rep. Goodlander said. “That’s not right. Our commonsense bipartisan bill will cut senseless red tape, restore basic accountability, and return the power back where it belongs: with patients.

Maintaining Physical Health During the Holidays Physical activity remains important for both physical and mental well-being, even when schedules are full.","Editor’s note: The Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center has begun a Behavioral Health Initiative to inform the community with information and resources that will help with everyday struggles like stress management, nutrition and physical health, emotional intelligence, and healthy habits. This article focuses on maintaining healthy stress levels during the holiday season.

FORT HOOD, Texas - The holiday season is a time of celebration, connection, and reflection, but it can also bring increased stress, disruptions to routines, and challenges to maintaining healthy habits. Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center encourages service members, families, retirees, and community members to take proactive steps to care for their mental, nutritional, and physical health—and to take advantage of the many resources available on post and in the local area.

“Maintaining your health during the holidays doesn’t require perfection or even a large time commitment,” said Col. Amit Gupta, Fort Hood director of psychological health and chief of behavioral health CRDAMC. “It’s about balance—recognizing stress early, making small healthy choices, and knowing when to ask for support. Use your CRDAMC providers, who want nothing more than to care for this community every step of the way.”

Managing Holiday Stress Holiday stress can come from many sources, including busy schedules, financial strain, travel, and separation from loved ones. Recognizing stress early and using healthy coping strategies can help prevent it from becoming overwhelming.

“Stress can affect both mental and physical health, especially when routines are disrupted,” notes Capt. Chelsea Yueng, a CRDAMC behavioral health nurse. “Reaching out early—whether to a provider, counselor, chaplain, or trusted individual—can make a significant difference.” Helpful strategies include: • Maintain Routines: Stick to consistent sleep schedules when possible. • Set Attainable Expectations: Unrealistic expectations y cause resentment and disappointment. • Set Realistic Goals: Prioritize what's most important and don't be afraid to say no. • Stay Connected: Make time for friends, family, and trusted coworkers. • Practice Relaxation: Try deep breathing, meditation, prayer, or even short walks to clear your head.

Support is Always Available: • CRDAMC Behavioral Health Services: Counseling for stress, anxiety, and other concerns. Visit https://darnall.tricare.mil/Health-Services/Mental-Behavioral-Health-Substance-Use-Disorder for more information. • Military & Family Life Counselors (MFLC): Confidential, short-term counseling.

Navigating Nutrition During the Holidays Holiday meals are meant to be enjoyed! With a mindful approach, you can savor your favorite foods as part of a healthy lifestyle.

“Nutrition is not about restriction—it’s about fueling your body in a way that supports energy, immunity, and overall health,” says Lt. Col. Donna Goodson, Director of Nutritional Medicine at CRDAMC.

Simple Nutrition Tips: • Use the Plate Method: Fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables, a quarter with lean protein, and a quarter with whole grains. • Eat Regularly: Don't skip meals, as this can lead to overeating later. • Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. It will also help you stay full. • Enjoy Mindfully: Savor your favorite holiday treats by consuming them slowly and focusing on the sensations. Eat without guilt by focusing on portion awareness and satisfaction.

For immediate release

Washington, DC—ASRM applauds the introduction of the Bipartisan IVF for Military Families Act. This significant development should be viewed as a rapid and sharp rebuke of House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), who unilaterally stripped TRICARE coverage for the brave men and women who serve our country from the Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26) National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).

“The ink on the final FY26 NDAA is still drying, and the bill has yet to be signed into law,” observed American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) Chief Advocacy & Policy Officer Sean Tipton. “And yet, even in one of the most polarized and partisan political environments we have seen in decades, House Democrats and Republicans have rapidly come together with one voice to condemn the Speaker’s actions and stand up for the members of the active duty military who desire to both serve their country and achieve their dreams of building a family.”

The Bipartisan IVF for Military Families Act is the first-ever, standalone, bipartisan bill to provide comprehensive fertility care for military families under TRICARE, the federal health care program for servicemembers and their families. Nearly identical to the language included in the version of the NDAA that passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support in September, the new legislation requires TRICARE coverage for fertility-related care, including IVF, cryopreservation of reproductive genetic materials, medications, and fertility treatment coordination, among other services. Notably, the IVF coverage directed by the bill achieves parity with the IVF benefits available to Members of Congress and their staff.

“We commend Representatives Sara Jacobs (D-CA), Nick LaLota (R-NY), Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA), and Jen Kiggans (R-VA) for their outstanding leadership on the Bipartisan IVF for Military Families Act,” continued Tipton. “In an era where Members of Congress frequently encounter threats of political retribution for bucking party leadership, it is a breath of fresh air to engage with these lawmakers who demonstrate what it means to serve with integrity and do the right thing. We thank this group of bipartisan champions for their work to ensure that our military families will have guaranteed access to IVF and other family building treatments, and ASRM looks forward to fighting alongside them to secure enactment of the Bipartisan IVF for Military Families Act as soon as possible.”

Many ASRM members have previously served in uniform, and others have years of experience providing fertility care to military families. Too often, ASRM members report that the biggest obstacle to caring for these patients is knowing that IVF is the best treatment option and simultaneously acknowledging that this family building pathway is financially out of reach because of barriers under TRICARE. The absence of coverage is deeply unjust considering the sacrifices military families endure and the elevated infertility rates among service members due to job-related factors.

“The introduction of the Bipartisan IVF for Military Families Act is a huge victory for military families across the country,” said Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) Executive Council President Dr. Micah Hill, D.O., a retired colonel who served 21 years on active duty. “The brave men and women who serve our nation are more likely to experience infertility than the general public, and it’s high time they receive comprehensive coverage for IVF and other essential family-building treatments through TRICARE.”",https://www.asrm.org/globalassets/_asrm/news-events/asrm-news/press-releasebulletins/press_release_teaser.png,N,1.0,2025-12-17 17:57:15.973163

Why it matters: San Diego has one of the largest concentrations of military personnel, and about one in four service members and their spouses report infertility.

In vitro fertilization, or IVF, treatments can cost tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket.

Driving the news: Jacobs and other congressional lawmakers introduced the Bipartisan IVF for Military Families Act as a standalone bill Wednesday to require military health care to cover all fertility treatments, including IVF and egg freezing.

Speaker Mike Johnson worked to remove a similar provision from the final version of the National Defense Authorization Act last week, despite it passing with bipartisan support in previous House and Senate versions.

What she's saying: ""It's a national security issue,"" Jacobs told Axios. ""People are leaving the military because they cannot continue and build the families that they want.""

Between the lines: California requires large health insurers to cover IVF treatments, but that doesn't apply to the thousands of local military families who use TRICARE, the military's health plan.

Zoom in: TRICARE only covers fertility treatment for those who can prove that there's a service-connected reason for their infertility, which can be challenging.

Jacobs said she talked to one woman who's tried 11 rounds of IUI, and can't get TRICARE to cover IVF, even with proof that her husband's multiple combat deployments have caused his fertility issues. They've even considered getting divorced so that she can get that coverage elsewhere, she said.

It is structured to help military-connected individuals enter care with clarity, predictability, and a sense of stability. Instead of navigating everything alone, you are offered a clear pathway that explains what steps to take and what support may be available.

One of the most meaningful aspects of Tricare is its emphasis on accessibility. Many individuals and families share that having guidelines and coverage explanations helps reduce the stress of making decisions during an already vulnerable time. When you understand what your plan includes, it becomes easier to imagine a healing experience that feels approachable.

Rehab is often described not as a place of judgment but as a space where understanding, connection, and grounding begin to take shape. Many individuals find themselves reconnecting with their needs, rebuilding inner stability, and exploring long-standing challenges with compassion and support.

Treatment can offer greater clarity, emotional resilience, healthier routines, and a sense of steady encouragement during moments of transition. Healing is never rushed. Each step is taken with intention and respect for your comfort level.

Feeling understood is often the first step toward healing. At Acceptance Treatment, individuals are welcomed exactly as they are, without pressure or expectation. We create a warm, trauma-informed space where you can explore what feels heavy, reconnect with your needs, and move forward at a pace that honors your internal rhythm.

While we are not a residential rehab facility, we offer grounding outpatient support for individuals who are considering different treatment options. We frequently help people understand which programs may align with their goals, including those that take Tricare insurance.

Later on Wednesday, the Senate unanimously adopted a bipartisan bill to close the loophole, but it still needs to pass the House.
GOP Sen. Ted Cruz said he hopes the House will take it up “expeditiously” Senators expressed concerns about other omissions in the defense policy bill.
Earlier House and Senate versions of the bill contained such language, but it was left out of the final product.","The Senate passed the annual defense policy bill, sending it to President Donald Trump’s desk for his signature.

Democrats and Republicans in the Senate voted overwhelmingly, 77-20, to approve the National Defense Authorization Act, which authorizes nearly $900 billion in funding for military programs, including a 3.8% pay raise for service members, and sets out the nation’s defense policy agenda.

The House of Representatives approved the package last week, and Trump is expected to sign it, having previously urged its passage.

Among the massive bill’s more controversial measures is a provision that pressures the Pentagon to provide more information on military strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean, which was added after the revelation of a follow-up strike conducted on September 2. The package would cut Secretary Pete Hegseth’s travel budget by 25% until unedited videos of the strikes are released to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees.

Earlier this week, Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio held classified briefings for all House members and Senators on the strikes. Hegseth told reporters on Tuesday the Pentagon will not release to the public the full video of the controversial September strike.

The NDAA would also repeal the 1991 and 2002 authorizations for the use of military force against Iraq, repeal sanctions on Syria, and seek to limit the Trump administration’s ability to significantly draw down troops from Europe.

Another provision aims to support efforts to recover Ukrainian children who have been abducted by Russia. The provision, based on bipartisan, bicameral legislation, would restore US support for the work to track and return the stolen children. Earlier this year, the Trump administration cut funding to the leading organization that tracks evidence of Russian war crimes, including the forced relocation of the estimated tens of thousands of Ukrainian children who have been taken by Russia.

Senators from both parties had raised alarms about a measure in the package that they warn will weaken safety measures put in place after last year’s deadly plane crash at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.

Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Chairman Ted Cruz and Ranking Member Maria Cantwell, along with Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, pushed for an amendment to the bill to ensure that a new rule instituted after the crash remains in place. The rule requires military aircraft to transmit their locations using a more precise system.

The senators, and others, warned that the NDAA includes a loophole that would permit military aircraft to use a less precise system, like the one that the Black Hawk military helicopter was using on the night of the collision with the American Airlines plane. Their amended language was ultimately not added to the bill.

Later on Wednesday, the Senate unanimously adopted a bipartisan bill to close the loophole, but it still needs to pass the House. GOP Sen. Ted Cruz said he hopes the House will take it up “expeditiously”

Senators expressed concerns about other omissions in the defense policy bill.

Many lawmakers, including Sen. Tammy Duckworth, were dismayed that language to expand coverage of fertility services like in vitro fertilization for service members on TRICARE was absent from the package. Earlier House and Senate versions of the bill contained such language, but it was left out of the final product.

“Health care providers should be able to focus on their patients.
“To ensure the warfighter is fit to fight tonight, the Military Health System needs to operate as efficiently as possible.
Previously, our health care providers renewed their privileges every two years.
Health care providers will also remain subject to the adverse action protocols at the setting in which they are practicing.","The Military Health System recently streamlined the provider-privileging process to allow health care providers to seamlessly transfer their privileges between MHS entities with minimal interruption to patient care duties. This change results in reduced administrative burden and increased patient access.

As of Oct. 15, 2025, health care providers retain their clinical privileges when moving within the enterprise, including across stateside and overseas military hospitals, clinics, and deployed settings.

“Health care providers should be able to focus on their patients. With portable privileges, they can do so more quickly,” said Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of war for Health Affairs.

Provider privileging promotes quality care

Provider privileging is a key component of maintaining the highest quality and safety of care we deliver in the MHS. Clinical privileges define a provider’s scope of practice and are based on factors such as relevant training and experience, current competence, health status, and judgment, and peer and department head recommendations.

Under the previous system, providers were required to complete a privileging action each time they transferred to different care settings, adding additional time to the process before providers could render care. With the expanded policy, when transferring between MHS entities, health care providers sign an attestation for an approved scope of work, eliminating the need for a privileging action or transfer briefing and allowing the provider to focus on patient care.

More effective privileging means accelerated care

Ferrara said that removing obstacles and barriers allows providers to do what they are passionate about — treating patients.

This supports mission readiness by reducing delays in patient care, Ferrara said. “To ensure the warfighter is fit to fight tonight, the Military Health System needs to operate as efficiently as possible. After moving to another facility, this allows our providers to start seeing patients right away instead of waiting weeks or even months to repeat this process.”

Life as a single service member can bring excitement, adventure, and unique stressors. Personal networks of peers, friends, and family members can help single service members cope with the challenges they experience in the course of military service. Such supports can help service members feel connected to life at home, cope with the stress during deployment, and assist with adjustment upon return home. Try using the tips and resources below to strengthen and expand your personal support network.

Benefits of Using a Personal Support Network

People in your personal support network are those whom you care about and trust, and who care about and trust you. Benefits associated with a strong personal support network include:

Less stress, by turning to your support network of friends, family, and peers who can provide practical and emotional support

A stronger sense of belonging, by spending time with people who value and care about you

Greater peace of mind, by knowing that you have people in your life on whom you can depend

More self-confidence, by being a part of someone else's support network to help them cope with similar challenges that you experienced

A strong personal support network can help you build resilience as you progress throughout your military service. Building resilience will make you a stronger, more effective warrior.

Get Involved: Single Service Member Programs

Single service member programs are a great way to develop new friendships and reinforce existing ones. These programs support the overall quality of single service members' lives by identifying common challenges, recommending ways to address these concerns through the chain of command, encouraging and assisting single service members in identifying and planning for recreation and leisure activities, and providing single service members with opportunities to participate in and contribute to their respective communities.

Tips to Strengthen Your Personal Network

Whether you're PCSing to a new duty station, deployed, or preparing for another life transition , now is the best time to strengthen your personal network. Try incorporating the following tips into your relationships with family and friends:

Keep in touch. Call, text, video chat or send emails frequently. Consider joining online networks that your friends and family enjoy. Social media is another way you can communicate with friends and family when you can't call, write, or visit.

Remember special days. Call, text, or send a card on birthdays, anniversaries, holidays and other days that are important to the people in your network. To help you remember these days, fill in a calendar or date book with the important dates. You can also set reminders on your cell phone.

Turn to your friends and family in good times, too. Your friends and family are there for you when times are tough; invite them also to share in your good news!

Surround yourself with positive people. The attitudes and behaviors of others can affect your attitude and behavior, so surrounding yourself with optimistic people may help you to maintain a positive outlook.

Show family and friends they are important to you. Return their calls and messages. Respond to invitations promptly when you are home. Tell them frequently that you appreciate them.

Don't wait for people to tell you that they need support. People may be reluctant to ask for help, especially if they know you have a busy life. If you think a person in your network may need someone to talk to, offer to share your experiences overcoming challenges because you are your friend's biggest support. If you feel a person is in danger of hurting themselves or others, seek help immediately by calling or texting 988 (press 1 for the Military/Veterans Crisis Line) to speak with a trained professional.

Make time for personal get-togethers. Even if you prefer to communicate by phone, text message or email, others may be more willing to open up in a face-to-face conversation. Make time for connecting with friends and family in-person by having a barbecue, attending a sporting event or concert together or going for a long walk.

This change results in reduced administrative burden and increased patient access.

As of Oct. 15, 2025, health care providers retain their clinical privileges when moving within the enterprise, including across stateside and overseas military hospitals, clinics, and deployed settings. “Health care providers should be able to focus on their patients. With portable privileges, they can do so more quickly,” said Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of war for Health Affairs.

Provider privileging promotes quality care

Provider privileging is a key component of maintaining the highest quality and safety of care we deliver in the MHS. Clinical privileges define a provider’s scope of practice and are based on factors such as relevant training and experience, current competence, health status, and judgment, and peer and department head recommendations.

Under the previous system, providers were required to complete a privileging action each time they transferred to different care settings, adding additional time to the process before providers could render care. With the expanded policy, when transferring between MHS entities, health care providers sign an attestation for an approved scope of work, eliminating the need for a privileging action or transfer briefing and allowing the provider to focus on patient care.

More effective privileging means accelerated care

Ferrara said that removing obstacles and barriers allows providers to do what they are passionate about — treating patients.

This supports mission readiness by reducing delays in patient care, Ferrara said. “To ensure the warfighter is fit to fight tonight, the Military Health System needs to operate as efficiently as possible. After moving to another facility, this allows our providers to start seeing patients right away instead of waiting weeks or even months to repeat this process.”

The team took “synthetic data similar to what we see in MHS GENESIS and combined it with readiness policies,” he said. “They then spent three to four days developing a software application to show the value of leveraging DHA data and AI (artificial intelligence) to better understand and support medical readiness.” For Caban, the event offered more than a trophy: He said it served as proof for how data and AI can remove barriers that limit the force’s response speed. “As the agency’s leader for analytics and AI, participating in this event provides exposure to emerging technologies,” Caban said. “It also highlights the incredible talent we have within the agency that we can leverage to apply innovative solutions in support of warfighter readiness.” Leveraging AI to increase workflow productivity and efficiency Team MEDAL took on the challenge of automating aeromedical waiver generation for U.S. Air Force pilots. The scenario was a “known constraint on pilot availability,” said Park. They developed a prototype to “streamline aeromedical waiver processing and readiness,” directly addressing issues of medically clearing pilots in an efficient and timely manner, Park said. Aeromedical waivers can be a critical piece of the readiness puzzle. Before pilots can fly after a disqualifying injury, illness, or new diagnosis, providers must draft an aeromedical waiver, which reviews the airman’s medical history, current condition, and specific occupational requirements. This process can be unnecessarily time-consuming for military providers. “Leveraging AI capabilities, we were able to demonstrate a significant decrease in the time that a doctor would take to process aeromedical waivers,” said Kittrell, referring to a process that commonly ranges anywhere between 30 minutes and multiple days. “Our solution demonstrated the ability to get this down to less than 30 seconds.” The entire prototype development took less than 16 hours of coding during the hackathon, according to Park. “We used a coding platform to stand up the front end, coupled with an MHS GENESIS-compatible backend that we integrated using AI tools.” Creating real-world streamlining solutions Team MEDAL’s success demonstrated DHA’s capability to leverage AI and innovative approaches to improve efficiency, enhance clinical decision-making, and ultimately increase warfighter readiness, according to Dhillon. “This experience allowed us to test readiness-focused use cases, transforming how we approach medical readiness solutions within the DHA,” she said. “We’re excited to continue piloting AI solutions in support of the agency’s mission.” Since the hackathon, the team has continued refining the application using an approved application programming interface and has explored how similar tools could enhance other enterprise-wide initiatives. This example of integrating human and technology operations also aligns to DHA’s FY26 Mission Focused Directive as a combat support agency. The vital work of Team MEDAL demonstrated agility, innovation, and enhanced productivity for military medical readiness, Caban said. “I want to recognize and congratulate the team on their outstanding work and their continued support as we move quickly to mature our data and analytics capabilities in support of the readiness mission,” he added. “They are truly agents of change.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2512/9448437/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-12-17 12:56:32.745332

Medical personnel from Winn Army Community Hospital and Soldiers from across the 3rd Infantry Division enhanced their trauma care proficiency last week during the Rural Interactive Trauma Simulation Course, a hands-on training event designed to reinforce life-saving skills essential to battlefield medicine.

The course, now in its pilot year, is facilitated by the Medical College of Georgia. The program exposes military medical providers to realistic trauma scenarios, particularly those common in remote or resource-limited environments.

Lisa Tyler, nurse educator at Winn Army Community Hospital, said the training directly supports the hospital’s mission of preparing clinicians and warfighters for real-world emergencies.

“These are the people that are going to be taking care of you and your family members out on the battlefield,” Tyler said. “So it’s very important that they get these hands-on skills before they actually need to use them.”

Tyler oversaw 20 participants rotating through stations such as intraosseous access, central lines, pelvic binders, airway management, cricothyrotomy, intubation and chest tube placement. She said the experience is critical to maintaining trauma proficiency for the hospital.

“This is a very crucial part in helping us maintain our trauma designation,” Tyler said.

Winn emergency department noncommissioned officer in charge Sgt. 1st Class Randy Brandt described the training as essential preparation for procedures that are rarely performed but carry significant risk.

“So today we’re running through some trauma training. It is necessary trauma training,” Brandt said. “This is a lot of the stuff that I would consider to be low volume, high risk stuff — the very deep in-depth, bread and butter of what we do, but we don’t do it very often.”

Brandt said training alongside civilian medical partners helps validate military medical standards and build confidence among participants.

“It’s especially good to do it with external agencies, people that we don’t normally work with,” he said. “It just kind of confirms that what we do is right, that these are kind of standard across not just the Army, but the healthcare profession in general.”

For Soldiers operating in austere environments, the course mirrors the realities of battlefield medicine, where advanced equipment and imaging may not be available.

Capt. Jessica Richards, a nurse with 703rd Brigade Support Battalion, said the rural focus of the training makes it particularly relevant for deployed warfighters.

“So obviously, our training today is focused on trauma, especially in the rural setting, which is very applicable to our war fighters, because they are out with very minimal resources,” Richards said. “And so we’re kind of talking about those few things that we can do without all of the technology and imaging that would be helpful to make those decisions, and what we can do in the field to prepare to get them to that level in trauma center.”

As the only nurse in her Role II team, Richards said the course strengthened her ability to support medics and guide care under pressure.

“I’m very grateful to be a part of this training,” Richards said. “I can perform a quick FAST exam in the absence of someone that might be more experienced, and help out with that. Same with having the medics here doing the IOs, doing the central lines, because even though we might not be the ones placing them, we’re going to be the ones caring for them later.”

Richards said the experience also provided valuable perspective on how military and civilian trauma care intersect.

“It’s just really cool to see it from all different points of the people participating in the care, and then obviously to comparing it to our civilian counterparts, where we may be sending soldiers for follow-on care,” she said.

Brandt emphasized that while the procedures practiced during the course may be infrequent, the expectation for excellence remains constant.

“This is exactly what patients come to us for,” Brandt said. “To receive this higher level care.”

Kiggans.","Washington, D.C. — After IVF coverage for military families was stripped from the final version of the National Defense Authorization Act last week, Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (PA-06), Sara Jacobs (CA-51), Rep. Nick LaLota (NY-01) and Rep. Jen Kiggans (VA-02) introduced the Bipartisan IVF for Military Families Act to continue the fight to deliver this much-needed and deserved care for active duty service members and their dependents. This legislation mirrors text that was unanimously adopted on a bipartisan basis by the House Armed Services Committee and passed the House earlier this year.

Rep. Chrissy Houlahan said: “Military families already sacrifice so much in service to our country, and they should not be forced to put their dreams of starting a family on hold because TRICARE fails to cover medically necessary fertility care. Servicemembers should never have to choose between serving their country and building a family. This bipartisan bill recognizes infertility as a real medical condition and ensures servicemembers and their families have access to fertility care without unnecessary barriers. Supporting military readiness means supporting the people who serve.”

Rep. Sara Jacobs said: “Like I said last week, the fight isn’t over. Our military families shouldn’t be denied IVF access just because of politics while bearing the physical and emotional costs of service. Civilian employers are increasingly providing IVF coverage to their employees, and it’s even accessible to every Member of Congress and their staff, but the military is still lagging behind. This is creating an acute readiness and retention crisis because our military families are forced to pay tens of thousands of dollars out-of-pocket for IVF, forgo having children, or leave the military to get private coverage instead. That’s why I’m proud to introduce the Bipartisan IVF for Military Families Act to give our service members every opportunity to build their families.”

“Since 2023, Congress has rightly focused on strengthening military recruitment and retention by increasing troop pay, improving housing, expanding health care, and investing in quality of life for servicemembers and their families. Now, Congress should expand access to IVF, as many civilian employers already do, to build on that progress and help ensure America maintains the most lethal fighting force the world has ever known,” said Rep. Nick LaLota (NY-01).

Read the full article here.

This research addresses a critical gap in understanding treatment pathways for musculoskeletal shoulder conditions—one of the most frequent causes of pain and disability among active-duty service members and veterans. By analyzing longitudinal data from the Military Health System, the team identified patterns in healthcare utilization, including diagnostic imaging, physical therapy, surgical interventions, and medication use.

""Our findings provide a clearer picture of how care is delivered for shoulder disorders in a large, integrated health system. This knowledge is essential for identifying opportunities to improve efficiency and ensure patients receive the right care at the right time,"" said Steven Z. George, PT, PhD, professor in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Duke.

Key Findings:

Shoulder disorders represent a significant burden in military populations, often requiring multi-modal care.

Utilization patterns varied based on diagnosis type, patient demographics, and care setting.

The study highlights opportunities to optimize care delivery, reduce unnecessary interventions, and improve outcomes.

Why It Matters:

Musculoskeletal injuries are among the leading causes of limited duty and medical discharge in the military. Understanding how patients navigate care systems can inform evidence-based guidelines, improve resource allocation, and enhance patient-centered care for both military and civilian populations.

""By examining real-world data from the Military Health System, we can better understand treatment patterns and identify gaps in care. These insights are critical for developing strategies that improve outcomes and reduce unnecessary costs,"" said Maggie E. Horn, PT, DPT, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Duke.

“HR-6703 builds on recent reforms that put patients first and moves us closer to a system where Americans, not Washington, make their own health care decisions.” ###","ARLINGTON, Va. ― Concerned Veterans for America (CVA) today announced its strong support for HR-6703, the Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act, urging members of the U.S. House of Representatives to vote YES ahead of the upcoming floor vote.

Veterans understand the real-world consequences of government-run health care systems that limit choice, delay care, and put bureaucracy ahead of patients. HR-6703 takes meaningful steps to move the American health care system in the opposite direction –toward affordability, flexibility, and personal choice.

“This legislation is a commonsense effort to bring down health care costs and give Americans more control over how and where they receive care,” said John Vick, Executive Director of Concerned Veterans for America. “For veterans, troops, working families, and seniors alike, expanding access to affordable coverage options is long overdue.”

HR-6703 would lower premiums and increase competition by expanding health insurance options, reducing insurer-driven cost inflation, and empowering consumers rather than insurance companies or federal bureaucracies. For veterans navigating private insurance alongside VA community care, for military families relying on TRICARE, and for civilians struggling in the individual market, choice and affordability matter.

Under current federal health care policy, families face skyrocketing premiums, shrinking provider networks, and rising out-of-pocket costs, all while access to timely care continues to decline. Veterans have lived this reality inside the VA system, where lack of competition and rigid structures too often result in delayed or denied care.

“The House has an opportunity to take a clear step toward fixing what’s broken,” Vick added. “HR-6703 builds on recent reforms that put patients first and moves us closer to a system where Americans, not Washington, make their own health care decisions.”

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services should consolidate its scanning contracts to boost its records digitization efforts. That’s one recommendation from the USCIS ombudsman’s latest annual report. It also said USCIS needs to standardize its scanning operations to ensure documents are appropriately tagged with searchable metadata. The report touts how artificial intelligence could help the agency create fully searchable records. USCIS has been on a years-long journey to digitize its records, but it still manages approximately 171 million paper files.

Agencies will soon see a more streamlined process when giving bonuses to their employees. The Office of Personnel Management is transferring the approval process for pay incentives off of its own plate, and instead making it the responsibility of individual agencies. The goal is to make it easier to offer bonuses to employees, and free up time for OPM to focus on other priorities. Despite the process change, OPM said it “does not know” if agencies will actually offer more recruitment or relocation incentives as a result. The final rule implementing the changes comes after OPM first proposed regulations in 2023.

A new “Tech Force” hiring program from the Trump administration seeks to bring more technical expertise into the government’s ranks. The Office of Personnel Management said the new program will recruit 1,000 employees, for two years each, to work on IT modernization projects at various agencies. The new hiring initiative comes after more than 300,000 employees left government this year, due to the Trump administration’s efforts to reduce the workforce.

The future of the Federal Emergency Management Agency is up in the air after a turbulent year. Former FEMA leaders said the agency needs clarity to move forward. Last week, the Trump administration delayed the release of the FEMA Review Council’s recommendations. Speaking at an event on Monday, former FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor said the report was going to serve as a “north star” for the agency. “It was going to offer predictability to FEMA and to the entire emergency management enterprise that we were going to go somewhere transformative. And it hasn't happened, at least not yet. And I guess the biggest takeaway is, without the report, what happens next?” Gaynor said. White House officials canceled a scheduled FEMA Review Council meeting at the last minute on Friday. The council had been scheduled to vote on a draft of its final report.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is exploring workarounds to stricter rules on telework as a reasonable accommodation. CDC supervisors have instructed staff to email their medical documentation directly to Lynda Chapman, the agency’s chief operating officer, to “bypass” the traditional reasonable accommodation system. Chapman will decide if employees are eligible for 30 days of telework as an interim accommodation. Two CDC employees told Federal News Network that Chapman is only approving interim telework in a few circumstances, including recovery from surgery, pregnancy or chemotherapy.

Naval Hospital Okinawa, Japan Comm: 011-81-971-7024 DSN: (315) 646-7024 isaac.s.savitz.civ@health.mil","CAMP FOSTER, Japan — Providing health care to the nearly 55,000-person beneficiary population and the 188,768-person Western Pacific-eligible referral population in Okinawa presents unique challenges.

One challenge for an overseas medical treatment facility (MTF) is staffing medical specialties that may not see the same workload or complexity of cases as stateside MTFs.

The Defense Health Agency (DHA) and Navy Medicine have devised a creative solution by rotating neurosurgeons at U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa. Each provider spends about four months in Okinawa, providing critical, life-saving care.

Dr. Michael Lawless, a visiting neurosurgeon from Naval Medical Center San Diego, decided to proactively seek out cases. Because Okinawa has fewer causes of major trauma, such as high-speed roads and firearms, the daily caseload can be light. Lawless brought relief to many patients who were hesitant about undergoing traditional spinal surgery.

Spinal surgeries can have varied results, sometimes leading to more pain, long recovery times, and severe side effects. Lawless introduced another option for patients: a minimally invasive endoscopic procedure. This is becoming a routine procedure that relieves pinched-nerve sciatica resulting from spinal decompression.

The endoscope allows the physician to be more precise than in a more invasive open surgery. The department already has an endoscope, so there is little to no extra cost. The surgery also provided additional training for the hospital corpsman assigned to neurosurgery. HM3 Alyssa Clayton was able to scrub in and assist Dr. Lawless during the procedure.

The minimally invasive procedure allows rotating neurosurgeons to maintain a steady workload of two to three cases a week. It provides relief for patients suffering from sciatic nerve pain and allows for a dramatically quick recovery. One patient rated their pain as zero out of 10 while in the recovery room. This approach enables people to return to work much faster and keeps costs down by avoiding off-island medical evacuations.

While at the hospital, Lawless performed the first endoscopic laminectomy on the island. A laminectomy is a surgical procedure that removes a portion of the bony roof of the spine, called the lamina, to relieve pressure on the spinal cord or nerves. The patient had an excellent result with immediate relief of leg pain and did not require any narcotic pain medication.

This surgery has the same benefits as an endoscopic microdiscectomy: smaller incisions, less trauma to muscle and soft tissues resulting in less postoperative pain, and fewer complications and infections. This allows the procedure to be performed in an outpatient setting so patients can go home the same day.

According to a recent randomized controlled study in the British Medical Journal, endoscopic spine surgery was more cost-effective and provided better pain relief than traditional open surgery for sciatica, even one year after surgery. The study noted that the endoscopic approach resulted in savings of over $3,000 in direct health care costs and indirect lost productivity costs at one year after surgery.

A recent survey of elite athletes in the journal World Neurosurgery found an 81 percent return-to-play rate at 5.2 to 8.7 months after traditional open and tubular minimally invasive surgery. In contrast, endoscopic spine surgery produced an average 88 percent return-to-play rate at three months.

Creative staffing and innovative thinking allow patients at U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa to benefit from a less invasive surgery that relieves their pain, while allowing visiting doctors to maintain their surgical skills. It is a win for all involved and another way the people who make up the Defense Health Agency maintain a medically ready force by being a ready medical force.

The U.S. Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command Okinawa (USNMRTCO) supports the Defense Health Agency's U.S. Naval Hospital, Okinawa (USNHO) as the largest OCONUS Navy Medicine medical treatment facility and stands at the ready to respond to contingency operations to support the INDOPACOM region. It is a critical regional asset for direct care delivery, regional referrals, and medical contingency operations. The staff of USNHO understands their vital role as pre-positioned, forward-deployed naval forces within the first island chain, aligned and in support of the joint military commands and operations.

Joseph Ignatius Martin joined the U.S. Army in 1918, he began a military career that spanned 37 years, becoming one of the most influential leaders in military medicine. In 1958, the Martin Army Community Hospital, an iconic 10-story structure known as “the Old Hospital” in Fort Benning, Georgia, was dedicated in his honor.

Through his dedicated service during World War II in North Africa and Italy, and as an educator for the next generation of military medical leaders, Martin transformed how the U.S. Army trains its medical forces and treats its wounded on the battlefield — and the hospital honors these accomplishments through delivery of award-winning health care today.

Early focus on education, global service

Born Feb. 1, 1894, in Chicago, he earned his medical degree from the Chicago Medical College of the University of Illinois in 1918. That same year, he entered the U.S. Army Medical Corps Reserve as a first lieutenant, according to documents provided by the Army Medical Corps.

Early postings took him from Fort Riley, Kansas, to Camp Grant, Illinois, where he worked as a ward surgeon during the U.S. Army’s demobilization after World War I. He served overseas at Sternberg General Hospital in Manila, Philippines, building clinical and leadership experience that would later prove invaluable.

A lifelong student, Martin took every opportunity to learn while graduating from the Army Medical School, the Medical Field Service School, the Infantry School, the Command and General Staff College, and the Army War College.

Educating future military medical force

In 1940, Martin was assigned to design and build the Medical Department Replacement Training Center at Camp Grant, Illinois. His work shaped wartime training that prepared doctors, nurses, and medics for global conflict.

In August 1946, he became deputy commandant and, later, commandant of the Medical Field Service School at Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, Texas. During his six-year tenure, he transformed the curriculum, introducing new comprehensive programs in field medicine, leadership, and combat casualty care that became benchmarks for modern medical readiness.

As noted in The Military Surgeon, the journal of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States, Martin said, “At our schools, we aim to pass on to the younger group of medical officers that same torch of responsibility, with the hope that if World War III comes, the medical department will have in its ranks medical officers who are trained and capable of acting competently as medical leaders in the field.”

Medical innovation in peacetime and on the battlefield

He believed the military medical system should continually seek ways to enhance readiness, stating in The Military Surgeon, “We must continue to prepare ourselves by keeping abreast of technical developments for waging war … the specialty of military field medicine is not gained in a week or a year but requires a foundation of formal education and long experience to master.”

Martin’s work in field medicine improving evacuation procedures, sanitation controls, and mobile hospitals in combat conditions are “reflected in our modern system of training, management and employment of medical personnel, units and installations in peace and in war,” stated in an Aero Medical Association publication provided by provided by the Army Medical Corps.

International deployments on his rise to military medical leader

In 1943, he deployed to North Africa as chief surgeon of the Fifth Army, leading medical operations across campaigns in North Africa and Italy, according to his biography provided by the Office of the U.S. Army Surgeon General.

In July 1945, he was transferred to the Pacific to become chief surgeon of Army Forces Western Pacific, with headquarters at Manila, Philippines. For his leadership and innovation during wartime, he was promoted to brigadier general in 1944 and major general in 1949.

As chief surgeon of Allied Forces Pacific in Tokyo, he directed large-scale disease control efforts during postwar typhus epidemics, preventing what could have been “one of the world’s largest medical catastrophes,” according to a biography written by Army 1st Lt. George Kauffman in 1967.

In 1953, Martin was appointed surgeon of U.S. Army, Europe, overseeing postwar hospital operations, preventive medicine, and troop health programs that supported American forces across the continent.

Colleagues described his leadership and vision as innovative. “He developed many of the medical practices that became, and have remained, standard procedures for our Army Medical Service,” noted a 1955 profile in Military Medicine, a publication of the Aero Medical Association.

Legacy carries on at MACH with quality patient care

Among his many honors and decorations are the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the French Croix de Guerre, the Order of the British Empire, the Italian Order of the Crown, and numerous other awards in recognition of his long and distinguished service worldwide.

After retiring in November 1955, Martin settled in Santa Rosa, California, where he died on April 13, 1957. He was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery.

In 2014, the “Old Hospital” was replaced by 500-million-dollar facility with sustainable features and cutting- edge technology, still carrying the name of the military medical pioneer.

MACH continues to honor Martin’s namesake through quality, safe patient care. In 2024 and 2025, the hospital earned an “A” grade for hospital safety by the Leapfrog Group, an independent organization that focuses on health care quality.

“Health care providers should be able to focus on their patients.
“To ensure the warfighter is fit to fight tonight, the Military Health System needs to operate as efficiently as possible.
Previously, our health care providers renewed their privileges every two years.
Health care providers will also remain subject to the adverse action protocols at the setting in which they are practicing.","The Military Health System recently streamlined the provider-privileging process to allow health care providers to seamlessly transfer their privileges between MHS entities with minimal interruption to patient care duties. This change results in reduced administrative burden and increased patient access.

As of Oct. 15, 2025, health care providers retain their clinical privileges when moving within the enterprise, including across stateside and overseas military hospitals, clinics, and deployed settings.

“Health care providers should be able to focus on their patients. With portable privileges, they can do so more quickly,” said Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of war for Health Affairs.

Provider privileging promotes quality care

Provider privileging is a key component of maintaining the highest quality and safety of care we deliver in the MHS. Clinical privileges define a provider’s scope of practice and are based on factors such as relevant training and experience, current competence, health status, and judgment, and peer and department head recommendations.

Under the previous system, providers were required to complete a privileging action each time they transferred to different care settings, adding additional time to the process before providers could render care. With the expanded policy, when transferring between MHS entities, health care providers sign an attestation for an approved scope of work, eliminating the need for a privileging action or transfer briefing and allowing the provider to focus on patient care.

More effective privileging means accelerated care

Ferrara said that removing obstacles and barriers allows providers to do what they are passionate about — treating patients.

This supports mission readiness by reducing delays in patient care, Ferrara said. “To ensure the warfighter is fit to fight tonight, the Military Health System needs to operate as efficiently as possible. After moving to another facility, this allows our providers to start seeing patients right away instead of waiting weeks or even months to repeat this process.”

“Enterprise-wide privileging is just one of many efforts to make the Military Health System more agile. Previously, our health care providers renewed their privileges every two years. With this expanded policy, we have extended the renewal window to three years to reduce their administrative load,” said Ferrara.

The rigorous process of acquiring privileges remains the same, and there are no changes about the quality assurance of the credentialing standards for health care providers. Health care providers will also remain subject to the adverse action protocols at the setting in which they are practicing.

The new policy spearheads faster, more flexible operations as the MHS remains committed to excellence in care by enabling a ready medical force.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2502/8888359/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-12-16 16:56:55.874466

He could see multiple attempts and I could describe my attempts. For contraindications I could point those out so he didn't have to go searching through my record.

Bottom line: make it so easy for your doctor they're glad to help you.

Here's the Tricare prior authorization form from April 2025. Make sure you skip over questions when it says to! (For instance, #3 is only for 12-17 year olds.)

There may be a newer PA, or one specific to your plan, but this at least gives you an idea of what you might be dealing with.

You might also confirm with Tricare who is eligible to prescribe. They might require an in network provider.

I do! Your PCM will have to put through a prior authorization to express scripts, but as long as they have all the info they need it’s usually a quick process. I’ve had palpitation issues which was noted in my chart, so my doc checked the box that I had a contraindication to trying the cheaper weight loss meds (stimulants). They didn’t ask for anything further and my prior auth was approved the next day. I’m not sure how it works with Tricare as a secondary though. I’ve always been told your primary insurance would be billed first and then Tricare would pick up the remainder of the tab (not entirely sure of the nuances with that).

I have Prime and got it approved. I am on meds for hypothyroid as well, since 2018. My bmi was like 28 or something so I assume that is how I got the approval. I don't have high blood pressure or diabetes or sleep apnea so he wouldn't have indicated that. He did put me on phentermine for 6 months prior to this, and it worked for a bit but then it stopped working. Maybe that helped?",,N,-1.0,2025-12-16 22:56:52.723892

A copy of the letter can be found below or by clicking here.

Dear Lieutenant General Brady,

I am writing to request immediate and comprehensive action regarding the deeply disturbing allegations involving Major McGraw, a former Army physician in Texas. The reports indicating widespread misconduct toward service members and military families raise profound concerns about clinical oversight, command accountability, and the integrity of the military health system.

These accusations do not reflect isolated lapses; they point to potential long-term failures. Because the alleged conduct may have occurred over an extended period and across multiple duty stations, it is imperative that any review extends far beyond a routine internal inquiry.

I urge you to ensure that the Department of War initiates an independent, thorough investigation into both Major McGraw’s actions and the Army’s handling of prior complaints or warning signs. This review must safeguard patient privacy, protect potential victims, and evaluate whether pathways for reporting medical misconduct were available and effective.

In addition, I request that the Department of War Office of Inspector General promptly examine how clinical, command, and Defense Health Agency oversight structures failed to identify and intervene in this case. A transparent assessment of systemic shortcomings, and actionable recommendations to strengthen standards of care and accountability will be essential to restoring trust within the military community.

To support the Department’s review and to ensure transparency for those affected, I request answers to the following questions:

Will the Department ensure a comprehensive investigation into all allegations involving Major McGraw, including an assessment of the Army command climate, supervisory actions, and compliance with applicable medical and reporting policies at each installation where he served?

What trauma-informed resources, victim assistance programs, and behavioral health services will the Department and the Army make available to former patients and their families during the investigative process?

Has the Department notified the Texas Medical Board or other relevant state licensing authorities of Major McGraw’s suspension and the ongoing criminal investigation? If not, when will such notification occur?

Will the Department commit to identifying any systemic or oversight failures that enabled this alleged misconduct, and provide a plan for implementing corrective actions to prevent similar breakdowns in the future?

Will the Department review oversight, supervision, and reporting requirements within Defense Health Agency Graduate Medical Education programs to ensure trainees are appropriately monitored and patient safety is protected?

Will the Department review the conduct and reporting actions of medical supervisors and personnel who worked with Major McGraw to determine whether they fulfilled their obligations under Army and DoW policy?

What policies, reporting pathways, and oversight mechanisms will the Department and the DoW Inspector General review to ensure that patients who experience misconduct by military medical providers can report concerns safely and with confidence that their complaints will be addressed.

The men and women served by the military health system deserve confidence that their care is provided in an environment that prioritizes safety, accountability, and professionalism. I appreciate your attention to this urgent matter and request to be kept informed of the Department’s findings and next steps.",https://www.texasgopvote.com/sites/default/files/health-care_24.jpg,N,-1.0,2025-12-16 16:57:01.787979

A Clear Answer with Practical Context So, do the US Armed Forces cover mental health treatment programs?","Mental health care has become an essential part of readiness, resilience, and long-term well-being for active duty service members, veterans, and their families. As awareness grows around conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, substance use disorders, and traumatic brain injury, a common and important question continues to surface: Do the US Armed Forces cover mental health treatment programs?

The short answer is yes. The US military provides coverage for a wide range of mental and behavioral health services through TRICARE, the health care program serving uniformed service members, retirees, and eligible dependents. Coverage includes outpatient therapy, inpatient treatment, substance use disorder care, and increasingly, technology-enabled behavioral health services. However, understanding how coverage works, which programs qualify, and how to access the right level of care can be complex. This is where program placement support and medical technology-driven navigation tools play an important role.

In this article, Medigy explores how military mental health coverage works, what types of treatment programs are available, how behavioral health programs for military members are evolving through medical technology, and how TriCareRehabs offers program placement support to help individuals and families make informed decisions.

Understanding TRICARE and Mental Health Coverage

TRICARE functions as a comprehensive health care system designed to meet the unique demands of military life. Mental and behavioral health services are considered a core benefit, not an optional add-on. This reflects a growing institutional recognition that psychological health is directly tied to operational effectiveness and long-term quality of life.

Coverage applies across several TRICARE plans, including TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, TRICARE Reserve Select, and TRICARE for Life. While plan details vary, all include benefits for mental health assessment, diagnosis, and treatment when care is deemed medically necessary.

Importantly, TRICARE does not restrict coverage only to combat-related conditions. Service members and beneficiaries can receive care for mood disorders, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, sleep disturbances, family and relationship stress, and other behavioral health concerns that affect daily functioning.

What Types of Mental Health Treatment Programs Are Covered?

TRICARE coverage extends across a continuum of care, allowing treatment to be matched to clinical need rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all approach. Outpatient therapy is often the first point of care and includes individual counseling, family therapy, and group therapy delivered by licensed professionals. Psychiatric services for medication management are also included.

For individuals requiring a higher level of support, intensive outpatient programs and partial hospitalization programs may be covered when clinically appropriate. These programs provide structured therapy while allowing individuals to maintain some aspects of daily life, an option that can be particularly important for active duty members balancing service obligations.

Inpatient mental health and residential treatment programs are covered when symptoms are severe, pose a safety risk, or have not responded to lower levels of care. Substance use disorder treatment, including medical detoxification and rehabilitation, is also included under TRICARE’s behavioral health benefits.

Coverage decisions are guided by clinical criteria rather than diagnosis alone. This emphasis on medical necessity aligns with evidence-based care standards and helps ensure that treatment intensity matches individual need.

Behavioral Health Programs for Military Members and Unique Care Considerations

Behavioral health programs for military members differ in meaningful ways from civilian programs. Military culture, exposure to trauma, frequent relocations, and the demands of service create distinct clinical and logistical challenges. Effective programs integrate an understanding of military identity, command structures, and confidentiality concerns into treatment planning.

Many military-focused programs incorporate trauma-informed care models designed to address combat stress, moral injury, and cumulative operational strain. Family systems are often included in treatment, recognizing the impact of military life on spouses and children.

Technology has become a critical tool in bridging access gaps for behavioral health programs for military members. Telebehavioral health platforms now allow service members in remote locations or on tight schedules to connect with licensed clinicians securely. These platforms often integrate symptom tracking, digital assessments, and care coordination features that enhance continuity of care.

Medical technology also supports outcomes measurement, enabling providers and payers to evaluate treatment effectiveness over time. This data-driven approach aligns with TRICARE’s focus on value-based care and continuous quality improvement.

How Authorization and Referrals Work Under TRICARE

While mental health coverage is broad, accessing care often requires navigating authorization and referral processes. Active duty service members typically need a referral from a primary care manager for specialty mental health services, except in emergencies. This process ensures coordination with command requirements and readiness considerations.

Family members and retirees generally have more flexibility to self-refer, depending on their TRICARE plan. However, certain higher levels of care, such as inpatient treatment, usually require prior authorization to confirm medical necessity and network eligibility.

This administrative layer can feel overwhelming, particularly during times of crisis. Understanding plan-specific requirements, documentation standards, and network rules is essential to avoiding delays in care. Program placement support services can help interpret these requirements and align treatment options with TRICARE coverage parameters.

The Role of Medical Technology in Accessing Care

Medical technology has reshaped how military-affiliated individuals access mental health treatment. Secure telehealth platforms have expanded reach to underserved areas, reduced wait times, and minimized stigma by allowing private, at-home sessions. For active-duty members, this flexibility can be crucial when in-person appointments conflict with training or deployment schedules.

Digital intake tools and electronic health records streamline information sharing between providers, improving care coordination and reducing redundant assessments. Some programs now use artificial intelligence-driven screening tools to identify risk patterns, support early intervention, and personalize treatment recommendations.

Wearable devices and mobile health applications are increasingly used to monitor sleep, stress, and physiological indicators associated with mental health conditions. While these tools do not replace clinical care, they provide valuable data that can inform treatment planning and relapse prevention strategies.

From a systems perspective, medical technology supports TRICARE’s goal of delivering consistent, high-quality behavioral health care across diverse geographic regions and care settings.

Why Program Placement Support Matters

Despite comprehensive coverage, finding the right mental health or substance use treatment program can be challenging. Not all facilities accept TRICARE, and not all programs are equally equipped to address military-specific needs. Matching clinical requirements, personal preferences, location constraints, and insurance eligibility requires specialized knowledge.

This is where TriCareRehabs offers program placement support as a navigation resource rather than a treatment provider. Placement support focuses on understanding an individual’s clinical needs, verifying TRICARE acceptance, and identifying appropriate levels of care within qualified programs.

For families unfamiliar with the behavioral health system, this guidance can reduce confusion and emotional burden during a vulnerable time. Program placement support also helps ensure that referrals align with evidence-based practices and continuity of care principles, increasing the likelihood of positive outcomes.

Common Questions About Military Mental Health Coverage

Many service members and families wonder whether seeking mental health treatment will negatively impact a military career. While certain conditions and treatments may require temporary duty limitations, the Department of Defense has made significant efforts to reduce stigma and encourage early care. Seeking help is increasingly recognized as a strength and a proactive step toward readiness.

Another frequent question involves confidentiality. Mental health care under TRICARE follows strict privacy standards, though specific disclosures may be required in limited circumstances related to safety or fitness for duty. Providers experienced in working with military populations can explain these boundaries clearly.

There is also concern about continuity of care during relocations. Medical technology, telehealth, and standardized electronic records have improved the ability to maintain treatment relationships or transition smoothly between providers when permanent change of station orders occur.

The Future of Behavioral Health Care for the Military

The landscape of military mental health care continues to evolve. Policy changes, research advancements, and technology innovations are driving more integrated, personalized, and accessible care models. Behavioral health programs for military members are increasingly blending in-person treatment with digital tools to support long-term recovery and resilience.

TRICARE’s ongoing investment in telebehavioral health, outcomes measurement, and provider network expansion reflects a broader shift toward proactive mental health management. Program placement support services are likely to become even more important as treatment options diversify and care pathways grow more complex.

In this environment, clarity and guidance matter. Understanding what is covered, how to access care, and which programs are best suited to individual needs empowers service members and families to seek help without unnecessary barriers.

A Clear Answer with Practical Context

So, do the US Armed Forces cover mental health treatment programs? Yes, they do, through a comprehensive TRICARE benefit that spans outpatient care, intensive treatment, inpatient services, and technology-enabled behavioral health solutions. Coverage is designed to meet clinical needs while supporting readiness and long-term well-being.

At the same time, navigating this system requires informed decision-making. Medical technology plays a growing role in expanding access and improving care coordination, while placement support services help translate coverage into real-world treatment options. When TriCareRehabs offers program placement support, it reflects a broader effort to ensure that coverage leads to timely, appropriate, and effective care.",https://medigy.com/news/contributed-content/b7041c94-6584-55c5-9e20-8f29cd0481f5-featuredImage.jpeg,N,0.0,2025-12-16 12:57:01.436838

The move of the Defense Health Agency from Falls Church, Virginia, could bring as many 3,300 jobs to San Antonio, according to the daily. However, it’s still unclear which parts of the mission may relocate and how many people ultimately might relocate.

The Express-News based its reporting on a letter from members of the city’s congressional delegation to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth along with “recent moves at City Hall.”

The city’s attempts to woo the Defense Health Agency comes as Hegseth has begun pulling two military commands out of San Antonio, including some 1,100 staffers, the Express-News reports. Air Force plans to beef up the cybersecurity operation at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland also appear to have stalled out under the current defense chief.

Both the city and county are ponying up cash to win the Defense Health Agency, the Express-News reports. Each has budgeted $10 million to modernize an existing structure at Fort Sam Houston to house the unit, and each has also requested an additional $5 million in state grants to cover the costs.

Christine Dunn talks on McGraw complaints filed

The complaint says these women are victims of McGraw who were sexually abused or non-consensually videotaped by McGraw during appointments at the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center (CRDAMC) in Fort Hood and the Tripler Medical Center in Hawaii.

Six of the Jane Does in the complaint were treated at the CRDAMC and one was treated during McGraw's time at Tripler Medical Center in Hawaii.

In the release, the administrative complaints filed on Monday allege that the Army is liable for McGraw's actions under the FTCA because, ""it was negligent in hiring, supervising, and retianing McGraw. They also allege that the Army lacked adequate protocols to keep patients safe from sexual abuse.""

The complaints allege McGraw sexually violated the women by video recording them without consent and performing unnecessary medical exams that involved groping their genitals or breasts.

The alleged abuse occurred while the women were in vulnerable states, including while pregnant, after giving birth or in the ICU.

The complaints also claim McGraw frequently ignored standard medical guidelines, such as conducting exams without a medical chaperone present and refusing to allow patients to undress for exams in privacy.

""My clients went to this doctor expecting to be well cared for. They thought they could trust a U.S. Army doctor, but we now understand that the doctor abused that trust in the most egregious way,"" said Christine Dunn, the law firm's DC Co-Managing Partner.

The FTCA allows individuals to bring legal claims against federal agencies for wrongdoing by their employees. Before filing a lawsuit in court, individuals must first file administrative complaints with the agency, which then has at least six months to investigate.

The complaints allege the Army is liable for McGraw's actions because it was negligent in hiring, supervising and retaining him. They also claim the Army lacked adequate protocols to protect patients from sexual abuse.

""The Army had a duty to take reasonable measures to protect patients in its care. To the extent that Dr. McGraw was able to abuse so many patients, it is compelling evidence that the Army was negligent in supervising him,"" Dunn said.

Attorneys at Sanford Heisler Sharp McKnight would like to have the opportunity to help you.","FORT HOOD, Texas, Dec. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Attorneys at Sanford Heisler Sharp McKnight (""Sanford Heisler”) today filed Federal Tort Claims Act (""FTCA”) administrative complaints against the United States Department of the Army, the Defense Health Agency, and the Department of Defense (collectively ""the Army”) on behalf of seven Jane Does (Jane Does 1-7), all of whom were sexually abused or non-consensually videotaped by Army doctor Blaine McGraw during medical appointments at the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center (""Darnall Medical Center”) in Fort Hood, Texas and Tripler Army Medical Center in Honolulu, Hawaii (""Tripler Medical Center”). McGraw is currently facing numerous criminal charges for secretly recording dozens of female patients.

All Jane Does are represented in the matter by Christine Dunn, Sanford Heisler’s DC Co-Managing Partner and Co-Chair of the firm’s Sexual Violence, Title IX, and Victims’ Rights Practice Group, as well as Jillian Seymour, Associate, and Alison Hagani, Litigation Fellow.

The FTCA is a federal statute that permits individuals to bring legal claims against federal agencies for torts committed by their employees. Prior to filing an FTCA complaint in court, the individual must first file an administrative complaint with the agency at fault. The agency is then afforded at least six months to investigate the claim. After that, the individual may file a lawsuit against the agency in federal court.

Today, Sanford Heisler took the first step in the FTCA legal process by filing administrative complaints against the Army on behalf of Jane Does 1-7. All seven women are former patients of McGraw, who treated Jane Does 1-6 at Darnall Medical Center and Jane Doe 7 at Tripler Medical Center. The complaints allege that McGraw, an Army OBGYN, sexually violated Jane Does 1-7 by video recording them without their consent and/or performing unnecessary medical exams that involved McGraw groping their genitals or breasts. The complaints further allege that McGraw committed this sexual misconduct while the Jane Does were in especially vulnerable states, including while they were pregnant, had just given birth, or were in the ICU. The complaints also assert that McGraw frequently flouted standard medical guidelines, such as conducting exams without a medical chaperone present and refusing to allow the Jane Does to undress for exams in privacy. Although McGraw committed this sexual misconduct under the guise of medical necessity, the complaints allege that there was no medical need for him to have engaged in this behavior.

The administrative complaints filed today allege that the Army is liable for McGraw’s actions under the FTCA because it was negligent in hiring, supervising, and retaining McGraw. They also allege that the Army lacked adequate protocols to keep patients safe from sexual abuse.

On December 9, Army military prosecutors announced numerous criminal charges against McGraw, including 54 counts of indecent visual recording and five counts of conduct unbecoming an officer. The Army has previously stated in an official statement that Army leaders suspended McGraw and opened an investigation of him ""within hours” after a patient complaint was reported in October 2025. However, news reports have reported allegations that at least one patient had complained about McGraw at Tripler Medical Center, where he was stationed prior to his Fort Hood assignment until 2023. This week, in response to growing concerns that the Army was aware of McGraw’s misconduct prior to October 2025, over 50 United States congressmembers have sent a letter to the Pentagon’s Office of Inspector General to investigate reports that Army leaders refused to investigate complaints against McGraw, including during his employment at Tripler Medical Center.

""My clients went to this doctor expecting to be well cared for. They thought they could trust a U.S. Army doctor, but we now understand that the doctor abused that trust in the most egregious way,” said Dunn. ""The Army had a duty to take reasonable measures to protect patients in its care. To the extent that Dr. McGraw was able to abuse so many patients, it is compelling evidence that the Army was negligent in supervising him. Our servicemembers and their families deserve better and the Army must be held accountable.”

Sanford Heisler has extensive experience representing victims of sexual misconduct against the military. Attorney Christine Dunn currently represents 45 victims of Major Michael Stockin, a former Army doctor who was recently convicted of sexually abusing dozens of patients during medical exams at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Tacoma, Washington. The firm has filed FTCA complaints on behalf of these victims in an attempt to hold the Army accountable for negligently supervising Dr. Stockin. Attorney Dunn also represents more than two dozen former cadets in their FTCA claims against the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. The firm’s work on behalf of these former cadets is the first known collective action against a United States service academy involving claims of sexual abuse.

Svan,,,,,https://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2025-12-15/delays-medical-appointments-overseas-report-20098431.html,"The report also found that personnel working in military medical clinics and hospitals overseas experienced burnout and low morale and were at risk of decreased readiness.
Auditors highlighted several shortcomings, including wait times for medical appointments that exceed the federal and Defense Department guidelines, the IG said.
Medical personnel told the team that clinics were not always fully staffed, particularly with nurses, who receive and prioritize messages that patients send to providers.
Moreover, the agency did not have a process to identify why some civilian medical personnel left for other employment, auditors said.
Though DHA agreed with the recommendations, auditors said they were still awaiting specific actions on how the agency plans to make a comprehensive review of staffing at overseas military treatment facilities.","The average wait for urgent medical appointments at U.S. military bases outside the continental United States was as long as three weeks in some locations and even longer for routine appointments in 2024, a Pentagon watchdog agency said in a new report.

Treatment delays that service members and their families face while stationed outside the United States increased the risk for negative outcomes and preventable complications and decreased patient satisfaction, according to a Defense Department Office of Inspector General audit published last week.

The report also found that personnel working in military medical clinics and hospitals overseas experienced burnout and low morale and were at risk of decreased readiness.

The agency reviewed 15 out of 79 military treatment facilities in overseas locations as well as Hawaii and Alaska, looking at 2024 data and conducting employee interviews.

The evaluation sought to assess how effectively the Defense Health Agency was managing care for its overseas patients, following the agency’s transition in 2022 to assuming full control of the Pentagon’s health care system.

Auditors highlighted several shortcomings, including wait times for medical appointments that exceed the federal and Defense Department guidelines, the IG said.

Between February and July 2024, service members and their families faced delays in access to care ranging on average from 1.2 days to 21.1 days for urgent appointments and from 7.2 days to 36.8 days for future routine appointments, the report said.

Federal and DOD guidance requires the military health care system to see patients within 24 hours for urgent appointments and seven days for routine care, according to the inspector general report.

While the guidelines allow for patients to be referred to a Tricare-approved civilian provider within the allotted time frame, finding care outside the military network overseas can be challenging due to language barriers, cultural differences and denial of U.S. health insurance claims, the report said.

DHA’s management of staffing at overseas locations is one area that needs to be improved to reduce appointment delays, the audit team determined.

Medical personnel told the team that clinics were not always fully staffed, particularly with nurses, who receive and prioritize messages that patients send to providers.

They also said that they had difficulty managing the volume of messages received from the online patient portal and that sometimes messages could be missed, putting patient safety at risk.

At one clinic, for example, providers did not see a prescription refill message and the patient did not follow up with another request. As a result, the patient did not take prescribed antidepressant medication for two to three weeks, according to the report.

At another military treatment facility, personnel said shortages in medical technicians led to canceled ultrasound appointments, delaying follow-on medical care and leading to an increased risk of preventable complications, according to the report.

Staffing data also showed shortages in personnel, according to the report. In September 2024, for example, one facility had only 27 of the 36 civilian personnel and 27 of the 37 contractors that it was authorized.

Another facility lost more than half its primary care clinic active-duty doctors between 2019 and 2024 and saw a 20% decrease in active-duty technicians, medics and licensed nurses, while patient workload remained steady, according to the report.

Hiring civilian staff, meanwhile, isn’t always an option due to funding and lengthy hiring timelines, personnel told auditors.

In 2024, DHA left some civilian vacancies unfilled because of budgetary constraints, and the average total days to hire in some locations ranged from 155 to 213 days, the report said.

Moreover, the agency did not have a process to identify why some civilian medical personnel left for other employment, auditors said.

To address staffing issues, the inspector general team recommended that the DHA director track data on why personnel are leaving military treatment facilities, review authorized staffing at its overseas locations, track support staff availability and better balance its workforce.

Though DHA agreed with the recommendations, auditors said they were still awaiting specific actions on how the agency plans to make a comprehensive review of staffing at overseas military treatment facilities.

The inspector general issued 11 recommendations in total, including directing DHA to issue finalized guidance to its personnel and better manage data discrepancies reported to the team.",https://www.stripes.com/incoming/ecvmvf-161225dhaphoto02.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/161225DHAphoto02.jpg,N,-1.0,2025-12-15 11:56:30.711796
