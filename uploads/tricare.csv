Until lawmakers pass a funding bill, families and individuals who depend on federal programs face growing financial stress and uncertainty about when relief will come.","As Congress fails to pass spending bills for 2026, thousands of military families and student veterans are caught in limbo as essential services halt or slow across the nation.

By M.J. Cameron

On Oct. 1, the U.S. government shut down for the first time since Dec. 22, 2018. Congress failed to enact the 12 bills for fiscal year 2026 that make up the spending budget before the midnight deadline on Sept. 30.

Each year, Congress is required to pass bills to approve funding for government agencies and organizations. If the bills aren’t passed on time, lawmakers can pass a short-term fix called a continuing resolution to provide temporary spending bills that allow federal operations to continue until final appropriations are enacted according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

When there is no funding bill or continuing resolution, the government shuts down due to a lack of approved funding.

Serving Arizona’s fourth congressional district, Rep. Greg Stanton said that many agencies must stop or reduce the essential services they provide, and furlough employees until the end of the shutdown. Other essential employees in agencies must keep working without pay until funding is passed.

Under federal law, however, employees who are furloughed or required to work during a shutdown must be paid after it ends for the time the government was closed.

What does this mean for military families?

Active-duty personnel are considered essential; therefore, they must continue their duties without pay. Military families aren’t just worried about paychecks, but the resources and programs they rely on for support according to the National Military Family Association,

The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) may run out of remaining funding quickly, leaving families without food assistance. People receiving health care through Tricare on the base may be affected as there are no protections for routine medical care. Those receiving civilian healthcare with Tricare shouldn’t be affected.

College students may be affected as well. Active-duty, veterans and dependents receiving higher education typically use education benefits such as Chapter 35 for survivors and dependents, post-9/11 GI Bill and the Montgomery GI Bill.

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has stated that benefits will continue to be processed and delivered. Students new to using their benefits, switching schools or changing programs may face delays in payments. Hotlines for education assistance are closed until further notice, leaving students unsure.

As the shutdown continues, millions of military families and students wait for Congress to reach an agreement. Until lawmakers pass a funding bill, families and individuals who depend on federal programs face growing financial stress and uncertainty about when relief will come.

While the end of the shutdown is unknown, families could start accessing what bills to prioritize.",https://thetacomaledger.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/cropped-ledgerLogo-32x32.jpg,N,0.0,2025-10-20 11:19:54.547719

PRESS RELEASE: CMB.TECH trading update

Cylembio plus pembrolizumab achieved a clinically relevant 19.4 months median progression free survival (mPFS) compared to 11.0 months mPFS with pembrolizumab alone; study narrowly missed progression free survival (PFS) primary endpoint for statistical significance

Improvement in PFS favored the combination across virtually all subgroups, notably in patients with PD-L1-negative tumors, BRAF V600 -mutated tumors, and elevated LDH, without adding any systemic toxicity compared to pembrolizumab alone

Final data from the Phase 2 basket trial in lung and head & neck cancers also presented

NEW YORK, Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IO Biotech (Nasdaq: IOBT), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel, immune-modulatory, off-the-shelf therapeutic cancer vaccines, today presented detailed results from its global Phase 3 trial (IOB-013/KN-D18) of Cylembio ® (imsapepimut and etimupepimut, adjuvanted), in combination with Merck’s (known as MSD outside the United States and Canada) anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab), for the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic (advanced) melanoma. The data, presented as a proffered paper at the Melanoma and other skin tumors session of the 2025 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress in Berlin, expand upon topline results reported in August 2025.

Final results from the Phase 2 basket trial (IOB-022/KN-D38) evaluating Cylembio in combination with pembrolizumab in the first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN) were also presented.

“The Phase 3 results in advanced melanoma, together with final data from our Phase 2 basket trial, continue to build on the encouraging clinical evidence seen with Cylembio in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy,” said Mai-Britt Zocca, PhD, president and chief executive officer of IO Biotech. “These data reinforce Cylembio’s potential to serve as a first-line treatment option across multiple tumor types, and we remain committed to advancing novel immune-modulatory vaccines that may help people living with cancer.”

In the randomized Phase 3 trial, 407 patients with previously untreated advanced melanoma received either Cylembio plus pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab alone. Median progression-free survival was 19.4 months for the combination and 11.0 months for pembrolizumab (hazard ratio [HR] 0.77; 95% CI, 0.58–1.00; p=0.0558), narrowly missing the primary endpoint prespecified threshold for statistical significance (p≤0.045).

Across virtually all subgroups, outcomes in progression-free survival consistently favored the combination regimen, including among patients with PD-L1–negative tumors (16.6 vs 3.0 months; HR 0.54; 95% CI, 0.35-0.85), BRAF V600 mutated tumors (HR 0.60; 95% CI, 0.40-0.90), and elevated LDH (HR 0.60; 95% CI, 0.39-0.92). In addition, a post-hoc analysis, excluding patients previously treated with anti-PD-1 therapy in neoadjuvant or adjuvant settings, showed mPFS of 24.8 months vs 11.0 months (HR 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56–0.98).

The combination was well tolerated, with no increase in immune-mediated adverse events (34.0% vs 38.4%) or grade ≥3 treatment-related events (14.5% vs 15.6%) compared to pembrolizumab alone. Local vaccine-related injection-site reactions, reported in 56% of patients in the exploratory arm, were generally mild and transient, mostly grade 1/2. IDO1- and PD-L1–specific T-cell responses were expanded in the vaccine arm versus the pembrolizumab arm, reinforcing the therapy’s proposed immune-modulatory mechanism.

“Despite the narrow miss on statistical significance, I am encouraged by the clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival observed with IO102-IO103 plus pembrolizumab. The consistency of findings across subgroups, together with the manageable safety profile and convenient administration, supports continued exploration of IO102-IO103 as a potential option for patients. I am particularly excited about the encouraging outcomes seen in patients with PD-L1–negative tumors across multiple endpoints,” said Jessica Hassel, MD, Professor at the Department of Dermatology and National Center for Tumor Diseases at the University Hospital Heidelberg, Germany, and lead enrolling investigator for the Phase 3 trial.

Phase 2 Basket Trial in NSCLC and SCCHN

Also presented at ESMO were final data from the Phase 2 basket trial (IOB-022/KN-D38), evaluating Cylembio in combination with pembrolizumab as first-line treatment for patients with NSCLC (PD-L1 TPS ≥50%) or SCCHN (PD-L1 CPS ≥20).

Among 49 efficacy-evaluable patients (31 with NSCLC and 18 with SCCHN), mPFS was 8.1 months at 21.4 months of follow-up in NSCLC and 7.0 months at 18 months of follow-up in SCCHN, with durable responses and encouraging 18-month overall survival (OS) rates. The combination’s safety profile remained consistent with anti–PD-1 monotherapy, with no new safety signals.

The UAE launch of the FX Super One will take place on October 28 at the Armani Hotel, Burj Khalifa, Dubai.

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF.

“Welcome to the 25 th issue of our Weekly Report. We are starting with the EAI Flywheel.

Today we are excited to announce a major production and delivery milestone for FX Super One. On S2-S4 Product & Technology, Supply Chain, Production, and Delivery FX has officially signed the procurement agreement for the first batch of complete parts for the FX Super One with its supply chain partners, and shipment is about to begin. The whole team is now in full sprint mode for the year-end off-line target for our first FX Super One vehicle. This marks a key milestone for FX, from R&D and design to prototype development, pilot validation, and eventually the potential for mass production, subject to securing necessary agreements, funding and permitting. This marks a critical leap from technical validation and prototype development to mass production and delivery. This milestone carries significant meaning:

Accelerated Production: FX Super One will officially move to pilot build and initial production, laying the foundation for the first vehicle off-line at year-end, and building experience for large-scale delivery.

Engineering Validation: Once the parts arrive, vehicle engineering validation, functional testing, and homologation will start, generating real data to support potential mass production and continuous improvement.

Closer to Market Delivery: This step brings us closer to user delivery and marks the strategy of our Co-Creation Ecosystem Online Direct Sales Model.

Government Affairs Support: It also provides solid data and a business justification for ongoing tariff exemption or reduction negotiation.

Localization Advancement: More U.S.-based R&D, engineering changes, and component upgrades will enhance product competitiveness, and help ensure compliance with the U.S. ICTS requirements. Although higher localization standards increase both costs and lead times, this investment is essential to deliver products that meet U.S. market and compliance standards.

Next, we will speed up our logistics and supply chain efforts to ensure the timely arrival of this batch of parts at our Hanford factory. The whole team is now in full sprint mode for the year-end off-line target for our first FX Super One vehicle. We are also empowering FX Super One with much of the core technologies of our $300,000 FF 91, bringing Ultimate AI TechLuxury to a broader audience and targeting to make this “Blue Ocean + Blockbuster” product the first mass-produced model under the Global Automotive Industry Bridge Strategy.

In the mid- to long-term, this milestone not only validates the effectiveness of our Light 4, Swift 4, Focused 5, and Empowering 5 model, it also provides a replicable foundation for potential FX’s future mass production programs, including the FX 4 concept. This also marks the first time that the globalized value of China’s supply chain has been realized locally in the U.S. through FX.

Moving on to S5 Capital:

We’ve officially kicked off the Q3 financial reporting process right on schedule. Both listed entities under the Dual Flywheel structure have now entered their regular quarterly preparation cycles, and we’re confident about delivering the reports on time as planned.

On S6 Middle East:

The Middle East Final Launch of the FX Super One will take place on October 28 at the Armani Hotel, Burj Khalifa, Dubai. From California to the Gulf, the first-class EAI-MPV is ready to make its debut. We warmly invite everyone to join and co-create this moment together.

Coming back to S7 System Build-Up:

After years of experience as a U.S.-listed company, FF has gradually built a mature operational management system. We are providing transition services to Qualigen to assist with building a solid, compliance-ready operating framework that meets public company standards. The team is making good progress on this.

On the Crypto Flywheel:

This week, the listed company QLGN kicked off its implementation and execution of its three core business engines. We will share more progress in the following weekly reports.

Finally, our issues, reflections, and solutions over the week:

As the Dual Flywheel Strategy deepens across regions and verticals, we are establishing a new strategic and business incubation system. This initiative could not only enhance coordination and execution efficiency but also enable faster incubation of high-potential businesses — reshaping our value creation model for the future. Guided by our “Light 4, Swift 4, Focused 5, and Empowering 5” methodology, we are confident in driving dual breakthroughs in both operational efficiency and long-term value creation.

We will share a piece of good news on the FF FX Auto Finance Company next week. With the Dual Flywheel Strategy accelerating on all fronts, a composite ecosystem of Technology × Product × Finance × Co-Creation is rapidly taking shape. Together, let’s continue to push boundaries and embrace the next breakthroughs. See you next week!”

Cylembio plus pembrolizumab achieved a clinically relevant 19.4 months median progression free survival (mPFS) compared to 11.0 months mPFS with pembrolizumab alone; study narrowly missed progression free survival (PFS) primary endpoint for statistical significance

Improvement in PFS favored the combination across virtually all subgroups, notably in patients with PD-L1-negative tumors, BRAF V600 -mutated tumors, and elevated LDH, without adding any systemic toxicity compared to pembrolizumab alone

Final data from the Phase 2 basket trial in lung and head & neck cancers also presented

NEW YORK, Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IO Biotech (Nasdaq: IOBT), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel, immune-modulatory, off-the-shelf therapeutic cancer vaccines, today presented detailed results from its global Phase 3 trial (IOB-013/KN-D18) of Cylembio ® (imsapepimut and etimupepimut, adjuvanted), in combination with Merck’s (known as MSD outside the United States and Canada) anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab), for the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic (advanced) melanoma. The data, presented as a proffered paper at the Melanoma and other skin tumors session of the 2025 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress in Berlin, expand upon topline results reported in August 2025.

Final results from the Phase 2 basket trial (IOB-022/KN-D38) evaluating Cylembio in combination with pembrolizumab in the first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN) were also presented.

“The Phase 3 results in advanced melanoma, together with final data from our Phase 2 basket trial, continue to build on the encouraging clinical evidence seen with Cylembio in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy,” said Mai-Britt Zocca, PhD, president and chief executive officer of IO Biotech. “These data reinforce Cylembio’s potential to serve as a first-line treatment option across multiple tumor types, and we remain committed to advancing novel immune-modulatory vaccines that may help people living with cancer.”

In the randomized Phase 3 trial, 407 patients with previously untreated advanced melanoma received either Cylembio plus pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab alone. Median progression-free survival was 19.4 months for the combination and 11.0 months for pembrolizumab (hazard ratio [HR] 0.77; 95% CI, 0.58–1.00; p=0.0558), narrowly missing the primary endpoint prespecified threshold for statistical significance (p≤0.045).

Across virtually all subgroups, outcomes in progression-free survival consistently favored the combination regimen, including among patients with PD-L1–negative tumors (16.6 vs 3.0 months; HR 0.54; 95% CI, 0.35-0.85), BRAF V600 mutated tumors (HR 0.60; 95% CI, 0.40-0.90), and elevated LDH (HR 0.60; 95% CI, 0.39-0.92). In addition, a post-hoc analysis, excluding patients previously treated with anti-PD-1 therapy in neoadjuvant or adjuvant settings, showed mPFS of 24.8 months vs 11.0 months (HR 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56–0.98).

The combination was well tolerated, with no increase in immune-mediated adverse events (34.0% vs 38.4%) or grade ≥3 treatment-related events (14.5% vs 15.6%) compared to pembrolizumab alone. Local vaccine-related injection-site reactions, reported in 56% of patients in the exploratory arm, were generally mild and transient, mostly grade 1/2. IDO1- and PD-L1–specific T-cell responses were expanded in the vaccine arm versus the pembrolizumab arm, reinforcing the therapy’s proposed immune-modulatory mechanism.

“Despite the narrow miss on statistical significance, I am encouraged by the clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival observed with IO102-IO103 plus pembrolizumab. The consistency of findings across subgroups, together with the manageable safety profile and convenient administration, supports continued exploration of IO102-IO103 as a potential option for patients. I am particularly excited about the encouraging outcomes seen in patients with PD-L1–negative tumors across multiple endpoints,” said Jessica Hassel, MD, Professor at the Department of Dermatology and National Center for Tumor Diseases at the University Hospital Heidelberg, Germany, and lead enrolling investigator for the Phase 3 trial.

Phase 2 Basket Trial in NSCLC and SCCHN

Also presented at ESMO were final data from the Phase 2 basket trial (IOB-022/KN-D38), evaluating Cylembio in combination with pembrolizumab as first-line treatment for patients with NSCLC (PD-L1 TPS ≥50%) or SCCHN (PD-L1 CPS ≥20).

Among 49 efficacy-evaluable patients (31 with NSCLC and 18 with SCCHN), mPFS was 8.1 months at 21.4 months of follow-up in NSCLC and 7.0 months at 18 months of follow-up in SCCHN, with durable responses and encouraging 18-month overall survival (OS) rates. The combination’s safety profile remained consistent with anti–PD-1 monotherapy, with no new safety signals.

The UAE launch of the FX Super One will take place on October 28 at the Armani Hotel, Burj Khalifa, Dubai.

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF.

“Welcome to the 25 th issue of our Weekly Report. We are starting with the EAI Flywheel.

Today we are excited to announce a major production and delivery milestone for FX Super One. On S2-S4 Product & Technology, Supply Chain, Production, and Delivery FX has officially signed the procurement agreement for the first batch of complete parts for the FX Super One with its supply chain partners, and shipment is about to begin. The whole team is now in full sprint mode for the year-end off-line target for our first FX Super One vehicle. This marks a key milestone for FX, from R&D and design to prototype development, pilot validation, and eventually the potential for mass production, subject to securing necessary agreements, funding and permitting. This marks a critical leap from technical validation and prototype development to mass production and delivery. This milestone carries significant meaning:

Accelerated Production: FX Super One will officially move to pilot build and initial production, laying the foundation for the first vehicle off-line at year-end, and building experience for large-scale delivery.

Engineering Validation: Once the parts arrive, vehicle engineering validation, functional testing, and homologation will start, generating real data to support potential mass production and continuous improvement.

Closer to Market Delivery: This step brings us closer to user delivery and marks the strategy of our Co-Creation Ecosystem Online Direct Sales Model.

Government Affairs Support: It also provides solid data and a business justification for ongoing tariff exemption or reduction negotiation.

Localization Advancement: More U.S.-based R&D, engineering changes, and component upgrades will enhance product competitiveness, and help ensure compliance with the U.S. ICTS requirements. Although higher localization standards increase both costs and lead times, this investment is essential to deliver products that meet U.S. market and compliance standards.

Next, we will speed up our logistics and supply chain efforts to ensure the timely arrival of this batch of parts at our Hanford factory. The whole team is now in full sprint mode for the year-end off-line target for our first FX Super One vehicle. We are also empowering FX Super One with much of the core technologies of our $300,000 FF 91, bringing Ultimate AI TechLuxury to a broader audience and targeting to make this “Blue Ocean + Blockbuster” product the first mass-produced model under the Global Automotive Industry Bridge Strategy.

In the mid- to long-term, this milestone not only validates the effectiveness of our Light 4, Swift 4, Focused 5, and Empowering 5 model, it also provides a replicable foundation for potential FX’s future mass production programs, including the FX 4 concept. This also marks the first time that the globalized value of China’s supply chain has been realized locally in the U.S. through FX.

Moving on to S5 Capital:

We’ve officially kicked off the Q3 financial reporting process right on schedule. Both listed entities under the Dual Flywheel structure have now entered their regular quarterly preparation cycles, and we’re confident about delivering the reports on time as planned.

On S6 Middle East:

The Middle East Final Launch of the FX Super One will take place on October 28 at the Armani Hotel, Burj Khalifa, Dubai. From California to the Gulf, the first-class EAI-MPV is ready to make its debut. We warmly invite everyone to join and co-create this moment together.

Coming back to S7 System Build-Up:

After years of experience as a U.S.-listed company, FF has gradually built a mature operational management system. We are providing transition services to Qualigen to assist with building a solid, compliance-ready operating framework that meets public company standards. The team is making good progress on this.

On the Crypto Flywheel:

This week, the listed company QLGN kicked off its implementation and execution of its three core business engines. We will share more progress in the following weekly reports.

Finally, our issues, reflections, and solutions over the week:

As the Dual Flywheel Strategy deepens across regions and verticals, we are establishing a new strategic and business incubation system. This initiative could not only enhance coordination and execution efficiency but also enable faster incubation of high-potential businesses — reshaping our value creation model for the future. Guided by our “Light 4, Swift 4, Focused 5, and Empowering 5” methodology, we are confident in driving dual breakthroughs in both operational efficiency and long-term value creation.

We will share a piece of good news on the FF FX Auto Finance Company next week. With the Dual Flywheel Strategy accelerating on all fronts, a composite ecosystem of Technology × Product × Finance × Co-Creation is rapidly taking shape. Together, let’s continue to push boundaries and embrace the next breakthroughs. See you next week!”

,,2025-10-19 11:51:40+00:00,MSNBC.com,Trump's IVF announcement disappoints everyone – even his own supporters,Susan Rinkunas,,,,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-ivf-conservatives-health-care-insurance-rcna238151,"“Under the Trump administration, we are going to be paying for that treatment,” he told NBC News.
Once in office, Trump signed an executive order in February directing aides to submit within 90 days “a list of policy recommendations on protecting IVF access and aggressively reducing out-of-pocket and health plan costs for IVF treatment.” The 90-day deadline came and went.
In August, officials admitted to The Washington Post that the administration had no plans to require insurance coverage of IVF but that it would work to lower costs.
That means any cost savings from IVF drugs could be eaten up by increasing monthly premiums — if people can afford to purchase health insurance at all.
Even though Trump’s plan doesn’t mandate IVF coverage, anti-abortion leaders were not pleased.","During the 2024 presidential campaign, President Donald Trump claimed he would make in vitro fertilization free for people in the U.S. His official plan, laid out Thursday, should be a wake-up call for anyone who still believed he’d follow through. Instead, the president’s plan primarily focuses on somewhat reducing the cost of IVF — at the same time that the administration is pursuing policies that will increase what people pay for health insurance.

Starting in August 2024 — only after Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee — Trump began claiming on the campaign trail that he would make IVF free if he won. “Under the Trump administration, we are going to be paying for that treatment,” he told NBC News. At a Michigan event a day later, he claimed: “Your government will pay for — or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for — all costs associated with IVF treatment.”

Any cost savings from IVF drugs could be eaten up by increasing monthly premiums.

Once in office, Trump signed an executive order in February directing aides to submit within 90 days “a list of policy recommendations on protecting IVF access and aggressively reducing out-of-pocket and health plan costs for IVF treatment.” The 90-day deadline came and went. In August, officials admitted to The Washington Post that the administration had no plans to require insurance coverage of IVF but that it would work to lower costs.

On Thursday, the White House announced that the administration will issue guidance to encourage more employers to cover IVF and that it had negotiated with one drug manufacturer and two specialty pharmacies, CVS Specialty and Express Scripts, to lower costs of prescription fertility drugs used in IVF.

To be clear, the guidance does not make insurers cover IVF. Instead, as Sen. Elizabeth Warren put it, the White House’s idea is to “politely ask companies to add IVF coverage out of the goodness of their own hearts — with zero federal investment and no requirement for them to follow through.” And while 60% of people under 65 have insurance through their jobs, that leaves the remaining 40% who either have public coverage, buy their own plans or go without insurance.

And while getting lower prices for some IVF medications is certainly a good thing, it won’t make the treatment affordable for most people who pay out of pocket for fertility services. That’s because drugs are not the main source of IVF costs, which can run about $15,000 to $20,000 per cycle and include lab visits, genetic testing and an embryo transfer procedure. Per the White House’s own fact sheet, the prescription drugs needed to complete the process make up about 20% of that cost. The administration suggested that, with new discounts, people could save up to $2,200 on the drugs per cycle, but that would still leave people with bills of more than $10,000.

“The Federal government has the power to meaningfully improve IVF access, but the recommendations it announced [Thursday] are not nearly enough,” said Center for Reproductive Rights President Nancy Northup in a statement. Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, told The New York Times: “I think it is a whole lot less than he promised in the campaign.”

To make matters worse, Trump announced this plan on Day 16 of a government shutdown, in which a central issue is Republicans’ refusal to extend enhanced subsidies for people who buy their own insurance on the Obamacare marketplace. That means any cost savings from IVF drugs could be eaten up by increasing monthly premiums — if people can afford to purchase health insurance at all.

Even though Trump’s plan doesn’t mandate IVF coverage, anti-abortion leaders were not pleased.

And insurance costs are expected to increase even for people with other kinds of health plans, thanks to the GOP budget law that passed this summer. The bill is designed to kick millions of people off Medicaid, which will result in hospitals taking on more “uncompensated care.” Health policy experts warn that hospitals will raise their rates as a result, and that will increase costs for everyone across the country.

If Trump wanted to require insurers to cover IVF, he could back a bill sponsored by Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., a combat veteran who welcomed two children through IVF. Her Right to IVF Act would create a right to access fertility services, including IVF, and would require employer-sponsored plans and public insurance including Medicaid and military TRICARE plans to cover the treatments. Republicans blocked Duckworth’s bill twice in 2024.

Instead, Thursday’s announcement was another example of Trump trying to appease voters who supported him on a pledge to lower costs while also attempting to mollify religious conservatives who strongly oppose abortion and IVF. But even though Trump’s plan doesn’t mandate coverage, anti-abortion leaders were not pleased. Many in that movement oppose IVF because they believe life begins at fertilization and the treatment involves the creation of multiple embryos, genetic testing and routine destruction and storage.

Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life, wrote on social media, “I’m thankful there’s no new healthcare mandate forcing coverage for the destructive IVF industry, but IVF, as it’s practiced, still destroys countless humans in the embryonic stage.” Hawkins said it was the “second disappointment in two weeks from his team,” referring to the FDA’s approval of a new generic version of the abortion drug mifepristone. Live Action founder Lila Rose was more critical, claiming after Trump’s announcement that “IVF kills more babies than abortion — millions of embryos are frozen, discarded, or destroyed.”

At a press conference Thursday, Trump claimed to be unaware of anti-abortion opposition to IVF. “I’m just looking to do something because, you know, pro-life,” he said. “I think this is very pro-life. You can’t get more pro-life than this.”

It’s worth remembering that Trump only took up the IVF issue during the 2024 campaign after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that IVF embryos can be considered children for the purposes of wrongful death lawsuits. Trump had repeatedly bragged about nominating three of the Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade, but that ruling allowed states and judges (like in Alabama) to define life as beginning at fertilization, limiting access to fertility treatments. Trump didn’t want to be associated with those consequences, so he criticized the ruling — and once Harris entered the race, he made his wild promises. Some voters believed him.

And now here we are with a plan that falls far short of his pledges, barely makes a dent in affordability, and has still angered conservatives. As is so often the case with Trump, everyone loses while he claims victory.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251017-trump-ivf-announcement-zz-01-7c638d.jpg",N,-1.0,2025-10-20 07:17:05.578750

In the last couple years, some families have become real professionals at getting the latest untested treatment that holds promise, triggering a debate that pits medical ethics against a mother's love for a suffering child.

When Penny Lopez, 25,learned that two of her three young children had Sanfilippo Syndrome -- a rare genetic disease that would lead to mental decline and certain death before adulthood, doctors told Lopez that ""there is no treatment, no cure for it.""

""They gave us no hope,"" said Lopez, of Lakewood, Wash.

But Lopez refused to listen. First she found a doctor at Duke University who was developing stem cell treatments.

Her 5-year-old daughter Hannah could not be helped, but Duke researchers were hopeful that the treatment could slow the disease in her 1-year-old son, Aiden.

Although her military health care, TriWest HeathCare, twice denied the $700,000 treatment plan, Lopez did not give up. She called up local news stations with her story and got a congressman to write a letter of appeal.

Finally, TRICARE agreed to use a part of the contract allotted for rare diseases to approve the stem cell transplant. The Lopez family and TRICARE were willing to risk the 30 percent chance that Aiden would not make it though the entire treatment.

Lopez might seem alone in her work, but several families this year have used savvy public relations campaigns, appeals from powerful people and old fashioned negotiation to get expensive, untested treatments for their dying loved ones despite debates from doctors and regulators about whether this trend is a good idea.

Last week, the Thompson family of Virginia Beach gained national attention in The New York Times for their fight to win access to a $100,000 a year drug called Iplex for Lou Gehrig's disease.

Chris Hempel of Reno, Nev., waged a two-year, full-time public relations, networking and research campaign at finding a new drug for her 5-year-old twins Addison and Cassidy.

The Hempel twins suffer from a rare, degenerative and genetic disorder called Niemann-Pick Type C. Like Lopez, Hempel was faced with few options to treat her children. So, like Lopez, she looked up the latest research and found a treatment that was neither covered by her insurance nor tested by the U.S. Food and Drug administration.

After appearances on national television shows, and several written appeals to the government, Hempel won a compassionate use designation from the FDA to try infusions of a compound used in cholesterol free foods called cyclodextrin.

""In our disease we don't have the time to wait for a new drug. We have to find things that are sitting on a shelf,"" Hempel told ABCNews.com in April.

For people like Lopez and Hempel, there is no question about the importance of fighting for new treatments that might help their children.",https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/default-img-16x9.png,N,0.0,2025-10-18 11:59:42.342204
