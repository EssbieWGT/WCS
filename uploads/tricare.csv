Blaine McGraw.

The policy, rolled out in December 2025 and announced publicly this month, marks a direct response to the McGraw case, in which the Army doctor faces 54 counts of indecent visual recording involving 44 women at Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center and Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii.

What Changed

Under the new policy, staff at all military treatment facilities worldwide must now proactively offer chaperones for any sensitive examination. Previously, facilities were only required to accommodate patient requests for chaperones — placing the burden on patients to ask for protection.

""Having chaperones available is a crucial part of patient-centered care,"" said Dr. Paul Cordts, DHA Deputy Assistant Director for Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer. ""Chaperones can help protect both patients and health care staff.""

The policy defines chaperones as ""an impartial third party and a safeguard for patients and staff"" who will ""immediately report any suspected inappropriate conduct.""

Lawsuit Alleges Systematic Failures

But according to a civil lawsuit filed in Bell County on Dec. 10th, 2025, by 82 women, the damage from the old policy was already done.

The petition alleges McGraw ""routinely altered and falsified records...recording the presence of chaperones who, in fact, were never in the room.""

The petition argues that ""the Army's chaperone policy at Darnall Army Medical Center...placed the burden of protection on the very women least equipped to insist on safeguards"" — particularly military spouses, dependents, and junior soldiers who felt intimidated by a male field-grade officer.

Many women requested chaperones but were denied by McGraw, according to the petition.

Shield of Sisters and the Cobos Law Firm brought four survivors to Capitol Hill, pushing Congress to go further than the DHA policy by making chaperones mandatory — not optional.

""We think that chaperones should be mandatory. It should not be optional, nor should it be up to the discretion of the individual who is receiving care,"" said attorney Andrew Cobos, who represents the 82 women suing McGraw.

Cobos argued that mandatory chaperones would not only protect patients but also save taxpayer money by preventing costly federal lawsuits.

""We have seen multiple instances — the Michael Stockton case, this case, the Nassar case — where the federal government has been sued for legitimate reasons for their failure to provide oversight, and that has cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars,"" Cobos said.

Three Legislative Proposals

The advocates introduced three pieces of legislation during their meetings with House representatives, senators, and the Democratic Women's Caucus:

Mandatory chaperones during sensitive medical examinations

Expanded definition of military sexual trauma (MST) to include family members and Department of Defense civilians

Commander accountability for ""quiet PCSing"" — the practice of transferring problem service members without resolving issues internally

""They were saying, 'We thought we'd fixed this with Vanessa Guillen and we thought we did this right,'"" said Shannon Hough, founder and CEO of Shield of Sisters. ""And we told them there's nothing you can do until we start holding commanders and perpetrators accountable just like we would on the civilian side.""

The Transfer That Wasn't Stopped

The lawsuit alleges that McGraw transferred from Tripler to Fort Hood after a patient complained he improperly recorded her pelvic exam on his personal cell phone.

""Rather than investigate or meaningfully restrict his practice, McGraw's chain of command dismissed the complaint, minimized her allegations, and permitted him to continue treating women with little or no supervision,"" the petition states.

The lawsuit calls this a ""systemic military and leadership failure — not an isolated incident.""

Bipartisan Support

Hough said the response from lawmakers was overwhelmingly positive and bipartisan.

""It's so encouraging that they're saying this is not a partisan issue, this is a human issue,"" Hough said.

Lawmakers were shocked to learn the scope of military sexual trauma, Hough said.

""You would not believe how many of them don't know that it's one in three women, that it is such a huge issue. It's a systemic problem and it's an endemic problem,"" Hough said. ""The public needs to know how bad this problem is.""

According to the advocates, more than 56,000 survivors are currently waiting for compensation exams from the Department of Veterans Affairs.

What the New Policy Means for Patients

Under the new DHA policy:

Staff must offer chaperones before any sensitive exam (examinations involving genitalia, rectum, or female breasts)

Patients can request chaperones when scheduling appointments or during visits

Staff will make ""reasonable efforts"" to provide a chaperone of the preferred gender

If a chaperone isn't available, patients can reschedule

Chaperones can be physicians, nurses, medics, technicians, or other qualified staff

The policy applies to all military hospitals and clinics worldwide

Patients with questions or concerns should contact their facility's patient advocate.

The policy may be waived in emergency situations.

Where the Case Stands

McGraw, 47, remains in pretrial confinement at the Bell County Jail. He faces four charges and 61 specifications, with alleged offenses occurring between January 1 and December 1, 2025.

Cobos said his firm has filed a motion for default judgment against McGraw after he failed to respond to the civil lawsuit. They've also submitted Federal Tort Claims Act cases seeking compensation from the federal government, but must wait six months for the Army to respond.

'We're Not Done'

Hough emphasized that the fight extends far beyond the McGraw case.

""We're not done in DC. There's gonna be many more trips. We're not done in Fort Hood or Tripler,"" Hough said. ""We're not done until the last person says, 'I'm the last one who was assaulted in the military,' and that's gonna take a lot.""",https://media.kcentv.com/assets/KCEN/images/79db87a3-6f03-4367-adfa-c1e3fa4c92c0/20251211T123515/79db87a3-6f03-4367-adfa-c1e3fa4c92c0_1140x641.jpg,N,-1.0,2026-01-20 00:56:30.259624

That's if you want to be able to present more to her as to how it would be beneficial for him to have Tricare as well (honestly not sure why you wouldn't, but that's just my personal thoughts)

Also to add, I'm almost positive that now that you're under prime (I'm new to prime, i've always had select) you have to go through the referral process to continue using your same providers, because prime typically has to be seen by their on post provider.

The child can have 2 insurances. Not sure of the circumstances of them having Medicaid or if theyd be able to maintain that. Thats something the bio mom & your husband need to navigate. But the providers as well as a Triicare need to be informed of dual insurance. Medicaid would be filed 1st & Tricare would pick up second to them. Also, if Tricare finds out there's a different primary insurance & claims aren't filed accordingly, yall could be on the hook, financially. So, get it taken care of sooner than later.

I’m sorry you’re getting so much incorrect info here.

Medicaid is one of the few situations where Tricare is first payer. https://tricare.mil/Plans/OHI

Your stepson’s doctors will need to know he has Tricare. Does he live near a military installation? If so, will his mom be willing to switch his doctors if needed and take him on base?

It might make more sense in this situation to have him on Select. The rest of your can be on Prime if you like.",,N,0.0,2026-01-19 06:56:35.839601

Navigating the Current Climate

Be Selective with Agencies: Focus on agencies that are more stable or considered mission-critical. ""Yes. Just be selective. Look at the non-negotiable agencies, like DoD and VA.""

Consider the Political Climate: Some Redditors advise avoiding federal jobs under certain administrations due to instability and emotional toll. ""Do not work for this administration. The emotional tax is crushing""

Persistence Pays Off: Even during hiring freezes, some jobs are still available. ""My FJO somehow has not been rescinded, I scour USAJobs daily in case something pops up and can apply as a plan B.""

Mastering the Application Process

A well-crafted application and strong interview skills are crucial for securing a federal job.

Good Resume and Interview Skills: Ensure your resume is well-formatted and you can excel in interviews. ""What works best is: 1. Good formatted resume 2. Good interview skills 3. Apply Apply Apply""

Career Progression Strategies

Once you're in, there are several ways to advance your career within the federal system.

Seek Ladder Positions: These jobs allow you to progress through different GS levels without reapplying. ""I’m a GS 7 with a ladder to a GS 9""

Gain Experience and Certifications: Continuous learning and skill development are key. ""I got here with solely a combo of experience and IT certifications.""

Networking: Building connections can open doors to new opportunities. ""Best of all get to know people, network and always be positive when dealing with others""

Degrees and Experience

You can get a federal job with or without a degree, depending on your approach.

Degrees Open Doors: Pursuing a degree can make it easier to enter federal service. ""If you want to open doors in federal positions, you need to pursue a degree.""

Experience Can Substitute: Many federal jobs value experience over education. ""Most federal jobs do not require a degree.""

Start Low and Climb: It's possible to start in a lower-grade position and work your way up. ""Started at GS6 0343 and five years later I am a non supervisory GS13""

You can have the court house wedding right now and then have the fancy wedding later if you both truly love each other and want to get married, that way you both will have the coverage. My friend and her husband (now ex-husband) got married at the courthouse before his deployment and then had the fancy wedding when he got back.

Courthouse wedding.

Eat the costs which will be 6 figures.

Abortion.

You made an adult choice to have unprotected sex, time to have the corresponding adult discussion. Do whatever right means to you but make those choices sooner than later, legitimately in the next two weeks.

FTR they don’t give a fuck about a ring. Just that piece of paper. If gf wants a “real” wedding, just file the official paperwork and be married on paper then have a wedding later. Or look into your state’s Medicaid. They often cover unwed pregnant women.

You done messed up a-a-ron.

Seriously though go ahead and get married at the courthouse. Yall will lose the cost of a wedding to medical bills otherwise. Put that in savings to have the full deal when yall are ready.

Yeah you’re right Tricare won’t cover her until y’all are married. But will cover from the date you get her registered in DEERS as your dependent and she gets her ID card. As for baby, once born, you’ll have 90 days to register baby with DEERS and Tricare and they’ll be covered under you.

You can explain that the courthouse wedding will be done now and then yall can have a big ceremony/reception later. Very common in the service.

Go to the courthouse, do the paperwork and get legally married.

Have a wedding later if that's what she wants.

Hell you don't even have to tell anyone you're married yet if she doesn't want to.

I became a preacher online and did a wedding for a friend on his porch a few months ago, he didn't feel like having a wedding so we did it there. Quick and easy",,N,-1.0,2026-01-17 16:56:18.821284

Having passed the Senate, SB 2018, SB 2016, and SB 2019 now head to the House of Representatives for further consideration.","In a pivotal move for both military service members and the state’s tourism sector, the Mississippi Senate passed two groundbreaking pieces of legislation in the third week of January 2026. These bills, SB 2018 and SB 2016, mark an aggressive start to the 2026 legislative session, with far-reaching implications for Mississippi’s National Guard and tourism industry, while also setting a course for broader economic revitalization. The state has set a bold precedent by focusing on both military readiness and economic infrastructure, signaling a significant policy shift.

What are SB 2018 and SB 2016?

SB 2018, titled the Mississippi National Guard TRICARE Premium Reimbursement Program, is designed to make healthcare effectively free for traditional Guardsmen by reimbursing their monthly insurance premiums. This bill, authored by Senator Jeff Tate of Meridian, aims to provide active-duty Mississippi National Guard members with reimbursement for their TRICARE Reserve Select health care plans. This initiative is aimed not only at expressing gratitude for the service of Guardsmen but also at bolstering recruitment and retention within the state’s military ranks.

SB 2016, the Mississippi Tourism Reorganization Act, creates a new standalone Mississippi Department of Tourism, separating it from the Mississippi Development Authority (MDA). This restructuring is intended to enhance the tourism sector’s efficiency, responsiveness, and competitiveness, reflecting the fourth-largest industry in the state. With a focus on streamlined operations, the legislation aims to increase tourism-related revenue, strengthen marketing efforts, and attract new visitors to Mississippi. Furthermore, the bill ensures the creation of a dedicated Tourism Advertising Fund sourced from sales tax revenues from restaurants and hotels.

Both pieces of legislation reflect Mississippi’s ongoing efforts to address its economic needs while supporting its military personnel.

When and Why Did These Bills Pass?

The Mississippi Senate passed SB 2018 and SB 2016 during the third week of January 2026, signaling the state’s proactive approach as it moves into the new legislative year. These two bills represent an urgent response to long-standing issues of military healthcare accessibility and tourism sector inefficiency. By addressing the military healthcare issue, the state aims to ensure that Guardsmen are medically ready, which is vital for the security of both Mississippi and the nation.

Simultaneously, the reorganization of Mississippi’s tourism efforts is a move to capitalize on the growing potential of the state’s tourism industry. Advocates believe that creating a dedicated department will eliminate bureaucratic layers that have historically hindered the sector’s growth. The state’s tourism industry, fueled by a $18.1 billion impact in 2024, stands to benefit significantly from this legislative overhaul.

Who Will Be Affected by These Bills?

The passing of SB 2018 will directly benefit members of the Mississippi National Guard. The bill targets “traditional” Guardsmen, who work in the private sector without employer-sponsored health benefits, ensuring they have access to free healthcare coverage under TRICARE Reserve Select. As long as Guardsmen meet eligibility criteria such as being an actively drilling member and not being covered by another employer’s insurance, they will receive full reimbursement for their monthly insurance premiums.

Meanwhile, the creation of the Mississippi Department of Tourism under SB 2016 will affect tourism stakeholders across the state, from hoteliers to restaurant owners, as well as workers in the hospitality industry. The restructuring will ensure a more targeted, efficient, and dynamic approach to marketing the state’s attractions, bolstering Mississippi’s status as a tourist destination. The bill also introduces a new Tourism Advertising Fund, directly benefiting local businesses by channeling a portion of the revenue from restaurant and hotel sales taxes into the fund.

What Are the Expected Economic Impacts of These Bills?

The passage of SB 2018 and SB 2016 is expected to have a profound impact on Mississippi’s economy, particularly in tourism and military readiness. The state’s tourism industry, already a substantial contributor to the economy, is expected to benefit from increased agility and focused branding as a result of SB 2016. This bill aims to push tourism revenue beyond its current $18.1 billion threshold and expand the state’s reach to new markets through more effective marketing strategies.

SB 2018, on the other hand, is expected to improve military readiness by ensuring that Mississippi’s National Guard members are medically prepared to respond to emergencies and deploy when needed. With approximately 12,000 Guardsmen currently in service, the state anticipates that this initiative will boost retention rates and ensure that these individuals are able to meet physical and medical standards, a key component of maintaining an effective military force.

Additionally, both bills are projected to support more than 130,000 jobs in the tourism sector, with a special focus on stabilizing the hospitality industry. This includes maintaining jobs linked to hotels, restaurants, and tourism services, all of which have been critical drivers of the state’s economic growth.

How Will These Bills Be Implemented?

The implementation of SB 2018 will begin with the establishment of the Mississippi National Guard TRICARE Premium Reimbursement Program, which will be managed by the Adjutant General of the Mississippi National Guard. The program’s effectiveness will be evaluated in a report due to the legislature by December 1, 2026. This ensures that the program is meeting its goals of improving healthcare accessibility for Guardsmen and supporting retention.

For SB 2016, the new Mississippi Department of Tourism will officially take charge of the state’s tourism efforts by July 1, 2026. The separation from the Mississippi Development Authority (MDA) is intended to streamline processes, allowing for quicker decision-making and more focused marketing. As part of the reorganization, a new Tourism Marketing Advisory Board will be formed, composed of representatives from Mississippi’s five tourism regions: the Hills, Delta, Capital/River, Pines, and Coastal regions. This structure will allow for a more regionally tailored approach to tourism marketing.

In addition to these structural changes, SB 2019 ensures the continued investment in the state’s infrastructure, particularly through the allocation of $80 million in annual lottery proceeds to the State Highway Fund for bridge repairs and pavement projects.

What’s Next for These Bills?

Having passed the Senate, SB 2018, SB 2016, and SB 2019 now head to the House of Representatives for further consideration. Should these bills pass the House, they will be signed into law by the Governor, setting into motion a transformative period for Mississippi’s National Guard and tourism industry. With their focus on healthcare, economic growth, and infrastructure, these legislative changes have the potential to reshape the state’s future, making it more competitive in both the tourism market and national defense efforts.

Conclusion: A New Era for Mississippi’s Economy and National Guard

The passing of SB 2018 and SB 2016 represents a decisive step toward ensuring long-term security and prosperity for Mississippi. The National Guard’s healthcare coverage program addresses a critical need, while the tourism department reorganization is poised to give the state’s fourth-largest industry the tools to thrive. With the continued development of infrastructure through SB 2019, Mississippi is positioning itself for sustained economic growth and a more robust defense posture. As these bills move through the legislative process, their full impact will become clearer, but the early signs are promising for the future of Mississippi’s economy and military readiness.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/mississippi.jpg,N,0.0,2026-01-17 15:56:20.433753
